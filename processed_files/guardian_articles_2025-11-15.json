I mean, maybe not through the outback, but if you’re in any of the cities, walk. I do that wherever I go. And I love to just go off and explore without knowing where I’m going, without a map or any preconceived ideas. I think it’s the best way to discover a place, and it has the great virtue that if you turn a corner – say in Sydney – and there’s suddenly the Harbour Bridge, you feel as if you’ve discovered it. There’s a real feeling of exhilaration, I think, in that. But also, you discover little cafes and hidden corners and odds and ends.You just issued the revised edition of A Short History Of Nearly Everything; what was your favourite fact you learned in revisiting that book, two decades later?I think the one that most staggered me was that the number of moons in our solar system is roughly double now what it was when I first wrote the book – and I just thought, well, didn’t they notice these other moons? I mean, 100 new moons have been discovered. And the answer, apparently, is a lot of them are really quite small – they’re essentially just big rocks. But if a rock faithfully orbits a planet, then it qualifies as a moon. [That change] was in chapter one, and I went through the book in chronological order. So I just thought, Jesus Christ, I’m going to be making a lot of changes.Of all the historical figures you’ve researched for your books, who would you invite to a dinner party?It’s a very strange question when you think about it. I mean, obviously I would choose Shakespeare, and probably Isaac Newton. But the thing is, you wouldn’t be learning anything – you’d be spending the whole dinner explaining to them why they’re not dead any more! I mean, they would just be saying, “What the fuck? What’s going on?” and it wouldn’t be like a congenial dinner party with everybody drinking and relaxed. And then, you know, who’s going to tell them that when the dinner is over, they have to be dead again – that they have to go back to their graves? I don’t want to be associated with this exercise.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningYou’ve written 21 books – do you have any rituals around starting or finishing a book?It’s a funny thing – every single time I’ve ever written a book, it always feels as if I’ve never done this before. And even though it’s me every time, and I have only one voice, I seem to have to find that voice before I can get comfortable. So I really feel that the first page, or paragraph, is very, very important, and I cannot proceed onwards until I’ve got that. And once you’ve got the tone and the rhythm and the feel of things, then it all becomes much easier. [During the writing] the only ritual I’ve had is that when I was much more active, I’d have two cups of coffee and then I’d go sit at my desk and start working, no matter what. And rituals for finishing? No – just finish it and then drink a lot of red wine.You wrote a book about troublesome words and usage; what’s your number one pet peeve?Oh, I drive my grandchildren absolutely crazy because I will not let them say, you know, “me and Brian went to the store the other day” or “me and so-and-so”. They all do that, and I jump all over them every time. And I think they just think I’m being a fussy old man, but that is the verbal equivalent of having a tattoo on your head. I can’t abide it.What book, album or film do you always return to, and why?There are so many books in the world, and the amount of time to read them is so clearly finite, that I find it slightly a waste of time to go back and read something again. Same with movies. I did rewatch The Grand Budapest Hotel – not all the way through, but I went back and watched certain parts of it because I was just kind of enchanted with it and there were some scenes where I wanted to know, how did they film that?What’s the best piece of advice you have ever received?I don’t like being given advice. Something that always annoys me is when people say, “Do you mind if I give you a piece of advice?” My answer always is, “Yes, I do very much mind.” Some people who have read my books will tell me the things they didn’t like about the books as if I’ll really appreciate that and it’ll help me become a better writer the next time I do it. And again, no thanks.I suppose the closest to “best advice” I could think of offhand would be off a Bob Dylan album, which is “don’t look back”. I think looking back is not, by and large, a good policy, because there’s nothing you can do about it, and you will end up dwelling on things that you wish you hadn’t done or hadn’t happened, or mistakes you made. And you can’t run the clock back and do it all over again, so just let it go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not just Trump – in fact, Trump almost least of all. It’s all the enablers – I can’t bear it that all of these people are allowing him and encouraging him. And it’s not just that they’re doing things that I don’t agree with politically, it’s that there’s so much malice and vindictiveness attached to all of it. I find that the most upsetting thing. And it’s my country, it’s where I come from. I haven’t lived there for a long time, but I remember a much nicer America than the one we’re looking at.What are you secretly really good at?I am the world’s best raker. I rake fantastically, and I love to rake. I don’t know why but I find it very, very satisfying. We have a big garden with a lot of trees. And the thing I love about raking is it is totally mindless, so I can listen to podcasts or audio books. And it’s actually pretty good exercise. You’re out in the fresh air.Paul Kelly: ‘Imagine by John Lennon is probably one of the worst songs ever written. I can’t stand it’Read moreI have this two-rake method: with one rake I scoop a whole bunch of leaves on to another, and then transfer them into a wheelbarrow. Most people have leaf blowers, which I find obnoxious. And it’s so satisfying when you’ve done a big bit of lawn to stand back and look at it, all tidy and clean and free of leaves. This, of course, is a big issue at this time of year in England.What habit are you trying to kick?I’m almost embarrassed to tell you this, but ever since I was a little boy, I have genuinely pretended to be able to vaporise people that I don’t like – like with X-ray vision – and I still do that. And it’s not a worthy way of going through life. But if I hold the door open for somebody, and they go through and they don’t say “thank you”, I look at them and I imagine them just sort of disintegrating. And I can’t say that I actuallywishthey would disintegrate, but it’s pretty close. And I just think: that’s not good, Bill. I mean, you really shouldn’t be doing this at 73 years old. So I’ve been trying to be more generous to my fellow humans. Not always very successfully.A Short History of Nearly Everything 2.0 by Bill Brysonis out now through Penguin.

Put your brain aside, and enjoyLucy ManganSat 15 Nov 2025 16.55 ESTShareThat its ultra-wealthy characters live in a place called Richford Lake tells you almost everything you need to know about the glossy new thriller Wild Cherry. Yes, it’s another entry in the increasingly popular eat-the-rich genre. Yes, it has shades ofThe White Lotusand everything starring Nicole Kidman for the past five years. Yes, most of the budget has gone to wardrobe, with any woman over the age of 30 apparently allergic to synthetic fibres and every actor seemingly cast primarily for her ability to carry off swagged silk and cashmere in warm beige tones. Yes, you should have bought shares in the colour camel years ago but it’s too late now. Yes, the insular community and soapy vibe suggests an ancestry that includes Desperate Housewives and Gossip Girl. Yes, in short, it’s trash with pretensions. But trash with pretensions is as fun a way to spend the long winter evenings as any, so why not set your brain aside and enjoy it?We begin with the obligatory the-future-as-prelude scene, which here involves four women – two older, two younger – standing in a well-appointed bathroom in their underwear scrubbing blood off their hands. We then flashback to begin the six-part journey to finding out what the jolly heck is going on.The four women are a brace of mothers and their daughters. One mother is Juliet. She is played by Eve Best with unfitting reserve in the kind of production that needs a wholehearted “to hell with Ibsen!” attitude from all to make it work. Juliet is described by the arch-with-as-yet-nothing-to-be-arch-about voiceover as “old money”, and therefore deeply concerned with reputation and appearance, even though in real life these are very much the province of new money, which has no breeding to back it up. Even – no, especially – in a soap, getting this kind of thing right matters.Anyway, Juliet is also a supermum and top cashmere-er, so she is in the middle of launching her first book, on how to be the perfect parent and raise teens “who can be your best friends”. It is a lead title for Hubris Books, an imprint of Come On Now Publishing. As she finishes a publicity interview and is getting the glad-eye from the young sound man, she is called to her daughter’s (posh, private, all-girls) school to be told that the 15-year-old Allegra (Amelia May) and her best friend, Grace (Imogen Faires), were spotted in a now-deleted “lewd video” shown by a fellow pupil to a teacher. Grace’s mother, Lorna (Carmen Ejogo), Juliet’s best friend despite being a self-made businesswoman instead of a lord’s offspring, has been called into the meeting, too. She is shocked, but while she is reeling Juliet goes on the attack, warning the headteacher not to “sex shame” teenage girls and reminding him of the sizeable donations her family has made to his little educational establishment over the years. The problem goes away.Or does it? It turns out that, unbeknown to their parents, Grace and the embryonic influencer Allegra have been adding a touch of Mean Girls and Heathers to the ancestral mix. They have built an app that centres on “the catalogue”, eventually revealed to be an array of titillating shots taken of and by themselves and their friends (male and female, but mostly female), upon which paid subscribers to the app can vote. The desire to make it to the top of the hotness league will result, I am sure, in a variety of very sensible decisions by all.Meanwhile, the adult world is not overrun with good ideas either. Juliet goes off and bangs the sound man, allowing Allegra and Grace (on a sleepover) to sneak out to a party held at the house of an older, male content creator with whom Allegra imagines a burgeoning business relationship. A newcomer to the neighbourhood, Gigi (Nicôle Lecky, who is also Wild Cherry’s show runner), is trying to befriend all the horrible women there – who dismiss her either as a gold digger (she is the second wife of a recently divorced rich prick) or vulgar entrepreneur – and ends up standing in the middle of her indoor pool in despair.Clearly, nothing is going to end well, but it hardly matters. There are signs along the way that Wild Cherry wants to be working out big questions – it gestures at the intersection between race and class prejudice, and it aims to criticise the privilege money buys while it salivates over its material trappings – but it would have done better either to commit to that or to developing a proper rich froth that would put it firmly into the escapist nonsense category. As it is, it remains just fun enough for the run.Wild Cherry aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

And I was’: Cherrie-Ann Austin-Saddington.Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianLife and styleShe was a prison officer. He was a convicted rapist. How did she fall for him?Cherrie-Ann Austin-Saddington was working in a men’s prison when she began a relationship with an inmate that would turn her, too, into a criminal. How do some of the most dangerous men in Britain get what they want – even behind bars?Jenny KleemanSat 15 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareThere was a moment in the summer of 2022 when 26-year-old Cherrie-Ann Austin-Saddington, a female prison officer in a men’s jail, had to make a choice. She was on her wing at HMP The Verne in Dorset, in the day room where inmates go to read books and newspapers, when a prisoner called Bradley Trengrove handed her a magazine. Concealed within its pages was a slip of paper with a number written on it – the number of his secret, illicit mobile phone. Under the watchful eye of the prison’s security cameras, Austin-Saddington had to decide what to do next.“I was thinking, do I report it?Do Inotreport it?” she says. “I wasn’t thinking, I’ll text him–that wasn’t in my head.”But she did not throw the piece of paper away. She kept it, and in the end decided not to report anything.It was the first in a series of catastrophic choices that would lead Austin-Saddington to a sexual relationship with Trengrove, and transform her from a prison officer into a convicted criminal, in line for a custodial sentence of her own. It’s a decision she says she will regret for the rest of her life. The story of how she came to make it reveals much about Austin-Saddington. But it tells us even more about the state of our prison system, the worrying flaws in how staff are recruited and managed, and how failures in its duty of care to prisoners and staff are undermining the course of justice.Austin-Saddington is one of dozens of prison officers in recent years to enter into sexual relationships with the inmates they were supposed to be guarding. In response to a freedom of information request, the Ministry of Justice told me 64 prison staff have been recommended for dismissal because of inappropriate relationships with prisoners between 31 March 2019 and 1 April 2024. This is likely to be a fraction of the true number. It does not include those who resigned before they could be sacked, those who were not members of staff (such as employees of the NHS and other organisations who work in prisons) and, of course, those who were never caught. This phenomenon goes far beyond the bad judgment of a few individuals – it shows there is a systemic problem within the Prison Service.Overwhelmingly, it’s female former prison officers who have had relationships with male prisoners who are facing criminal charges. In May, Austin-Saddington became one of at least 10 women in the past year alone to be convicted of misconduct in public office for this reason. Linda de Sousa Abreu was sentenced to 15 months in prison in January, after a clip of her having sex with an inmate at HMP Wandsworth went viral. Morgan Farr Varney wassentencedto 10 months in May after she was captured on CCTV going into a cupboard with a prisoner at HMP Lindholme.Toni ColeandAimee Dukeworked at HMP Five Wells in Northamptonshire at the same time; they were both sentenced to 12 months earlier this year following their relationships with two different prisoners. Katie Evans was barely 21 when she began her affair with an inmate; shereceiveda 21-month sentence in March. Kerri Pegg, former governor of HMP Kirkham, wassentencedto nine years in May following her relationship with a notorious drug trafficker.They pick the target, then they try to get close. They ask you to do little things that then build up to bigger thingsIn this crowded field, Austin-Saddington’s story stands out. She knew Trengrove was a convicted sex offender when she embarked on her affair with him. She was arrested in May 2023 after she was caught trying to smuggle a Calpol syringe to him, which he wanted her to use to inseminate herself with his sperm. And in February 2024 – nine months after their relationship ended and more than a year before her case came to court – she suffered a spinal stroke that left her paralysed from the chest down. That was the reason why the judge chose to suspend her two-year sentence.“I know I didn’t get prison time, but I am locked inside my body for the rest of my life,” Austin-Saddington, now 29, tells me from her wheelchair at her home in Weymouth.Misconduct in public office is a serious offence – one to which Austin-Saddington pleaded guilty. She is a convicted criminal, and the story she tells me over the three hours I spend with her should be understood in that context. But it is about much more than sex. It reveals how some of the most dangerous men in the country are able to get what they want, even behind bars, by gaining control over the staff who hold the keys to their cells.“Working in the job, you hear all these stories about people having relationships with prisoners. You think, that’sawful. God, how can they do that? I never thought I’d be that person. And I was.” Her eyes brim with tears. “I feel like a massive fuck-up. I can’t hide away from it – it happened. How did I let that happen to me?”Prisons had always intrigued Austin-Saddington. She knew someone who was in and out of jail while she was growing up. She was too young to visit him, but he would write to her, describing the harsh treatment he received at the hands of prison staff. “I was curious to see what it was like inside,” she says. “I wanted to help. I wanted to go in and make a difference.”Austin-Saddington’s childhood ended early. She gave birth to a daughter and became a single mother at 16; she missed out on a lot of secondary school, she says. There was a year of college, followed by four years of working in social care, helping people in their homes. “I really enjoyed it,” she nods. “I like to make other people happy. Even though it was such hard work, it was rewarding just to know at the end of the day that you’d helped somebody.” But she quit in 2018, when she became pregnant with twins with a new partner at 22; she was too unwell during the pregnancy to continue caring for other people. “I had a long gap to think about what I wanted to do with my life.” That’s when she saw the online ad for the prison officer’s job. “At the time of applying, I was very confident. I wanted to find a career for myself, to better myself for my family.”View image in fullscreen‘Now I’ve had time to reflect, I do think he took advantage of me. He knew what he was doing.’Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianShe had to attend an in-person assessment day, where her maths, English and physical fitness were tested, and there was role play. “There were three rooms and inside each was a different actor, playing a prisoner with a situation that needed solving. Two got up and were quite aggressive. You had to calm the situation down.” There were online personality tests and assessments of how quickly she could count the number of people in a picture. The process seemed designed to identify candidates who could take an accurate headcount and de-escalate aggressive situations.The job offer came within a few weeks: Austin-Saddington was going to be paid around £1,800 a month to work long, irregular hours, including nights and weekends, beginning in July 2019, when she was 23. She was never officially informed that she was going to be working in a prison for sex offenders; she only found out from friends who recognised the name when she told them about her new job.The Verne, a Category C men’s jail five miles south of Weymouth, is not a typical prison. A third ofinmates are over 60; Gary Glitter served part of his sentence here. “It was a completely different experience to what I was expecting,” Austin-Saddington says. “It wasn’t a violent prison. The staff didn’t have anything to do. There was lots of gossiping, lots of politics among them.” Her idealism quickly evaporated. She realised many of her fellow prison officers had favourites – and inmates they didn’t like. When she tried to do her job – finding out information for a prisoner, for example – she found herself being redirected from person to person. “It was like banging your head against a brick wall.”My life as a prison officer: ‘It wasn’t just the smell that hit you. It was the noise’Read moreTwo weeks into her job – and more than two years before she was to meet Trengrove – Austin-Saddington discovered that a prisoner on her wing with a history of poor mental health and self-harm had been hurting himself. “He’d been punching the door, and his hand was quite infected.” She says the more experienced staff working with her made it clear that they didn’t like him; they told her to ignore him. She went above their heads and spoke to the custodial manager, and the inmate was put on a care plan. After that, he began to gravitate towards her. It seemed innocent enough to Austin-Saddington: he wanted to thank her for her help, or tell her if he’d been having a bad day. They’d talk in an office on her wing. It wasn’t unusual for her colleagues to talk to prisoners in the offices, she says, but most of her fellow prison officers were male. Within days, she was called in to see the security governor – responsible for ensuring a safe environment for staff and prisoners – and told a colleague had claimed an inappropriate relationship was forming between Austin-Saddington and the inmate. She was moved to another wing, and her probation period was extended.Austin-Saddington was sanctioned, but says she wasn’t given any feedback or advice about what kinds of interactions were inappropriate. There had been on-the-job training when she arrived at The Verne, with more role play involving high-conflict, high-pressure situations, but the prisoners she was guarding were not aggressive. “You get a false sense of security at The Verne, because they are very respectful. You forget they are also very dangerous and very manipulative people.”During the early weeks of training, Austin-Saddington was warned that she would be committing a crime if she had an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner. She was told about how these relationships can begin, with prisoners testing boundaries. “They pick the target, then they try to get close. They ask you to do little things that then build up to bigger things,” she remembers being told. But at the time it felt like just another set of facts to absorb, along with the meanings of the different radio call signs. “You don’t ever think you’re going to be in that situation. I didn’t think a prisoner would ever be able to manipulate me.”When Bradley Trengrove was transferred to The Verne in January 2022, Austin-Saddington’s life was in disarray. She was homeless, sharing a single room in a B&B with her three young children. She’d recently escaped from a relationship she says was abusive; she had used her holiday allocation to get her jaw repaired after she’d been thrown to the ground in the street. The council placed her in temporary accommodation next to a drug rehabilitation centre, and when she left for work dressed in her uniform, she would be spat at. It was an effort simply to get through each day.Trengrove had already been at The Verne for months before she even noticed him. She was doing patrols at a workshop where inmates learn bricklaying, checking the headcount. As she walked out of the workshop, he shouted after her; he wanted to borrow a copy of Farmers Weekly and he’d been told that she could get it for him. There was nothing unusual about that kind of request, she says – inmates often sought her out when they wanted things. She found the magazine on her wing and left it in Trengrove’s post slot.View image in fullscreenBradley Trengrove, the convicted rapist with whom Austin-Saddington became involved.Photograph: ROCUThen she began to see him everywhere. Whenever she’d set off to do the post run, or help with searches, he would appear. “I’d come out the door and he’d stand in the pathway as I’m walking past. He’d be like, ‘All right, Miss? Thanks for the magazine. Everything all right?’ It started like that.”He was popular with the other prison officers. “He’d come to the office door and start making jokes.” Sometimes, he’d talk about the other prisoners. “He’d say, ‘Oh, they’re all wrong ’uns in here.’” He knew how to get people to like him, she says, how to make people look at him differently.Three or four weeks after he borrowed the magazine, he returned it to Austin-Saddington in person, with his phone number hidden inside it. He also asked her to kiss him. She told him to get away from her, and he did: he left her in the reading room, deciding what to do next. “I was shaken. I didn’t know who to trust.” Her mind went back to getting in trouble during her first weeks at The Verne. “If I report it, I thought, are people going to accuse me of something else going on?”She decided to just try to keep her distance from Trengrove. “Then I thought, it’s no biggie. He hasn’t attempted anything since then. Maybe it was some sort of joke. Maybe he didn’t mean it. Maybe somebody’s trying to set me up.”For a month, nothing much happened. One of Trengrove’s friends started messaging Austin-Saddington on Facebook, begging her to text Trengrove’s number. Trying to avoid him was futile. “Every time I stepped out, he was there.” And then Trengrove shared some gossip he’d been told about her: Austin-Saddington had had a brief relationship with one of the other prison officers, and Trengrove knew all about it. “He said the officer was telling him about what positions he’d put me in, being really derogatory.”She was devastated. “That’s a really private thing. It was outside of work, and it wasn’t really anything. It was so inappropriate for [the officer] to be telling prisoners about it. He must have said something, otherwise how would Bradley know? Obviously, I can’t trust staff. I just felt so isolated.” Trengrove told her the officer was an arsehole, and she should forget about it. “I was angry and upset, and Bradley comforted me.  It was after that that we started texting each other.”It was one or two texts a day, at first, she says; they would bitch together about the officer who had broken her trust. “Then it turned into talking about how my day was. He’d message me and say, ‘I saw you at work earlier. You looked nice.’” Trengrove got his mother, brother and grandmother to contact her. “It was like I’d gained a family of support,” she says. “And then, a couple of months in, he said, ‘I think I’m falling in love with you.’”Of course, Austin-Saddington knew Trengrove was a convicted sex offender. But people served time at The Verne for a range of offences, she points out. “Sometimes it’s really huge crimes. Sometimes it’s – I don’t want to say minor, because I don’t want to diminish the importance of it – but they weren’t as severe,” she says, carefully. The computer system she had access to showed only the length of an inmate’s sentence and the main offence they were serving time for. She knew Trengrove had been found guilty of rape. But he told her it was because he’d had a relationship when he was 15 with a girl who was six months younger than him; he had cheated on her and, when he turned 16, she’d reported him. “He was saying, ‘She stitched me up.’”A lot of people would say I was crazy in love with him. I’d say he was my only bit of support and I clung on to itIt’s a shame Austin-Saddington didn’t Google Trengrove. I found anarticlepublished in 2015 that details how he was described as “exceptionally dangerous” when he was sentenced to 13 years in 2015 for “repeatedly raping a teenage girl” and having sexual activity with a child. The article reveals that twenty other women came forward alleging he had assaulted them following his conviction.“After all this happened, the police showed me his convictions. I just couldn’t believe it. I felt sick,” Austin-Saddington continues. “At the time, his explanation sounded absolutely plausible. I just took every word as gospel rather than thinking, hang on a minute, Cherrie, these are the moves – this is how it starts. At the time, all I could think was, I’ve got somebody here that’s giving me the attention and support I need right now.”He told her he was going to be out in three months – another lie. When I ask why she didn’t check his conditional release date, she winces. “I don’t know why. I was blinded.” A few weeks after he told her he loved her, their relationship became physical.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Trengrove had been given a job as a general handyman, which came with privileges: he had the freedom to walk around the workshop area without anyone questioning why he was there. “He’d nod at me if it was quiet down there. We’d find somewhere where there was no one around.” There were cameras, “but they don’t cover everything. Sometimes they don’t work. It’s quite an old prison.”Trengrove would later claim they had sex 30 to 40 times. A wild exaggeration, Austin-Saddington says.“I think it was maybe four or five times in total. We were together for a number of hours each time – two and a half maybe – and we’d sit and talk, get physical, then carry on talking again.” The logistics of finding an opportunity without anyone getting suspicious meant it couldn’t happen very often, she insists.When I ask if it felt exciting, Austin-Saddington winces again. “Yeah, I think so. But at the same time it made me feel sick. It was nerve-racking.” It must have been flattering to have all this attention, I say. “I think so,” she replies again. “I’ve had a lot happen to me in younger life that’s skewed my way of thinking. I’ve been sexually assaulted on quite a few occasions. I feel like I have to give my person everything because I’m not enough.” Most of the time, the sex was “quite aggressive”. At one point, Trengrove removed her contraceptive IUD from inside her. “I just said yes to everything.”After a couple of months, Trengrove’s phone broke. “He turned suicidal. He said that if he wasn’t able to speak with me, he was going to start kicking off, smashing things up, he was going to do something to hurt himself.” Austin-Saddington would have felt responsible if he’d harmed himself, or anyone else, she tells me. So she smuggled a phone in for him.During her trial, it emerged she had stored his number in her phone as “Husband to Be”. She looks mortified when I bring this up. “It’sridiculous.” But it made sense, at the time. She had begun meeting up with his family; she’d become close with his mum. He told her he had bought a plot of land and some building materials. He had printed off pictures of the kind of place he was going to build for them to live in with her kids. “He was presenting me with a future. He gave me hope.”View image in fullscreenA picture from Austin-Saddington’s social media. She was a title-winning amateur boxer – something Trengrove said she had to stop when he wanted her to get pregnantThe third time they had sex, Austin-Saddington says, she became pregnant. She took the positive test in to show Trengrove. “Part of me was happy, but at the same I time I didn’t know what to do with myself.” He was delighted. His mother told Austin-Saddington she was officially part of the family. But a couple of weeks later, she lost the baby. The miscarriage was hard enough, but she also had to deal with Trengrove’s frustration. “Bradley was fixated on having a child,” she says. He told her he couldn’t wait until he was released – he wanted a baby now; she should be making more time to come and see him. Austin-Saddington had been a keen amateur boxer, winning regional titles. Trengrove told her that had to stop. “He said, ‘You need to stop boxing. You can’t try to have a baby and box at the same time.’”Trengrove became increasingly controlling. “I was in the wrong for everything. I needed to be punished for everything.” If she missed a call from him, he would cross-examine her. “He’d have to be on the phone to me from the minute I walked out of the prison gates and got in my car until I’d fallen asleep. Sometimes I would have to wait until heallowedme to go to bed.” She felt like she had to obey him; he could hurt himself or other people if she angered him, he could report her and ruin her life. Even though he was behind bars, he seemed to have all the power.I ask if she thought about quitting. “Lots of times,” she nods.“He convinced me that if I quit, he wouldn’t be able to cope. Then there was the income for the kids – and the fact that I’d just moved into a new flat and taken on a tenancy. I felt trapped.”In March 2023, seven months into their relationship, Trengrove’s cell was searched and his phone was found. He hadn’t bothered with a nickname for Austin-Saddington; all her messages discussing their physical relationship in explicit detail where there for all to see, under her full name. He was immediately moved to HMP Channings Wood, a two-hour drive away. Austin-Saddington heard about the transfer from Trengrove’s mother and handed in her resignation the same day. When she went into The Verne to return her key chains and uniform, several senior managers approached her at the gate. Wait for further contact, they said, someone would soon be in touch.It was the end of her career in the Prison Service, but her relationship with Trengrove continued. Using his mother as a go-between, he begged Austin-Saddington to go and see him in his new prison. Channings Wood would never have allowed her name on the list of visitors or approved people to call from the prison phone, so Trengrove told her she had to change her name by deed poll, which she did. Such was the extent of the control he was able to exert over her, even from his cell.The first time she drove from Weymouth to Channings Wood – with Trengrove on speakerphone all the way – her car broke down. She suddenly had a moment of clarity. “I thought, what am I doing? Why am I doing this?” But five minutes later she was waving a car down so she could hitchhike the rest of the way to the prison. Trengrove seemed delighted to see her. “But he would slip in little digs about my appearance. Tiny things. ‘I’d prefer your hair to be a different colour’ or, ‘You should wear makeup – you don’t look right without it.’” Austin-Saddington was now making her living teaching boxing and was in the shape of her life, but he made comments about her belly. “‘Look at you – you’re getting fat.’” Still, she went back, even bringing his grandmother to see him once. “A lot of people would say I was crazy in love with him. I’d say that he was the only bit of support in my life and I clung on to it.”Before her fourth visit, in May 2023, Trengrove told her to bring the Calpol syringe with her. “He wanted me to inseminate myself. I said, ‘I’ll do whatever you say.’ I didn’t actually plan to use it.” When she arrived at Channings Wood, something didn’t feel right. Each visitor was being carefully searched by a senior officer; when Austin-Saddington arrived at the front of the queue, she was immediately taken into a side room, where five officers were waiting – both prison staff and police. They asked whether she had anything on her. She told them about the syringe hidden in her bra. She was then told she was under arrest, on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.View image in fullscreen‘People I’ve known for years were sharing the story, calling me a vile human being.’Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianThis still wasn’t enough to end their relationship. It continued for another two weeks, with Austin-Saddington ever more dependent on Trengrove’s family for support and now receiving legal advice from his solicitor. But once the police visited her at home and showed her Trengrove’s rap sheet, she knew it had to end. She told his mother to tell Trengrove she no longer wanted anything to do with him.“He was still finding ways to contact me through his friends, friends’ girlfriends, through random people’s numbers,” she says. She got a message from his mother saying he had tried to kill himself. Then, in early 2024, she received a bloodstained letter. “It was 10 pages of him saying he can’t live without me, that I can’t leave him, that he will find me.”Austin-Saddington shared every message with the police, her new solicitor and social services. She was keen to demonstrate that she was now doing the right thing: someone had reported her to social services shortly after she was arrested; she says she has not seen her twins, now six, since that day in 2023.Two months after her arrest, Austin-Saddington began a new relationship with the tattoo artist she’d hired to ink a sleeve down her right arm, a man called Jonny. They married in November 2024, eight months after her stroke. Jonny is now her carer. He has been keeping their puppy quiet in the bedroom next door while she tells me her story.Spinal strokes – where blood flow to the spinal cord is interrupted – are rare, particularly for young, healthy people. The reason for Austin-Saddington’s stroke is still a mystery. She has no memory of it happening. Jonny came around to her flat late one Saturday evening and found her on the floor, unable to move. She was in a coma for nine days. She can now wiggle the toes on her right foot, but her doctors have told her not to expect much more improvement.Austin-Saddington was relieved to have her prison sentence suspended. But the news reporting around her trial means she is living with a sentence of another kind, one she did not anticipate. “My eldest daughter saw it all, which was really difficult. It was very hard for her at school, and that made me feel awful.” She breaks down again. “People I’m friends with – people I’ve known for years – were sharing the story around, saying, ‘What a vile human being.’ Me and Jonny were getting messages all the time. I felt like I just wanted to get in my bed for the rest of my life and never leave it.”The female former prisoner officers convicted over the last 12 months were recruited to work in a service stretched to the limit, at a time when low wages were the norm. It was their responsibility to maintain physical and emotional boundaries between themselves and the prisoners they guarded, but they were unable to do so. They were either the wrong people for the job, or inappropriately managed, or both. There have been so many cases like Austin-Saddington’s over recent months that British psychologists have begun to study sexual boundary violation in the prison and probation services as a specific phenomenon.In arecent articleon the subject, the psychologists Tanya Garrett and Rosie Gray wrote, “We have seen concerning cases of young female staff who become emotionally/sexually involved with male prisoners, often convicted for serious offences, who appear to have inverted the power relationship, then used this power for their own gain.”“People don’t understand the job,” Austin-Saddington says simply. “They are desperate for work so they’ll take anything. Prisons are so short of staff that I don’t think enough attention is paid to the staff they’ve got.” For short periods, Austin-Saddington was drafted in to provide emergency support to cover staff shortages at HMP Portland and HMP Bristol, where she said female officers were even more exposed than at The Verne; twice, when she was at Portland, she says two different inmates tried to grab her and pull her into their cells. “In situations like that, you need to feel you’ve got your team to back you up. And when you’ve got problems at home, you need to have time off, because it’s very easy for things to go wrong if you’re not in the right frame of mind. Not just relationships, but other things, too – doors being left unlocked.”‘But he didn’t hit you, did he?’: inside the coercive control courtroomRead morePart of Austin-Saddington’s sentence required her to undergo 25 days of rehabilitation; she has been spending them having therapy with the Sexual Trauma and Recovery Service, and working with the domestic abuse organisationRefuge. Her contact there has suggested Austin-Saddington becomes a mediator, helping other victims of domestic abuse. Her face brightens when she tells me this. “I’m really excited about that because it gives me something to give back. I do feel like I still need to give back.”The relationship with Trengrove has left Austin-Saddington racked with shame and guilt. It happened at a time when she was young, naive and desperately in need of support. Her story follows a pattern that will be familiar to anyone who has studied thewarning signs of coercive control. But she still blames herself for allowing it to happen.It is unusual for prisoners to be prosecuted for encouraging misconduct in public office. But after reading Trengrove’s messages to Austin-Saddington, the Crown Prosecution Service determined that he, too, should go on trial. Trengrove was also found guilty and received another two years and three months to serve on top of his 13-year sentence. In his ruling, the judge said, “This was a relationship of equal halves, both making the wrong decision.”“I agree and I disagree,” Austin-Saddington says when I put this to her. “I am equally guilty. But now I’ve had time to reflect – being in a wheelchair, I’m sitting around a lot – I do think I was very vulnerable. Hedidtake advantage of me. He knew what he was doing.”I ask if she thinks he groomed her. She lowers her eyes, as if considering what to do with this opportunity to absolve herself a little. “Yes,” she eventually replies, “there was a lot of pursuing there. But equally, I did wrong. It’s all well and good saying that he groomed me, but I also take responsibility.”When Austin-Saddington heard that Trengrove’s sentence had been extended, she felt guilty at first. “I thought it wasn’t fair – he’s getting a longer sentence, and I’ve had mine suspended, that’s not equal,” she says. “But then later on, when I thought about it, I was glad. I know what kind of man he is. He’s an extremely dangerous man.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePrisons and probationRelationshipsCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why has Swift, who once wanted ‘to be on the right side of history’, said nothing?Sat 15 Nov 2025 06.41 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 07.33 ESTShareIn the last two weeks, the Trump administration has used music from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in three posts on social media. Thefirst, shared by the official White House account on TikTok, was a patriotic slide show of images set to lead single The Fate of Ophelia. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, the video cuts to pictures of the US flag, President Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and the first and second ladies. The second and third were posted by Team Trump, the official account for the Trump Campaign.One, set to Father Figure, riffs on the lyric “this empire belongs to me” with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”, while theother, celebrating Melania Trump winning something called the Patriot of the year award, is soundtracked by Opalite.The Trump administration has found itself in dicey waters for using popular music in the past.The White Stripesand the estate ofIsaac Hayeshave both attempted to sue the administration for using their music without permission, while artists including Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have released statements demanding Trump stop using their songs at campaign rallies and public appearances. Most recently,Olivia Rodrigo condemnedthe administration after the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram account used her song All-American Bitch on a video promoting its controversial deportation efforts (the song was later removed by Instagram).Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueSwift, however, has said nothing in public. The silence is surprising from an artist known to be litigious over unsanctioned use of her music or likeness: she has previouslysued a theme parkfor playing her music without a licence,come for Etsy sellersfor using lyrics from her songs in unofficial merch,taken on YouTubecreators over copyright infringement anddemanded retroactive songwriting creditsfrom newer artists (including Rodrigo). (Her representatives did not respond to a request for comment.)That Swift and her team haven’t issued a statement distancing her from a president mired in scandal and an administration criticised for censorship, violent immigration raids and far-right policies, is curious. Once politically shy, she appeared to fullyembrace and advocate for progressive values in 2018, so much so that her decision to speak out about politics became the narrative tent pole of her documentary Miss Americana. She has subsequently endorsed Democratic political candidates, supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 American presidential election, and criticised the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade. “I need to be on the right side of history,” she said in Miss Americana, apparently defying the advice of team members including her own father.It is now unclear whether that statement still stands. If it does, Swift seems less interested in telling us so: she hasn’t denounced ICE raids or commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict.It’s a non-position that chimes with those of other once vocally liberal celebrities who have now clammed up about politics. Jennifer Lawrencerecently saidshe would no longer publicly discuss the president as it would just “add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart”. Instead, “a lot of the movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape”, she said, “and that’s how I feel like I can be helpful”. Other stars who endorsed Harris alongside Swift in 2024, including Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry, have similarly remained schtum. Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney has refused to engage with the fraught political discourse,even after being revealed as a registered Republican.Like Lawrence, Swift may believe that publicly opposing the Trump administration would further fracture an already crumbling nation. She may be quietly supporting those whose lives have been affected by the government’s attacks on immigrants and minorities. And there is risk in speaking out: after Swift endorsed Harris, Trump said he “hates” Swift, and asthe Jimmy Kimmel fracasdemonstrated, the government isn’t afraid to use its heft to silence critics.Fear of retribution hasn’t muffled other stars, though: both Rodrigo and Billie Eilish have made their feelings about the Trump administration clear, as have artists including Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Madonna and Bruce Springsteen.Of course, Swift has more to lose than most. Despite critical brickbats for The Life of a Showgirl, she has never been more popular, at least commercially. Aforthcoming Disney-produced docuseriesgoing behind the scenes of the Eras tour is hotly anticipated. And there are her upcoming nuptials to Travis Kelce. Their relationship has turned them into jingoistic emblems for red-blooded (and red-hatted) Americans: the late conservator commentator Charlie Kirkvociferously approved, while other Maga voices suggested their union would encourage Americans to procreate. It has helped reshape Swift’s image so much that even Trump softened on her: “I think that she’s a terrific person,” he said while congratulating the couple on their engagement.View image in fullscreenRed-blooded Americans … Swift with her fiance, Travis Kelce, of the Kansas City Chiefs.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesThe president may also see some of himself in Swift, a staunch businesswoman who releases multiple editions of her albums to generate extra revenue and secure high chart positions – seemingly timed to prevent other artists from reaching No 1. It’s telling that Swift’s attention right now appears to be on blocking Spanish star Rosalía from scoring a No 1 album withLux, by releasing a new streaming-exclusive variant of The Life of a Showgirl. If that is the case, this money-grubbing, competition-destroying approach to pop stardom is paralleled in Trump’s profit-driven mindset, and her self-interest even perhaps has a parallel with his protectionist economic policy.Jennifer Lawrence says speaking about Trump would ‘add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart’Read moreSwift, as with corporations such as Disney, Meta, Paramount and Walmart, might see kissing the ring as economically advantageous. There is even a whiff of conservatism to the material on Showgirl that feels in step with Trump 2.0: Cancelled! defends those who have faced public backlash, while on Wi$h Li$t she fantasises about a white picket fence lifestyle, a basketball hoop and to “have a couple kids / Got the whole block looking like you.”It is difficult to forget the young woman of Miss Americana who so passionately rejected the advice of those around her in order to speak up for what she believed was right. Whatever you think about celebrities’ impact on politics, Swift’s platform is so monumental that any public opposition to the Trump administration would be valuable, be it through her art or her actions. It may further fuel what is already a fiery and divisive political climate, but her influence gives her the potential to galvanise thousands in rejecting increasingly regressive and terrifying social and political norms.But if Showgirl is indicative of Swift’s current preoccupations, she has never been more insular. Vengeful, self-absorbed and lacking imagination, it is the product of an artist who seems disconnected from the anxious state of the world. “I protect the family,” she sings on Father Figure. Once, you knew exactly what that meant. Now, it’s not so clear.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Never mind that both taxes deter people from buying and selling. It allows everyone to avoid the clearer, fairer annual tax on wealth that many economists support.Rachel Reeves looks like joining her predecessors when she stands up in the Commons on 26 November to deliver her second budget. This week it emerged thatplans to increase income tax have been abandoned. The betting is now that she will instead raise money from a series of stealth taxes, citing a review of the economic outlook as suggesting she can get away without breakingthe manifesto commitmentnot to raise one of the “big three” taxes.Less than two weeks ago, with her sums showing Britain deep in the red, the chancellor signalled she would begin talking to the nation openly about the difficulties of providing 21st-century public services with the income from a tax regime hollowed out by the Tories and distorted by endless tinkering.The prospect of grasping the political nettle was a reminder of Keir Starmer’s approach immediately before and after the general election to put “country first, party second”, as he said ina speech on his return from seeing the kingon 5 July.Country first appeared to be the guiding maxim as Reevesgave a speecharguing everyone should share the responsibility of rebuilding the state after years of austerity. Rather than skate around the subject, she strongly hinted that income tax would need to rise. There would also be a root-and-branch review of property taxes.It is unfair to single out the current Labour leadership for brazenly putting party firstEveryone knew income tax rises had been avoided since 1975 and an increase this year would also break a manifesto promise. Yet here we were, with No 10 and No 11 seemingly on the same page. Not only that, there was an expectation they would explain the need to not only raise tax fairly and transparently, but alsoto create a big enough financial bufferto stop any speculation – in the press and in financial markets – that she would need to do it all again next year.Labour backbench MPs – or enough of them – by contrast, signalled that breaking manifesto promises was a step too far. They would lose their seats. Labour would lose the next election.In many ways it is unfair to single out the current Labour leadership and those sitting on the backbenches for brazenly putting party first. If we rewind to the early 1990s we find Norman Lamont relying on stealth taxes – such as a freeze on income tax thresholds – to bring in the much-needed cash.He could rightly point to one element of his budget that demonstrated to the public very visibly how they needed to share the pain. He included an increase VAT on domestic fuel, to take effect a couple of years later. However, with echoes of today, his successor Kenneth Clarke was unable to implement the rise after a rebellion of Tory backbenchers.View image in fullscreenGeorge Osborne took a stealthy approach except when he increased VAT from 17.5% to 20%.Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPAGordon Brown, well known for implementing stealth taxes, provided an exceptional moment when he added 1p to national insurance, hypothecated on it being dedicated to health spending. Osborne took a stealthy approach except when he increased VAT from 17.5% to 20%.Osborne’s VAT rise is more akin to Reeves’s situation. Osborne was breaking a manifesto pledge, but had the excuse of a difficult global situation, high debts and needing to compromise with the Liberal Democrats.There was never any need for Osborne to introduce a succession of austerity budgets when borrowing costs were almost zero, but falling into line with the standard VAT rate across Europe was a reasonable and transparent way of raising much-needed cash.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Income tax thresholds will be frozen, disguising the increase in tax on workers. If there are changes to pension taxes, they will mostly likely add complexity to an already byzantine system.Why do voters deserve politicians who lack the will to make long-term decisions? Maybe that’s because MPs and many voters fail to understand what patriotism means. It is a belief that the UK is good place to live and needs some self-sacrifice from those who have done well to make it thrive.Instead we have an ageing electorate where too many want to actively rewind the clock to some mythical bygone age or just cash out, taking their pensions and property gains with them.There was hope that Starmer and Reeves would override these impulses to establish a more coherent, fairer tax system. That seems to have evaporated.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Viewpoint columnEconomicsIncome taxTaxRachel ReevesTax and spendingCapital gains taxcommentShareReuse this content"

The pace and scale of migration is placing immense pressure on communities.”However, the majority of asylum seekers currently receiving support are unlikely to be affected. Government sources said rules that mean most asylum seekers are not allowed to have jobs will not change.There are about 100,000 people in receipt of asylum support in the UK, the vast majority of whom are accommodated by the state. About a third remain in hotels, althoughLabourhas pledged to end this practice by 2029.About 8,500 people in asylum accommodation have the right to work because they entered the country on a visa and later claimed asylum.Those without visas whose claims remain outstanding after a year through no fault of their own are sometimes permitted to take on paid work, but only in a limited number of fields where there is deemed to be a significant shortage of suitable candidates.The UK wants to emulate Denmark’s hardline asylum model – but what does it actually look like?Read moreAlthough there are about 19,000 people who have been waiting for more than 12 months for an asylum decision, the Guardian understands most do not meet this criteria and not all of those eligible are in employment.The government did not specify how much it expected to save as a result of these measures but it added that asylum seekers who break rules could also be excluded from financial support, which could further reduce costs.A spokesperson said: “In a historic move, automatic handouts for those seeking refuge will end.“Introduced in 2005 under EU law, the legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support has meant guaranteed, unconditional financial assistance for anyone who claims asylum and would otherwise be destitute.“That is ending. Support will no longer be a given; it becomes a discretionary power.“This means theHome Officecan deny assistance to those who can work, have assets, fail to comply with removal directions, engage in criminality, disrupt accommodation settings, or work illegally.”However, sources indicated these were not “blanket” rules and cases would continue to be assessed on an individual basis, with mitigating factors taken into account.The changes are perceived as a pitch to Labour voters who are considering backing Reform at the next general election. The plans are thought to be unpopular with some of the party’s MPs, particularly those worried about losing support to the Greens and Liberal Democrats, although the government hasindicated a rebellion is unlikely to be tolerated.Government officials are also expected to launch a consultation on “additional requirements migrants could have to follow to receive and retain benefits” with those who “contribute and integrate” given priority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Danish overhaul is considered to have helped the party resist electoral challenges from the populist right.After excluding data from 2020, when major travel restrictions were in place because of the pandemic, the number of successful asylum claims processed in Denmark is at a 40-year low.Although those targeted by foreign regimes are normally given protection, the Danish government reserves the right to return refugees to their home countries when it is deemed safe.Denmark also tightly controls which refugees can bring family members to the country. Those who live in housing estates earmarked as “parallel societies”, where more than half of the people are from “non-western” backgrounds, are not eligible.The law also enables the state to demolish housing within these estates. Although the government says this is aimed at promoting integration, an EU official recently raised concerns about potential discrimination. The left of the British Labour party has been vocal in its criticisms of the Danish system.Reform’s lead in the polls has been fuelled in part by a rise in small boat crossings over the last five years, a trend that successive governments have struggled to reverse.The party has promised those who arrive in Britain via small boats would not be allowed to claim asylum if it took power.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabourHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Benn came close to sealing the knockout he craved in the last minute of the fight when he twice dropped Eubank Jr heavily.Conor Benn defeats Chris Eubank Jr in middleweight boxing rematch – live reactionRead moreA shuddering combination from Benn had an initially delayed reaction but the right hand that smashed into the side of Eubank Jr’s head finally sent him toppling to the canvas. He rose to his feet but was soon down again as Benn threw punch after punch at his wilting and shrunken frame. Eubank Jr staggered to his feet just before the referee completed his count. The fight would surely have been waved over – but the last bell echoed above the bedlam.The wait for the scorecards was a formality as Benn was declared the overwhelming winner by margins of 119-107, 116-110 and 118-108. He was exultant as beating Eubank Jr in crushing style followed a grim three years for a complicated and sometimes haunted man who tested positive twice for clomifene in 2022 and then lost a wild and testing battle against Eubank seven months ago. But he had stressed this week that he would be much more clinical and disciplined in the rematch.View image in fullscreenConor Benn lands another blow on Chris Eubank Jr at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesHe kept to his word but Eubank Jr, who usually campaigns at least two weight categories above Benn, looked worn out and debilitated by his draining battle with the scales and the fact that a prohibitive rehydration clause prevented him adding more than 10 pounds a day after the official weigh-in. It was, clearly, a fight too far for the 36-year-old.The atmosphere was typically raucous as Benn marched slowly from his dressing room to the sound of Ready or Not from the Fugees seguing into a mashup of the old Phil Collins song which his dad, Nigel, used for many of his ringwalks in the early 1990s. Father and son took the time to dance together and embrace before the live drummers kicked in and Benn Jr moved purposefully to the ring.A cascade of boos greeted Eubank Jr, looking resplendent in a white fur coat, his father walking close behind him clutching a bag in his hand as Dr Dre boomed around them. And then, suddenly, the rapper 50 Cent became an honorary Eubank, joining junior and senior on their ring walk as he barked out a sample trilogy of tracks. As they closed in on the brightly lit square circle, the expression on Eubank Jr’s face turned stony.Yet, once the fight began, Eubank Jr seemed strangely circumspect against the smaller but far more authoritative man. He looked listless and devoid of any belief. With a third of the bout completed Benn had done exactly what he and his corner had planned and cruised through the first four rounds. Control over drama appeared to be Benn’s mantra and it was no consequence to him that the crowd sounded a little bored as chatting rather than cheering became prevalent.A rangy left jab by Eubank in round five was a rare success for the older man but Benn soon matched him with the exact same punch. Benn, who had been so crude last time they fought, kept up his clinic as the punches flowed. Eubank Jr was down in the last minute of the sixth round but it was an obvious slip. He also swung wildly and missed just before the bell as Benn sealed a shut-out of the first half of a strangely one-sided fight.Confidence surged through Benn as he opened up in the seventh and bullied Eubank Jr against the ropes. A low hum filled the arena as tension drained from the contest. Eubank connected with a jolting jab but Benn’s huge right hand snapped back the head of his increasingly forlorn rival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was also boxing far better than he had ever done before. The crowd began swapping bored whistles from one side of the stadium to the other as a way of entertaining themselves in the absence of any meaningful fight from Eubank Jr.Before the penultimate round Nigel Benn flashed a huge grin and cheery thumbs up on the big screen. Even the brash old fighter could not have expected such a carefree romp. He was on his feet as his son nearly closed the show in the dramatic last round.Benn immediately shut down talk of a trilogy and a rubber match next year. He shouted out that the Benn-Eubank family saga was “over” and stressed that “it’s done”.Eubank Jr said: “It’s one-one. I’ve got to go away and deal with some of the things I’ve been dealing with over the last couple of months. Who knows whether we will see something new with me and him. Maybe we won’t. But right now, it’s all about this man. This is his night.”We can only hope that Eubank Jr will escape this dangerous business and find peace in a different life. Benn can return, then, to his more natural home at welterweight, where he can test himself against opposition far superior to his exhausted domestic rival. The rest of us can also move on, free at last from the hoopla of a manufactured rivalry which has run its course.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a question often put to highlight the cruelty of hunting, because the answer would seem to be no. Or so you would think.Yet increasing numbers of people are volunteering to be chased across the countryside by baying bloodhounds in what could soon be the only legal way to hunt with dogs in England and Wales, rather than pursuing animals or their scents.Under governmentplans to outlaw trail hunting, where dogs follow an animal-based scent, the planned tightening of the“unworkable” 2004 foxhunting banhas prompted growing interest in so-calledclean-boot hunting. This country pursuit has the rare distinction of being backed by both the League Against Cruel Sports and some former fox hunters.Matthew Weaver being chased by dogs and riders.It involves bloodhounds and horse riders pursuing not foxes but cross-country runners. Today, one of those runners is your nervous Guardian reporter, as I join the human quarry of theNew Forest Hounds(NFH).It is not a blood sport, I have been assured. Despite their ghoulish name, bloodhounds, unlike foxhounds, do not tear their quarry to pieces. “They’re very soft and friendly, you’ll see,” says Will Day, joint master of the hunt. The screensaver on his phone is a photo of Shogun, the pack’s champion chaser.Day takes me to a Victorian kennels built for foxhounds and still topped with a weathervane in the shape of a fox. It is now home to 40 bloodhounds, noisily excited by the arrival of a lorry that signals they will soon in pursuit.It also home to professional huntsman Danny Allen and his young family, one of NFH’s three full-time employees. “This is the future of hunting,” he says.Rider calls in the hounds with a horn.Later he will lead the hunt in a bright green jacket and call in the hounds with a horn. He also has the less glamorous task of retrieving dead livestock to feed to the hounds, in aknackerman businesswhich helps fund the hunt. “It’s a side of it that the public don’t see, but it takes up most of my time,” says Allen. In an outhouse lies the remains of a pony that the hounds have just polished off. This grisly sight does nothing to allay my pre-hunt paranoia about being eaten alive.Those nerves intensify when I’m asked to get inside the hunt lorry to allow the hounds to get a good whiff of my body odour. Before hunts runners are advised not to shower or use deodorant to ensure they are at their smelliest.I am warned to lean up against the side of the lorry to avoid being knocked over by the hounds, who can weigh up to 11 stones (70kg). When their cages are opened they come bounding towards me in a whirl of black and tan fur, lolling tongues, and drooling jowls. They all jostle to put their huge paws on my shoulders to sniff up close and personal.The other three runners: Day, Meghan Clarke, the hunt’s treasurer; and Rich Shirley, the quarry captain, are used to this, and know most of the hounds by name. To a novice it is a bracing initiation, but it does show the hounds are harmless, however boisterous.Meanwhile, hunters, horses and their followers are gathering for the start of the meet outside the Bold Forester’s pub. It has all the trappings of a traditional hunt: horsey types in jodhpurs, hunting horns, and copious amounts of port laid on by the pub. The only things missing are hunt saboteurs and a fox.After the 2004 ban, NFH switched from foxhunting to trail hunting – a pursuit of animal scents, typically fox urine. In 2020 Forestry England suspended trail hunting on its land which includes the New Forest. This prompted NFH to switch again. It is now one of 22 clean-boot hunts across the UK.A small minority of the hunt resigned in protest at this perceived wokery. Day would have preferred to carry on trail hunting, but now he is a zealous convert. He says: “Society moves on and you have to move with it. We were all very pleasantly surprised with how well it went and how fun it is.”NFH volunteers, who help with the logistical challenge of organising meets, includeveterans of the Countryside Alliance march against the hunting ban in 2002, but also former hunt saboteurs fervently opposed to hunting any animals – except human volunteers.Before the hunt sets off, volunteers are given a head start and begin running. To avoid confusing the hounds with other scents, Day takes us away from any paths. It means scrambling across thick bracken, heather and gorse.Nervous glances behind show no sign of the chasing pack. But soon we can hear the ominous sound of deep barking getting closer. It makes the heart pump even faster. This is cross-country running with added peril.Bloodhounds are used across the world for tracking missing people, suspected criminals and escaped convicts. On rough ground like this they can run three times as fast as a human and they don’t give up. They have been known to carry on chasing days after humans have fled.Matthew Weaver pats a hound that jumps on his chest.We have no chance of escape. They are soon so close that to continue running would be futile. We hunker down in the heather so the hounds will have to find us only by smell and not sight. With unerring skill these stench-seeking missiles hit us in a flash.Once again we are bombarded with wet snouts and slobbery jowls. Any irrational fears of being gobbled up are instantly allayed.As soon as they catch us the hounds quickly lose interest. They are already keen to start the next hunt. Once we have caught our breath and wiped ourselves down, we go again.Over the course of the day we end up running more than eight miles in five separate hunts. Wherever we went – across bogs, wading through rivers and clambering through woods – the hounds always caught us. Their ability to follow their noses is uncanny and awesome to witness first-hand.Being hunted by hounds is strangely exhilarating. It is certainly more exciting than a Parkrun.Explore more on these topicsHuntingAnimal welfareWildlifeRunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident at a London station.Williams, of Peterborough, is due to appear at Cambridge crown court on 1 December.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

She carried a sign saying: “Let’s struggle.” She said: “I am here for my people, my land, our rivers and our ancestors. We are constantly threatened by mining, by agribusiness and by land invasions. We must fight for our survival.”View image in fullscreenA funeral for fossil fuels was staged as part of the march.Photograph: Jonathan WattsThe most gothic section of the march was a “funeral for fossil fuels”. A dozen “mourners” dressed in black rallied below two large ghoul puppets and three enormous coffins bearing the words “coal”, “oil” and “gas”. One woman, who gave the name Krishna and said she was an actor from Belém, looked like a figure from a Victorian horror story in a black lace veil and umbrella. “Our lives depend on getting rid of fossil fuels. Our children and our future depend on our struggle. Through my art, I am here to fight.”One of the many anti-capitalist areas of the march surrounded a large banner declaring: “The environmental collapse is capitalist: Lula, the energy transition with Amazon oil is a farce.” Nearby, a sound truck blared out the Italian socialist anthem Bella Ciao. Among those marching here was Maria Melia of the Quilombola Movement of Maranhão. She said she was fighting for the Amazon and against a “hydrovia” water transport project that was cutting through the territory of her community.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators at the Belém march.Photograph: Jonathan WattsSome marchers held large images of capybaras. Fabricio (pictured above on right) told the Guardian: “We came to the march to say animals need to be protected, too. The negotiators have got to think about how biodiversity must be protected.”There was support for Palestine visible everywhere also, including flags and chants. Classic Brazilian songs were blasting out of speakers, in particular the popular track Anunçiação by Alçeu Valença.View image in fullscreenSome marchers brought a 30-metre snake to carry through the streets symbolising the need to ‘pay up’!Photograph: Dharna NoorTowards the back of the march, 80 protesters held up a 30-metre-long cobra. The Guardian caught up with them as they were taking the sculpture apart. Cobra is a double entendre, they explained: The snake is a sacred animal for Indigenous people in the Brazilian Amazon, and the word cobra also translates to “pay up!”“We came here with the message that we need climate finance for the people living in the Amazon,” said activist Helena Ramos of Brazilian grassroots organising coalition Amazônia da Pé.Inspired by a dream that an Indigenous leader had, massive sculpture was built by 16 artists from Santarém municipality in Pará state, then brought over on a boat by the Indigenous youth movement the People’s Alliance. It took 83 people to hold it up.“It’s not too heavy,” said Ramos. “Holding it up is part of our mission.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators with a sign calling for action on the climate emergency.Photograph: Dharna NoorThe talks still have one week to run, and it is unclear what the outcome will be. The Brazilian hosts have said they do not plan toissue a cover decision– the agreement that is sometimes gavelled out at the end of the talk. Instead, they will focus on implementation. As yet no one is quite sure what that will look like.Meanwhile delegates are also stuck on the “big four” issues of climate finance; trade; transparency; and how to address the inadequacy of nations’ recently submitted national climate plans – into a separate set of “presidency consultations”, that emerged as countries tried to agree an agenda last Sunday, before the start of the two weeks of talks.Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilAmericasFossil fuel divestmentFossil fuelsEnergyRenewable energyShareReuse this content"

It is believed to have been intended to interrupt the keynote weekly showdown between Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch in September.The police believe the phone was deliberately placed to cause disruption. A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “At 10.25 on Wednesday 3 September a mobile phone was found during a routine search of the House of Commons chamber by Met officers.“Enquiries led officers to believe that the phone was purposely placed in a location with the aim of causing disruption to business in the house.“A man in his 30s was arrested on Friday 5 September on suspicion of attempting to intentionally cause a public nuisance.“Another man in his 60s was arrested on Tuesday 30 September on suspicion of the same offence. Both have been bailed to return at a later date.”Heightened security measures were introduced in the Commons after the phone was found. Audio and guided tours were cancelled and there was reduced access to the Commons chamber.The House of Lords took the same decision to reduce access to the Lords Chamber “as a precautionary measure”.“Enquiries remain ongoing and we continue to keep the speaker and clerk of the house up to date with our investigation,” the spokesperson said.The incident is being treated seriously as it represents a major breach of parliamentary security.The phone was found while hundreds of security staff based in Westminster were onstrikeover pay and conditions. As a result, visitors were banned from the parliamentary estate. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the strike went ahead because of the reduction of annual leave entitlements, stagnant pay and an ethnicity pay gap.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Like any good BBC drama, it was a plot twist no one had seen coming.As they assessed the brutal pressures that had finally proved too much for Davie, a second question soon arose. Was running theBBCnow simply an impossible job?“That’s the conversation going round this newsroom,” said a BBC insider. “That’s one of the sad things; the relentless nature of these roles. They are big jobs but … god.”Davie had been through a series of rows since the start of the year, from the social media posts of its former star sports presenterGary Linekerto several issues relating toIsrael and Gaza coverage. As recently as last week, however, he had seemed to be thinking about the future as he engaged in a staff debate about the impact of AI.Yet, to the BBC lieutenants whose ranks would once have produced Davie’s successor, this latest crisis has exposed gaping issues that now make the job so perilous.The Guardian has talked to sources across the BBC about the events that have unfolded since allegations of systemic liberal bias were made in a memo by a former external adviser, leaked to the Daily Telegraph and dissected over several days.Opinions differ about the severity of the issues laid out by Michael Prescott, a PR executive who was once the political editor of Rupert Murdoch’s Sunday Times.Most point to theediting of a Trump speech, in which the corporation’s Panorama programme spliced together two parts of the president’s address on the day of the Capitol riots, as the most serious error. The BBC hasapologisedpersonally to the president, who has threatened to sue.The crisis has also brought to the fore long-running concerns about internal political pressure. In a demonstration of the dysfunction, some in the corporation regard Prescott’s memo as the culmination of a “coup” by rightwing forces attempting to bend the corporation’s coverage.The concerns have concentrated on the role of Robbie Gibb, the self-styled “proper Thatcherite Conservative” who served as communications chief to Theresa May when she was prime minister. He was placed on the BBC board by Boris Johnson and given a new term by the last Conservative government.Some point to an alignment between the gripes of Gibb and Prescott. It had been reported that the pair were friends, but the Guardian has since established that Gibb was on a panel that handed him the advisory role. Prescott has said his concerns “do not come with any political agenda”.A gathering of the BBC board on 6 November to discuss how to react to Prescott’s claims became a microcosm of the increasingly fraught internal tensions. It featured a news team at odds with board members, board members at odds with each other and a weakened chair, Samir Shah, seemingly unable to find a resolution for days on end.It ended in the departure of Davie and Deborah Turness, the head of BBC News. For the former, it was one crisis too far, while Turness concluded that her job, too, had become impossible.View image in fullscreenDeborah Turness would have been an obvious candidate to succeed Tim Davie as director general but is now ruled out.Photograph: Jack Taylor/ReutersWhile sources said Gibb was at one end of a spectrum criticising BBC bias, there was a wider group on the board that day concerned about how far BBC News was prepared to go in its contrition about Panorama’s edit of Trump’s speech.Many insiders saw it as the culmination of a steady stream of bias allegations lodged by Gibb, backed by a cadre of board members. Gibb’s concerns were seemingly shared by Michael Plaut, a relatively recent addition to the board appointed by the Conservative government before the last election. Plaut is not a member of any political party.Shah has described any notion of a rightwing operation to attack the BBC from within as fanciful. He has also said it was right to have a diversity of views. BBC figures point out that Gibb was just one voice of more than a dozen board members, and was one of four who picked Prescott.After the resignations, however, some in the BBC discovered Gibb had additional power thanks to his role on the obscure-sounding editorial guidelines and standards committee (EGSC).As a member of that committee, Gibb had the right to order ad hoc research from its senior policy adviser, the longtime BBC journalist and Gibb’s former BBC Newsnight colleague David Grossman. It was Grossman’s memory for a story that led him to spot that Panorama had spliced together the Trump speech. He had previously covered the White House as a reporter.As Gibb was one of five EGSC members – the others including the preoccupied Davie, Shah and Turness – insiders said this gave him significant scope to set in train a flow of evidence of liberal biases.This is disputed. It is understood that, generally, Grossman’s main research topics were decided by the whole committee, and editorial leaders were aware of research commissioned by Gibb, which was then discussed by all on the committee.One said Gibb took exception to a story about rail strikes that was dominated by comments about the inconvenience to travellers, with no reference to the arguments of the striking workers. But Gibb has said publicly that his biggest concerns at the BBC were around liberal bias.View image in fullscreenRobbie Gibb, a self-styled ‘proper Thatcherite Conservative’, was placed on the BBC board by Boris Johnson.Photograph: Steve Back/Getty ImagesDefenders of Gibb say he wants to protect the BBC. In fact, he did not want Davie to resign and has backed the licence fee, the compulsory charge that funds the corporation.Roger Mosey, a former head of BBC TV news, said: “You need people from a wide range of political views. I’d much rather they had not been a former press spokesman for Theresa May, because that feels more official. The BBC is in a sort of centre-left liberal position, if it’s not careful.”However, critics who believe there has been a push from the right said Prescott’s memo did not touch on claims of bias from other political directions, such as thetreatment of Palestinian voices, on itsGaza reporting generallyor its reportingon trans rights issues.“The concerns about partiality always seem to be the same ones,” said Lewis Goodall, a podcaster and former BBC reporter who has previously clashed with Gibb and Grossman. “I would have a lot more time for Prescott or Gibb if they were [trying] to form a genuine list of eclectic impartiality breaches which ran across the spectrum.“It presupposes that partiality breaches only go in one direction. For these people, they do, because the truth is they are as partial as those that they seek to correct.”Some potential successors to Davie are said to have been put off by Gibb’s presence. BBC staff, unions and politicians are nowdemanding his removalfrom the board to make life easier for the next director general. The workings of the EGSC are also being reviewed.On top of the internal strife and external noise, the incoming director general will have to deal with seismic talks with the government about the renewal of the BBC’s charter – essentially a discussion about its existence, funding and purpose.The incoming director general will have those discussions against the backdrop of the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, which has said it wants to abolish the licence fee.Pat Younge, a former BBC chief creative officer, is among a group of figures who believe the Labour government must act now to place a ring of steel around the BBC’s independence.“The BBC needs a forever charter, which will give it a degree of insulation from the day-to-day back and forth of politics,” he said. “Appointments to the BBC board need to be made by a fully independent public appointments process.”Sowho will do Davie’s job? It’s remit has become so large that many are pushing for the creation of a deputy position occupied by an established journalist.Many agree it is time for the first female director general, but one obvious candidate – Turness – is now ruled out. Charlotte Moore, the recently departed chief content officer, was often seen as a successor but has no background in news. Some regard Kevin Bakhurst, the director general of RTÉ, who has helped the Irish broadcaster navigate difficult times, to be a safe pair of hands.There was a prophetic moment at a recent staff meeting in Cardiff when Davie was asked whether, like the BBC’s Doctor Who, the director general would be regenerating soon. While he said he loved the role, he conceded it was “not a job for the faint-hearted”.Seeing how events of the last week derailed their boss, many of those in his shadow hope they don’t find themselves emerging from the Tardis."

Although Reform has not specified what those thresholds would be, it is reported they could be set at about £60,000 a year – far in excess of the £41,700 currently required for most skilled worker visas.Skilled worker visas come with restrictions and can be cancelled if a person leaves their employer, or if their salary changes.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage said non-UK citizens would have to continue to apply for visas, with new higher salary thresholds, but has not specified what those thresholds would be.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesIn addition, the Labour government’s plans to extend the indefinite leave to remain qualifying period to 10 years have been perceived as an attempt to claw back the support of voters who are considering backing Reform.Here, some people who have chosen to make the UK their home tell the Guardian how the lives they have built are now in jeopardy.No 10 tells Labour MPs it expects support for tough new asylum policiesRead moreJinnie Shin, 44,an emergency medicine doctor living in Bishop’s Stortford, HertfordshireShin, originally from the US, came to the UK as a medical student in 2015. She had barely left medical school when the NHS was paralysed by Covid. As a newly qualified doctor at Croydon university hospital, south London, she found herself battling to save the lives of those floored by the virus – and comforting the dying as they said goodbye to their loved ones on video calls.Five years on, Shin, from Boston, is now an emergency medicine registrar at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. Despite the sacrifices she has made for the NHS – she didn’t see her family for 18 months while working 12-hour shifts treating patients on ventilators – she wonders if she has a future in Britain.Shin, 44, is now eligible for indefinite leave to remain. However, she has been left questioning whether it is worth paying the “enormous” costs – application fees start at about £3,000 – only for Reform to rescind settled status if they win the next general election.She also worries that setting the salary thresholds for skilled worked visas at about £60,000 a year would devastate the NHS. A registrar beginning specialist training earns £52,656. The starting salary for a resident doctor – formerly known as a junior doctor – is £38,831.“You are basically talking about culling [doctors] who will eventually become our registrars and consultants,” Shin said. “This sort of move would eliminate the foot soldiers of the NHS.”Shin maintains that she was “fortunate” to be able to help the health service navigate the worst crisis in its history in her first year as a doctor, but feels the toll it took on her and other immigrants – about a fifth of the NHS workforce is from outside the UK – may be forgotten.“It was terrifying,” she said. “I saw more death in the first two weeks than I have in my entire career thus far. As traumatised as many healthcare workers are, we do appreciate that we did a great service for people.“Every day was the worst day of someone else’s life and that was our day, day in, day out. It was truly devastating. I was on my own without any family support.“Some of us actually sacrificed our lives. Some of us have come out of it like we’ve been to war – because we really were at war with this virus. People are talking about us as if we’re a drain on resources.“I have good friends who I see regularly. I have a partner, who is European, but has been settled in the UK for 20 years. We have a fantastic life here, in terms of what we have built for ourselves, but when we talk about our future here, we’re just not sure.”Shin said she has also observed an uptick in “microaggressions” directed at some doctors of colour. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, recently said he was shocked at the“ugly” racism experienced by some NHS workers.She added: “As someone who, every day, goes in and takes care of the people of the UK – some of these people, what if inside they’re thinking: I’d rather have a white, English, male doctor? It’s an uncomfortable situation to be in.“I hate to think staying in the UK would be a bad decision, but it’s looking less and less like a good one. I would love to stay, because I’ve built my life here, but I don’t really feel that welcome any more.”Sid Shyamsundar, 31,an engineer living in Bury, Greater ManchesterShyamsundar was elated when he was offered his “dream job” as a human factors engineer, working to help enhance Britain’s defence capabilities amid increasing global instability. In 2021, he came to the UK from Pune, western India, on a skilled worker visa.View image in fullscreenSid Shyamsundar, an engineer from India, says uncertainty over visa rules has left him anxious about his future and life in Britain.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHe and his wife, a graphic designer, adore the life they have built in Bury, Greater Manchester, and want to buy their own home there. But with the future of Britain’s immigration system shrouded in uncertainty, they have put their plans on hold.“2025 has been the hardest year I’ve had to face,” he said. “The reminders that your life may be temporary are a constant drain on your mental health. The big news announcements from all the parties take their toll. It’s always there in your mind that your way of life can be taken away from you. I haven’t slept very well in the last six months. It’s been difficult. It’s been an exercise in resilience. We’re socially, financially and even emotionally invested in the UK. We’ve almost had the rug pulled from under us.”Shyamsundar should be eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain next April, but is plagued by questions about whether this will guarantee a long-term future in the UK. He also lives with the threat of having his visa revoked should the rules change. He said he would not qualify for a skilled worker visa if Reform raised the salary threshold to about £60,000 a year.“It doesn’t take away from what my job is – the people I want to keep safe, the pilots, ground crew, everybody,” he said. “But there is a lot of rhetoric around immigration. It can be demoralising when you focus on it, but as collective, we as defence workers, immigrants in defence and aerospace, make a difference.“One of the biggest messages I try to deliver is that migrants are a net contributors. We have had a lot of chat that immigration is a drain on the economy. When you look at the hard data, there is a very different story.”Shyamsundar said questions over his future in the UK often hit him at unexpected moments.“It’s like a death by a thousand cuts – walking along in the autumn, seeing the leaves fall, and thinking, I might not be here next autumn,” he said. “That’s what really breaks your heart. It takes a toll on people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eight years later, Haj Ahmed – who works for a leading multiple sclerosis charity and says she has never claimed benefits – can’t imagine living anywhere but London.“My integration is rooted in real human connection,” she said. “London now feels like home in every sense of the word. Each time I travel outside of the city, I feel the pull to return. When I return to London I’m pleased – I’m home.”Haj Ahmed devotes her spare time to charity work. She has worked as a volunteer interpreter for refugees, given free tuition to A-level and GCSE students and provided companionship for dementia patients.She and her husband, Abdullah al-Nofal, 37, have bought a house in Wembley, north-west London, and are in the process of applying for indefinite leave to remain, although they say their application has been complicated by recent regime change in Syria. Nofal says he was detained in Syria’s notorious al-Khatib prison – known as “hell on earth” because thousands were tortured there.“Throughout these years, my husband and I have contributed to the economy and society without ever relying on the state,” Haj Ahmed, 34, said. “We have integrated fully into British society and British life. The relationships I have formed have become the foundation of my sense of belonging. I have embraced UK traditions, history and social norms.”Haj Ahmed, who added that she has severe depression because of uncertainty over her immigration status, said Reform’s plans to scrap indefinite leave to remain would “destroy” her life.Why does UK government want to copy Denmark’s immigration system?Read more“This policy undermines a sense of stability for us, which is essential to integration.” she said. “When people work, study and contribute for years, they deserve a clear and reliable pathway to permanence, not shifting rules which make belonging feel really conditional.“I wanted to have children this year. We worked very hard to have a home here, so now we have a mortgage. We are reaching for stability but we don’t know where we’re going. The broader question is, what kind of country does the UK want to be? My story shows what refugees and immigrants can contribute when given the opportunity.”Haj Ahmed said being deported to Syria would be unthinkable. Although the Assad regime fell late last year, concerns about violence and human rights violations persist. The country has also been targeted by Israeli drone strikes.“I don’t have any other place to go,” she said. “I’m being treated as a number, a figure. It’s not my fault, what happened in my country. I ran away from death and the Assad regime.“Many Syrians who visited Syria recently say they feel like strangers in a place they were born because the country has changed and so have we. Belonging is not just about geography, it’s about where your life is, where your friends are, where you feel safe, where you have a home.”Sayali Wandhekar, 30,adesignerliving in Camden,LondonView image in fullscreenSayali Wandhekar: ‘I want to be here long term. But am I going to buy a house, settle here, have children here? It’s something I can’t plan for.’Photograph: Sophia Evans/The GuardianSayali Wandhekar moved to London to study for a master’s degree in 2020. She loved it so much that, in 2022, she took a job as a designer in the corporate sector. However, the “shifting goalposts” on immigration rules mean she is now struggling to plan for the future.Wandhekar, 30, hopes to apply for indefinite leave to remain when her skilled worker visa expires in 2027, unless the eligibility criteria changes before then.“I don’t know what the system is going to look like,” she said. “How many years am I going to have to be on a skilled worker visa? I’ve come so close to getting ILR (indefinite leave to remain). In terms of mental health, it does create a lot of uncertainty.“I want to be here long term. I’ve made a life here. I have a strong friend group. I have a proper life. But am I going to buy a house, settle here, have children here? It’s something I can’t plan for.”Wandhekar says a “significant” number of her colleagues are “distressed” by the idea the salary threshold for a skilled worker visa could increase to about £60,000 a year. She added that a Reform victory in the next general election could force her to rethink her future in the country – and perhaps prompt her to return to her native Pune, in western India.“[It] would definitely turn me towards considering other places I can move to, plus potentially moving back to India,” she said. “The last thing I want is to be on a skilled worker visa forever. It restricts my freedom.”Wandhekar added that she feared the UK could suffer a brain drain if skilled workers were unable to settle in the country permanently.“I have a friend group – most of them are on skilled worker visas,” she said. “If they were to scrap indefinite leave to remain, most, if not all of them will look for options outside of the country.“I have friends who are engineers, in finance and consulting – highly skilled jobs. If they were to move back to other countries, then we are going to see fewer people in those workplaces. From a diversity perspective, you are going to miss out on international talent. How do you upscale people in the UK to take on those jobs?”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumReform UKfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He studied at Liberty, a Christian university founded by the conservative pastor and televangelistJerry Falwell, and recalls wearing a T-shirt expressing opposition to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.Two decades later, Justin Douglas is running for theUS Congress– as a Democrat.He is amongaround 30 Christian white clergy– pastors, seminary students and other faith leaders–known to be potential Democratic candidates in next year’s midterm elections, including a dozen who are already in the race. While stressing the separation of church and state, many say that on a personal level their faith is calling them into the political arena.US Catholic bishops elect conservative president, doubling down on rightward leanRead moreThe trend marks a break from a traditional racial divide. Whereas Black pastors who run for office are typicallyDemocrats, their white counterparts are usually Republicans, reflecting the strength of the religious right and the party’s dominance among evangelical voters.Douglas, 41, based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is among a new generation ofthe Christian leftaiming to change that narrative by ensuring that the Democratic brand is not associated with only college-educated urbanites, but can also connect with white working-class churchgoers.“We’ve seen Democrats time and time again sell out working-class people and we’ve seen Democrats time and time again look like liberal elitists who are looking down on people who think going to church on Sunday is a core part of their life,” said Douglas, who has been in ministry for more than 20 years. “Some people might feel judged for that.“But I also think the stereotypes of Republicans being pro-faith are bullshit too. We’re seeing a current administration bastardise faith almost every day. They used the Lord’s Prayer in a propaganda video for what they’re now calling theDepartment of War. That should have had every single evangelical’s bells and whistles and alarms going off in their head: this is sacrilegious.But I also think the stereotypes of Republicans being pro-faith are bullshit tooJustin Douglas“But unfortunately, sometimes, when you’re in it, you can’t see it and it takes somebody who has an ability to communicate to that audience, to help show that you’re being manipulated.”For decades, many white Christians were not partisan and often voted Democratic, especially in the south. But by the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Democratic party’s identity was shifting toward civil rights, feminism and secular liberalism. Many white conservative Christians felt increasingly alienated from the party they had long inhabited.The racial divide can in part be traced to the mid-1970s when the Internal Revenue Service began removing tax-exempt status from private schools that discriminated by race. Conservative Christian leaders such as Jerry Falwell saw this as federal overreach and seized on abortion as an issue that could be framed in religious and political terms.Falwell’s organisation the Moral Majority used abortion as a broader symbol of moral decline alongside feminism, sex education and gay rights. His followers then felt betrayed whenJimmy Carter, the first evangelical Christian to occupy the White House, failed to pursue their priorities.View image in fullscreenJerry Falwell speaks at Higher Ground Baptist church in Kingsport, Tennessee, circa 1980s.Photograph: Kenneth Murray/Photo Researchers History via Getty ImagesThey defected to Republican Ronald Reagan, and, by the end of the 1980s, white evangelicals had become one of the most consistently Republican voting blocs, evenas Black churchgoers remained loyal to Democrats. That has persisted over the past decade under Donald Trump, seen by critics as vulgar and unchristian but by supportersas a blunt instrumentto defend a church under siege by a godless liberal culture.Whereas Carter earned 60% of the white evangelical vote in 1976, fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton gained only a 16% share in 2016. It was a troubling realignment that caught the eye of Doug Pagitt, a pastor and executive director of the progressive Christian groupVote Common Good.He said: “That’s not natural. That’s not just a policy change. There was something more significant going on. It’s been a two-sided effort. Republicans have oriented themselves primarily around religious voter identity and Democrats have set aside religious voter identity, including the fact that in 1992 Democrats removed from the voter access file the category of religious identity.”Pagitt said Charlie Kirk’s organisationTurning Point USAwas vital in turning out young Christian voters for Trump last year: “The difference couldn’t be more stark, which is why white clergy running for office is such a big deal when they’re running as Democrats in Iowa, in Arkansas, in Pennsylvania, in California.”Trump’s first election was the trigger for a new wave of white clergy to overcome fears of being seen as partisan and run for elected office. Pagitt added: “After 2016 and 2018, a whole lot of people started thinking: ‘Hey, maybe running for office is something we should actually do.’“Few people are surprised whenRaphael Warnocksays: ‘I’m a working pastor at Ebenezer Baptist church.’ He comes from the Martin Luther King tradition, from that pulpit, and it made sense: people are like: ‘Yeah, of course a Black clergyman’s going to run as a Democrat.’ But when a white woman pastor in Iowa says, ‘I’m going to run as a Democrat,’ it’s a real statement. It’s taken some of these people a little while to get comfortable with the fact that they are going to be partisan.”I joke sometimes that the two people who have changed my life ... are Jesus and Donald Trump, for very different reasonsRobb RyerseVote Common Good was founded in response to a schism created by the election of Trump, which left many religious people feeling “politically homeless”. The group operates as a “dating service”, connecting these voters with Democrats and non-Maga Republicans. The group will spend time in 50 congressional districts this year helping candidates meet faith voters and leaders in their districts.Douglas is a county commissioner looking to unseatRepublican Scott Perryin Pennsylvania’s 10th district. But he was previously the lead pastor of a growing church that allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to participate fully in its community; over the course of a year, this developed into a huge bone of contention and in 2019 Douglas eventually lost his licence. He had to find a new house and go from one job to three jobs including driving an Uber and CrossFit coaching. He started a new church that is still operating today.Douglas recalls: “I paid the price for standing with the LGBTQ+ people. I would do it again. It taught me that doing what’s right is often costly but always necessary, and everyone deserves to be safe, respected and fully included. That’s not a religious belief. It’s a human belief that I have.”James Talarico, a Texas state representative and a 36-year-old part-time seminary student who has amassed a sizable social media following – has become an unlikely standard-bearer in the Democrats’ 2026 Senate primary.In a series of social media posts, he deploys scripture to champion the poor and vulnerable while castigating Republicans for what he casts as their drift towards Christian nationalism and corporate interests.He asked in one: “Instead of posting the Ten Commandments in every classroom, why don’t they post, ‘Money is the root of all evil’ in every boardroom?”View image in fullscreenSupporters cheer as James Talarico kicks off his Senate campaign in Round Rock, Texas, on 9 September 2025.Photograph: Mikala Compton/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty ImagesIn Iowa, state representativeSarah Trone Garriott, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor, is seeking her party’s nod to challenge Republican incumbent Zach Nunn in what is already billed as one of the nation’s marquee congressional races.In Arkansas,Robb Ryerse, a Christian pastor and former Republican, is mounting a challenge to representative Steve Womack, adopting the slogan “Faith, Family & Freedom” – rhetoric more commonly found in Republican campaign literature.Ryerse, 50, from Springdale, Arkansas, said: “I joke sometimes that the two people who have changed my life more than any others are Jesus and Donald Trump, for very different reasons. Donald Trump is absolutely inconsistent with Christian principles of love and compassion, justice, looking out for the poor, meeting the needs of the marginalised.“But Donald Trump has also used and been used by so many evangelical leaders who want political power. He has used them to validate him to their followers and they have used him to further their agenda, which has been a Christian nationalist culture war on the United States, which I think is bad for both the church and for the country.”White clergy are deciding to run for office, Ryerse believes, in part as a response to the rise of Christian nationalism and the reality that, according to a Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI)survey, Trump won 85% of the white evangelical vote in last year’s presidential election.Ryerse said: “We realise, hey, our churches and the people in our churches have been duped by this guy and so rather than hope someone else will clean up the problem, what we’ve seen is a lot of pastors respond with, you know what, I’m going to jump in and I’m going to be a part of the solution.“On a more positive note, there’s also that notion we need to do something for the common good. There’s so much alignment between what I believe personally is good for my neighbour, what it means to love my neighbour, and how that aligns with what public policy ought to be.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsDemocratsChristianityReligionUS CongressfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, a growing number of companies are offering pension salary sacrifice as a perk, and it can be a very tax-efficient way of saving into your workplace scheme.It involves an employee agreeing to give up some of their salary and move the amount they would otherwise receive into a benefit that’s “non-cash” based – in this case, extra employer contributions into their pension pot.These schemes can run alongside conventional workplace pension contributions – if your employer lets you make “additional voluntary contributions” this might be through salary sacrifice.The money you sacrifice comes out of your gross pay – the salary before income tax and national insurance (NI) are taken off – so it costs less to make a contribution than if it was done out of taxed income.By reducing your salary you also reduce how much you pay in NI. This means thatyour take home pay could be higherthan if you paid the same sum into your pension through a traditional arrangement.Reducing your taxed earnings can have another advantage – if you are a parent and earn more than £60,000 you could divert money into your pension and keep more of any child benefit you claim.The schemes also benefit employers, as they do not have to pay employee NI on the money sacrificed. Some will pay part, or all, of their NI saving into the worker’s pension as well, thereby further boosting their pot.What is being considered?Amid suggestions that lots of higher earners are maxing out this perk, the government is reportedly looking to restrict the tax benefits offered by these schemes.“Rather than an all-out ban on using salary sacrifice, one option on the table is a £2,000 cap on the amount of earnings that can be exchanged for pension contributions that benefit from a national insurance exemption,” says Charlene Young at the investment platform AJ Bell.What would the impact be?Introducing that cap could reportedly raise up to £2bn a year, but at a cost to employees and companies. AJ Bell says someone earning £55,000 a year who contributes 10% (£5,500) into their pension through salary sacrifice would have their take-home pay cut by £188 a year and their employer would pay an extra £525 in NI. If salary sacrifice was removed as an option, the figures would rise to £441 and £825 respectively.Pensionexperts have warnedthat cutting the incentives to save will be counterproductive at a time when there are concerns about the adequacy of people’s retirement planning.On Thursday, thechief executive of Aviva, Amanda Blanc, told the Times: “What you’re effectively doing is penalising those employers that actually contribute more to employees’ pensions.“But you’re also saying to people who save for their pension that perhaps they shouldn’t do it, and I think that’s bad news long-term for the UK if you think about the fact that 15 million people in the UK are not saving enough.”Is pension tax-free cash safe?Currently, from the age of 55 (57 from April 2028) you can usually take up to 25% of your pension as a tax-free lump sum, up to a limit of £268,275.Spool back a few weeks and there was fevered speculation that Reeves may look to slash this limit. However, during the last few days, reports have emerged claiming the Treasury has – for now – ruled out such a move.Helen Morrissey, of the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “Restrictions to tax-free cash are reported to be firmly off the table. It’s a move that will be greeted with a huge sigh of relief from people who have worked hard to build up a decent retirement income and were concerned about the looming loss of a valuable benefit.”What about pension tax relief?In simple terms, when someone pays into a pension, the government usually adds a top-up payment called tax relief. It means their savings are usually boosted by 20% or more, depending on their rate of income tax – so people who pay tax at 40% or 45% get extra relief (different rates apply in Scotland). As a result, this is a hugely valuable tax break, and a big part of why saving into a pension is usually seen as a very good thing for people to do.Pretty much every year there are rumours that the government is going to clamp down on pension tax relief with the aim of making the system less generous to better-off earners. That is no surprise when you consider that – depending on whose numbers you believe – tax relief on pension contributions costs the government anything from £50bn to more than £60bn a year.At the time of writing, cutting/redistributing pension tax relief is not viewed as a frontrunner for this month’s budget.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025PensionsPensions industryRachel ReevesTax and spendingexplainersShareReuse this content"

I knew he was an Australian living in the South Island ofNew Zealand. I was in Wellington, and there’d been a few occasions when I’d travelled to the South Island for raves or anarchist conferences where some of the folks had gone to Tom’s place – but I splintered off somewhere else.Then one day, in 2007, I was at a punk gig when a mutual friend said, “Oh, do you know Tom Box? He’s over there. He’s just moved up to Wellington.” There in a sea of black-clad punks, jumping up and down at the front of the mosh pit, was this guy in a pale blue Star Trek uniform. To me, as a person unfamiliar with Star Trek, he looked like he was wearing pyjamas. This was my first vision of him, but we didn’t talk at all that night.View image in fullscreenKate and Tom at the Doctor Who Worlds of Wonder Exhibition in Wellington, 2024.Some time later I was living in a squat and working as a theatre set designer. I’d made this set that had gameshow podiums in it, but they looked a bit like Daleks. Another friend saw them and said his housemate, who was obsessed with Doctor Who, would love them. It turned out his housemate was Tom.They lived around the corner, so, hoping to catch his attention, I drew a poster saying “Free to a good home, something vaguely resembling a Dalek!” I included my phone number and stuck it outside what I thought was his flat. About a week passed and I hadn’t heard anything. Then I realised I’d stuck it up in the wrong alleyway, so I moved it and within 24 hours I had a bite.Texts started flowing in and they got weird pretty quickly. He was initially concerned that I might be someone dodgy trying to lure him in with a Dalek. Tom has a slightly filthy sense of humour, which I find very entertaining, so once I had confirmation from a mutual friend that the texter was indeed him, I was happy to keep up the banter.Eventually, we met up, and he wasn’t convinced my set pieces looked much like a Dalek. We had a cup of tea and decided we should keep hanging out. Our first few dates were pool, pinball and roller disco outings. Sometimes, we’d play doubles at pool and would be so on fire no one could beat us.View image in fullscreenThe couple wearing Star Trek uniforms at home with Esmerelda, also dressed in a Star Trek onesie, 2011.I gradually started spending more time at his place and, eventually, when a room became available in his flat, I moved in.I’d had a number of short relationships before meeting Tom but I always knew they had their limits. With Tom, something felt different. It was as if we’d been on the same path the whole time – like we’d always been heading towards this moment. But this revelation was not without anguish. I’d come out of a relationship with a woman – my first of this nature – and was eager to explore more.I remember sitting on the back porch of my squat feeling a pang of fear that my life would never be the same again – but I already knew we were an unbeatable duo. In that way, meeting Tom was joyous and a little sad, because it meant my future experiences with women might be over. It also marked the end of my squat life – no rent, no bills, carefree days – and suddenly I needed a proper job to fund my new “lavish” lifestyle of dining out with Tom!Right from the get-go we always enjoyed dressing up together. Tom loves the gender-bending aspects of some of the costumes. We started anannual calendarof photos of Tom dressed as various masked characters we’ve created. We’d go on road trips waiting to jump out if we spotted the right opportunity, such as a derelict house for Creepy Bunny, or some farm machinery for Pigeon Head.The moment I knew: they decorated a carrot cake to celebrate with meRead moreTom is a gardener, at home and at work, and does a lot of hard yakka that I really admire and respect, regenerating the native bush for the birds and insects. In his past he was a forest blockader and, having been to a few blockades myself, I understood the risks and importance of this type of activism. His care for nature is very deep, and I love and respect that greatly. Tom has a great moral compass, too, and is always a wonderful sounding board.We’ve been together for 18 years now. I work in the film industry so, while I’m galavanting around the country working, Tom keeps the home fires burning. We bought a house, had a few cats – sadly lost a few, too. We’ve both learned to enjoy time apart but love coming back together again, going on adventures and our lovely life together.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

But could he have been Hannibal Lecter to Jodie Foster’s Clarice Starling?The intriguing prospect is raised by an unlikely 33-page draft script for The Silence of the Lambs lurking in a collection of the late actor Gene Hackman’s possessions thatgoes up for auctionlater this month.From Unforgiven to The Firm: Guardian writers pick their favourite Gene Hackman moviesRead moreThesale of more than 400 itemsfrom the estate of Hackman – who won Oscars for his roles in The French Connection and Unforgiven – follows his death earlier this year at the age of 95 and contains more than one surprise.The story of the partial script dates back toHackman callingThomas Harris’s The Silence of the Lambs “one of the most cinematic books I’ve ever read” and buying a share of the film rights. “Gene wanted to direct, and play Hannibal Lecter,” Harris’s agent, Robert Bookman,told Deadline in 2017.Work on a screenplay was under way when Hackman suddenly got cold feet and abandoned the project, apparently because it was too dark. Bookman recalled: “Gene Hackman’s daughter read the book. And she called her father and said, ‘Daddy, you’re not making this movie.’”The Silence of the Lambswas released in 1991, directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Anthony Hopkins, and won all five of the top Oscars. Hackman’s first instinct had been on the money.View image in fullscreenHackman pictured in 1996.Photograph: Ron Davis/Getty ImagesAnna Hicks, the head of private and iconic collections at Bonhams, says via Zoom from Los Angeles: “I guess he was the original person to latch on to the rights for that and try and make the movie. Then I found online that, basically, within his own circle people were like, ‘This is too creepy, don’t do it.’ It’s very interesting to see that he started that project but was like, OK, maybe not.”In February, Hackman and his wife,Betsy Arakawa, were found dead inside their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Authorities determined that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer’s diseaseabout a week after Arakawa, 65, died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare disease spread by the droppings of infected rodents.The Gene Hackman Collection: A Life in Artoffers a poignant epilogue with annotated scripts, call sheets, posters and behind-the-scenes photos from films such as Mississippi Burning, Runaway Jury, Hoosiers, Unforgiven and Bonnie and Clyde. There are Golden Globe trophies as well as the Cecil B DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award complete with a handwritten acceptance speech. (The Academy does not allow the resale of Oscars.)But perhaps the great revelation of the auction has nothing to do with the movies. When retired from acting in 2004, he left Hollywood for a somewhat secluded existenceat the end of a cul-de-sac in a gated communityin Santa Fe, exploring a rich and varied hinterland of writing novels, collecting art and painting pictures.More than 70 of Hackman’s works are for sale and on display at Bonhams in Los Angeles. Hicks says: “He was quite a private person and it comes as a surprise to a lot of people. The first thing that everyone says is: This whole wall? He did all of this? When did he have the time?“Within the Santa Fe community we’ve learned there were more people that knew he took art classes from some local artists who are selling some of the journals he had from those classes. Some of his teachers have given us nice quotes about working with him and how dedicated he was to mastering what he was trying to do.”She adds: “To the global audience it’s an outlier. It’s not something anybody knew about him but it’s also cool to see behind the artist’s eyes instead of just in front of the camera.”View image in fullscreenAn image of the Santa Fe studio from the Gene Hackman Collection.Photograph: BonhamsAmong the items being auctioned are Hackman’s seascapes, still lifes and copies he painted of HenriMatisse’s Fruits and Bronze and Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night. He has a particular gift for portraiture, though buyers should not expect to find pictures of his film co-stars: most of the subjects are anonymous, implying his art was cordoned off from the Hollywood persona that defined his public life.Hicks says he clearly studied hard and took his time. “We have books of sketches that show over this time period how he went along and became better and better at it. That’s one of his strongest areas of work. There are a lot of Santa Fe landscapes and still lifes as well but the portraiture is probably my favorite of all the things he did.”Working in an artist’s studio, Hackman made a 14in-tall bronze bust of Arakawa, a classical pianist who was his wife for more than 30 years. The original signed plaster cast is included with the lot. Hicks explains: “We found a book from the studio that he worked in talking about it. He made the mould and somebody else helped him make the bronze. It’s beautiful.”Hicks sees a clear dialogue between the Hackman’s art and the works he collected, particularly in the study of the human form and the use of colour. His taste spanned categories of postwar and contemporary art, western and Native American art, photography and prints.In 1997 Hackman boughtFigure on the Jettyby the American modernist Milton Avery. Depicting a lone figure on a jetty gazing out to sea, the painting is thought to be inspired by Avery’s summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in the late 1950s. It hung in Hackman’s personal library and is expected to fetch between $500,000 and $700,000.View image in fullscreenMilton Avery – Figure on the Jetty.Photograph: BonhamsAndrew Huber, Bonhams head of 20th and 21st century art, weighs in via Zoom from New York: “It’s exactly what you want from a Milton Avery. A good variance in the colour palette. It’s just before he had a medical issue that diminished him towards the end of his career. Great at-the-beach scenes of this scale and oil on canvas is something the market’s looking at, not just the American market but also internationally.”Other notable works includeGreen, 1986by Richard Diebenkorn, estimated at $300,000 to $500,000, a colour etching regarded as Diebenkorn’s most important print of his prominent Ocean Park series. There is a monumental bronze by Auguste Rodin, estimated at $200,000 to $300,000. The catalogue also includes a likeness of Hackman from portrait artist Everett Raymond Kinstler, who painted US presidents and drew for comic books.Founded in 1793, Bonhams has previously handled the estates of celebrities including Lauren Bacall,Diahann Carroll, Siegfried and Roy and Roger Moore. The Hackman sales are structured into a live auction of 13 premier fine art pieces in New York on 19 November and two subsequent online sales. Listings start as low as $100 for Hackman’s everyman Winmau dart board or $600 for a shot at his Seiko diver’s wristwatch.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, Close alternates the glamour of the red carpet with living in a red state. She talks about the joy of her ‘undefined’ lifeByEmma BrockesSat 15 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 14.16 ESTShareMost of us don’t live our lives in accordance with a governing metaphor, but Glenn Close does. The 78-year-old was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, a town in the north‑east of the US that, to the actor’s enduring irritation, telegraphs “smug affluence” to other Americans. In fact, Close’s background is more complicated than that, rooted in a childhood that was wild and free but also traumatic, and in an area of New England in which her family goes back generations. “I grew up on those great stone walls of New England,” says the actor, chin out, gimlet-eyed – Queen Christina at the prow of a ship. “Some of them were 6ft tall and 250 years old! I have a book called Sermons in Stone and it says at one point that more energy and hours ran into building the New England stone walls than the pyramids.”If the walls are an image Close draws on for strength, they might also serve as shorthand for the journalist encountering her at interview. Close appears in a London hotel suite today in a military-style black suit, trim, compact, and with a small white dog propped up on a chair beside her. For the span of our conversation, the actor’s warmth and friendliness combine with a reserve so practised and precise that the presence of the dog in the room feels, unfairly perhaps, like a handy way for Close to burn through a few minutes of the interview with some harmless guff about dog breeds. (The dog is called Pip, which is short for “Sir Pippin of Beanfield”. He is a purebred Havanese and “they’re incredibly intelligent”. Most dog owners in the US have the emotional support paperwork necessary to get them on a plane but, says Close, laughing, “That’s really what he is!”)Anyway, none of this matters – neither the reserve nor the canine distraction – because, of course,Glenn Closeis completely irresistible. How could she not be? The intensity of her most famous roles, from Alex Forrest, the “bunny boiler” in Fatal Attraction (1987), to her maniacal Cruella de Vil in 101 Dalmatians (1996), to Joan Castleman, the seething protagonist of The Wife (2017), makes her that rare thing, a movie star who is also beloved as a character actor. Long before A-list actors made a stampede towards television, Close was churning out five seasons of Damages, the great New York legal drama that ran from 2007, and her choice of projects remains improbably broad. After our meeting, she will fly to Berlin to film the sixth instalment of The Hunger Games, in which she will play Drusilla Sickle, then return to London to film Maud, a drama for Channel 4, all the while appearing on Disney+ in Ryan Murphy’s new schlock divorce drama, All’s Fair, in which she stars alongside – broad church, indeed – Kim Kardashian. Close, who has been known to lobby for a role after she has been turned down for it, has never won an Oscar, and if it’s a weird glitch in Hollywood history, from certain angles the omission works in her favour. Taken alongside the impossible grandness of a Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett, Close remains the more nimble and interesting performer.View image in fullscreenPortraits: David Vintiner/The GuardianActually, I suspect Close can be extremely grand in her way; she’s just better at clothing it in a down-to-earth manner. Her newest release isWake Up Dead Man, the third Knives Out mystery by Rian Johnson for Netflix – first film, fantastic; second, a mess; this one, a return to form with a starry ensemble cast that includes Andrew Scott, Josh Brolin and Kerry Washington. (Brolin plays a Trump-like preacher in a small town in upstate New York, thumping his pulpit and leading people towards mutual hatred and suspicion.) Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc is funnier than ever (the best joke involves a snippet of music from Cats and some organ music from Phantom of the Opera). But the standout role in the movie is Close as Martha Delacroix, a righteous woman quivering with religious fervour – or “a sad character with no life outside the church”, as Close puts it – with the creepy habit of materialising behind people and making them jump.The role was an easy yes for Close because of Johnson’s reputation. “I leapt at it!” she says. “I’d heard from absolutely everyone what a wonderful human being Rian Johnson is. And he really is. He’s incredibly bright and funny, and wonderful. I mean I’d marry him if he wasn’t already married.” Dry pause. “And if he’d have me, at my age.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m not a hugely social person. But I have neighbours who I really, really like’Poor Martha: stricken with guilt, fanatical to the core – a spoofy role, says Close, that “you have to play for real. If you try to be funny, you’re not funny. And the behaviour is funny because it’s written well.” It’s the quality of the writing that often draws Close to a project, and in this case, “Rian said he worked on the plot for eight months before he actually started writing”. Unlike the lastKnives Outfilm, in which Johnson skewered the tech bros with a laboriousness that made the experience of watching it exhausting, the new movie takes on demagoguery without overtly wagging the finger. “It’s not making huge statements,” says Close, “and at the end, it’s like, order is restored and hope is possible.”Close keeps a small apartment in Greenwich Village in New York – “where I started my career” – but her own source of hope and stability is her newish base outside Bozeman, Montana. This is where the actor’s extended family now lives – her sister and brother, who moved there in the 1980s, followed more recently by her older sister, and finally by her daughter, Annie, with Annie’s husband, Marc (the couple moved from LA and earlier this year had their first child). Close joined them permanently in 2019, and her wonder and enthusiasm for a tight-knit family, all living in one place – “It’s such a gift! All the cousins will grow up together!” – indicates how far it is from the way she was raised. But we’ll get to that.I don’t live a life that is saying, Look at who I am, I’m a big famous actress. I never haveI tell her I have been onher Instagram page– she looks theatrically appalled: “I’m sorry!” – and was surprised to see photos she posted from a recent anti‑Trump, No Kings march in that part of the world, which skews heavily Republican and libertarian. “Yeah, it’s very red. We have a university in Bozeman, which is a blue island in a largely red state. So it was amazing that so many people came and stayed the entire time. They’d made their signs. I think everyone is just longing to be able to somehow let other people know how they feel. I’ve actually thought about going down to the courthouse with a sign.”Montana’s reputation is deceptive in other ways, too. It is cowboy country – “Just around the corner from me is where Bob Redford filmed The Horse Whisperer,” says Close – but has long been popular with the ultra-wealthy in search of peace and stunning scenery. Michael Keaton has a ranch there, as does David Letterman; Ted Turner owns one of the largest ranches in the state. Close is living much more modestly and says she is working on finding her own community. “I’m not a hugely social person. But I have neighbours who I really, really like, and in my little community there’s a women’s club I’ve been to once and really enjoyed it.”View image in fullscreen‘She will always be relevant.

The image of a Montana version of the Women’s Institute featuring Glenn Close on the cake committee is … unexpected. What do they do there? “People bring little cakes. The community will have potluck dinners. You get to meet Betty Biggs, whose family’s been ranching there for five generations, and she’s just a very interesting woman. I’m not somebody who would run to a ‘women’s club’, but I really enjoyed it, that sense of community.”The other notable thing about Close’s social media feed is that the photos she posts of herself divide neatly into two categories: red-carpet ready and just woken up. For a movie star, and an older one at that, the 78-year-old is startlingly happy to appear bare-faced, hair puffing wildly off her head like “the endless work of dreaming”, as Marilynne Robinson once memorably wrote of a character.“No makeup, yeah,” says Close with a sly grin.Is that low-key political, the decision to appear unmadeup?“I don’t think of it as political. I’m lazy. And I don’t think makeup necessarily makes you look better. It’s all about lighting. It really is. So I put a ton of light on my face and can look … OK. But, you know, I don’t want to spend that much time on my face if I don’t have to.” For The Hunger Games, she’ll be in makeup for two and a half hours a day. “So when you’re home you don’t want to have to do anything. I’d much rather be myself.” From an engagement point of view, it seems to be working – Close punches the air – “I got up to 1 million [followers]. I don’t know who they are, but thank you.”If Close enjoys a tightly controlled version of letting go, it adds to her reputation as someone who, despite her status, enjoys sitting outside the entertainment bubble.I can’t imagine the crowd at the women’s group in Bozeman, for example, is particularly wowed by the actor’s Hollywood status. “No,” she says. “But then I don’t live a life that is saying, ‘Look at who I am, I’m a big famous actress.’ I never have. I have a little house in town and I sit on the front porch and say hi to people as they go by.”The ability to derive happiness from small things is often most acute among those who were raised to take nothing for granted. For the first time in decades, Close is living near to her siblings, and one result of this arrangement is that they are able to pick over the carcass of their childhood endlessly. In fact, they talk about it “too much”, she says. Specifically: the abrupt change in circumstance that came about with their surgeon father’s decision, when Close was seven, to join Moral Re-Armament, a rightwing religious cult founded in 1938 by an American minister called Frank Buchman, and move the family from Connecticut to Switzerland.Close won’t talk publicly about the details of the cult. She will only say that she still has triggers from the experience, which she has described as “a kind of psychological abuse couched in underlying misogyny”. Buchman’s movement posited what he called a “God‑controlled Fascist dictatorship” as a countermeasure to communism, and before burning out in the late 1960s it was weirdly popular – particularly in Britain, where its most famous adherent was Daphne du Maurier. When Close talks about her background, she focuses on the foundational years until she turned seven, which she characterises as happy and free, a case of she and her siblings running unsupervised around rural Connecticut. “What has sustained me is the landscape of my childhood, which becomes your DNA. One of my earliest memories is being on my grandfather’s farm in back country Greenwich, which was very pastoral then. And I just was a little feral child. My insides need nature.”The regional stereotype of people from New England is similar to that of England proper: buttoned up, unshowy. “You don’t display yourself,” says Close, with a smile. “My mother – we all just adored my mother, and she was the most unmaterialistic woman ever. I never went shopping for entertainment and, now that I look back, I think it’s one of the ways that a girl could possibly start defining herself, if you go and shop. But I hate shopping.” If Close’s mother was repressed, it was in part because, like a lot of women of her generation, she had neither the life nor the opportunities that, looking back, her daughter would have wanted for her. “Oh, I think she could’ve been an artist. She was really good at sculpturing. She could probably have been a writer.”It’s insane that what happens at a certain time in your childhood is, she taps her chest, right hereWhat did she do with that energy? She sighs, then bursts into rueful laughter. “Sublimated it to my father.” Close hoots. “Cooked! Cooked him meals that he would then eat in three minutes.”Did her mother put some of that energy into shaping her?“Oh, I was completely undefined for a very long time. I still am undefined.”Maybe that’s better – to be undefined rather than rigidly holding to someone else’s mould. “Yeah, I guess so! You pull yourself together. You take all these bits and pieces and there’s … Martha.” Or Cruella, or Joan Castleman. “I’d like to think of it as confidence. I haven’t always felt that way.” It’s the process of piecing together the minutiae of a character that Close loves most about acting. “For example, the character I play in The Hunger Games, I started thinking about these little, tiny details that set off my imagination, and that’s where I like to live. This thing I’m going to do here [Maud, the Channel 4 drama]: same thing; I don’t have her yet. I do love that.” It’s the singularity of the chase that Close enjoys, but “it’s also collaborative. I have a wonderful wig guy, and [finding the character] will be a combination of hair, makeup, clothes. If someone can’t collaborate, they shouldn’t be in this profession. You can’t do it yourself.”View image in fullscreen‘My daughter is all earth and I’m all air and water. I’m not into all that but it’s interesting’In her early 20s, Close got away from her parents and the cult to study drama and anthropology at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. She was married by then, to Cabot Wade, a man she had met in a music and performance group affiliated with the cult and from whom she would separate within two years. She has said that acting saved her, although the impression one gets is that talent of equivalent size in any direction would have been enough to yank her out of that world. Life moved on, she became Glenn Close, but the memories and their impact remain. “It never leaves you,” she says. “It’s insane that what happens at a certain time in your childhood is,” she taps her chest, “right here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When Close talks about nature, or the soothing effect of returning in her mind to the happy first seven years of her life, it is with an unusual intensity. This is what I mean by her grandness; not in the sense of airs and graces or the affectation that runs rife in her industry, but a kind of operatic quality I suspect comes from the habit of having to get up the juice to overcome difficult experiences.After college, Close moved to New York to try to make it as an actor. “I have a beautiful wooden troika,” she says, “which is [a toy] made of Russian smooth painted wood: three horses, a sledge and a man and a woman in the back under a rug you could take off and on. My grandfather got it from my uncle, who was killed in world war two, and it came to me and was my treasure. I used to play with it in the snow. When I first moved to New York and had my apartment, I’d gotten this cheap shelf and I put my troika on it and it collapsed. And the troika fell on the floor and all the horses’ legs were broken. And I remember I sank down to the floor and sobbed.” She pauses. “All the rejection I’d had, everything.”She stayed weeping on the floor until something occurred to her. “It was the image of the stone walls. And I remember thinking: you get up. YOU GET UP.” She hisses it. “Get. Up.” Jesus. A real red-earth-of-Tara moment. Close got up and carried on.The funny thing is, she says, in spite of this image of trauma surmounted, “I’m not as fierce as I seem.” She has said that Annie, her daughter, is fiercer. After her first marriage, Close married twice more, to James Marlas, a businessman, and most recently to David Shaw, also a businessman, from whom she divorced in 2015. In between, she had a relationship with John Starke, the film producer and Annie’s father. How is Annie fiercer, I wonder? “Oh, Annie would say [when Close was dating], ‘Mom, he’s an asshole.’ And I’d say, ‘Yeah, but he wasn’t always an asshole. I mean, why is he an asshole? What was in his childhood?’ She’d say, ‘Mom! He’s an asshole.’”That feels like a very generational shift, from apology to no tolerance when it comes to bad behaviour. “Well, my daughter is all earth and I’m all air and water.” She smiles. “I’m not into all that but it’s interesting.”Close is at her most formidable perhaps when she is pursuing a role. Several times in her career she has lobbied hard for ones she knew she wasn’t in the running for. When she auditioned for Fatal Attraction, she went into the audition knowing she was nobody’s favourite, and her soul “shrank to the size of a walnut”. To secure her role as Mamaw, JD Vance’s grandmother in Hillbilly Elegy, the 2020 adaptation of Vance’s memoir, she wrote the director Ron Howard a letter campaigning for the part. And in one of her earliest stage roles, the 1976 Broadway musical Rex, about Henry VIII, she messed up the audition. “SoI wrote a letter and said I’d like to audition again, and I ended up getting cast as Mary Tudor.”View image in fullscreenAs Mamaw in Hillbilly Elegy (2020).Photograph: Lacey Terrell/NetflixView image in fullscreenAs the titular character in Albert Nobbs (2011).Photograph: Roadside Attractions/Sportsphoto/ AllstarIf one didn’t know better, one might suspect that this ability of Close’s to appeal to directors and casting agents to give her another chance is a highly effective audition shtick. “WhenI auditioned for a play called Albert Nobbs, which I ended up doing the movie of years later, I started auditioning and I just sucked. And I stopped the audition and said, ‘I’m boring myself to tears, so I must be boring you, and I think I’m going to go home.’ And at the end of that day, they called my agent and said, ‘That’s the most interesting thing that happened to us all day.’” She was, she says, “terrible at auditioning” and after that particular flameout hired an acting coach recommended by Kevin Kline. “And said to him I really want this part; and I worked with him, went back and got the part.”On the subject of Hillbilly Elegy, the film and the book are now thoroughly tarnished by association with President Trump’s vice-president. Doesn’t the fact the film animates the origin story of JD Vance besmirch her memory of making it? “No. Not at all. Because I spent time meeting [Mamaw’s] daughter, or a niece, and looked at how she sat, talked, laughed, held her cigarette. What was in her house. I got very specific ideas. I don’t regret that at all. I think a lot of times a woman like that would be looked down on. And I also think I did her justice and I loved her.”Given the amount of time Close spent researching Vance’s extended family in Appalachia, does she have any insight into why that part of the world pivoted so decisively to Trump? “I love reading history, and the great leaders through history were very eloquent people. We have not had … I think Obama was eloquent, but I was less and less aware of a kind of eloquence that you need to bring a people together. And I think you need to be sensitive to what people are dealing with. But you also have to be able to communicate with them. And I think people started to think that nobody cares.”It isn’t the characters of Mamaw or Albert Nobbs, for that matter, that Close is most commonly identified with. Her most enduring role is almost certainly Alex Forrest, the book editor turned stalker who lit up the nightmares of every cheating man in the late 1980s and beyond. At almost 40 years distance, many of us who saw it as teenagers still remember vividly the most gruesome jump scares. And, says Close, “It really holds up. Kids are still watching it. I did some masterclasses in the theatre department of Indiana University, which is a wonderful campus, and before I did it I wanted the kids to see Fatal Attraction. They came in afterwards with their mouths open.”Is the Forrest character, on whom the film heaped scorn in a way that today seems starkly misogynistic, still relevant? “I think it will always be relevant,” she says. “To me she’s a tragic figure.”View image in fullscreenClose with, from left, Sarah Paulson, Teyana Taylor and Kim Kardashian at the world premiere All’s Fair last month.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesWhich brings us, in a roundabout way, to Kim Kardashian. All’s Fair, the new Ryan Murphy drama for Disney+, features a roster of impressive women, including Naomi Watts and Sarah Paulson, and one slightly boggles at the idea of them acting alongside Kim Kardashian in her first major role. I would infer that the quality of the writing may not have been the main incentive for saying yes to this particular job – but it does sound as if it might have been fun. So … how’s Kardashian to work with?“She’s lovely! And very smart. Very, very conscientious with her kids. When we were filming she was going through working towards her law degree, and near the end she would have flashcards. She now has her law degree, and I asked her: are you going to practise?And she said: no, I just want it in my back pocket.”But I mean … she’s not got any acting background at all. “No. But she surrounded herself with really good people.” Close indicates herself and bursts out laughing. If that sounds arrogant, she says, “I swear to God, I’ve seen all nine episodes and it’s pretty fucking good. It is what it is: it’s juicy and outrageous at times and touching.”What is so striking about Close’s current slate of performances is the amazing expanse of energy she is able to summon. I tell her I’m 49 and exhausted most of the time.“Shame on you!!” she hollers. Well, yes. I don’t have your wall system, I say.“You have walls all through your country!” I know, but Hadrian’s Wall doesn’t work as a metaphor for me. Anyway, the question is: how does she do it? “I’m energised when I have to be. I’m very good when I’m working, when I have a schedule imposed upon me. I’m not necessarily that good when I’m at home trying to figure out what to do for the next hour, because I always just want to read a book, and I know I can’t do that.”Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery review – whodunnit threequel is murderously good funRead moreIt seems to me that Close has spent her life pushing through a determination to be happy. But I wonder if she thinks that ability is innate, or a function of sheer force of will? “Good question. I think when I’m with my family I’m very happy. I’ve been unlucky in love, which is sad. It’s not something that I’ve spent a hell of a lot of time thinking about, but I’m happy that my daughter has a mate for life. In fact, none of my generation in my family have been successful [in their relationships], except my brother. We’ve all had multiple marriages. But I think the next generation are much more…I think they’ve found life mates, and that’s fantastic.” She laughs. “But I … don’t mope around.”“GET UP!!” I exclaim, startling us both.“Get up,” hisses Close.Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is in cinemas from 28 November and on Netflix from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsGlenn CloseKnives OutinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Research has suggested it can affect who we date, how well students do at university (those with surnames later in the alphabet were found to receive lower grades), and in China it has been found to impact how likely people are to commit a crime. So how does having an unusual name shape your life? Emma Russell spoke to a Peach (and therapists and economists) to find out.Read more2.When I met Craig he was 13 and homeless.

In this context, AI is offered as a balm not because it addresses root causes of abysmal US public health, but because it allows policymakers and corporations to gloss over them. This faith in AI also reflects a misunderstanding of care itself.”The use of AI is surging dramatically in the US healthcare system but, warned Eric Reinhart, “rather than correcting human fallibility, AI seems more likely to amplify it by training clinicians out of their capacity to listen and think critically, collaboratively and creatively.”Read more5.‘We could be winning or losing – it doesn’t matter as long as we’re together’: the friendships forged on football terracesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fabio De Paola“It started – all the best things do – with a big, messy hug … ”Brought together by fate, and the love of the same football club, great friendships can be forged on the terraces.

Twelve months ago, Ford narrowly failed to clinch a home victory in this same fixture, but he was a pivotal figure on Saturday as his side gained their revenge with a first win over New Zealand in south-west London since 2012.“George is a brilliant player, an outstanding leader and an even better person,” the head coach said after the fly-half contributed 13 points to seal his team’s 10th successive Test win this year. “I know you like to talk about 12 months ago and the ball hitting a post. But when he pulls on the England shirt he is just such a consistent performer.Fantastic Ford steers battling England past All Blacks in Twickenham thrillerRead more“He made brilliant decisions and executed perfectly. I am pleased for him and all the players. They should enjoy themselves tonight and have a good night out.”Ford’s all-round tactical assurance and calm were exemplified by the two first-half drop goals that shifted the momentum of the contest after the All Blacks had taken an early 12-0 lead. “It was always part of the plan,” Ford said. “You want to come away with something when you get to that end of the pitch. Sometimes the drop goal is the way to go … it’s important to get rewards for the work the forwards are doing.”Ford and Borthwick were also heartened by England’s assurance in the final quarter as they pulled away to record a ninth win against New Zealand in the long history of the fixture. Borthwick believes his team have further improvement in them and also highlighted Maro Itoje’s eve-of-game captain’s speech.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje’s motivational speech paid dividends in the buildup to England’s 10th successive victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I heard him address the team this morning,” said Borthwick. “He talked about when the team were 14- or 15-year-old boys, dreaming of playing for England and playing here against teams like New Zealand. He asked the players to go out and play with that intent of a 14 or 15-year-old with a dream. The boys took those dreams on to the pitch today and they were outstanding.“We know [an improved world] ranking helps, but this isn’t about that. This is about trying to achieve special moments and special memories and today is one of them. Hopefully, there’s a load of young future rugby players watching around the country who want to wear the white shirt and get great victories.”Itoje said England had been keen to make a statement even before the game kicked off by standing up to the haka. “As a group of leaders we came up with what you guys saw. We were trying to achieve the same thing they were trying to achieve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is hard to win a grand slam and we definitely know how hard it is now.

Steve Clarke has Belarus to thank for that, their surprise draw in Denmark leavingScotlandin precisely the position they had sought before this clash with Greece. If Scotland beat Denmark in Glasgow on Tuesday, they will top this section.The dust might just have settled on this preposterous fixture by then. Scotland trailed by three at one point before hauling themselves back into proceedings against aGreeceteam who finished with 10 men.Greece 3-2 Scotland: World Cup 2026 qualifier – as it happenedRead moreGreece’s win by the odd goal in five was a merited one but, after a silent wait for full time in Denmark to arrive, the Tartan Army celebrated as 10 added minutes in Copenhagen drew to a close. Clarke and his Scotland players did not seem to know how to act, which was totally understandable. For all the shortcomings laid bare here, the spirit summoned was quite striking. Clarke’s task in the coming days is to combine that with far more assuredness, especially in defence.“A crazy game, crazy night,” said Clarke, who puffed his cheeks out and shook his head before beginning post-match media duties. “We conceded bad goals and scored good goals. I have said it repeatedly about this group, they give everything. They didn’t give up.“I am pleased that the players still have the opportunity to go directly to the World Cup but disappointed we lost the game. It is not a game we should have lost. I have a mix of emotions in my head just now.”By the end of a bizarre first half, Scotland could either have been faced with an insurmountable challenge or been level. The visitors had Craig Gordon, their veteran goalkeeper, to thank for the fact Greece did not add to their solitary goal. Not at that point anyway.View image in fullscreenGreece's Anastasios Bakasetas (right) scores his side's first goal.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAWhen that early counter arrived, John Souttar was left red-faced after misjudging the bounce of a hopeful punt. Vangelis Pavlidis stole in, the striker’s shot expertly saved by Gordon. The ball broke to Tasos Bakasetas, who slammed it low into the bottom left hand corner of the Scotland net. Albeit messy, the goal was appropriate reward for Greece’s spritely start. Scotland looked petrified.Gordon duly saved twice from Christos Tzolis with the first – of a one-handed nature – particularly impressive. Panagiotis Retsos was next to test the Hearts keeper with a close-range header. As Pavlidis failed to connect properly with a Tzolis cross, Scotland were rocking badly.During first-half stoppage time, Clarke’s men woke up. Scott McTominay, hitherto anonymous, smacked the bar from 20 yards. Ché Adams should have scored with a back-post header but fluffed his lines. Ben Gannon-Doak, sent clean through by McTominay, was similarly wasteful with only the Greek goalkeeper to beat.Scotland actually started the second period reasonably well. Ryan Christie capitalised on a defensive mix-up before playing in Adams for what should have been an equaliser. The Torino forward was ponderous, his eventual shot blocked. The lack of proper threat provided by Adams is a regular source of Scotland weakness.Greece heeded the warning. The substitute Andreas Tetteh rampaged down the left flank before cutting back for Konstantinos Karetsas. The golden boy of Greek football lived up to his reputation with a wonderful, curling shot which Gordon could not halt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead it was Tzolis, the most outstanding player on show, who blasted Greece 3-0 in front from 25 yards. Greece were taking out their frustrations from earlier failings in this campaign on a shell-shocked Scotland.View image in fullscreenScotland had hope of a remarkable comeback after John McGinn scored their second goal, with Greece’s earlier three-goal lead reduced to one.Photograph: Louiza Vradi/ReutersWhat happened next was as remarkable as it was unforeseen. Gannon-Doak fired high past Odysseas Vlachodimos when meeting a John McGinn cross. Consolation, surely? Think again, said Scotland. Another cross, this time from the captain, Andy Robertson, found Christie for 3-2. Belarus had now edged 2-1 ahead in Denmark; a previously despondent Scotland support were suddenly in raptures. Scotland had 20 minutes in which to salvage the most stunning of points.McTominay spurned a glorious chance, albeit Vlachodimos saved superbly with his feet. Bakasetas in theory made things easier for the Scots by hauling down Lewis Ferguson for a second booking. Clarke by this point had thrown on Lyndon Dykes and Lawrence Shankland to pep up his attack. When George Hirst replaced Gannon-Doak, three minutes from time, Scotland were playing 4-2-4.A goalmouth scramble from a McGinn cross was as close as Scotland came to notching the sixth goal of the night. Incredibly, defeat barely mattered. Clarke is one game from Scottish sporting immortality. The circumstances that brought him to this point were so utterly, wonderfully bonkers.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersGreeceScotlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The England captain has 23 goals in 17 appearances for Bayern Munich this season, while for his country it is three in four. If he scores against Albania here on Sunday, he would equal Pelé’s record in international football. Kane has 76 goals from 111 caps. The Brazil legend finished with 77 from 92. One more detail: Kane has failed to score in only six matches for club and country this season.It is a time of excitement and possibility. Bayern are laying waste everyone, winning 16 of their 17 games, the only blot coming last Saturday when they drew at Union Berlin;Kane saved them from defeatwith a late equaliser. They are fancied to win the Champions League plus everything in Germany.Thomas Tuchel wants England substitutes to channel anger into World Cup victoryRead moreMost important for Kane, most tantalising, there is the World Cup next summer whenEnglandwill be among the favourites. Their record in qualification has seen to that – seven wins out of seven, with seven clean sheets. The Albania game is the final one. England guaranteed their place at the finals after match number six.It did not feel incongruous to ask Kane about the Ballon d’Or, how he felt about his chances of winning the prestigious individual award. His answer spoke volumes about his mindset.“I could score 100 goals this season, but if I don’t win the Champions League or the World Cup, you’re probably not going to win the Ballon d’Or,” he said. “It’s the same with [Erling] Haaland, it’s the same with any player. You have to be winning those major trophies. We’re in great shape at Bayern Munich so that maybe makes the odds a little bit more in my favour. Same with England.“Hopefully, if things go my way for club and country then I’m definitely going to be in the conversation for a trophy like the Ballon d’Or.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane scored his 75th and 76th goals for England against Latvia in October.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesTeam glory is everything and in terms of England Kane believes the squad is in the right place underThomas Tuchel, having suffered a blip this time last year. It was when Lee Carsley was in caretaker charge and the squad was undermined by withdrawals for the must-win Nations League game against Greece in Athens.Kane worried the culture instilled by Gareth Southgate wasin danger of ebbing away. It is now back to its most robust, nobody wanting to be seen to look for an excuse. Tuchel has spoken about creating a “competition where if a player pulls out of a 50-50 situation, the door will be closed as someone else will take the shirt”.For Tuchel, squad chemistry and the commitment to the collective is fundamental, even more so than team selection and tactics. So it was hard to ignore the example of Marc Guéhi in the week. The Crystal Palace defender had picked up an injury against AZ Alkmaar on the Thursday before last and according to his club manager, Oliver Glasner, could not walk and “if he arrives with crutches for England, they will send him home”.Guéhi reported for duty and was a part of the meetings leading up to Thursday’s2-0 Wembley win over Serbia, if not the training sessions. Only on Friday did he withdraw.View image in fullscreenPelé finished his international career with 77 goals – Harry Kane has scored 76.Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/Alamy“Yes, 100%,” Kane said when asked whether England had the culture to win the World Cup. “It’s better than where we were last year. There was a transition stage with new managers and temporary managers with Lee. So there is maybe room for a little bit of an excuse there. But representing your country is the biggest honour and, when you’re trying to build a culture and a winning mentality, you need the players there as much as possible. Every moment is important.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can see with this camp … Marc had a little injury, but still wanted to be around the group and the meetings and learn from what we’re trying to do. I definitely think the team is in a really good place going into the new year.”It is clear Kane has grown as a vocal leader in the past 18 months or so. He spoke calmly but incisively at Euro 2024 about the criticism from former England players, while his comments about the withdrawals for the Greece game were similarly hard-hitting. It is also evident just how much Tuchel is leaning on Kane to help him with his messaging to the squad.After the team secured their qualification to the World Cup with the5-0 win in Latvialast month, Kane spoke in the dressing room to say that everyone had to show up in November and “keep this thing going”. Tuchel said on Wednesday that it was “basically the headline” for the camp.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said Harry Kane’s comments in October set the tone for November’s England camp.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesWhen Kane speaks, people listen and he was interesting on two others issues – the importance of set pieces and Phil Foden as his understudy in the No 9 role, even if the Manchester City player brings a “false” profile to it, as he did when he came on against Serbia on Thursday.“We want to build a book of set plays … like an NFL playbook where you look at the opposition, see if they are zonal or man-mark and pick what we want to do,” Kane said. “Ultimately, the best team at set plays normally go on to be the best team in the tournament.“With Phil, there has been a lot of talk throughout his England career about where he should play and clarity is the thing he probably needs. The boss has made it pretty clear he sees him as one of the false 9s or as a No 10. Phil looked sharp against Serbia and he just wants to prove a point again.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandHarry KaneWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThomas TuchelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is uncharted territory for the Spaniard, who will compete in the title match of the Association ofTennisProfessionals’ season-ending tournament for the first time.Earlier this week, Alcaraz sealed the year-end No 1 ranking ahead of Sinner by rolling through his round-robin group with a flawless 3-0 record. He will attempt to close out his individual season, by far the best of his career, by winning an incredible ninth title of 2025.No matter how things play out, this is a fitting climax to a year that has been defined by the dominance of the two rivals. Alcaraz and Sinner have split the four grand slam tournaments between them for the second consecutive year, with Sinner winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon while Alcaraz took the French Open and US Open.Either Alcaraz or Sinner has won the last seven tournaments when both players have been present in the draw and they have faced each other in six finals this year. Alcaraz has won seven of their last eight meetings, establishing a 10-5 overall lead, meaning Sinner will be looking to definitively halt Alcaraz’s momentum in the match-up.Sinner continues to perform at such a consistent, high level that has allowed him to rapidly rise up the list of all-time great men’s tennis players. In a season that included a three-month doping ban between February and May, Sinner will attempt to win his sixth ATP title of the year in his 10th final. The 24-year-old has won 30 consecutive indoor hard court matches and 14 matches in a row after his recent triumphs at the Vienna Open and Paris Masters. He has also won 18 consecutive sets at theATP Finals.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz celebrates after beating Félix Auger-Aliassime.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images“Making three times consecutive finals in Turin means a lot to me,” said Sinner. “It’s a great atmosphere, great place for me to play tennis and also a great place for me to close this beautiful season I’ve played in. Tomorrow I will enjoy, I will obviously try my best to get the best possible result but in any case, it has been again an amazing week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their form this week only further illustrated the challenge before him. While the Australian barely survived the group stages, qualifying through tie-break rules despite losing two of his three matches, Sinner eased through his group without dropping a set.For more than an hour, however, De Minaur threw everything he could at the Italian, playing some of his best tennis of the tournament in the process. He forced himself inside the baseline, frequently having to half-volley ground strokes as he tried to maintain his court position. The Australian also served well, saving Sinner’s first seven break points as they reached 5-5, and he used his stupendous defensive skills to make the court seem as narrow as possible to his opponent.His best efforts were far from sufficient. As has been the case every time they have faced each other, Sinner completely overpowered De Minaur with far more potent ground strokes. He also continued his own brilliant serving form during the tournament, emerging from their tight opening set having landed 82% of his first serves. With the first set secured, Sinner opened his shoulders and hit his helpless opponent off the court to reach another final in front of his buoyant home crowd.Explore more on these topicsATP FinalsJannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazTennisAlex de MinaurAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The Welsh performance was miles off of what is expected on these shores. Sloppy attack, squandered opportunities and a 20-minute red card for Josh Adams almost handed the win to Eddie Jones’ team but that won’t be remembered in years to come, what will be is Jarrod Evans’ name.Fantastic Ford steers battling England past All Blacks in Twickenham thrillerRead moreIt was his last-play-of-the-game penalty that won the game for Wales, the first in Steve Tandy’s reign as head coach. The roar that followed has to be up there with one of the loudest this stadium has heard. It was the replacement’s only kick at goal of the game and he had nerves of steel to seal the victory.Jones had said he wanted his team to make the pressure Wales are under feel like a “burden”, and for a large portion of the game they did that with brave attack. But a few tries went begging for them too, as well as a few penalty kick misses.There were four cards in the game – Adams’ red and three yellow cards for Japan. Jones, who joked the last-minute loss made him want to “kill someone”, added he thought all of those decisions were “farcical”. “I think we are absolutely ruining the game of rugby,” Jones said. “I don’t think any of the actions were intentional, I don’t think they deserved to be sin-binned. Any of them. I think we have to have a more sensible approach to the game.“There is going to be contact with the head, unless it is reckless which I didn’t see any of those actions being. A penalty is fair enough … The game of rugby is about having 15 players on the field and I think World Rugby should be looking at this very closely.”Quick GuideWales v Japan teams and scorersShowWalesMurray; Rees-Zammit, Llewellyn, B Thomas, Adams (Tompkins 60); Edwards (Evans 79), T Williams; Smith (Carre 48), Lake (Belcher 77), Griffin (Assiratti 48), D Jenkins (F Thomas 79), Beard, Wainwright (Plumtree 48), Mann, Cracknell.Red cardAdams (40).TriesEdwards, Rees-Zammit, Tompkins.ConsEdwards 3.PenEvans.JapanYazaki; Ishida (Ueda 78), Riley, Lawrence, Osadal; Lee (Komura 77), Saito; Kobayashi (Furuhata 77), Sato, Tamefusa (Takeuchi 49), Uluiviti (Hockings 49), Dearns (capt), Cornelsen, Shimokawa (Paul 69), Makisi.Sin-bin:Uluiviti (25), Makisi (29), Hockings (80).TriesIshida, Makisi.ConsLee 2.PensLee 3.RefereeMatthew Carley (Eng).Attendance61,324.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was a must-win for Wales as if they had lost they would have been leapfrogged by the visitors in the world rankings. That would have given Wales a stiffer task at the Rugby World Cup draw, on 3 December, as they would have dropped to 13th, meaning they would be in a group with two of the top 12 in Australia. So this game was a must-win but they had to do it without their captain, Jac Morgan, who was ruled out with a dislocated shoulder.The home side were bolstered by Louis Rees-Zammit, who made his first start and scored his first international try since returning to rugby from trying to make his name in the NFL. The hope of Wales finally winning at home was palpable before kick-off, with the atmosphere absolutely electric. The lights went down but a red undertone remained, with a pyrotechnics show making the Principality Stadium feel like a cauldron.Quick GuideRoundup: Ireland demolish Australia, South Africa sink Italy despite redShowMack Hansen claimed a first-half hat-trick to setIrelandon course for a record 46-19 win over his nativeAustraliain Dublin. The Canberra-born Hansen, who started at full-back for the first time at Test level, celebrated his return from a foot injury by crossing three times in the opening 28 minutes to delight a capacity Aviva Stadium crowd. Second-half scores from Caelan Doris, Ryan Baird and Robbie Henshaw ensured head coach Andy Farrell again came out on top against the former Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt.Australia trailed by just five points at the break following converted tries from Len Ikitau and Fraser McReight and claimed a late consolation through Billy Pollard. But Ireland were deserved winners ahead of completing their autumn campaign at home to South Africa, the world champions, next weekend. The fly-half Sam Prendergast kicked seven points, including a drop goal, for the dominant hosts, before his replacement Jack Crowley slotted a further nine.South Africashrugged off a red card for the second successive match to power to a 32-14 win over anItalyside that threw away a golden opportunity to earn a rare win over the Springboks in Turin on Saturday.Franco Mostert was shown a red card after 11 minutes but Italy failed to make their extra man count, with Paolo Garbisi guilty of missing kickable penalties.Tries from Marco van Staden, Morné van den Berg, Grant Williams and Ethan Hooker earned South Africa a comfortable win after they withstood enormous early pressure from Italy, who scored one second-half try through Ange Capuozzo.Guardian sport and PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A cacophony of noise flooded the stadium as Dan Edwards darted over but thanks to the skill of Japan’s Faulua Makisi it was the visitors next putting pressure on. The No 8 was instrumental in two dangerous attacks which led to a try by Kippei Ishida. Japan were the better side in the first half but things took a turn as they were handed two yellow cards for Epineri Uluiviti and Makisi. But despite being depleted, Japan did not concede and Wales had their own card to deal with as Adams’ illegal clear-out was upgraded to a red card after a bunker review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I could see the crowd, I could see Jarrod going to take the kick but I couldn’t see the posts. But then you just hear the eruption from the support. Fair play to Jarrod, that kick is some kick under pressure.”Wales are back to winning ways at home and will look to bring more victories to the Principality Stadium. But with two huge challenges coming against New Zealand and South Africa, and their only wins in their last 21 Tests coming against Japan, it is likely to be 2026 before fans see Wales win again.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesWales rugby union teamJapan rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

He died a couple of years ago and it would have been great to have won a race like that for him.“But this horse is just very, very tough and she’s a great advertisement for our whole team, the vets, physios, the staff who look after them on a day-to-day basis, because she’s been a fragile horse.”Skelton is quoted at 2-5 for a first title by Paddy Power, with Mullins (7-4) the only other runner at single-figure odds, and the most positive news for Skelton’s backers is that he feels his string is only now hitting peak form.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday's tipsShowFontwell:12.27 Atreides 12.57 Just Forty 1.32 Galactic Charm 2.05 Shantou Lucky 2.42 One Island 3.17 Ballyfinn 3.52 Atlantic PowerCheltenham:1.15 Gaelic Pride 1.45 Jordans Cross (nb) 2.20 Glengouly (nap) 2.55 Tanganyika 3.30 Alexei 4.00 Bud FoxWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s weird how it happens,” Skelton said. “I said to [my wife] Grace, I think in the middle of last week or the week before: ‘I just feel like they’re about to turn.’ I didn’t know when it was going to happen or why it was going to happen, but it just felt like the bubbles were getting to the surface. I can’t tell you why it happens, but it did.”Both of the feature events on day two of the November meeting were won by mares, as Henry de Bromhead’s July Flower, the 6-5 favourite, beat Skelton’s Be Aware by a length and a half in the Grade Two Arkle Trial Novice Chase.The win inevitably evoked memories of another mare from the same stable, Put The Kettle On, who took the same race in 2019 and went on to win the Arkle Trophy itself at the festival the following March and then the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2021.“We’ll take it one step at a time but what I can tell you is they are so much the opposite,” De Bromhead said. “This one is the sweetest mare you’ll ever come across while all Put The Kettle On wanted to do was eat you alive. They are so different, but both have so much ability.”The trainer also paid tribute to the winning jockey, Darragh O’Keeffe, who has taken over as the stable’s No 1 after the retirement of Rachael Blackmore at the end of last season. “He has all the attributes Rachael had,” De Bromhead said. “The hunger, the want, the natural ability. He knows how hard he has to work and just really wants it. We are so lucky to have had him step into her shoes.”Explore more on these topicsCheltenhamHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a statement 3-0 victory for Andrée Jeglertz’s side thanks to goals from Rebecca Knaak, Bunny Shaw and Lauren Hemp. It was one that truly announced their title credentials as they consolidated their place at the top.Manchester City v Manchester United: Women’s Super League – liveRead moreIn contrast, it was a result that signalled back-to-back WSL defeats for Marc Skinner’s side for the first time since May 2024, leaving them seven points off the league leaders. Their ability to juggle domestic and European football with a thin squad has been hotly discussed and it always felt like this was the week that would truly test this capability. Unfortunately for the visitors, they looked fatigued, the historic win against PSG clearly having taken a toll.The United manager was not ready to give up their title challenge but admitted that they needed to strengthen.“We deserved it. We gave City those goals,” he told BBC Sport. “It wasn’t like they dominated us; that’s the scary thing.”“We’ll see at the end of the season,” he continued. “I still think you can catch them. I don’t see anything exceptional with them … What we need to do is use the winter window to recruit the people we need to help to support this team.”Skinner had freshened things up with a handful of changes. Ella Toone, Elisabeth Terland, Dominique Janssen and Leah Galton all added energy, although the dropping of the in-form Melvine Malard to the bench raised a few eyebrows.Manchester City, in contrast, have no such scheduling worries. Jeglertz made one change with Lauren Hemp making her first start since recovering from injury.The storm clouds started to gather for United from the start. This was a show of strength from City whose dynamic attack played with and pulled the visitors apart with a sublime first half performance in which they scored three in 21 minutes. This was no mean feat against the second-meanest defence in the WSL, one that had conceded just six this campaign.View image in fullscreenBunny Shaw scores Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesThe warning signs came early when Vivianne Miedema used her strength to bundle Julia Zigiotti Olme off the ball, only to drag her shot wide. Hemp was at the heart of it, exploiting the space left by Jayde Riviere down United’s right Her deliveries were consistently dangerous and led to an opportunity for Yui Hasegawa that Anna Sandberg scrambled off the line.United had several forays forwards, their direct style giving them options but they could not trouble Ayaka Yamashita. City, meanwhile, were strong in possession, teasing their opposition and trying to pull them out of their structure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A delivery to the back post was headed across goal by Shaw for Knaak to nod home. It was City’s seventh headed goal of the campaign.They extended their advantage just before the break. When Jade Rose was allowed to maraud through the middle, the pitch opened up. Kerstin Casparij picked the ball up on the right before delivering a pinpoint low cross for Shaw to bundle home. Four minutes later, they had a third after a swift turnover in possession afforded Hemp the space to drive home from distance.Malard entered the fray in the second half but it was too late to change the course of the game. Former Manchester City player Jess Park came closest, hitting the post, but the visitors were creatively abject and failed to register a single shot on target.The hosts, meanwhile, could have extended their lead when a delightful Miedema long ball sent Shaw away only for her to fluff her lines but it mattered little.

They’re a middle-class couple calledJoe and Eileen Baileyand they live on Long Island. At one point the imaginary couple, who feature inSchumer’s 2007 book, Positively American, were called the O’Reillys. According to the Hill, one Schumer aide said the name then was changed because the publisher thought O’Reilly was “too ethnic” for mass consumption. Another aide said that claim was false, and Schumer just wanted a name that “sounded more national”. Naming strategy aside, the key point here is that Schumer has said he runs all his policy decisions by this completely fictional couple. He’s referred to themhundreds of timesthroughout his political career.With that in mind, you can probably thank the Baileys for the latest Democratic disaster. The US government has just emerged from the longestshutdown in history. About 700,000 federal employees workedwithout pay, desperately needed food benefitswere disrupted,court caseswere delayed, national parks closed and flights gotcancelled.All this pain was supposed to be in service of a very specific gain. Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown because they wanted to take a stand on healthcare. The24 million peoplewho get their health coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces (commonly known as Obamacare) are going to see their premiumsmore than doubleafter an enhanced tax credit expires at the end of the year. The Democrats want to extend the credits; the Republicans have refused to commit to avote on the issue.You can certainly argue that shutting down the government to force a vote on Obamacare subsidies was the right thing to do. But it is very hard to find any strategic sense in putting Americans through a world of pain for 43 days only to shrug your shoulders and give up. Particularly as Schumer himself said the subsidies were a “life or death” issue and there was “no fucking way” the Democrats would cave on it.But cave they did – and just as it looked like their strategy was paying off. An NBC pollreleased on 2 Novemberfound that voters said Trump and Republicans in Congress were more to blame for the ongoing government shutdown than the Democrats. You could argue that people were starting to turn on Republicans and their hand would be forced. But the Democrats once again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Seven Senate Democrats andone Democratic-aligned independentbroke with the party last weekend to vote for a bill that would reopen the government. Those expiring tax credits that Schumer said were a “life or death” issuewere left unresolved.Schumer, to be clear, voted no on the bill. But he’s the Democratic leader, he’s supposed to keep his party in line; the buck stops with Chuck. Nowat least ninefurious Democrats are calling for 74-year-old Schumer, who is clearly not being advised well by his imaginary friends, to step aside. Axiosnotesthat “this represents Democrats’ largest groundswell against one of their leaders since last year’s effort to push then President Biden off the presidential ticket”.Among the lawmakers demanding Schumer step aside is Ro Khanna, a California representative who has been outspoken about how the Democratic party has forgotten how to fight and needs “a total makeover”. Khanna, who co-chaired the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign and isexpectedto be a 2028 presidential candidate, has noted that Schumer has lost touch with the zeitgeist on multiple levels. Schumerrefusedto endorse Zohran Mamdani, for example. And the top Senate Democrat, who told the New York Timesin Marchthat his “job is to keep the left pro-Israel”, does not seem to understand why so manyyoung Democratsare aghast at Israel’songoinggenocide in Gaza.“Senator Schumer caved on protecting people from losing their health insurance,” Khanna told me in a statement. “There are 20 million people in this country who are about to see huge premium hikes and we got no concession. We need Medicare for All and we need a politics of morality and truth-telling. That includes a moral voice on Gaza and stopping bombs to Netanyahu. His time is up.”Unfortunately, US politicians are not very good at voluntarily ceding power with dignity.EightDemocratic members of Congress have died in office since November 2022. And last month Eleanor Holmes Norton, an 88-year-old Democratic congresswoman representing Washington DC, was described in a police report as experiencing “early stages of dementia” after being scammed in her home (her office told NBC Washington “the medical diagnosis included in the police report was based on an assumption the reporting officer was unqualified to make”). Nevertheless, the calls for Schumer to step aside are getting louder, and harder to ignore. The 74-year-old can gracefully step aside now or he can wait be humiliated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who manybelieve will challengeSchumer for his Senate seat in 2028.Whatever Schumer does, I suggest he stop his conversations with the Baileys stat. We don’t need you talking to your imaginary friends, Chuck. We need you listening to the concerns of real people.Record numbers of young women want to leave the USForty per cent of women aged 15 to 44 say they would move abroad forever if they could, according to asurvey from Gallup. That’s four times higher than the 10% who wanted to leave in 2014 and more than double the number of young men (19%) who want to leave the US right now.

So why is no one watching her films?Sat 15 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 06.11 ESTShareIwas on a walk around my local area in London when I was stopped in my tracks by a young man sauntering past me, wearing stone-wash jeans, a pair of shades and a “Reagan-Bush ’84” T-shirt. He gave off an incredibly smug air but, to be fair, he did look good. It’s a nice T-shirt, not like those garish Reform-branded football kits, so I could see why it might be appealing. A quick search informed me that for gen-Z rightwingers in the US, it has become the “conservative takeon a band shirt or the once-ubiquitous Che Guevara tee”.That casual display of conservative aesthetics reminded me of something else too: a much discussedcover of New York magazinefrom earlier this year, after Trump 2.0’s inauguration, which showed young rightwingers celebrating as they “contemplate cultural domination”.“Conservatism – as a cultural force, not just a political condition – is back in a real way for the first time since the 1980s,” the journalist Brock Colyar wrote. Perhaps, given the way the British and American cultural spheres seem more enmeshed than ever, it was only a matter of time before I happened upon a Republican T-shirt in my back yard.View image in fullscreenCover of New York magazine from January this year.Illustration: Mark Peterson/Redux for New York MagazineThe US right has long had designs on controlling culture – frustrated by the idea that, despite many political successes, the arts remain in the grip of a liberal-left orthodoxy. (It’s neatly echoed in Britain by debates about BBC “wokeness”.) If there is anything members of the Maga movement want more than their guys in office, it is to feel that their worldview is reflected back to them whenever they turn on a screen or head into a gallery. That is what lies behind Donald Trump’s attacks on the Smithsonian museum, which he seeks to purge of “improper ideology”, and his threatened imposition of100% tariffson non-US-made films.But as we draw to the close of the year, what has come to pass from this prediction of a conservative seizure of culture? There were early claims of victory. In the Atlantic, after the latest season of The White Lotus came out, the commentator Helen Lewis wrote that it was “the first great work of artin the post-woke era”. The critic Kevin Maher in the Times proclaimed simply that “woke is dead” and that “middle-aged white men” are back in – he cited the return of Mel Gibson, who has been repeatedly accused of bigotry, and his forthcoming follow-up to The Passion of the Christ.What caused the biggest stir, however, was the trajectory ofSydney Sweeney, the breakout Euphoria actor who fronted an advertising campaign by American Eagle that played with the idea of her having “great jeans/genes”. Some critics saw the advert as flirting with white supremacist eugenics. Meanwhile, Sweeney, who was reported to haveregistered as a Republicanvoter in Florida a few months before Trump’s election, has been hailed as representing a return to more “traditional”, white-centric beauty standards in the culture.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump and ICE, is due to perform at Super Bowl 2026.Photograph: Alexander Tamargo/WireImageEarlier this month, when addressing the controversy in aninterview for GQ, the journalist Katherine Stoeffel said the criticism centred around the idea that “in this political climate, white people shouldn’t joke about genetic superiority”, offering Sweeney the opportunity to clarify. With startlingly empty eyes, Sweeney answered: “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.” For this, rightwing zealots see her as leading the great unwokening of Hollywood: stars, rejoice! You need no longer kowtow to cancel culture. Perhaps she simply thinks the furore is silly and doesn’t want to entertain it. But presented with the chance to distance herself from such a divisive narrative that’s been projected on her, why would she not?If there is a great popular desire for fewer woke cultural figures, the verdict is still decidedly out: Sweeney’s latest film, Christy, in which she portrays the boxer Christy Martin, has recorded one of theworst opening weekendsin box-office history. (It follows on from her box-office bombs of Eden and Americana, which opened in the US this year.) A few flops don’t tell us everything. But as Sweeney is perhaps the most talked about star of the year, it raises a question: the right may be determined to disrupt Hollywood and the arts, but does it actually care enough about it to consistently show up? Buying a political T-shirt is an easy commitment; having to sit through a two-hour biopic to prop up the conservative-leaning lead star, less so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ask the striking workers at the British Library | Zadie SmithRead moreWhatever electoral successes, and no matter how much it attempts to reorder institutions, the right will not enjoy cultural domination because you cannot so easily manufacture popularity. It may cry out for the Super Bowl half-time show to feature a Nashville-approved conservative singer, but it will have to get on Duolingo in time to understand record-breakerBad Bunny’s 2026 performance, in which he’ll most likely cuss out Trump and ICE entirely in Spanish.Contemporary conservatism has failed to become cool because its instincts are more about edgy provocation than any serious appreciation of art and culture.Great art will always be about expanding our worlds, not making them smaller. Even Kelsey Grammer, arguably Hollywood’s most prominent conservative, knows this: despite being an open Trump supporter, he has affirmed his decades-longcommitment to diversity, which includes executive-producing the 2000s sitcom Girlfriends, about four Black women in Los Angeles.Those predictions about a post-woke Hollywood also look laughable considering some of the great woke film successes of the year: takeSinners, an African-American horror film scored with southern Black music, orOne Battle After Another, about an ex-revolutionary and his mixed-race daughter fighting against explicitly racist US state authorities. Both have garnered critical success (the former doing very well at the box office) and have Oscars buzz. The young mixed-race actor Chase Infiniti looks in much better stead than Sweeney.In the end, people will queue up for what they want to watch and listen to. When most people ask for culture recommendations, they don’t ask “Is it diverse?” or “Is it conservative?”, they ask, “Is it any good?” So perhaps Sweeney should spend more time letting us know why her films are worth watching rather than what colour her eyes are.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

Last year, Universal Music Group (UMG), alongside labels including Warner Records and Sony Music Entertainmentsued two AI music startupsfor allegedly using their recordings to train text-to-music models without permission.But last month,UMG announced a dealwith one of the defendants, Udio, to create an AI music platform. Their jointpress releaseoffered assurances that the label will commit to “do what’s right by [UMG’s] artists”. However, one advocacy group, the Music Artists Coalition,responded with the statement: “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership’, but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps.”The lawsuit is one of dozens across US courts. As artists, publishers and studios argue that the use of their material in AI training is copyright infringement, judges are struggling to reconcile copyright law with a technology that undermines the very concept of authorship. For many, this is as much a legal question as it is one of justice. InAndersen v Stability AI, one of the first class-action lawsuits over an AI image generator, artists allege that the use of their artwork to train AI models without credit, compensation or consent “violat[es] the rights of millions of artists”.That creative workers bear the brunt of the AI boom is not in question – generative AI isalreadydisplacing creative labour. In January 2024,more than a third of illustratorswho responded to a Society of Authors survey said they had lost income due to AI, and one study projects a21% revenue lossfor audiovisual creators by 2028.In response, a new wave of activism has united entertainment executives and artists to take on the tech industry withsocial media campaigns, crowdfundedlobbying, and lawsuits. TheHuman Artistry Campaign, an industry-artist coalition founded on the principle that “AI can never replace human expression and artistry”, rallies creatives and executives to jointly endorse legislation protecting artists from AI and big tech. But some artists, creators and civil liberties groups warn of another danger: big content.What might the consequences be of well-intentioned working creatives taking the side of large media conglomerates that have longexploited their labourandaggressively expandedcopyrightagainst public interest? While some artists insist that an “enemy of my enemy” approach strategically justifies joining big content’s side, this won’t work if big content and big tech seem to be going from “enemies-to-lovers”.Dave Hansen, copyright lawyer and executive director of the non-profit Authors Alliance, argues that copyright lawsuitswon’t protect artists against AI. Instead, they’ll lead to exclusive licensing deals between large media and tech companies while “everybody else gets sort of left out in the cold”. History supports the cynics. When the tech and entertainment industries negotiated licensing during the rise of streaming,labelsandstudiospocketed the profits and left musicians, writers and actors behind. Will AI licensing deals be any different? When the AI company Runway and Lionsgatestruck a licensing deal, the CEO of United Talent Agency, Jeremy Zimmer, said: “If I’m an artist and I’ve made a Lionsgate movie, now suddenly that Lionsgate movie is going to be used to help build out an LLM for an AI company, am I going to be compensated for that?” In some multimillion dollar deals between publishers and AI companies, authors weregiven neither compensationnor thechoice to opt-outof datasets.Even if US courts rule that tech companies must pay for AI training data, working artists are unlikely to benefit. Creating a licensing regime under the current imbalance of power could embolden media companies to pressure artists into signing away their training rights as a condition of employment. Voice actors havealready been askedto sign such contracts. Nor would mandatory licensing rein in big tech. Companies such as Google and OpenAI can afford to pay the cost of licensing this data; smaller, open-source AI developers cannot. Ironically, the quest to take down big tech through copyright is further consolidating power in its hands.Too many of the solutions proposed in the name of “protecting artists” would not only fail to do so, but potentially hurt artists and the public at large. In the US, the proposed NO FAKES Act, supported by major entertainment coalitions, would create a federal “digital replication right” to regulate deepfakes: nonconsensual AI replicas of a person’s voice or likeness. However, civil liberties groups, including the Center for Democracy and Technology and the American Civil Liberties Union,have criticised the bill’s vague language, weak protections for free speech and potential for abuse. The NO FAKES Act would allow individuals – includingchildren– to license and transfer their digital replica rights for up to 10 years (five for children). It’s easy to imagine studio executives salivating over the prospect of pressuring young artists into signing away control of their own faces and voices.Why do these solutions fall so short? Because many of these copyright lawsuits, licensing solutions and digital replica rights are Trojan horses, inside of which sits big content. TheCopyright Alliance, an influential non-profit advocating for the interests of the “copyright community”, argues for strong copyright solutions to generative AI. While it claims to “advocate for individual creators”, its board of directors is stacked with industry executives from media giants such as Paramount, NBC Universal, Disney and Warner Bros.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because big content needs artists. Its media empires need artists’ labour to profit, its lobbying needs artist support to seem legitimate and its new AI business partners need artists’ art.This fact points to a strategy that entertainment executives fear far more than AI, one that would empower artists to challenge the status quo across big content and big tech: organised labour. Unionised creative workers, such as those in the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, have securedmeaningfulprotectionsagainst AI through strikes and collective bargaining. Copyright is a tool too antiquated, too static and too indelicate to bear the task of deciding the future of an already precarious creative labour force. If big content truly cared about protecting artists from AI, it would stop trying to sell their voices as training data and start listening to them.Alexander Avila is a video essayist, writer and researcherExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionUniversal MusiccommentShareReuse this content"

I had to realise that’s not always how it works, in science or in lifeSat 15 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 10.44 ESTShareIf the words “force equals mass times acceleration” are mildly triggering, I apologise. Newton’ssecond law of motionwill be familiar to anyone who’s ever studied physics. For some who struggled with that course, it may bring back painful memories. But for me, as an awkward teenager, it was oddly comforting – proof of an ordered, structured universe where cause always led to predictable effect. I carried that belief into university, where I studied physics, and even into my career. If I just worked hard enough, success would be mine.But nine months into my first job, I got made redundant. It turns out that life doesn’t always obey Newton’s laws.Losing your job is tough for anyone. But for me, it was devastating. I had worked so hard, yet somehow I had still failed. It felt like a violation of everything I thought I knew about how the world worked. And on top of this, I was completely burned out after months of manic work.My employer was not a company run by sadists who delighted in playing with the hopes of naive young graduates. There was a broader context to this layoff. And once I had passed through the shock and numbness, I could begin to see it. It was the summer of 2001, and all was not well with the world. The dotcombubble burstinghad sent financial shock waves around the globe, forcing my company – a management consultancy – to cut jobs.And the crisis itself wasn’t even unique. Similar things happened during the2008 sub-prime mortgagecrash. In 2011, there was the eurozone crisis. In 2013, the rupee crashed. In 2015, turbulence on the Chinese stock market.No one saw any of these crises coming – or at least not precisely. And in almost every case, they weren’t triggered by some enormous, dramatic event but by small, seemingly innocuous failures that snowballed into something far larger.UK 18- to 24-year-olds: we would like to hear your experiences of trying to find a jobRead moreAnd this is where ideas from physics come in again. While Newton’s second law of motion proved an imperfect way for me to analyse the world, there are other ideas from my studies that have helped me understand these crises, and our place within them. All the above events are examples of chaotic systems – ones that, in theory, can be explained by cause and effect, but in practice are so sensitive to conditions that tiny variations can spiral into radically different outcomes.Take the “three-body problem”, made famous by the Liu Cixin novel and the recent Netflix adaptation. If you have two planets orbiting each other, you can predict their paths for ever. But add athirdplanet, and suddenly the forces interacting between the three bodies become so complex that the mathematics explodes into unpredictability. The system is still governed by clear laws, but an infinitesimally small shift can throw the whole system off balance.This idea doesn’t just apply to things as big as the financial system or astrophysics; we can see such complexity and unpredictability in our own lives. For many, the response is control: we optimise our schedules, work harder, operate at maximum capacity. I know I certainly did. I assumed the way to get ahead was to work as hard as humanly possible. But physics teaches us that, for systems susceptible to chaotic forces, this actually makes us more fragile, not less.Think of a power grid. Most of the time, it hums along without problem. But during an unexpected surge – for example, when millions of air-conditioners are switched on at once during a heatwave – the system can overload and shut down. To prevent this, engineers design grids with slack in the system: surge capacity to absorb unexpected spikes. A grid that operates at 80% survives a sudden spike in demand; one at 100% causes blackouts.As a young graduate, I had been living without any surge capacity, at the limit of my abilities. And that’s perhaps why losing my job was so painful. But the truth is, most of us do the same. We convince ourselves that if we just push harder, we’ll be fine. But the more we operate at our limits, the more vulnerable we become.Arecent reportfrom Mental Health UK revealed that 91% of UK adults have experienced high or extreme stress in the past year, with young people feeling it most acutely. Meanwhile, nearly half of young workers regularlywork unpaid overtime. Among all UK desk workers, 84%feel pressuredto work overtime regularly and 65% have to work at weekends to get their job done. We’re a nation of power grids running at 100%, wondering why we’re burning out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can heat water gradually and nothing seems to change – until you reach a critical threshold, boiling point. And suddenly the whole system transforms –undergoing what’s known as a phase transition – from liquid to gas. People can absorb strain for a while, operating at maximum capacity, appearing fine. But stress doesn’t accumulate linearly. It builds until a critical point, and then the system flips. That’s why burnout often feels sudden, even though the pressure has been building for months or years.Over the years, I’ve learned techniques to build my personal surge capacity. I try to always leave enough slack in my day for the unexpected. And I’ve learned that recovery isn’t a luxury, it’s essential.But we’ve built an economy that celebrates overwork and treats burnout as personal failure rather than as a design flaw. The recentKeep Britain Working reviewrevealed an alarming increase in people dropping out of the workforce due to mental health conditions. Could it be that the overwhelming nature of work itself – the expectation to operate at 100% capacity with zero surge capacity – is what’s making people unable to work at all?Until we recognise that resilience requires inefficiency – that robust systems must have slack – we’re just optimising our way towards collapse. Newton’s second law still holds. I just wish someone had told me that it’s not just about how much force you apply, but knowing when to ease off.Zahaan Bharmal is the author ofThe Art of Physicsand a senior director at Google, writing in a personal capacityExplore more on these topicsMental healthOpinionWork & careersHealth & wellbeingHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a lost generation and if we don’t do something now the consequences economically, societally and personally will be devastating,” he said.Blunkett, a leading figure in Tony Blair’s New Labour government, urged Starmer to consider launching a revamped version of the 1990sNew Deal for young peoplelaunched early in Blair’s first term in office.“If we could go back and learn from it, and apply it to the modern era – where obviously there’s a great deal more challenge – that would be good.”Youth unemployment has increased from 14.8% a year ago to 15.3%, the highest level outside the Covid pandemic since 2015, and more than three times the headline jobless rate for people over the age of 16. Long-term youth joblessness is also at a decade high.While under-25s account for roughly a tenth of the overall UK workforce, the Guardian’s analysis ofHMRC jobs datapublished this week shows younger adults have borne the brunt of job losses in the past year.The figures released by theOffice for National Statisticsshow the number of employees under the age of 25 on company payrolls in November was down by 77,000 from the level in June 2024, before Starmer’s election landslide. Most of the decline was fuelled by a drop in employees under the age of 18.The latest monthly figures show a recovery in November from October of about 37,000 under-25s on company payrolls, but the total in work is still down from June last year.Labour has been blamed for fuelling Britain’s jobs market slowdown after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, targeted employers with a£25bn increase in their national insurance contributionsin last year’s budget.Seized on by the government’s critics, theBank of Englandhas warned the tax increase has sapped hiring mostly among employers in hospitality and retail – typically where young people find a first step into the world of work.“Any lost generation is on the chancellor,” said Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor. “You don’t get more young people into work by punishing the very businesses that hire them.”Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, called on Reeves to reverse the tax rise at the 26 November budget. “The youth jobs crisis is a ticking timebomb but some obvious solutions are staring the chancellor in the face,” she said.It comes as ministers brace for an update on Thursday, which risks showing the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) has climbed above 1 million for the first time in a decade.Amid mounting concern at the heart of government, Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, this week appointed Alan Milburn, the former Blair-era health secretary, to lead anindependent reviewinto rising youth worklessness.Reeves is expected to announce funding in this month’s budget for a “youth guarantee” to offerguaranteed paid workto every eligible young person who has been on universal credit for 18 months without earning or learning.The chancellor pledged in her party conference speech in Liverpool earlier this autumn that Labour would aim for “the abolition of long-term youth unemployment”. However, official figures this week show the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months has surged to 137,000, the highest level in a decade.Ben Harrison, the director of the Work Foundation thinktank, said the government needed to expand its plan to support more young adults between the ages of 18 and 24.“If you want to see a tangible difference made in time for the next election, more investment and support is needed,” he said.A government spokesperson said Milburn’s review would help to tackle the key barriers behind rising youth unemployment. “It is unacceptable that 1 million young people are not in education, employment or training,” the spokesperson said.“We are delivering opportunities to young people across the country, from the expansion of Youth Hubs to our Youth Guarantee to ensure the chance to earn or learn is available to all.”Explore more on these topicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsUnemploymentYoung peopleWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

Thepay settlement he reached with resident doctorslast year avoided a winter plagued by NHS strikesBut it also criticises significant aspects of his performance, including the way he handled theabolition of NHS Englandand his lack of action to stem the exodus of senior GPs.The findings threaten to puncture Streeting’s reputation after a turbulent week during which he wasforced to deny accusationsfrom allies of Keir Starmer that he was lining up a leadership challenge against the prime minister.Wes Streeting’s gamble with the NHS is greater than any play for Downing Street | Gaby HinsliffRead moreStuart Hoddinott, the IfG’s associate director and the author of the report, said: “There have been some positive steps: performance is trending slowly upwards in hospitals, there’s been a genuinely large increase in GPs and the rate at which hospital staff are leaving their jobs is the lowest on record outside the pandemic.“But that has been undermined by a chaotic and incoherent approach to reforming the service. The announcement ofNHSEngland’s abolition was abysmally handled and management cuts in integrated care boards have been a needless distraction.”He added: “Worse than that, nothing the government has done will address the ongoing exodus of GP partners, and it has taken decisions that may actively harm the adult social care sector.“The further decay of general practice and social care would be a disastrous legacy for Streeting and the government.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said:“While the report acknowledges our success in delivering record numbers of GPs and appointments, it ignores our work to reform primary care and shift care out of hospitals, including £1.1bn extra investment, and the creation of new neighbourhood contracts to deliver a truly neighbourhood health service in every part of the country.“Far from diverting money to hospitals as the IfG claims, integrated healthcare organisations will ensure funds are diverted towards prevention and community care to keep people out of them.“We are succeeding in our efficiency drive, with our move to bring NHS England back into the department freeing up more than £1bn a year that will be reinvested into frontline services, and a recent report showed we are exceeding our targets in improving NHS productivity.“We reject the notion we should go slower or do less, with our reforms and modernisation to date already delivering millions more appointments, cutting waiting lists and ensuring patients can benefit from the latest treatments and technology.”Government officials believe their political success hinges on whether they can improve NHS performance, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has made it one of the top three priorities in this month’s budget.As Streeting is widely tipped as the person most likely to replace the prime minister should he leave before the next election, he is facing even closer scrutiny over his performance at the health department.Despite Streeting’s promises of sweeping reforms to the way the health service is run, the report finds that in many areas performance has stagnated in the past year, and in some cases even declined.It criticises the health secretary’s decision to abolish NHS England as a rushed, poorly explained distraction, calling it “a case study in how not to make complex policy decisions and announcements”.Streeting hasin recent daysbeen rebuffed by the Treasury in his demand for over £1bn to cover redundancy costs stemming from that abolition.The report also accuses the health secretary of pulling the NHS in contradictory directions, for example, by saying he wants to shift more care into the community but then proposing new “integrated health organisations”, which could end up allocating more money to hospitals.The report adds that Streeting has provided very little detail on how his plans would be implemented, beyond relying on emerging technology such as voice-capture tools to take notes for GPs.The NHS is still struggling to improve productivity, the report finds, with fewer than 10% of areas managing to raise the number of elective procedures they carry out by any more than the number of extra staff they hire.As a result, it warns: “The government will struggle to meet its flagship target that 92% of patients should wait no longer than 18 weeks from referral to starting consultant-led treatment of non-urgent health conditions. And it has little chance of meeting national waiting time targets for A&E and cancer treatment.”Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingNHSLabournewsShareReuse this content"

This time by the President of the United States.”Greene did not specify any threats against her that had been received by security firms, but said that “as a woman I take threats from men seriously. I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims ofJeffrey Epsteinand his cabal, must feel.”Greene also said that as a Republican who votes “overwhelmingly” in favor of party legislation, “his aggression against me also fuels the venomous nature of his radical internet trolls (many of whom are paid), this is completely shocking to everyone” .The accusation echoes claims made by Trump and administration officials that Democrats have used “paid actors” at protests.In a later post on X, Greene posted a chart of rising average grocery bills, calling it “the ultimate warning to all of my Republican colleagues” and equating cost-of-living pressures to a vote in Congress over the release of further Epstein files next week.“You vote NO on Tuesday to release the Epstein files and face severe outrage from America,” she warned. “Republicans don’t have support from women and this right here is a perfect example of why.”The post is the latest in an increasingly bitter war of words with Trump, primarily over the release of government-held documents relating toJeffrey Epstein, which Greene supports. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, is expected to hold a vote next week to decide whether to release the entirety of unclassified communications and documents.What’s happening with Marjorie Taylor Greene? Why the Maga loyalist has won some Democratic fansRead more“Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!” Trump fumed on social media, a day after ending his support for Greene, calling her “Wacky Marjorie” and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in the next midterm election “if the right person runs”.Earlier on Saturday, Greene postedon Xthat she never thought she would be in the position of “fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are”.The dispute between Greene and Trump, simmering for months, has broken out into the open as the once solid Maga supporter has found herself opposing Trump on a series of issues, including US military aid to Israel, the government shutdown and the so-called “Epstein files”.That has led Trump to accuse Greene of going “Far Left” as she offered a series of dissenting opinions against the Maga mainstream. Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months was “COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” adding: “I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Greene added: “I don’t worship or serveDonald Trump.”Trump has indulged flame wars before with otherwise loyal political allies, includingElon Musk, only to make up after a cooling-off period. Like Musk, Greene’s newfound opposition appears rooted in what both see as a dilution of Trump’s “Americas first” political philosophy, including grappling with foreign peacemaking projects.The trajectory of Greene’s dissatisfaction dates to at least May, when she announced she wouldn’t run for a Senate seat and attacked Republican donors and consultants who feared she couldn’t win. She later said she wouldn’t run for Georgia governor and attacked what she said was a political “good ole boy” system in the state.She sided with Maga dissenters, including Tucker Carlson, in June over possible US efforts at regime change in Iran.But as the Epstein files controversy heated up in recent months, she placed herself in opposition to the administration’s reluctance to release the documents and videos in full. In September, she said she wanted to expose the “Epstein rape and pedophile network” and asked people to remember she is “not suicidal” should something happen to her.Earlier this month, Greene sharply criticized her party during an appearance on The View, describing the Republican-controlled Congress as “an embarrassment” for not being in session for more than a month and saying she’d grown “really tired of the pissing contest in Washington DC between the men”.Asked whether she planned on becoming a Democrat, she said both political parties had failed and called for women to step in and steer the country. “Our red-white-and-blue flag is just being ripped to shreds,” she said. “And I think it takes women of maturity to sew it back together.”Explore more on these topicsMarjorie Taylor GreeneDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinRepublicansHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Like Ebola, it causes severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and has a 21-day incubation period.Also like Ebola, it is transmitted via contact with body fluids and has a fatality rate of between 25% and 80%.The head of the World Health Organization, Ethiopia’s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, confirmed on Friday that at least nine cases had been detected in southern Ethiopia, two days afterAfricaCDC was alerted to a suspected haemorrhagic virus in the region.“Marburg virus disease (MVD) has been confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory (in Ethiopia),” Africa CDC said on Saturday.“Further epidemiological investigations and laboratory analyses are under way and the virus strain detected shows similarities to those previously identified in east Africa.”It said Ethiopian health authorities had acted swiftly to confirm and contain the outbreak in the Jinka area.It said it would work with Ethiopia to ensure an effective response and to reduce the risk of the virus spreading to other parts of east Africa.An epidemic of Marburg virus killed 10 people inTanzaniain January before being terminated in March.Rwanda said in December 2024 it had managed to stamp out its first known Marburg epidemic, which caused 15 deaths.There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for the Marburg virus, but oral or intravenous rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms increases patients’ chances of survival.Last year, Rwanda trialled an experimental vaccine from the US-based Sabin Vaccine Institute.Explore more on these topicsEthiopiaAfricaTanzanianewsShareReuse this content"

Sheworked for the Observer for 25 years, where she was described as “the backbone of the paper”.On a tribute posted on the newspaper’s website, Tim Adams, the editor of New Review, said: “Rachel could not only do everything as a journalist – fearless and funny commentary, ego-piercing interviews, campaigning social reporting, erudite and blistering book reviews, taste-making food writing, courageous foreign reportage – she could invariably do it all better, and quicker, than anybody else.”Jane Ferguson, a former editor of New Review, said Cooke had “intellectual ballast, lightly worn, authority, bite, humour and positively fizzed with ideas”. Ferguson added: “Despite filing over 100,000 words annually over decades, she somehow still had time to read and see everything.”The journalist Sonia Sodha, a former colleague of Cooke’s at the Observer, said: “I feel so lucky to have had Rachel Cooke as a friend and colleague in recent years.” Sodha described Cooke as “funny, kind, clever, a truly exceptional writer” who was a “loyal sister-in-arms” to feminist colleagues.The Guardian interviewer and features writer Simon Hattenstone described Cooke as “the brilliant Observer journalist who could write wonderfully about anything” adding that she would be “hugely, hugely missed”.Rachel Cooke on criticism: ‘What is the point of a critic if not to tell the truth?’Read moreBorn in Sheffield in 1969, Cooke was the daughter of a university botany lecturer and a biology teacher. She spent part of her childhood in Jaffa, Israel, attending a Church of Scotland school where Arab and Jewish children were taught together. She studied at the University of Oxford, before beginning her journalism career on the Sunday Times. She also wrote a television column for the New Statesman.As part of her role at the Observer, Cooke wrote a monthly food column. In 2023, she published Kitchen Person, a collection of her culinary writing, inspired in part by her grandmother, a working-class woman from Sunderland who was “touched with a kind of genius in the kitchen”.Adams said Cooke had “an emotional connection to lunch and dinner” throughout her life. He added: “She would invariably roll her eyes at any mention of diets or dry Januarys.”Cooke is survived by her husband, the writer Anthony Quinn, with whom she lived in Islington, north London.Explore more on these topicsThe ObserverNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a scene that evoked a tropical island rather than a bustling city in north-eastLos Angelescounty.“It feels parrot-y,” says Diego Blanco, a research assistant at Occidental College’sMoore Laboratory of Zoology, nodding to the verdant flora that surrounds us: tall trees and ornamental bushes with berries.Blanco and John McCormack, who directs the lab, have taken me to a street corner to look for some of the loudest – yet sometimes evasive – residents of Los Angeles: free-flying parrots. Most are a vivid green species with a shock of red at their head known as red-crowned parrots, but the LA basin also hosts a number of other parrots species – including the lilac-crowned, yellow-crowned and the Nanday parakeet.View image in fullscreenDiego Blanco, a research assistant, observes verdant flora, tall trees and ornamental bushes with berries. ‘It feels parrot-y,” he says, standing with John McCormack, director of the Moore zoology lab.Photograph: David Fouts/The Guardian“You’d be surprised sometimes,” McCormack says. “They can be right above you and you don’t even see them.”Instead, you often hear them first. The two researchers name the birds squawking in the vegetation above us. Scrub jay. Band-tailed pigeon. Then Diego gives a yelp. “Oh oh oh, those are parrots!” he shouts, pointing upward. Indeed, a group of six bright green parrots have just flown overhead.We take off on a parrot chase – a very lopsided parrot chase, since they are soaring above the city streets and we are walking.As we follow the chattering flyers tantalizingly out of reach across the urban wilds of Pasadena, it’s clear: the parrots have the upper hand in this city.View image in fullscreen‘They have definitely figured out how to live and thrive,’ McCormack says, attributing it to both natural ability and Los Angeles’ ‘buffer against extremes’.Photograph: David Fouts/The GuardianBirds of a feather escape togetherTheir feathers are bright, their voices are loud. Some might even call them the ultimate Angelenos.The parrots were originally imported from Mexico and South America during a pet trade that peaked in the 1970s, and were often sold to celebrities. One story tells of a fire at a pet store, during which firefighters opened cages to save birds from burning – and the rest is history. In the years that followed they escaped into the wilds of the city – adapting, transforming and making the urban environment their own.View image in fullscreenRed-crowned parrots observed in Los Angeles county in 2006.Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesAdaptable, creative and intelligent, today the parrot population numbers in the thousands. They are a common sight in certain neighborhoods: you can find them on the palm trees in Pasadena or all the way across town on telephone poles in Malibu.They have almost no predators outside of a few hawks or other raptors, and don’t compete with local birds for food, since they eat a diet of almost entirely imported ornamental plants. That means that while they are non-native, they are not considered an invasive species because they don’t push other species out. It’s not just Los Angeles: a 2019 study showed that25 species of parrotshave formed self-sustaining populations in 23 states around the US, including places such as Illinois and Connecticut.A team of researchers are now trying to better understand how these successful newcomers have adapted to their environment, evolving and interbreeding in unexpected ways. It’s a project that could hold lessons not just for Los Angeles but for cities around the world.“You’re never going to get all the things back to where they’re originally supposed to be,” says Blanco of the parrots’ impact on the city. “So now it’s just kind of like: who knew that this piece from that ecosystem happens to fit in well here? And what kind of new freak-o-system do we get when it’s all combined?”McCormack didn’t set out to study parrots in LA. He was a serious scientist studying native species of birds. Vibrant green parrots, on the other hand, were an introduced species – even worse, escapedpets– and their raucous squawking could drown out the gentler sounds of native fauna. It wasn’t as if others hadn’t studied them in the past, but it certainly wasn’t an activity for a serious biologist.View image in fullscreenMcCormack observes a parrot specimen in front of their large collection of birds at the Moore lab.Photograph: David Fouts/The Guardian“We started out sort of making fun of them,” says McCormack. But, he admits, “that hid something underneath – a certain longing to study them”.And then one day, inspiration hit – in the form of a parrot that collided with a library window at Occidental College, and died on impact. McCormack and his lab – specialists in birds – were called in to check it out.When they started looking closely at the specimen, they noticed hints of a scientific mystery: the bird did not look like any of the species that had landed in LA decades before. Instead, it bore traits of two of the different species that would never have met in the wilds of Mexico: the red-crowned parrot and the lilac-crowned parrot.View image in fullscreenMcCormack and Alana Pizarro, a research and curatorial assistant, work in the DNA lab at the Moore lab of zoology.Photograph: David Fouts/The GuardianIt helped that McCormack was the curator of a vast Mexican bird collection that dates back a hundred years. He went to the catalog and started to poke around. Sure enough, the collection included examples of the same species in their native range in Mexico from before the pet trade got going, he says,offering a method of comparison with the urban hybrids.“We had this baseline example of what the birds looked like, as well as their genomes, before they were ever brought to LA.”Now, genetic analyses between the birds in McCormack’s catalogue and the specimens his team have collected is revealing how the LA birds are mixing. And they may even prove to be a key future link back to their original home.Clues to a hybrid mysteryAt Occidental’s Moore laboratory, McCormack opens a drawer of specimens collected in the 1930s in central Mexico. After nearly 100 years, the birds have retained their brilliant color – a green that looks like a chameleon, combined with purple or red feathers on their heads. He holds up the parrots to compare with the modern species – the ones that volunteers have brought Flapp (the Free-Flying Los Angeles Parrot Project) to study. Any parrot, freshly dead, with fewer than 10 bugs is a welcome addition to the project.View image in fullscreenMcCormack showcases a variety of bird specimens from the lab’s extensive collection.Photograph: David Fouts/The GuardianRed-crowned parrots are the most common, he explains – and then there’s the sister species, the lilac-crowned parrots. They share a recent evolutionary history. Both native to Mexico, the red-crowned parrots live on the eastern coastal foothills of Mexico, while the lilac-crowned parrots are on the western coastal foothills.“In nature, they never come into contact,” McCormack says. “It’s been like one or two million years, they’ve gone their separate ways. But now they’ve been brought to Los Angeles, and they’re living together.”He lifts up a bird with red feathers on its head but dark skin around its nostril, a feature of the lilac-crowned variety. It’s a clear example of a hybrid variety that has become part of the city’s melting pot.The hybrids aren’t overtaking other species just yet – but they are an interesting nod to the impacts of city living. Genetic analyses of 40 to 50 birds have shown the way the parrots’ biology has shifted as well. The lab’s research also showshow these birds have adaptedto conditions far outside the parameters of their home range – different temperatures, different trees and different rainfall.“They have definitely figured out how to live and thrive,” says McCormack. “Part of that is probably their own natural ability to withstand different conditions, and part of that is that the city is a buffer against extremes.”And in a remarkable twist, these thriving populations could be a lifeline for their cousins back in Latin America.View image in fullscreenMcCormack shows a variety of parrots from their study into parrot DNA and their migration into LA.Photograph: David Fouts/The GuardianThe birds are nowendangered in Mexico, where habitat loss and illegal trapping are putting their existence in danger. While working to conserve that population where it lives is key, some scientists see the potential for repopulating parts of Mexico with LA birds. The population in Mexico is believed to be smaller than the one in Los Angeles.“There’s this fanciful idea that, should they ever go extinct in the wild, you might be able to repopulate them from the urban populations from these arcs of biodiversity that occur in cities,” says McCormack.McCormack’s research also shows that some of the parrot species could spread. A new study shows the Nanday parakeet, which lives in the Santa Monica mountains, hasadapted to live and feed on sycamore trees, and seem to prefer south-facing coastal canyons. The sycamore balls in California are fairly similar in size to the nuts of the carnaúba palm from their native range in South America. The team analyzed suitable habitat and said the parakeets could move next in the Santa Ynez mountain range behind Santa Barbara.View image in fullscreenMcCormack shows a variety of parrots from their study into Parrot DNA and their migration into LA.Photograph: David Fouts/The GuardianTransplants find their flockWhatever their future role in conservation, the vibrant parrots continue to inspire admiration, curiosity and even a little frustration from local residents.Angelenos have a love-hate relationship with the birds, says Denys Hemen, a facility and operations manager at the Audubon Center at Debs Park in Los Angeles. “Some people think they’re a little noisy,” he says, “During the day, you might hear one or two chattering somewhere in the tree. I personally love them.”Those noisy calls are adapted to the environment of their homeland – shouting over treetops in the jungle – but they also work in the city. That’s because they communicate over fairly long distances, McCormack says. “They do a lot of flying during the day – they move around from tree to tree, foraging here and there. And because they’re so social, and they hang out in flocks, they need to communicate with each other.”View image in fullscreenA parrot sits near the Bette Davis picnic area in Los Angeles on 21 February 2022.Photograph: Marky Mutchler/CourtesyJanel Ortiz, a researcher at Cal Poly Pomona, is focused on studying how they roost. How do the birds choose where to spend the night? (She has a hunch they actually use busy roads as a protective mechanism against predators.) And what do they do during the day?She also wonders about their chosen nesting areas for raising the next crop of Angelenos: the birds use cavities inside palm trees, and LA’s palm trees – planted decades ago – are starting to die or be cut down. “Are they going to be able to shift to a different type of tree, to be able to raise their babies?”Despite the challenges, the parrots’ numbers are strong –one study points to more than 3,000 red-crowned parrotsalone, and that number is probably conservative. But they still face threats. Since the parrots are non-native, they don’t have any protections under California laws outside of basic rules against animal cruelty. People have tried to capture them in the past, such as an incident in 2023 when a mannetted and killed several birds.View image in fullscreenParrots cruise the skies in Los Angeles county in 2013.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty ImagesThe birds were added to the California Bird Records Committee in 2021, where they joined species that are not native to the state, but have become integrated into California ecosystems over the last century. And some scientists have argued that parrots should be offeredsanctuary as endangered species living among us.It’s a testament to how beloved they are by many Angelenos. As the parrots soar over the sidewalk of Pasadena, Blanco points out how cool it is to have birds from so far away thriving in the urban jungle.“It’s like a little piece of the tropics that’s being brought here,” he says, his eyes trained to the skies. “They bring with them the imagination of those ecosystems.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsWest CoastLos AngelesConservationAnimalsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their task is to try to remove millions of peppercorn-sized black plastic biobeads from where they have settled in the sand. Beyond them, a seal carcass grins menacingly, teeth protruding from its rotting skull.Last week, an environmental disaster took place on Camber Sands beach, on what could turn out to be an unprecedented scale. Eastbourne Wastewater Treatment Works, owned by Southern Water, experienced a mechanical failure andspewed out millions of biobeadson to the Sussex coastline. Southern Waterhas since taken responsibilityfor the spill. Ironically, biobeads are used to clean wastewater – bacteria attach to their rough, crinkly surface and clean the water of contaminants.In the days since, volunteers have flocked to the beach. On a chilly November morning, beneath a blue sky, they painstakingly pick out the minuscule beads by hand. It is mind-numbingly tedious work.Others – much to the envy of the hand-pickers – have sieves. One volunteer has fashioned a sieve from a mesh onion sack found nearby.View image in fullscreenCamber Sands is one of England’s most popular beaches, with rare dune habitatView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenVolunteers use nets, sieves and dustpans and brushes to try to remove as many of the millions of biobeads as they can“We’re scooping up the sand, then pouring the sand over a bucket into a sieve, and then pouring the water on top, so that we just get the beads,” says Hastings resident Roisin O’Gorman.Andy Dinsdale, the founder of Strandliners, an environmental organisation that runs beach cleanups, says: “They’ve got to get down on their hands and knees, almost into the strandline [the line of seaweed and other debris that lines the high water mark on beaches], to look for very small 5mm black pellets. We can only do our best.”Kneeling on the sand, on your knees, just picking them out, one by one, is futileNick, volunteerHe is noticeably exhausted from his days-long effort coordinating the cleanup. He has missed his son’s birthday celebrations, he says, to be here.Despite their valiant efforts, many volunteers feel helpless. Walking tramples the plastic further into the sand and overfilled bin bags of waste can split, putting workers back to square one. “Kneeling on the sand, on your knees, just picking them out, one by one, is futile,” says Nick, a volunteer from Tunbridge Wells, in frustration.View image in fullscreenMany volunteers feel frustrated and helpless at the seeming futility of cleaning up the spilled biobeadsTo make more of a dent, experts have brought in a special machine. “Do you remember Teletubbies?” says Dinsdale. He points about a mile down the beach, towards what looks like a giant vacuum cleaner – remarkably reminiscentof the character Noo-Noofrom the children’s television series – sucking up a carpet of black beads.This microplastic removal machine is the invention of Joshua Beech, an environmental scientist and founder of the cleanup organisation Nurdle. “It works by vacuuming up material, separating it by density, and then sieving and separating in the back [of the machine] so it comes out as nearly pure plastic in the collection trays,” he says.View image in fullscreenJoshua Beech, left, and Roy Beal with their beach-cleaning machineBeech and his colleague Roy Beal have spent five backbreaking days vacuuming the beach from sunrise to sunset. Beech hoists the heavy nozzle on to his shoulders while Beal holds it underarm. “He has a rugby player’s shoulders,” says Beal. “I have kayaker’s shoulders.”They hope that removing as many biobeads as possible can prevent more damage.Tamara Galloway, professor of ecotoxicology at the University of Exeter, says microplastics “overlap with the prey item size of many marine organisms and can enter the food web, with the potential to transfer contaminants into cells and tissues”.They can also break down and leach harmful compounds that affect animals’ hormones and cause reproductive problems. Local people are already concerned by an unusual number of stranded animals – three seals and a porpoise – that recently washed up on the beach. At this stage, the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP), which investigates strandings, doesn’t think these deaths are linked to the spill.Rye Harbour nature reserve, adjacent to Camber Sands, is Sussex Wildlife Trust’s largest reserve. This special area is “a matrix of wetland habitat”, influenced by and linked to the sea, says site manager Paul Tinsley-Marshall. “The vegetated shingle is a globally threatened habitat.” It is home to more than 4,355 species, including common, sandwich and little terns, oystercatchers, plovers and avocets. Biobead pollution has now been confirmed at Rye Harbour, and the reserve’s team is currently assessing the damage and carefully planning their cleanup of this sensitive habitat.View image in fullscreenCamber Sands is part of a special area described as ‘a matrix of wetland habitat’ influenced by and linked to the seaView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA dead seal near where the volunteers are working; sacks of plastic biobeads gathered by the teamAccording to Strandliners, there have been two previous large-scale biobead incidents reported to the Environment Agency, in 2010 and 2017.“This is the worst microplastic spill we’ve seen this year,” says Beech. Worse even than the spill ofnurdles (pre-production plastic pellets)in March,when two ships collidedin the North Sea. The plastic beads washed up on Norfolk beaches and the surrounding coastline.‘When I pass piles of fishing nets, I see piles of money’: a one man recycling revolution on the Cornish coastRead moreThe harm caused by the biobeads at Camber may depend on their composition. Beads like these used to be recycled from potentially toxic e-waste until regulatory legislation in 2006. No one knows when these beads were made, Dinsdale says.With the sun due to set at 4.20pm, time on the beach is limited. “We’re fighting against the sunlight,” says volunteer Cate Lamb who has travelled from London with her partner, Khalid Flynn, and eight-year-old Maya Flynn. “We feel like we’re fighting a losing battle, a little, because of the scale of the challenge.”At that moment, her bucket splits.Rother district council says attempts to remove all the pellets have “proven impossible” and that they “expect further large amounts to be deposited in the coming weeks and months”.View image in fullscreenEntire families get involved in beach cleaning on Camber SandsBeech and the Nurdle team hope to return after the next spring tide brings in more, but this is dependent on them being able to cover the costs of a second clean.The money they make selling recycled sheeting made from the beach plastics to fund future cleanups isn’t enough. “We can’t afford to come back,” says Beech. “But the environment needs us back.”Southern Water has apologised for the spill but Helena Dollimore, the MP for Hastings and Rye, wants it to go further by funding the cleanup and any future nature restoration. She is also calling for an independent investigation. “Southern Water cannot be trusted to mark their own homework,” she says.Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansCoastlinesPollutionPlasticsOceansMarine lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The church and its congregation have endured through uprisings – in particular the famous 1831 slave revolt led by the Black Baptist deacon Samuel Sharpe – and earthquakes.But whenHurricane Melissadescended on Jamaica, it ripped off the church roof and shredded the rows of sturdy pews, leaving an unrecognisable mangle of wood and debris in its wake. Outside, parts of the structure had survived the onslaught of the category 5 storm. The church is one of Jamaica’s 146,000 buildings – just 15% of those assessed so far – that has suffered major to severe damage, according to Alvin Gayle, director general of Jamaica’s emergency management office. The death toll on Thursday was 45, with 13 people missing; an estimated 90,000 households and 360,000 people have been affected by the damage.View image in fullscreenThe ‘freedom stone’ built into the church structure to commemorate the abolition of slavery.Photograph: William Richards/The GuardianThe names of past members are still etched into its walls and the “freedom stone”, built into its structure to commemorate the end of slavery on 1 August 1838, is still there.As church and faith groups play a significant role in Jamaica’s recovery, the loss of the building and parts of the adjacent school are a huge blow to the community, Rev O’Neil Bowen told the Guardian.Cold Spring village, andmany of its neighbouring communitiesin Hanover, where residents are still coming to terms with catastrophic destruction, were once plantations owned by Europeans whoamassed wealthfrom centuries of trafficking and enslavement of African people. One of the Guardian’s 19th-century funders co-owned a plantation, Success, in the area. For the last few years, theLegacies of Enslavement Programmehas been engaging with these communities to discuss priorities for repair.At the ongoing UNCop30climate change conference in Brazil, campaigners say that devastated regions such as Hanover as well as others across Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti, are stark examples of how African descendants are disproportionately affected by centuries of environmental degradation.View image in fullscreenRev O’Neil Bowen in front of Gurney’s Mount church.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The GuardianSpeaking fromCop30, Jamaican economist Mariama Williams said historical injustices must be confronted and addressed.“The research shows that wherever Afro descendants are located, they are most vulnerable to climate and environmental impact and have been suffering from historical environmental injustice and climate injustice,” she said. “Climate justice cannot be separated from reparatory justice. The same systems that enriched the north created today’s vulnerabilities.”The Global Afrodescendant Climate Justice Collaborative, where Williams is a senior adviser, is among hundreds of human rights groups and environmentalists that urged Cop30 to put reparations on the agenda.In their open letter they argue that “global warming began with the Industrial Revolutions that were made possible by the resources provided by imperialism, colonialism and enslavement, [and] that colonialism and enslavement skewed the global economy in favour of the material and financial interests in the global north”.Describing the efforts to recover fromHurricane Melissaas a “real-time case study” that validated this argument, Williams said: “The storm hit rural Jamaica hardest – people who are poorest, least protected, and historically marginalised. The same communities shaped by slavery, colonial extraction, and racialised policies are now on the frontline of climate disaster. So we’re not in theory any more.”The economist believes countries such as Jamaica should have remedies such as being able to identify and write off debts which they were forced into because of their colonial past.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toCotton CapitalFree weekly newsletterA behind the scenes look at the Cotton Capital project, direct to your inbox for 15 weeksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aid has been pouring into the country and theWorld Bank announced last weekthat the government of Jamaica would receive a full payout of $150m under its catastrophe insurance coverage.But for environmental justice academic and associate professor Kevon Rhiney, though insurance payouts are important,Caribbeancountries need more sustainable solutions in order to withstand the brunt of climate change they did not cause.“Countries cannot just be expected to insure their risks because the fact that a single hurricane can wipe out an entire agricultural sector means that these bonds will not be enough to cover the full risk and the loss and damages that these countries will accrue.” he said.Referring to the amount of money pledged to the UN-backed loss and damage fund to help vulnerable countries recover from climate change impacts such as extreme weather, as “embarrassingly low”, he called for a greater commitment from high-emitting countries.View image in fullscreenA drone view of affected areas in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, in Black River, Jamaica.Photograph: Raquel Cunha/Reuters“We’re not begging these countries. This is a debt that is owed. And I think this needs to be made clear. And this is why there is very deep connection between calls for climate reparations and reparations for slavery, because they’re both connected through these longer histories, these colonial legacies,” he said. The UK has pledged £7.5m.Arley Gill, a member of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Reparations Commission, set up to advance the region’s pursuit of reparatory justice, told the Guardian that “a successful Cop cannot avoid a discussion about climate change and reparations”.“Hurricane Melissa once again showed us that the same islands and the same peoples that are … demanding reparative justice for the crimes against humanity of slavery, slave trade, and indigenous genocide, are the same peoples and the same countries that are on the wrong end of the effect of climate change. And so those two issues are inseparable.“We call upon the global leaders, to once and for all to confront the harsh reality of that climate change is as a direct result of the impact of colonialism and industrial revolution which was fuelled by the crimes against humanity.” he said.On Thursday, theUN permanent forum on people of African descentcalled for climate action rooted in human rights, and reparatory and racial justice.“We must recognise that climate justice cannot succeed without addressing historical and structural forms of injustice and their lasting consequences.”Explore more on these topicsJamaicaCotton Capital: ongoing seriesHurricane MelissaColonialismClimate crisisSlaveryCaribbeanReparations and reparative justicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We have to do it.”‘Make no mistake – this was a coup’: the extraordinary downfall of the BBC’s top bossesRead moreThe BBC sentan apology to Trump on Thursdaybut said there was no legal basis for him to sue the public broadcaster over a documentary his lawyers called defamatory.The corporation rejected his demands for compensation after lawyers for Trump threatened to sue for $1bn (£760m) in damages unless theBBCissued a retraction, apologised and settled with him.TheBBChas also agreed not to show the edition of Panorama again.Trump said he had not spoken to the British prime minister, Keir Starmer – with whom he has built a solid relationship – about the issue, but that he planned to call him this weekend.Turmoil erupted at the BBC after the clip re-emerged a week ago when a leaked internal memo highlighted the misleading edit, in which the US president appeared to say: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol ... and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”However, the verbatim quote from the speech was: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”And it was more than 50 minutes later that he added: “And we fight. We fight like hell.”The attack, which led to five deaths, including of a police officer, came shortly after Trump spoke at the “Save America” rally on 6 January.A violent mob stormed the Capitol in Washington after Trump made false claims in the same speech that the 2020 election had been “stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats”.As many as 2,500 people entered the Capitol during the attack, with some participating in vandalism and looting.More than 1,000 people were sentenced for their role, though later Trump issued a presidential pardon to all the attackers, including those convicted of violent offences.Trump’s actions around the attack led to widespread suspensions from social media sites. In September, YouTube agreed to pay $24.5m (£18.6m) to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump, following similar settlements with X/Twitter and Facebook.The money from YouTube will be put towards a new ballroom at the White House, while the Facebook settlement is earmarked for his presidential library, court documents showed.In its letter to Trump’s legal team, the BBC set out why it felt there was no basis for the US president to sue. This included that the programme was only shown in the UK and that he was not damaged by it, having been re-elected shortly after.The BBC also said it was not designed to mislead, having been only 12 seconds of a long speech, and was not meant to be considered in isolation but as part of an hour-long programme. which included multiple voices in support of Trump.In an interview with GB News on Friday, Trump said the edit was “impossible to believe”.“I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement,” he said. “Fake news was a great term, except it’s not strong enough. This is beyond fake, this is corrupt.”The BBC chair, Samir Shah, sent a personal apology on Thursday to the White House and told lawmakers the edit was “an error of judgment”. The following day the culture minister, Lisa Nandy, said the apology was “right and necessary”.It has since been discovered a similar edit was made in 2022, on the BBC’s Newsnight programme.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationBBCUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One charity called the huge dump of rubbish “an environmental catastrophe unfolding in plain sight”.Calum Miller, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bicester and Woodstock, told parliament the “estimated cost of removal is greater than the entire annual budget of the local district council”.He added: “Criminals have dumped a mountain of illegal waste weighing hundreds of tonnes in my constituency on a floodplain adjacent to the River Cherwell. TheEnvironment Agencysaid it has limited resources for enforcement.”0:20Drone footage shows ‘mountain’ of fly-tipped waste in Oxfordshire – videoFriends of the Thames said the illegal rubbish dump was created about a month ago by an organised crime group. It said no visible containment or mitigation measures appeared to be in place.The charity’s chief executive, Laura Reineke, said: “This is an environmental catastrophe unfolding in plain sight.“A mountain of waste has been allowed to build up just metres from the Rver Cherwell – an illegal landfill sitting on the floodplain of one of our most important waterways.“Every day that passes increases the risk of toxic runoff entering the river system, poisoning wildlife and threatening the health of the entire catchment.“The Environment Agency must act now, not in months or years – which is their usual reaction time.”Billy Burnell, a local angler who regularly fishes in the area,toldthe BBC he noticed the pile in September. He said it was “horrific” and called the potential runoff into the river an “environmental disaster waiting to happen”.Anya Gleizer, a geography researcher at the University of Oxford, said: “What we have on our hands, right now, is an environmental and health emergency that threatens not only the Cherwell River and its ecosystem, but also poses a direct risk to us: the communities living downstream from the dump-site,” she said.“As an ecologist, river guardian, rower but also, more simply, as a mother of a child that enjoys splashing about and fishing for aquatic invertebrates, I have to emphasise that this crime has more far-reaching consequences.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Their role will be to find who left the waste there and take appropriate action.In a report released last month, the Lords environment and climate change committee said organised crime gangs were illegally dumping millions of tonnes of waste across the countryside every year.The committee identified incompetence at the Environment Agency as a factor in the growing crisis.But Philip Duffy, the agency’s chief executive, hit back, and said: “I think it’s very unfair on my hard-working staff to be accused of incompetence.”Explore more on these topicsWasteOxfordshireRiversEnvironment AgencynewsShareReuse this content"

Nigel Farage, today’s incarnation of the politics of Enoch Powell, is the effect.”Powell made a speech widely remembered for the phrase “rivers of blood” in 1968, when he was a Conservative shadow minister, which was blamed for inflaming racial tensions at the time.It comes days after Reform UK wasaccused of embracing racismafter it picked a former academic who argued that UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds were not necessarily British as the head of its new student organisation.Matthew Goodwin, who is now a hard-right activist and prominent Reform supporter, posted on X that he believed even being born and brought up in the UK did not mean that people from black, Asian or other immigrant backgrounds were always British.Earlier this year, in response to Farage’s opposition to the government’s Online Safety Act, Kyle claimed people like Jimmy Savile would use the internet to exploit children if he was still alive. He insisted anyone against the act, such as Farage, was “on their side”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragePeter KyleEconomic policyThe far rightRaceEconomic growth (GDP)newsShareReuse this content"

That Teletubbies “made a huge amount of money for the BBC” had been “forgotten”, she added.Although Teletubbies was accused of “dumbing down” when it first aired in 1997, academic research subsequently suggested that the emphasis on rhyme, repetition and simplicityimproved children’s language capabilities.Wood acknowledged “an awful lot of people didn’t understand Teletubbies” but attributed the show’s success to focus groups aimed at meeting children where they were – reversing the prevalent idea that “you had to tell children things”.View image in fullscreenThe Teletubbies’ use of rhyme, repetition and simplicity in language helped improve children’s capabilities.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“In television, you can tremendously show and reflect back to children their own experience in a comic way that makes them smile – if you have children smiling their confidence is building,” she said. “There’s a real art in editing for a three- or five-year-old – you hold to allow the child time.”She contrasted this with algorithms that “beat down your own ability to develop and think around and imagine around”. She said shows such as CoCoMelon were “a distraction” to assist busy parents, which could be helpful in small doses, though she wondered “what it’s squeezing out, what children are missing”, with many YouTube channels “on the side of what makes money for them”.The children’s TV presenter Konnie Huq, who presented Blue Peter between 1997 and 2008 and will soon be starring in the BBC’s new drama Dexter Proctor, 10-Year-Old Doctor as headteacher Ms Saeed, agreed the children’s TV landscape had changed significantly.“If you search for it, you can find really good educational stuff, but if a child is told they can eat sugar for every meal they might eat sugar for every meal. People – grown-ups and kids – will go for instant gratification and a dopamine hit over something that might be a bit more work but might give delayed gratification and longer term benefits,” she said.Huq also said she feared the media industry more widely was increasingly commercially driven: “Nowadays it’s hard to even exist in the world of media without – maybe that’s my downfall – TikTok and Instagram and a million zillion product endorsements. The BBC was the last bastion of not being that, but when you go to a meeting at the Beeb now they want people to be doing that stuff.”But she felt the undervaluing of children’s TV, which was sidelined from the main Bafta event and in which remuneration was lower, had deep roots. “People sort of look at as a secondary little brother or sister, whereas it’s way more important than grownup TV in the respect that you’re bringing up kids to be the grownups of tomorrow,” she said.Sonia Livingstone, the director of the Centre for Children’s Digital Futures at the London School of Economics, said evidence suggested that children benefited from high-quality content that is educational, creative or imaginative, though “parents don’t always know how to tell what’s of value”.She added “the problem with YouTube was more the format than the content” as the algorithm is commercially motivated and capable of “grabbing and sustaining attention beyond where the child would naturally keep watching”.A YouTube spokesperson said: “We incentivise high quality content for kids through ourquality principles, which guide what’s recommended to younger viewers, and provide parents with robust controls to decide what content to make available to their children. We’ll keep investing in this critical area, guided by experts.”Dexter Procter: The 10-Year Old Doctor will be available on BBC iPlayer and CBBC in December.Explore more on these topicsChildren's TVYouTubeTelevision industryTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

I think they’re gonna be fine.Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej said prime minister Anutin explained the matter to Trump on their call, “who expressed understanding regarding the issue”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The agreement was seen as a boost for Orbán, who has been in power for 15 years, during uncertain economic times for the country.According to insiders, another of Orbán’s priorities for the trip was to persuade Trump to visitHungaryfor a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, with whom Orbán has maintained ties, despite anger from other European governments.Orbán’s claims of Trump summit triumph mask growing doubts over his grip on powerRead moreThe Hungarian leader has repeatedly warned of the risks of an ever-spiralling war, and Orbán will be hoping the “anti-war” message can undercut his opposition before the elections, which are due to take place in April next year.But Péter Magyar, a former Fidesz insider whose Tisza party is now leading in some independent polls, had organised another event in Győr on the same day. “Fidesz is the party of war and hatred, while Tisza works for peace at home and around the world,” he said in a Facebook post.Orbán has positioned himself as the voice of reason against what he says is a failed EU-led campaign to arm Ukraine. But his detractors at home and in the EU believe that the rightwing politician is too close to Putin and have called him the Kremlin’s “Trojan horse” in the bloc.Last month, Orbán led a “peace march” in which he told thousands in the crowd that Hungary was “the only country inEuropestanding up for peace”.Relations between Budapest and Kyiv have deteriorated over Hungary blocking steps towards Ukraine’s accession to the EU, as well as Orbán’s refusal to impose sanctions onRussia.The issue of Ukraine, which shares a border with Hungary, has regularly played into domestic politics. Pro-Fidesz media have accused Magyar of collaborating with the Ukrainian secret service, calling him “the Hungarian Zelenskyy”.This year, billboards have been erected in Hungary depicting a sinister-looking Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, alongside the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, with the caption: “They would take Ukraine in the EU. We would pay the price.”Vlada, a 23-year-old Ukrainian woman living in Hungary, said: “When families come here from the frontlines, where they’ve been under bombardment for years, these posters can trigger bad feelings again.” She asked only to use her first name to protect her identity and the people close to her, some of whom still live under Russian occupation in Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t send any weapons, but they help organise peace conferences, with reconstruction,” Vlada said.The topic of “peace” is expected to become a central narrative in Fidesz’s re-election campaign. Fidesz may try to “turn the election into a referendum on war and foreign policy”, said Dániel Róna, a political scientist and director of the independent 21 Research Centre. But Mátyás Bódi, an expert at the independent analytics group Electoral Geography, said the question was “whether that will be enough in the midst of a cost of living crisis”.Electoral Geography’s polling indicates a 7% lead for Tisza.After 15 years of Fidesz rule, Hungarians are struggling with inflation, a failing healthcare system, and deepening problems in education – areas where voters now trust Tisza more, Bódi noted, citing recent research from the independent pollster Policy Solutions.Orbán still holds an advantage on foreign policy, especially on peace and migration. “But we don’t see parties winning elections based on foreign policy,” Bódi said.Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Greene currently represents Georgia’s 14th congressional district.Earlier on Friday, Greene toldPoliticothat Trump should not be trying to stop the release of the Epstein files when rising costs in the US are making it difficult for even the president’s own supporters to pay their bills.“It’s insanely the wrong direction to go. The five-alarm fire is healthcare and affordability for Americans. And that’s where the focus should be,” Greene said.“Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world. Just release it all. Let the American people sort through every bit of it, and, you know, support the victims. That’s just like the most common sense, easiest thing in the world. But to spend any effort trying to stop it makes – it just doesn’t make sense to me.”He continued his tirade on Saturday in a Truth Social post, calling Greene a “disgrace” to the party.Greene has spent the past few months voicing opinions that are at odds with those of the White House and some of her Republican colleagues. Earlier this week, Trump pushed back against criticism from Greene, saying she had “lost her way” after sheaccused himof paying too much attention to foreign affairs and not enough to the rising cost of living in the US.Greene responded to Trump’s remarks on X a day after, saying that “the only way is through Jesus”.“That’s my way, and I’ve definitely not lost it. Actually I’m working hard to put my faith into action,” she posted.Escalations have increased since Trump’s return to office, as the 51-year-old has increasingly broken with the party on domestic and foreign policy. Shecriticisedthe White House for its plans to send “billions of dollars” in weapons to Ukraine and departed from the Republican party’s traditional support for Israel by calling its war in Gaza a “genocide”.In aninterviewwith the Washington Post, the Georgia representative spoke about her discontent with congressional leaders of her own party, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, amid the government shutdown that ended this week.During the shutdown, she sided with Democrats in their push to provide healthcare subsidies, a rare move for a Republican.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMarjorie Taylor GreeneTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicsJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

More people are reading and speaking English, and fewer are reading in Icelandic, a trend she says is being exacerbated by the way language models are trained.She made the comments before her appearance at the Iceland Noir crime fiction festival in Reykjavík after the surprise release of her second novel of the genre, which she co-wrote with Ragnar Jónasson.“A lot of languages disappear, and with them dies a lot of value[and] a lot of human thought,” she said. Icelandic has only about 350,000 speakers and is among the world’s least-altered languages.“Having this language that is spoken by so very few, I feel that we carry a huge responsibility to actually preserve that. I do not personally think we are doing enough to do that,” she said, not least because young people in Iceland “are absolutely surrounded by material in English, on social media and other media”.Katrín has said that Iceland has been “quite proactive” in pushing for AI to be usable in Icelandic. Earlier this month, Anthropic announced a partnership with Iceland’s ministry of education, one of the world’s first national AI education pilots. The partnership is a nationwide pilot across Iceland – giving hundreds of teachers across Iceland access to AI tools.During her time in government, Katrín said they could see the “threats and dangers of AI” and the importance of ensuring that Icelandic texts and books were used to train it.View image in fullscreenKatrín and Ragnar’s second book is set in the small village of Fáskrúðsfjörður, in eastern Iceland, in 1989.Photograph: Arctic Images/AlamyRagnar Jónasson, her co-author, agreed that the language was in grave danger. “We are just a generation away from losing this language because all of these huge changes,” he said.“They are reading more in English, they are getting their information from the internet, from their phones, and kids in Iceland are even conversing in English sometimes between themselves.”Citing what happened when Iceland was under Danish rule until 1918, when the Icelandic language was subjected to Danish influence, Katrín said changes could happen “very quickly”.“We have seen that before here in Iceland because we of course were under the Danes for quite a long time and the Danish language had a lot of influence on the Icelandic language.”Thatchange, however, was turned around rapidly by a strong movement by Icelanders, she added.“Maybe we need a stronger movement right now to talk about why do we want to preserve the language? That is really the big thing that we should be talking about here in Iceland,” she said, adding that the “fate of a nation” could be decided on how it treated its language, as language shaped the way people thought.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2017, when tested in service, 27 out of 27 Ford vehicles with Euro 6 engines failed the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) emissions tests.Cross-examining Marcus Davies, Ford’s former calibration manager, in the high court, Thomas de la Mare KC said that the systems had not been “sufficiently tested” and that “the scale of the problem” amounted to “one million vehicles affected”. It was a “generic issue affecting the best part of a million cars”, de la Mare claimed.Davies played down the 1m figure. “It’s not every vehicle that would have this problem,” he said.New software was implemented in production lines from 2018, and some Ford customers whose cars were serviced at official dealers also received a software update to address the problem, but there was no wider recall, the court was told.De La Mare said: “You must have appreciated that the update would not rectify the situation.”Davies replied: “It would improve it.”“But not make it compliant with the NEDC,” de la Mare replied.In the broader case, the claimants argued that Ford had deliberately calibrated its engines to pass certification tests rather than reduce real world driving emissions.Referencing the manufacturer’s own internal documents, Ben Jaffey KC, for the claimants, said that as far back as 2012 there was “a very clear recognition that Ford wasn’t using EGR [the exhaust gas recirculation system to reduce NOx] as much as possible”.Jaffey said: “The reality is that it was shaped to the requirements of the test and not much else?”Davies said: “It was calibrated in part to the requirements of the NEDC.” Changes to trap more NOx “would have been at the expense of the capture of other gases”.Documents shown in court also showed that NOx emissions from a Euro 5 transit van surged well beyond regulatory limits when the engine was tested inadvertently in sixth gear. The NEDC tests were normally carried out in fifth gear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is estimated to haveled to thousands of deathsand cases of asthma in children.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsFordAutomotive industryPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

A person on a zip wire at Bluewater in Kent.Photograph: suppliedRetail industryZip wires, darts, wild swimming: why shopping centres are trying new ways to bring in customersDevelopers are turning to health-related activities as traditional stores hit by online retail continue to closeSarah ButlerSat 15 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTShareThere was a time when the most active thing to do at a shopping centre was jostle to the front of the queue at Primark. These days, however, developers are bringing in sport and health-related activities from zip wires tocricket, football, rock climbing and even wild swimming to draw in consumers and use space no longer wanted by retailers.While the trend for competitive socialising, such as crazy golf, darts or bowling iswell establishedand gyms are commonplace in shopping centres, landlords are getting more creative and adventurous in the type of activity they are offering as they battle lacklustre interest in physical shopping.The activities are varied: Toca Social hosts diners watching and playing football in three shopping malls. US group Five Iron, which blends hi-tech golf simulators and coaching with a bar, has signed up for the first of at least 10 UK sites, at Broadgate in central London. Even the zip line adventure operators Zip World and Go Ape are understood to be talking to landlords about adding experiences to shopping centres and retail parks.Such operators are helping to fill the gaping holes in shopping malls after the closure of hundreds of department stores and other big retailers after the switch to online shopping and more working from home. A fifth of the former Debenhams sites remain vacant, for example, more than four years after the department storeexited the high street, while severalformer House of Fraser shopsstill stand empty.Footfall has fallen in all but three of the last 12 months in shopping centres and was down 0.9% in October, according to the British Retail Consortium survey with monitoring firm Sensormatic.View image in fullscreenToca Social hosts diners watching and playing football.Photograph: Jack WilliamsWhile the big shopping centres continue to do well, smaller, less successful malls are suffering because chains want fewer but larger stores.About 60 of the UK’s 500 bigger shopping centresare likely to be razed completely, and a further 200 could be partially demolished, analysis showed last year.Retailers had historically paid more rent per square foot than leisure operators, the diminished demand for retail space has narrowed the difference and many deals are now tied to turnover so that landlords quickly feel the pain if a shop is unsuccessful.Some centres have gone almost all in on sport and leisure. The former Centre Court shopping centre has been reinvented as Wimbledon Quarter – not far from the site of the annual tennis championships – under its owner Romulus, including an upmarket gym and members’ club, Third Space, and sports operator The Golf Groove.In Cardiff, the former Queens Arcade is in the process of being reinvented as a “leisure mall” with live performances, sporting areas – courts for theincreasingly popular padel– and interactive exhibitions and theatrics using digital projection.Vivienne King, the chair of the executive board at shopping and leisure centre body Revo, says: “There has been a clear shift in what people expect from destinations, focusing more now on experience than ever before.“It’s about creating memorable, shared moments for families and friends. These kinds of experiences encourage longer visits, repeat trips, and a deeper connection with the destination, so they are without doubt both commercially effective and culturally resonant.”View image in fullscreenWild swimming at Bluewater.Photograph: Hangloose AdventureKing adds: “Gen Z and millennials in particular clearly want to focus more on treating themselves, or what you might call ‘self improvement’, which can even include things like yoga studios and immersive play.”Bruce Findlay, the managing director of retail at LandSec, the owner of Bluewater, says: “Wellness is more and more to the fore.” The vast Kent shopping centre could soon host an even broader range of activities, including an outdoor events arena that could hosts gigs or theatre, padel courts and potentially even rollercoasters to draw visitors from further afield.Such experiences can’t work everywhere – some centres will not have sufficient space, indoor or out, or the right ceiling height to house experiences such as rock climbing or zip wires. Wimbledon Quarter’s climbing wall operator closed last year, citing problems with the space and difficulty in attracting enough visitors, for example.While Bluewater has lots of space, LandSec has also been prepared to completely redevelop more urban centres to fit in activities. A former Debenhams at its Southside centre in Wandsworth, south London, has been transformed by the leisure operator Gravity, bringing a mix of go-karting, mini-golf and darts. A section of floor was knocked out for the climbing wall operator Parthian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He says such experiences offer a chance for families to connect and get away from staring at screens. “We are really tapping into social, outdoor play,” he says. “It’s things you can’t do online. It’s that simple.”Katie Wyle, a director at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which owns the Westfield shopping centres in east and west London, says its leisure provision has grown by 39% since 2022.“People are craving an interactive experience rather than something passive,” she says. “It is about spending time, and money and then getting the selfies for afterwards.”Wyle says the shift towards more working from home means people are now “wanting to be able to do everything that day” in a handy location when they do come into a city.On top of sporting activities and cinemas, Westfield has lined up the 8,000 sq ft (743 sq metre) tech-enabled gaming experience Activate in London and will open the Wake the Tiger art experience.The change in consumer demand has not only drastically altered the picture for landlords, but also sports operators. Jo O’Boyle, the marketing director of Go Ape, says it has considered moving beyond its park and forest locations. “It would have to be the right space,” she says. “We really need footfall and an almost complementary offer such as bike riding or forest walks. If we could replicate that, it is definitely something we would be interested in.”Third Space has five of its 13 clubs in former department stores and forms part of the reinvention of the former Whiteleys shopping centre in Bayswater, London, where it will offer a martial arts dojo alongside cycle and yoga studios, steam rooms and a sauna.Colin Waggett, the chief executive of Third Space, says it is being offered high-quality former retail space that landlords are struggling to fill.“We are creating an attraction that is right for the here and now and what people want to be doing with their lives. With working from home, people want to get out of the house and go and do something,” he says.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryReal estateShops and shoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’d always wanted to work with animals, and I had just landed a job as a vet nurse in Melbourne. I was still learning the ropes, but I imagined I would stay there for years, building a life around the work. Then, five months in, the vet called me into his office and told me it wasn’t working out. “It’s not you,” he said, “I just really hate training people.” His previous nurse had been with him for decades; she knew his every move. I didn’t. And just like that, I was out of a job.I drove home crying, feeling utterly adrift. I wasn’t sure whether to try again at another vet clinic or rip up the plan entirely and do something else. After spending a few days floating around aimlessly, trying to recalibrate my life, I turned on the TV, needing something to take my mind off things. And there he was:Billy Connolly, striding across a windswept Scottish landscape in his World Tour of Scotland documentary.I had always liked Billy: I’d watched plenty of his standup shows on TV, laughing at his stories about growing up in Glasgow. But this was different. The programme, which had come out a few years previously, in 1994, was a love letter toScotland, full of history, humour and stunning scenery. I had never studied British or Irish history at school, so everything he was talking about – the castles, the battles, the wild coastlines – was brand new to me. I found myself completely transfixed.It wasn’t one joke or moment that got me, it was the combination of it all: his warmth, his irreverent humour and the rugged beauty of the country. I thought: I have to go there.Six months later I had saved enough money to book a trip. I flew into Edinburgh, and as soon as I stepped outside the airport I felt a jolt of recognition, as though something had clicked into place. It was like I had grown up in the wrong country. I spent the first week on a coach tour of the Highlands, then hired a car and drove around the south. I got hopelessly lost more than once – this was pre-GPS – but I loved every moment.When I returned to Melbourne, I knew I hadn’t had my fill. Two years later I applied for a UK work visa, signed up for a live-in pub job in London, and flew back across the world. The plan was to stay in London for a few months, then head up to Scotland to work and explore. Things didn’t go exactly to plan. A bar job in Scotland fell through, and I ended up following a friend to Belfast on a whim. I thought I’d stay a couple of months. I’ve now been here for 26 years.There was something about Belfast that drew me in. It was a smaller, more approachable place to build a life, and I felt people were willing to give me a chance in a way I hadn’t experienced before. I worked in a bar, and it was there that I met my future husband, who was also working there at the time. We got engaged a year later, and eventually fought a long, hard battle with the Home Office to get permanent residency, which I finally received in 2018.My parents were supportive of my decision to come here, although I think they assumed I’d be back after two years. I sometimes wonder how different my life would be if I hadn’t turned on the TV that day; if I’d just stayed home feeling sorry for myself instead of being inspired by a mouthy Glaswegian wandering around Scotland.Thanks to that chance moment 28 years ago, I have a life I love: a home, cat, a husband, and a deep connection to the UK. Without meaning to be, it was a real sliding doors moment, and a fork in the road. And I’m so glad I chose this path.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There’s actually a term for it –limerence– and this is the unsettling undercurrent of Tanya-Loretta Dee’s promising debut monologue, in which she also stars. There are very interesting ideas at play here, particularly to do with the fine line between sexual desire and something much wilder, more animalistic and untameable. But the production needs more fire and intensity. It unfolds at a slight distance and never quite pulls us deep inside this young woman’s fevered breakdown.The story revolves around Bex, who works in a Peckham party shop by day and has an awful lot of sexual fantasies by night. Into Bex’s life walks James. With his middle-class wardrobe and middle-of-the-road job, James is from a different world. At first, he is Bex’s fantasy prince. But as their relationship fractures and warps, Bex’s fantasies turn in on her, separating her from real life and the people who care about her.View image in fullscreenAbstract wasteland … Mydd Pharo’s set creates an eerie mood.Photograph: Zoe Birkbeck PhotographyDee develops an intimate rapport with the audience, helped by a flurry of witty asides. She has a good stab at bringing the other characters in Bex’s world to life, including her harassed best friend Greta, and her distant and disturbed mother (easily the most interesting character). But James is never anything more than a caricature: a bit of a brute who is easy to loathe and hard to like. That takes a lot of heat out of the production and makes Bex’s suffocating infatuation very tricky to buy into.There is also something just a little too controlled about Dee’s performance. She never lets herself off the leash. Instead, it feels as though Cheng Keng’s restless lighting design and Mydd Pharo’s abstract and moody set – a barren wasteland filled with long grass and grotty mattresses – are left to create an eerie mood never quite matched by the script or performance. Director Sophie Ellerby could have pushed things much further, surrendering to the darkness and chaos that glimmer beneath this script but are never given full expression.AtTheatre503, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSexreviewsShareReuse this content"

As she does so, she’ll join us to answer your questions.Peaches, AKA Merrill Nisker, emerged from Toronto’s underground scene in the late 1990s – her peers included Feist, her flatmate above a sex shop – but really came to fame in the early 00s after she moved to Berlin. Her debut EP, Lovertits, was a cherished item on the era’s electroclash scene but it was the a joyous, profane dance-punk track Fuck the Pain Away, from her debut album The Teaches of Peaches, that really took her into the mainstream.It began a run of brilliantly named albums – Fatherfucker, Impeach My Bush, I Feel Cream and Rub – graced by the likes of Iggy Pop, Soulwax and Kim Gordon, but there’s been a long gap since the last of those in 2015. Thankfully, the follow-up No Lube So Rude is set for release in 2026, and the first single Not In Your Mouth None of Your Business is a complete triumph: a pounding manifesto for liberation and resistance aimed at anyone trying to strip away queer rights.

For me, these early hours are an exercise in truly seeing.”‘The rainbow of colours reminded me of my childhood’: Guillaume Lavrut’s best phone pictureRead moreWhen he took this image, in 2019, he was visiting Havana,Cuba, with friends. He headed out alone at 6am to run and as he approached the waterfront Malecón promenade, the rising sun cast a glow on the city below, and this building caught his eye. “I was drawn by the distinctive architectural lines and windows, and its condition,” he notes. “All these old, majestic buildings framed people beginning to fill the streets, and classic cars cruising back and forth.”He took several shots on his phone, trying to capture the young man in red shorts passing by, when he was surprised by a speeding car of the same colour entering the frame. “It created the perfect, eclectic scene,” Jereissati says. “When I shoot, I try to weave together my own personal vision of a place, and this shot did just that. Later, we headed to the rural town of Viñales, where tobacco is the main protagonist, but my memory of this scene, and the Cuba it captures, never fades.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtCubafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s supposed to be an informal affair, but it’s necessarily been a long time in the planning because, unlike us, our guests are busy people, and hard to nail down.Besides, if you have weeks to plan a lunch it can’t be that informal – you don’t want to make it seem as if you woke up that morning still having no idea what you were going to cook, even if that is the case.“I don’t know,” my wife says. “Maybe pork?”“If they both still eat meat, that’s fine,” I say.“And then I was thinking of something with chickpeas, and spinach, and maybe tomatoes …”“This is just a list of ingredients,” I say.“Onions, peppers,” she says.“If you want me to cook something,” I say, “I have to know what it is first.”By 10.45am the meat is in the oven. I’m triangulating online recipes based on the ingredients in the shopping bag, and my wife is constructing a pear tart under my unstinting micromanagement.“How’s this?” she says.“You need to jam them in tighter than that,” I say.“They won’t fit,” she says.“One more pear,” I say. “Trust me.”By 12.30pm the table is laid. My wife has even ironed the napkins, although she hasn’t actually dragged out the ironing board; she just did them on the worktop.At 1pm the meat is resting, the pear tart is ready for the oven and everything else is in hand.“What time did they say they’d be here?” I say.“They didn’t,” my wife says. “But you know them. They’re prompt.”We wait. By 1.30pm the meat is well rested, and I’ve pushed part of the table setting aside so I can read the headlines on my laptop.“I’m hungry,” I say.The middle one, who has been lurking in the hope of cadging a free lunch, appears. ‘How long until we can just eat everything?’ he says“I don’t know what’s going on,” my wife says. “They’re never late.”“Have they forgotten?” I say. “When was the last time you spoke to them about this?”“I had a text 36 hours ago,” she says, pulling out her phone: “‘Looking forward to seeing you on Saturday.’”“Definitely this Saturday?” I say.“We settled on the date months ago,” she says.At quarter to two my wife places a call to one member of the couple, and then the other.“Straight to voicemail,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A dark bank of cloud has passed over, bringing on a premature dusk. I glance at the clock again: 2.25pm. Something dreadful occurs to me.“Are you sure that they know it’s lunch?” I say.My wife looks at me for a long moment. Then she takes out her phone and scrolls back through the whole text chain, which has its origins in the latter half of August. She looks up.“Supper,” she says. “I invited them to supper.”I find the need to spend some time with my head in my hands.Soon we will formulate a major salvage operation. The tart will go back in the fridge. The meat will get cut up and put in a big pot with absolutely everything else, creating a kind of stew I will eventually invent a name for. Then I will go out and buy some extra wine, because by suppertime I will want a lot of wine.Our friends will arrive at 7.30pm and we will all laugh at the story of our stupidity. The stew will be self-explanatory, and they will have to pretend to like it. That night I will go to bed as tired as I have been in ages; I will feel as if I’ve been cooking for an entire day.But for the moment I’m just sitting with my head in my hands, unable to speak. Finally, I open my eyes and raise my chin, because I have a question.“So,” I say. “What’s for lunch?”Join Tim Dowlingand other Guardian journalists at a special live event hosted by Nish Kumar on 26 Nov.

The musician, Davide, wears achiton(tunic), as do the guests; the mosaic floor, decorated vases and flicker of flames from the sconces add to the sense that we’ve stepped back in time.This is Moyseion, a one-of-a-kind hotel-museum in the famous troglodyte city of Matera, in Basilicata, known for itssassi– cave dwellings carved into the limestone mountainside. Every detail has been carefully designed to transport visitors to Magna Graecia, as this area of southern Italy was known when it was ruled by the ancient Greeks from the 8th-6th century BC.View image in fullscreenDreamed up by owner Antonio Panetta, an artist and lawyer turned hotelier who grew up nearby, the idea was to create “an immersive experience of history – a living work of art, where archaeology, myth and hospitality combine”. Four years in the making, it opened fully this summer in a series of restoredsassiclose to the city centre.Replicas of museum artefacts are on display, from urns to jewellery, while the handmade furniture copies designs seen on ancient pottery – three-legged tables, wall-mounted torches, vast wooden chests. Eight of the 16 stone dwellings are inspired by ancient Greece – high wooden beds, natural fabrics, cabinets with items depicting daily life of the era. They’re spacious, comfortable and remarkably calming (mod cons such as mirrors and hairdryers are carefully hidden from view). Other rooms reflect pre-Greek periods.View image in fullscreenThe lobby of hotel-museum Moyseion.Photograph: Adriano FedeleIn the basement, the Sanctuary of Waters is a multilevel spa dedicated to the goddess Demeter, evoking sacred sites of a lost world. It’s a moodily lit space with pools, statues of deities and stone basins based on Hellenistic thermal complexes. The floor mosaics are replicas of archaeological finds.But what really makes this place special is the young in-house team of archaeologists, classicists, musicians, performers, costume designers and dancers that bring everything to life with a passion for history that they’re keen to share. Staff have worked with international specialists in everything from ancient music to choreography and cuisine to ensure an authentic experience – it took a year simply to master the circular breathing needed to play theaulos, Davide tells me. Guests become part of the action as they take part in daily rituals and symposiums. I’d worried it would feel like a theme park, but as I wander around in mychiton, a musician playing a specially createdtrigonon(small triangular harp), it somehow feels magical, not gimmicky.Matera is layered with history and its location on the edge of a ravine adds to the dramaMatera itself is layered with history. Believed to be the third oldest city in the world, after Aleppo in Syria and Jericho in Palestine’s West Bank, its location on the edge of a ravine adds to the drama. We arrive at night, a bright moon hanging above the rocky limestone landscape and maze of honey-coloured streets, like a timeless nativity scene. No wonder this place has had a starring role in countless films, from Mel Gibson’s controversial The Passion of the Christ and the 2016 remake of Ben-Hur (both times standing in for Jerusalem), to James Bond’s famous car chase through the old town in No Time to Die.View image in fullscreenDavide, dressed in achiton, plays theaulos, an ancient Greek wind instrument.Photograph: Caroline GavazziWe explore thesassiwith guide Sandra, navigating the winding streets and piazzas, a jigsaw puzzle worthy of an Escher drawing. Divided into two ancient districts, Sasso Caveoso and Sasso Barisano, with the medieval Civita (old town) between, dwellings were both natural and human-made, partly dug into the rock and extended over millennia. Some were homes, some became part of the many monasteries and churches, incorporated into newer buildings that rose above them. Later, grand villas and palaces sprang up, such as Palazzo Viceconte (a Bond location), and Palazzo Malvinni Malvezzi, where Francis Ford Coppola is shooting his new film, Distant Vision, opposite the 13th-century romanesque cathedral.By the 1950s, however, the city had been dubbed the “shame of Italy” due to the poverty and unsanitary living conditions in thesassi. A 1952 law declared them uninhabitable and more than 15,000 people were moved to new, modern quarters on the outskirts of town. The cave dwellings stood empty until the late 1980s, when people slowly started moving back to restore them as hotels and restaurants. Unesco world heritage status came in 1993 and it was a European capital of culture in 2019, putting the city firmly on the tourist map.View image in fullscreenBreakfast at Moyseion.Photograph: Adriano FedeleAt every turn there is something new to gawp at. We visit the preserved cave house in Vico Solitario, which shows how life would have been when it was last inhabited in 1956 – mules and chickens living alongside the family, shelves and niches carved into the walls. We admire frescoes in churches excavated into rock – the Santa Maria de Idris and adjoining San Giovanni in Monterrone on a rocky spur with amazing views are among the most impressive.Even breakfast is an experience, the menu carefully researched and curated by food anthropologists and historiansI loveMusma, a wonderful sprawling gallery space that’s part 16th-century palazzo, part ancient cave complex, dedicated to contemporary art and sculpture. We visit artists keeping traditional crafts alive, too, weaving cloth on looms and carving wooden bread stamps, once used to imprint the owner’s initials on huge durum wheat loaves before they were cooked in the communal ovens.On a dine-with-locals experience we’re welcomed into the home of Marisa and Fernando and feast on endless plates of fried olives, bocconcini and artichoke, homemade pasta andfichi d’india(cactus fruit) as they share stories of Matera past and present. One afternoon we cross the suspension footbridge over the Gravina River to the other side of the gorge and climb to Murgia park, a vast wild rocky plateau pocked with hundreds of rupestrian churches (churches carved into rocks or cave walls). It’s the perfect vantage point to look back and watch the sunset paint the pale limestone town rose gold.View image in fullscreenA musician plays a trigonon in Moyseion’s spa, based on a Hellenistic thermal complex.Photograph: MoyseionBut it’s time spent at Moyseion and the people we meet there that stick in my mind. The ritual held in the water sanctuary each day, where we follow performers playing the lyre and recreating mythical tales of gods and goddesses; the evening symposiums where wine, music, dance and conversation are shared, as they would have been in ancient Greece.Even breakfast –akratisma– is an experience, the menu carefully researched and curated by food anthropologists and historians, and prepared by chef Vita. The table is laden with various breads and cheeses and cakes –melitouttamade with yoghurt, honey and cinnamon,plakousmade of filo pastry with ricotta, figs and walnuts. There’s barley salad with pomegranate, spreads made of wild onion, mushrooms or olives, quails’ eggs and sausage. The hotel has also started hosting courses and residencies in ancient music and dance, the first focusing on the lyre, working with Lotos Lab, a research centre in Cambridge, and world-class scholars.Matera has an important archaeological museum (closed for refurbishment during our visit), but few visitors to the city actually go, Panetta tells me. “People don’t want to just observe history and stare at things in a museum, they want to experience it in a real way,” he says. “When guests come here, they soon realise this is not Disney. The past is still alive in our souls – we want you to feel the past in the present, to make the past live again.”The trip was provided byMoyseion.

I like to order it atYau’s in Broughtonnear Scunthorpe orChi’s in Kentonin Devon, where it arrives as a small, fluffy, delicate omelette, barely able to hold itself together for the amount of vegetables woven into it. Over rice, it is a form of heaven on a Saturday night. I haven’t tried to replicate that specific joy here, but this is a homespun version, for those Saturdays when neither Chi’s nor Yau’s are within range.Mushroom egg foo yung over buttered riceYou’ll need a good nonstick pan, and make sure to cook the vegetables until there is no water left in the pan, or the omelette will become very delicate.Prep10 minCook45 minServes4350g jasmine rice80g unsalted butter4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced300g shiitake mushrooms, halved and thinly sliced4 tsp mirin2 tbsp light soy sauce, plus extra for serving8 medium eggs¼ tsp fine sea salt20g chives, finely chopped4 tbsp neutral cooking oil– I use rapeseedFor the sauce2 tbsp crispy chilli in oil2 tbsp light soy sauce2 tbsp rice vinegarFirst, cook the rice. Put it in a sieve and rinse under the cold tap until the water runs clear. Tip the rice into a pan for which you have a tight-fitting lid, add 600ml just-boiled water and bring to a boil. Cover, turn down the heat to a whisper and leave to cook for 15 minutes. Take off the heat, remove the lid, put 30g of the butter in the centre of the rice and cover again.Make the serving sauce by mixing the chilli oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar in a small bowl.Melt the remaining 50g butter in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat and, when it foams, add the garlic and mushrooms, and fry, stirring – the mushrooms will release water, so make sure to cook them until it’s all evaporated. Add the mirin and soy sauce, cook for a further minute, until the sauce evaporates, then take off the heat and leave to cool.In a bowl, whisk the eggs with the salt and two-thirds of the chives (save the rest for decoration).Once the mushrooms have cooled a little, add them to the egg bowl and mix well. Put a tablespoon of oil in the empty frying pan on a medium heat – to test it’s hot enough, put the tip of a wooden spoon in the centre of the pan: if bubbles form around it, the oil is ready.Ladle a quarter of the omelette mix into the hot oil, then move in the sides to make a roughly 15cm-diameter circle, spreading out the mushrooms evenly as you do so. Cook for about 90 seconds, or until golden brown underneath, then flip (I do this using one spatula under the omelette and another one on top) and cook for another 30 seconds. Slide out on to a plate, cover with tin foil to keep warm and repeat with the remaining oil and omelette mix.Spoon a quarter of the rice on to each of four plates, top each one with an omelette and a sprinkling of the reserved chopped chives, and serve with the chilli vinegar sauce alongside.Join Meera Sodha at a specialeventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou be the judgelive.

Reach for the acornsCranbrook, Kent:We have no culture of consuming acorns in Britain, but they have a place in my kitchen, especially in a boom year such as thisMichael WhiteSat 15 Nov 2025 00.30 ESTShareItire of hearing the term “abundance” in relation to autumn, and yet the word unavoidably reverberates as the season unfolds, until even I am tempted to use it. Wild food is everywhere, as is a frenzy of gathering and preservation, a ritualised nod to that which was once essential.Not every year is the same, though. Several species don’t fruit every autumn, but instead coordinate with others of their kind on so called mast years to produce a bumper crop: a highly evolved tactic that serves to overwhelm the frenzied gatherers, both human and animal, so enough seed will survive to germination.Currently, the Kentish Weald is awash with acorns, like pebbles on a beach, under the mature oaks that dominate the landscape and the view from my kitchen window. Pannage was the ancient and carefully managed practice of feeding pigs on this vast resource. This tradition has been etched into our landscape in the form of sunken lanes eroded by generations of driven swine. Today, the nuts are left to wildlife and a few diehard foragers.Unlike other countries, we have no culture of consuming acorns, save in the face of dire circumstances such as famine, or worse, a lack of coffee. This latter catastrophe emerged during the second world war, when roasted acorns were used as an alternative to scarce coffee beans. Their high tannin content, while giving character to hot drinks, poses a barrier to their general consumption. Though nutritionally comparable to a staple grain such as wheat, the high levels of bitter acid make untreated acorns unpalatable, and even toxic in quantity.To render oak mast edible, a process of leaching is required. Hot leaching involves boiling the shelled nuts in several changes of water until the flesh is soft and mild to taste, while cold leaching calls for their grinding and lengthy soaking in moving or repeatedly changed water. A stream is traditional, but a toilet cistern makes a practical alternative for those who can tolerate tea-coloured toilet water and associated tide lines.Despite honing the cold method whileliving on wild food, I prefer the hot water technique. As the days shorten, I adore a simple pâté combining them with wild fungi and wood sorrel, a potted homage to the season’s abundance.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsForagingCountry diaryRural affairsFoodCoffeeAutumnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The three-bedroom property, with a garage, a garden and space to extend, had an asking price of £575,000. But much of that, they felt, was based on its potential rather than its present condition.“Every room in the house needed to be ripped apart and redone,” says Murphy, a public relations executive. “The garden was borderline unusable.”The question, Murphy says, quickly became: “How do we secure this place, which fits our plans perfectly, without overstretching [our budget]?”The answer, he explains, was to be “bold but calculated”.The couple offered £35,000 under the asking price. The seller accepted immediately and Murphy says the quick agreement confirmed their hunch: the property had been overpriced to begin with.By challenging the asking price, they not only secured the home they wanted but also “freed up funds for the renovations it so clearly needed”.Across the UK, more buyers are feeling confident enough to take the same measured risk. According to the property website Zoopla, the average home now sells for about £16,000 below its listing price, while house price growth has slowed to just 1.3% year on year.View image in fullscreenThe average UK home now sells for about £16,000 below its listing price, Zoopla says.Photograph: Frank Fell/AlamySo if, like the Murphys, you have found a home that meets your criteria but see reasons to question the price, there is definitely a case for negotiation. (Which is not the same as gazundering – the much-frowned-upon practice where a homebuyer demands a reduction on the agreed purchase price at the 11th hour.)Loss aversionZoopla’s figures suggest many homeowners are still pricing properties with one foot stuck in the past. For many, their judgment is coloured by “loss aversion”, says Christian Hilber, a professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics. At a time when house prices were booming – for instance, during the mid-2000s – sellers routinely received more for their property than they originally paid for it. However, today’s economic conditions are tighter, and past optimism no longer dictates value.Some sellers genuinely believe their home warrants a high price because of all the renovations and improvements they have ploughed into it over the years.“Your home is your pride and joy, and if you’ve spent years investing in it, you’d hope it’s worth as much as possible,” says the Kent-based mortgage adviser Aggi Christou.However, the cost of living crisis and rising mortgage rates have tightened people’s budgets. This makes buyers, understandably, more discerning about what they should get for their hard-earned money.Estate agents also shape how sellers price their properties. Robin Edwards, a partner at the London-based property consultancy Curetons, says some agents may start with a slightly higher valuation “to test the market or reflect a seller’s ambitions, then adjust expectations if interest doesn’t materialise … Often it’s simply optimism meeting reality.”He says that when he is assessing a property: “I start with evidence: recent comparable sales, local demand and how long similar homes have taken to sell… Then I layer in the property’s condition and any unique positives or negatives that might affect the price. The real value isn’t what an algorithm predicts – it’s what an informed buyer is realistically willing to pay.”View image in fullscreenEstate agents shape how sellers price their properties.Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty ImagesEdwards says that, for buyers, the same logic applies. “Most sellers can tell the difference between a fair negotiation and someone trying to get away with something,” he says. A well-pitched offer shows respect for the property and the seller’s position, while a blatant lowball offer can make them defensive and less willing to engage.The key, Edwards says, is to be strategic but not speculative. “Back your offer up with facts such as survey findings or visible work that needs doing, and communicate respectfully,” he says.“Realism means understanding that value isn’t what the market once was – it’s what the numbers support right now.”The human factorRecent homebuyer Rowena Bower* agrees that emotions are “secondary” to hard metrics but she believes there is still a human factor that buyers and sellers cannot resist entirely.Bower, who works in human resources for a technology company, and her husband, an accountant, successfully bought a four-bedroom property in south-east London for £535,000 – £15,000 less than the original £550,000 listing price. They did so despite a competing higher offer.She attributes at least part of their success to a rapport with the sellers. “The owners were empty-nesters looking to downsize quickly,” she says. “We tried to make the process personal – to show we understood the home’s history, listened to their story, shared our own, and expressed that we wanted the chance to create the same memories there ourselves.”View image in fullscreenThe cost-of-living crisis and rising mortgage rates have tightened people’s budgets, so homebuyers are more discerning.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesThe couple bypassed the agent by sending a short letter directly to the sellers. “We already had the address,” she says with a laugh. They outlined their position, requested a chat and then met.“It let both sides put names and personalities to the numbers instead of just exchanging offers over email,” she says. “People forget that behind every listing there’s a person. If you can show you’re serious, genuine and respectful, your offer lands differently.”The below-asking-price offer was justified, Bower says. “We had carried out an independent survey and done our research, so we knew the property’s condition and comparable sales. At the same time, we could communicate honestly with the sellers about how every margin counts when raising a family. Building that human relationship helped them see our perspective.”However, Bower says buyers must still be “fully prepared to hear the word ‘no’”, and to accept it. “It’s fine to test the waters … But you need to be careful not to overstep. An offer too far from the asking price can undo the relationship you’ve worked to build.”Don’t ask, don’t getThe current UK housing market is more elastic than many realise. Asking prices ask, rather than dictate, a value.When confidence returns and the economy strengthens, the balance of power in the housing market is likely to flip againChristian Hilber, a London School of Economics professorAs long as you have done your homework, why not make your case? The worst outcome is a polite refusal. Even a relatively small percentage reduction can save thousands and, as Christou highlights, “make a tangible difference – whether that means [more money for] decorating or simply affording the mortgage, deposit or stamp duty more comfortably.”Now is the time to act. Hilber says the spate of sellers accepting lower offers is likely to be “a temporary response to the current environment … When confidence returns and the economy strengthens, the balance of power in the housing market is likely to flip again.”With supply still constrained, even modest increases in demand could push prices higher.For the time being, it is a buyer’s market. As the adage goes: if you don’t ask, you don’t get.*Nameshave been changedExplore more on these topicsPropertyHouse pricesHousing marketConsumer affairsReal estatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She told the company of his death and was stunned that the quotes then increased by up to 15%.Her car insurance quote went from £301 to £348, while her home and contents policy rose by almost 12% – from £1,039 to £1,161.“When I asked why, Ageas was unable to give me any reason other than ‘that’s what comes up on the screen’,” she says.“I was already the lead name on both policies and nothing else has changed. How can such decisions come at a time when the surviving partner is in no fit state to argue the toss, and also when a household’s income is likely to be reduced?”Newly bereaved customers face paying a premium in their grief as analysts say that many insurers regard a single policyholder as higher risk.Divorced and separated couples are also affected by this.I can’t get Allianz to refund travel insurance though my partner has diedRead moreThe little-known policy is based on algorithms that match individuals to the claims history of customers with similar profiles. Age, profession and marital status can affect pricing but this bereavement penalty has been denounced as particularly insensitive by customers adjusting to the loss of a partner.Alison Roper* was informed that her home and buildings insurance would cost more when her husband died.“They explain that your property is likely to be left less well attended when there is only one of you, even if, as in my case, you have two large dogs,” she says. “As for the car insurance, my husband was not named on the policy as he was no longer able to drive, but the price still increased.”Another new widow contacted the Guardian when her renewal quote increased by about £440 after her husband died.“Their home and contents policy with SwintonInsurancewas in both their names, but dad was the main policyholder,” says her son Steve Elliott*. “The renewal quote was just over £200, but when Swinton heard dad had died, it became £641. I explained that nothing else has changed and that my mum was being charged £441 more for losing her husband. They blamed the system and said they could do nothing about it.”View image in fullscreenAgeaos says joint policyholders are statistically less risky than solo ones and therefore receive a discount. This is forfeited when one of them dies.Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/AlamyThe family has since accepted a quote for £229 from another insurance company.According to the Association of British Insurers, providers are free to make commercial decisions on the prices they offer based on their risk appetite, and any change in personal circumstances can affect this. It declined to answer why a driver with a history of no claims is considered riskier once they live alone, or how widespread the bereavement premium is.When contacted by the Guardian, Swinton apologised for the distress and said it will offer compensation. “Our agent should have escalated the matter to our underwriting team for further review,” a spokesperson says. “We are addressing this with the team to ensure learning and improvement.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is forfeited when one of them dies.“We understand that removing this discount could cause additional distress to bereaved customers who have lost a partner or spouse since their last renewal,” says its chief underwriting officer, Thomas Quirke. “To prevent this, we have a specific process in place to ensure that the joint policyholder discount is not removed when the policy comes up for renewal.”Ageas acknowledged its process had failed in Lawley’s case. It has now refunded the additional premiums it had charged and sent her a bouquet of flowers. However, she will lose the discount when her policies are next renewed, “to reflect the true risk of being a sole policyholder in both motor and home insurance”.She says: “I’m discovering that very little has changed in the past 30 years, and being a single person still comes with a premium, whether it’s insurance costs or travel deals. I had hoped that the world might have moved on from its bias towards coupledom, but clearly not.”Fairer Financesays that insurers’ opaque pricing practices are undermining public trust, and that the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence to calculate premiums is making things worse. The campaign group wants government and regulators to insist on more transparency.“These cases highlight the lack of humanity that sits within many insurers’ pricing algorithms,” says its managing director, James Daley. “Even if there is a statistical basis for these decisions, they lack sensitivity – and it’s all the worse that insurers are unable to explain the reasoning to customers because their pricing models are viewed as a trade secret.“Current pricing practices are undermining consumer trust, and the use of AI means that complexity is accelerating.”* Nameshave been changedExplore more on these topicsInsuranceBereavementCar insuranceMotoringInsurance industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like Ebola, it causes severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and has a 21-day incubation period.Also like Ebola, it is transmitted via contact with body fluids and has a fatality rate of between 25% and 80%.The head of the World Health Organization, Ethiopia’s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, confirmed on Friday that at least nine cases had been detected in southern Ethiopia, two days afterAfricaCDC was alerted to a suspected haemorrhagic virus in the region.“Marburg virus disease (MVD) has been confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory (in Ethiopia),” Africa CDC said on Saturday.“Further epidemiological investigations and laboratory analyses are under way and the virus strain detected shows similarities to those previously identified in east Africa.”It said Ethiopian health authorities had acted swiftly to confirm and contain the outbreak in the Jinka area.It said it would work with Ethiopia to ensure an effective response and to reduce the risk of the virus spreading to other parts of east Africa.An epidemic of Marburg virus killed 10 people inTanzaniain January before being terminated in March.Rwanda said in December 2024 it had managed to stamp out its first known Marburg epidemic, which caused 15 deaths.There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for the Marburg virus, but oral or intravenous rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms increases patients’ chances of survival.Last year, Rwanda trialled an experimental vaccine from the US-based Sabin Vaccine Institute.Explore more on these topicsEthiopiaAfricaTanzanianewsShareReuse this content"

But Australian export data has no detail on what weapons have been supplied to the UAE and in what quantity.What is clear is that the UAE is – by far – the largest export market for Australian defence companies.Separate figures from the UN Comtrade database show the UAE has received “arms and ammunition, parts and accessories” valued at USD$197m from Australia over the past five years.Australian exports of ‘arms and ammunition, parts and accessories’ 2020-2024. Source: United Nations ComtradeThe UN figures also suggest Australia has been the UAE’s fourth-largest supplier of weapons over that same five-year period.But there is mounting evidence theUAE is arming the RSF, largely in exchange forgold. An estimated90% of Sudan’s gold–worth about USD$13.4bn– is smuggled illegally out of the country, dwarfing the legitimate trade:most of it goes to the UAE.A UN panel of experts detailed in April aheavy rotation of cargo planesflying out of the UAE, reportedlycarrying weapons, ammunitionand medical equipment to the RSF via Chad.At Sydney’s mighty arms convention, weapons are sold as ‘solutions’. No one mentions the people they will targetRead moreThe UAE has denied any involvement in trafficking weapons, insisting its flights werehumanitarian missions, carrying supplies for a field hospital, sewing machines, and Qu’rans.But British-made target systems and armoured personnel carrier engines have beenrecovered from combat sitesin Sudan. Bulgaria has also said weapons it supplied to the UAE werere-exported without permission.The UAE military itself has previously been accused of war crimes and violating arms embargos – includingin YemenandLibya. The UAE denies the allegations.Government supports expanded defence salesDespite concerns from human rights groups, the Australian government believes the defence relationship with the UAE can be expanded further.In a note to defence companies last month,Austrade said the“UAE’s extensive and ongoing defence procurement program represents real opportunities for Australian suppliers”.The government has covered costs for dozens of companies to showcase their products “face-to-face with the UAE ministry of defence” in Dubai.“At least one retired senior ADF officer will be on hand to lead the delegation,” a government briefing paper says.“They offer advice and support well as the key credibility of being in uniform.”The Green senator David Shoebridge told the Guardian the Australian government had been green-lighting weapons sales to the UAE for the past five years “at an astonishing scale”, with almost no transparency.Australian exports of ‘arms and ammunition’ to the United Arab Emirates. Source: Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade“When you start selling weapons to regimes like the UAE, what do you think is going to happen? Those weapons are going to end up in some of the bloodiest conflicts in the world.“We know the UAE has been sending arms to the RSF inSudan. The public has had zero assurances from the Albanese Government that Australian weapons are not being used and abused in places like Darfur.”This month, religious group Quakers Australia wrote to the foreign minister, Penny Wong, arguing Australia could not be confident – because of the opacity of its arms export regime – that Australian-made weapons were not being diverted to armed groups elsewhere.One man’s story inside the siege of El Fasher, Sudan - podcastRead moreThe Medical Association for the Prevention of War, along with other civil society organisations, have also called for anurgent parliamentary reviewof Australia’s arms exports, arguing the current export regime lacks accountability.Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Australia had an obligation under international law to ensure its military trade did not contribute to human rights abuses.“But Australia doesn’t have laws on the books that require it to monitor where and how these exports are used once exported,” said the HRW’s Australia director, Daniela Gavshon.‘Impossible’ to prove weapons haven’t been used in SudanA spokesperson for the Australian defence department said it had “a rigorous and transparent export controls framework that is consistent with international obligations”.The spokesperson said Australian law addressed “a range of issues including foreign policy, human rights, national security, regional security and Australia’s international obligations including the Arms Trade Treaty”. Laws also came into effect last year to provide greater oversight over the transfer of “controlled goods” to foreign entities.Defence did not answer questions on if and how arms were monitored once exported to the UAE.The Australian government has condemned the atrocities in Sudan and urged a three-month “humanitarian truce”. Wong was a signatory to ajoint statementfrom 27 countries, which said they are “gravely alarmed by the reports of systematic and ongoing violence against civilians”.The embassy of the United Arab Emirates did not respond to questions.Philipp Kastner, senior lecturer in international law at the University of Western Australia, told the Guardian that while confirming Australian-made weapons have been re-exported to Sudan was difficult, “I would say that it is impossible to confirm the contrary: that these weapons have definitelynotbeen used in Sudan.”Kastner argued weapons do not bring peace. “It may be an increasingly lucrative business for Australian companies, but we should ask ourselves, as a society, if it is really through the manufacturing of weapons that we want to increase our wealth.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsArms tradeUnited Arab EmiratesSudanHuman rightsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Prof Kenneth Ngure, president-elect of the International Aids Society, said: “The Global Fund saves lives every day through its work on HIV, tuberculosis and malaria and is estimated to have saved deaths from these three diseases by half since 2002.“While the final outcome of the replenishment is still to be determined, any reduction in support will have consequences – forcing African countries to make impossible choices as they strive to protect the most vulnerable.”Ngure, based in Kenya, said he was also concerned that funding cuts could compromise the rollout of new drugs widely considered to bepotential gamechangersin preventing HIV.Joy Phumaphi, executive secretary of the African LeadersMalariaAlliance, said the UK’s continued commitment was welcome, but that the drop would “have real consequences across Africa; fewer bed nets, medicines and diagnostics reaching those most in need”.Research published in October suggesteda 20% cut to the overall Global Fund would result in 330,000 additional deaths by 2040 from malaria alone. The fund provides 59% of international financing for malaria.Phumaphi added: “As co-hosts of this replenishment, the UK has a chance to reaffirm its global leadership by investing in stronger, more resilient health systems that benefit millions.”John Plastow, executive director at Frontline Aids, a global partnership, said: “We expected a stronger show of leadership, reflecting a proud UK legacy of support to the global goal of ending Aids.“There is a danger that this drop in its pledge will lead to reductions in other donor commitments, with real risks for people’s lives and for the global response to HIV.”Three countries boost family planning funding in ‘powerful shift from dependency’ in Africa after aid cutsRead moreHe added: “We urge the UK to make an explicit commitment to increase its Global Fund pledge later in the course of this three-year replenishment, when it is able to source additional funding.”Adrian Lovett, UK executive director of the One campaign, suggested the money could come from £74m saved byreducing the cost of hotel accommodation for asylum seekersin the UK. He said: “Ministers should use those funds to top up this Global Fund pledge, helping to save more lives and increasing the chances of a successful replenishment in Johannesburg.”Dr Andriy Klepikov, director of Ukraine’s Alliance for PublicHealth, said the Global Fund enabled more than half a million Ukrainians to access HIV and TB services during the war. He said: “Each of these people counts on the eighth replenishment outcomes; their lives depend on the pledge from the UK and other countries.”However, Klepikov said he was “thankful for the UK’s generous contribution in the current challenging context”, adding: “With such a contribution, UK confirms its leadership in global health.”The Gates Foundation is a major private contributor to the Global Fund.

This, she said, “can generate recommendations for the final text of this conference”. The idea would be that this is then picked up as a theme for future Cops.View image in fullscreenSonia Guajajara says Cop30 could help the Amazon and its peoples by means of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility.Photograph: André Penner/APGuajajara was speaking to the Guardian beforepeaceful protests outside the conference centre in Belém on Friday morning by Indigenous peoplebrought the Cop30 talks to a brief halt. Protesters gathered outside the entrance, peacefully blocking the way for delegates. After only about two hours of mild disruption, though with a heavy police and military presence, during which delegates had to use a side entrance, entry to the conference resumed as normal.Guajajara warned that countries must maintain the rights of Indigenous people, while mining interests seek to exploit the“critical minerals” necessary to manufacture the renewable energy and other low-carbon equipmentneeded to solve the climate crisis.The Tapajós and many other of the Amazon’s great rivers have been contaminated by the mercury used in gold extraction. Moves are under way to open up Yanomami territory – the largest Indigenous lands inBrazil– to industrial mining. With critical minerals and gold increasing in value due to the energy transition and expansion of telecommunications, Brazil’s congress, which is dominated by agribusiness and mining interests, is pushing for further exploration.‘Change course now’: humanity has missed 1.5C climate target, says UN headRead moreGuajajara told the Guardian: “We are working hard here to prevent the exploitation of these territories. Our federal constitution guarantees the exclusive right to the territories of Indigenous peoples … We have to talk and persuade congress not to approve these plans.”She also said one of the central ways the summit could benefit the Amazon and its peoples is through theTropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), which was launched last week in Belém.The fund is intended to help countries with large existing forested areas to keep them standing. Most forestry finance is only available to areas already afflicted by deforestation, and there are no other global mechanisms to compensate countries that forgo the short-term financial gains from logging, ranching, or converting forests to plantations.The TFFF is one of the main outcomes that Brazil hopes for from Cop30, and about $5.5bn (£4.2bn) has so far been pledged to it. Lula is hoping for $25bn from public funds, to be used to raise a further $100bn in the financial markets.Guajajar said it was “regrettable”the UK had decided not to invest in the forest protection fund that it helped to create.The UK was among 10 countries that helped to design the Brazilian initiative. City of London consultants built some of its initial financial models, and British diplomats have championed the plan. Prince William’s Earthshot prize put the TFFF on its shortlist. But shortly before it was formally unveiled, the British government announced that it would not be among the initial investors.“It is regrettable that Britain is not contributing resources,” said Guajajara. “They were signalling, before the Cop, that they would certainly contribute resources.”One veteran climate summit observer said this incident had cooled relations between Brazil and the UK, which was regrettable because these two countries should be working closely together to achieve a positive outcome at Cop30.Environment minister Marina Silva also struck a diplomatic note, telling the Guardian she hoped the UK would come to see the TFFF as a worthwhile investment.Another nation that was expected to invest in the TFFF was China. Last week, it expressed support and said it would join, but it did not quantify its commitment.One possible cause of its hesitation is that China’s longheld position is that rich, industrialised nations bear the financial responsibility for tackling the climate crisis because they are primarily responsible for causing it.Silva said this was understandable. “For a long time we have had to fight developed countries to fulfil their obligations under the Paris agreement, which has not happened until today.” But she said TFFF was different: “Each country has its own strategy about what they think is important to not open precedents of developing countries making donations. But in the case of the TFFF, it is not a donation. It is an investment.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Indigenous peoplesDeforestationGreenhouse gas emissionsBrazilAmericasTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

Japan has since said its position on Taiwan – just 100km from thenearest Japanese island– is unchanged.In a post online on Friday, China’s embassy inJapanwarned its citizens against travelling to the country.Two hours a night: Japan PM’s sleep schedule prompts concerns about work-life balanceRead more“Recently, Japanese leaders have made blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan, severely damaging the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges,” the WeChat post read.The situation presented “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan”, it added.“The ministry of foreign affairs and the Chinese embassy and consulates in Japan solemnly remind Chinese citizens to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future.”Beijing said it had summoned Japan’s ambassador, while Tokyo said it had summoned China’s ambassador after an “inappropriate” and now-removed online post from the Chinese consul general in Osaka, Xue Jian.In the since-removed statement on social media, Xue posted about “(cutting) off that dirty neck”, apparently referring to Takaichi. Japan’s ruling party has since passed a resolution calling for the envoy to be declared persona non grata.Beijing insists Taiwan – which Japan occupied for decades until 1945 – is part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to seize control. China and Japan are key trading partners, but historical mistrust and friction over territorial rivalries and military spending often test those ties.Takaichi,a conservative and China hawk, has toned down her rhetoric since assuming office last month. But her comments last week that an armed attack on Taiwan could warrant sending troops to the island under “collective self-defence” have put the two countries at odds.If an emergency in Taiwan entails “battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival [of Japan], any way you slice it”, she said.Security legislation passed in 2015 allows Japan to exercise the right to “collective self-defence” under certain conditions, including if there is a clear danger to the country’s survival.Despite the escalating diplomatic spat, Takaichi has since indicated she has no intention of retracting her statement and insisted it was consistent with Tokyo’s longstanding policy. But she said she would refrain from referring to specific scenarios in the future.Previous sitting Japanese prime ministers have avoided commenting directly on Taiwan’s defence, choosing instead to maintain so-called strategic ambiguity. The US has long been similarly deliberately ambiguous on whether it would deploy its military to defend Taiwan.Explore more on these topicsJapanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But,as Guardian Australia reported, Net Zero Australia issued a statement saying the cost estimatesin its reporthad been misrepresented.Former Liberal MPs deride net zero dumping as ‘nail in the coffin’ that may prolong pain in urban seatsRead moreThe academics found the additional cost of building an energy system to reach net zero emissions by 2050 would actually be about $300bn. That calculation did not factor in the cost of adapting to the climate crisis or repairing climate-related damage if emissions were not cut.Many studies have found the cost of inaction would be far more than the cost of acting.The $9tn figure refers to the potential capital investment between now and 2060 for energy developments within Australia, and for export developments.This investment would create industries and a huge number of jobs. Net Zero Australia said the “large majority” of the investment should be underwritten by overseas customers, not Australian taxpayers.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterHas the net zero target caused electricity price rises since 2022?No.The Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, said on Thursday that power bills had increased about 40% since Labor was elected – a figure apparently drawn froma report by the Page Research Centre, a thinktank with links to the Nationals. She suggested the increase was due to investment in renewable energy built to meet emissions reduction targets.Many long-term energy industry analysts disagree. Tony Wood, a senior fellow at the Grattan Institute and former Origin Energy executive, says the price increase had “almost nothing to do with renewable energy”.Power bills spiked by about 20% in 2022-23 after Russia invaded Ukraine, pushing up global gas prices. Gas power was already the most expensive form of electricity in the national grid, and routinely set the price for other types of generation.The rise was also caused by a jump in coal prices after flooding at east coast mines. And there was less generation in the power grid – and therefore less competition to keep prices down – due to outages at ageing coal power plants.2:17What does net zero emissions actually mean? And is it different to the Paris agreement? – videoPart of the increase after 2022 can also be explained by a rebound in prices after they were suppressed during the Covid-19 pandemic, when demand for electricity was down. Inflation has an impact each year.Askedon the ABC’s RN Breakfastwhat evidence he had that renewable energy was making electricity more expensive for consumers, Dan Tehan, the shadow minister for energy and emissions reduction, said: “Because people are seeing it every single day in their electricity bills.”Which isn’t an answer.Paul Simshauser and Joel Gilmore, from Griffith University’s Centre for Applied Energy Economics and Policy Research,found that the opposite was true– that the cost of generating electricity could be up to 50% higher had Australia relied solely on coal and gas and not pursued renewable energy.Dylan McConnell, a senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales, says the power grid needs to be rebuilt, and that will be more expensive than plants built decades ago.The key question is: what is the cheapest option to minimise price rises in developing a reliable future grid? Analyses by government agencies and academic institutions have consistently found it is renewable energy plusfirming support,even as costs estimates evolve.Could Australia stay in the Paris agreement if it abandoned emissions targets?Technically, yes. It won’t be forced out.But it would be in clear breach of what was agreed in the French capital in 2015.Article 4.3 of the Paris agreementsays countries will make successive commitments that “represent a progression” and “reflect its highest possible ambition”. That is, they must become more ambitious and there can be no backsliding.The main goal of the Paris agreement is to hold average global heating to well below 2C above preindustrial levels, and to “pursue efforts” to limit it to 1.5C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has looked at what meeting the 1.5C goal would involve. It found it would need a 45% global emissions cut between 2010 and 2030, and reaching net zero “around 2050”.The Coalition position is obviously at odds with this. Ley is promising a government she leads would “remain committed” to the Paris agreement while working against what it was meant to achieve.Some people might interpret that as leaving the agreement in all but name.Did emissions come down while the Coalition was in power?Yes. But not due to its policies.According to governmentgreenhouse accounts, annual emissions dropped about 21% between 2013 and 2022.Plan for Australia’s largest carbon capture project near Darwin criticised as creating ‘dumping ground’Read moreThe majority of this was due to changes in how much carbon dioxide was being absorbed by forests and the land. It increased significantly. Experts say this was mainly due to state governments and market pressure reducing the amount of land-clearing and native forest logging as well as a major drought ending – not federal policy.Remove the role of nature from the equation and climate pollution fell only 3% over the nine years. This was mostly due to a surge in renewable energy investment to meet a 2020 renewable energy target that was expanded when Labor was in power.Famously, the then prime minister Tony Abbottconsidered scrapping the targetin 2014, but did not have the votes in the Senate to do it. Instead, the target was reduced.There was also asharp drop in transport emissions during Covid-19as people drove and flew less. Presumably, the Coalition does not claim credit for this.Otherwise, emissions from transport, heavy industry, manufacturing and mining increased.Can carbon capture and storage (CCS) help cut emissions quickly?There is no reason to think so.Tehan said CCS – capturing emissions and injecting them underground – could “provide immediate relief when it comes to emissions reduction”.The evidence says otherwise. Governments have committed billions of dollars over decades to support CCS developments with little result.According to arecent report by the Global CCS Institute, there are 77 projects in operation, mostly to justify ongoing use of fossil fuels by capturing a fraction of the pollution at a site.Combined, they are claimed to capture up to 64m tonnes of CO2a year.If they deliver, that’s about 0.17% of global emissions.And they don’t always deliver.Also: nearly half of these CCS projects are used for “enhanced oil recovery”, which means the greenhouse gas is pumped underground to help extract more oil – a fossil fuel.Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor and writes theClear AirnewsletterExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisLiberal partyCoalitionanalysisShareReuse this content"

It strikes an umbrella, which was being used by one protester to avoid being sprayed with oleoresin capsicum (OC) foam, and lands on the road. For about a second, it seems to be either unnoticed or ignored.Then it explodes.The stinger grenade is designed as a crowd-control device. It makes a loud noise, creates a blinding flash and fires rubber projectiles.According to its manufacturer, some versions of the grenade can also discharge chemical agents or OC spray, but it is unclear which model is used by Victoria police.View image in fullscreenA US Customs and Border Protection officer throws a stinger grenade at community members pushing back against their attempt to raid a store in California in June.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is one of a suite of “less lethal” options embraced by police for use at protests in the past five years, despite such weapons being linked to a series of serious injuries or even deaths, including a woman in France who researchers found lost an eye because of a stinger grenade.The use of stinger grenades by police has also led to legal action by protesters, includingin the US, after they were used during Black Lives Matter rallies.‘It’s a bad day for Melbourne’At hospital later that day, Scout realised they had burns near their knee and groin, even though they were wearing pants. What felt like hot metal had torn holes straight through them. They also had a burn on their right wrist.In the next three days these burns became ringed with bruises, the colour of overripe banana. Scout says x-rays were carried out over concern that the skin may have been penetrated by shrapnel.View image in fullscreenA burn on Scout’s leg after the Melbourne protestAbout the same time Scout was in hospital, Supt Wayne Cheesman was lashing the behaviour of the counter-protesters in the city that day, including those who allegedly threw rocks at officers. He said a group were repeatedly violent against his officers, several of whom had been injured, and police have subsequently released photos of people – none of which included Scout – wanted for questioning.He also said at the time that no injuries to protesters had been reported to police.Cheesman, however, confirmed that police had used two stinger grenades and four flash-bang devices, along with rubber bullets and VKS Pepperball guns – pellets of pepper spray fired from a semi-automatic “launcher”.“It’s a bad day when we’re using those things, it’s a bad day for Victoria police, it’s a bad day for Melbourne, it’s a bad day for our community, we don’t want to be in that position,” Cheesman said.“But at the same time I don’t think our members should be target practice for people who want to hurt us.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailScout says they had not been violent towards police, and had been standing with a group – including media photographers – when the explosion occurred. They are one of two people considering legal action against police for injuries caused by the 19 October explosion, near the intersection of Spring and Little Bourke streets.Footage shows that neither Scout nor the other person considering legal action were resisting police at the time they were injured.Guardian Australia also spoke to a photographer who does not know the pair but was nearby when the grenade exploded. He said police had not shouted any warnings or given any indication the device would be used before it detonated. No such warnings can be heard on the footage.The photographer, speaking on the condition of anonymity given the nature of his work, confirmed that he had also felt debris from the explosion but had not required medical attention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He says the head of the grenade, the lever and its body could all cause serious injury if “expelled” with sufficient energy.“Fragments are expelled in a completely random pattern, and so it is impossible to reduce the risk of hitting a vulnerable part of the body,” Corney says.He says he believes that the use of OC spray by other police at the scene was successful at moving some protesters on. Scout was not targeted by the spray.“The officer throws it underarm but it is released from his hand in the air, not rolled along the ground,” Corney says. “This is dangerous at such short range, as the risk is it explodes in the air, and with people moving it may detonate in their face …“In this incident there is no immediate threat to the officer themself, not to any other officers in the immediate area.”‘Indiscriminate’ use of forceThe force’s own guidelines state that when stinger grenades, known as crowd control munitions are used, police “should consider, and where practicable, facilitate immediate access to medical attention”.“If any person is injured … the Police Forward Commander must arrange after care or medical attention at the earliest opportunity,” the guidelines say.Scout says there was no such offer on 19 October.View image in fullscreenFootage shows that Scout was not resisting police at the time they were injuredPolice are understood to believe the device was used in line with its guidelines.Victoria police were asked a series of questions about the incident and stinger grenades, including details about how many projectiles they contain, the intended use of the devices, and whether the officer who used the device had completed a “use of force” report and a CCM debrief report that “incorporates human rights considerations” as required under its guidelines.‘Like being stabbed in the eye’: the risk of serious injury by police at protests is escalating, experts warnRead more“Police do not attend protests with the aim of using this tactical equipment, but it is always in response to the actions of protesters whether it be violence between different groups, or towards officers,” a spokesperson said in their response.“Officers working at protests have reported being threatened, hit with objects such as bottles and rocks, and being grabbed, pushed or held.“Any sort of violent and disruptive behaviour in our community is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by police.”Jeremy King from the law firm Robinson Gill, which is representing Scout and another protester, says the footage shows “how indiscriminate the police use of force is and how police almost inevitably employ a one-size-fits-all approach to policing protests”.King says there are legitimate reasons for police to use force at protests, such as when people ignore directions or are violent, but points to a lack of oversight in determining whether that force is reasonable.“What is the lawful purpose of a stinger grenade, given force should only be used by police to affect something?” he said.“What are they actually seeking to do here?

Now federal Labor is about to make the same mistakes, critics warnOffsets were meant to be a last resort for mitigating environmental damage from development projects, but rapidly became the defaultFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastLisa CoxSat 15 Nov 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 18.45 ESTShareThe federal government risks repeating grievous mistakes made in NSW with its proposals to change the way developers compensate for damage to the environment, scientists and legal experts have warned.As the Coalitiontears itself apart again over climate, Labor’s plan to overhaul biodiversity offsets – andnature laws more broadly– has coasted under the radar with comparatively little scrutiny.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe plan includes a proposal to establish a “restoration contributions” fund that developers could pay into rather than doing their own work to find a suitable project to compensate for harm their projects cause.The legislation before parliament would also overturn a ban on offsets forming part of the federal nature market under adeal reached with the Greenstwo years ago.But Rachel Walmsley, deputy director of policy and law reform at the Environmental Defenders Office, said the proposals would replicate a flawed system at the national level despite “so much evidence of the problems” in NSW and other jurisdictions.Environmental offsets allow developers to compensate for the damage they cause by restoring habitat for the same species or ecosystem elsewhere.It is a system of balance sheet calculations – literally – where harm to habitat is approved on a promise to even the ledger with actions that deliver an equal or greater benefit.Offsets are meant to be a last resort after all efforts to avoid or mitigate damage to nature have been attempted.But as the former competition watchdog chief Graeme Samuel found in his 2020 review of national environmental laws, they have become the default policy by which most developments with significant affects on endangered species are approved.Problems with the system include offsets that arenever delivered or are insufficient, offsets on land thatalready had environmental protectionsand restoration activities (meaning there is little to no extra benefit derived from the offset), and integrity and conflict of interest concerns that have largely escaped the watch of corporate regulators.In NSW developers have the option of finding and securing an offset themselves or buying offsets on a market where “credits” for specific ecosystems and species are attached to properties where the landholder is undertaking conservation work.Developers can also pay into a fund managed by the state’s BiodiversityConservationTrust, which then inherits the task of finding offsets that meet the developer’s obligations.In 2021,Guardian Australia exposed a litany of failuresin this NSW scheme, triggering several investigations.Anauditor general reportfound the government had no strategy for ensuring the offset market delivered the required environmental outcomes. The auditor and a separate parliamentary inquiry found the money developers were paying into the fund managed by the trust was outstripping the supply of available offsets or credits.In plain terms, development was occurring that harmed nature, money was accumulating in the fund because there were not enough offsets to compensate for that harm and species were being pushed closer to extinction.Subsequent reviews by the NSW Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal have made similar findings and the NSW government has nowtaken steps to limitthe circumstances in which developers can pay into the fund.Dr Megan Evans, an expert on offsetting at the University of NSW, warned the federal legislation in its current form would replicate the problems seen at state level.“We know from experience … that pay-and-go offset schemes do not work because impacts to threatened biodiversity continue to be approved and then the state is liable for spending the money to buy offsets which are then too scarce, nonexistent – because there’s no habitat left – or expensive”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like-for-like rules require an environmental benefit to be delivered for the same species or ecosystem harmed by a development.Prof Brendan Wintle from the Biodiversity Council said last week the proposal was “absurd”.“You’re basically saying you can trade koalas with a land snail in Tasmania or a small plant in north Queensland,” Wintle said.Biodiversity is in catastrophic decline. Here are three ways to ensure Australia’s conservation law actually works | Atticus Fleming and Andrew MacintoshRead moreAnother element of the legislation would create a “top-up” provision to draw on taxpayer funds where contributions from developers fall short. Wintle’s colleague at the council, Prof Martine Maron, said this would leave taxpayers holding the bill for environmental destruction when the responsibility for that cost should fall to the developers that cause it.Some ecosystems and species were so endangered there were “serious limits to what we can actually offset”, Maron said.She said the use of offsets should be limited to cases where their environmental benefits were guaranteed and they would not simply facilitate further decline of species and ecosystems to a point that they cannot recover.“Turning offsets into an easy payment option flips the whole logic of environmental protection on its head,” she said.Guardian Australia sought comment from the environment minister Murray Watt.Explore more on these topicsEndangered habitatsEndangered speciesConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The agreement was seen as a boost for Orbán, who has been in power for 15 years, during uncertain economic times for the country.According to insiders, another of Orbán’s priorities for the trip was to persuade Trump to visitHungaryfor a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, with whom Orbán has maintained ties, despite anger from other European governments.Orbán’s claims of Trump summit triumph mask growing doubts over his grip on powerRead moreThe Hungarian leader has repeatedly warned of the risks of an ever-spiralling war, and Orbán will be hoping the “anti-war” message can undercut his opposition before the elections, which are due to take place in April next year.But Péter Magyar, a former Fidesz insider whose Tisza party is now leading in some independent polls, had organised another event in Győr on the same day. “Fidesz is the party of war and hatred, while Tisza works for peace at home and around the world,” he said in a Facebook post.Orbán has positioned himself as the voice of reason against what he says is a failed EU-led campaign to arm Ukraine. But his detractors at home and in the EU believe that the rightwing politician is too close to Putin and have called him the Kremlin’s “Trojan horse” in the bloc.Last month, Orbán led a “peace march” in which he told thousands in the crowd that Hungary was “the only country inEuropestanding up for peace”.Relations between Budapest and Kyiv have deteriorated over Hungary blocking steps towards Ukraine’s accession to the EU, as well as Orbán’s refusal to impose sanctions onRussia.The issue of Ukraine, which shares a border with Hungary, has regularly played into domestic politics. Pro-Fidesz media have accused Magyar of collaborating with the Ukrainian secret service, calling him “the Hungarian Zelenskyy”.This year, billboards have been erected in Hungary depicting a sinister-looking Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, alongside the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, with the caption: “They would take Ukraine in the EU. We would pay the price.”Vlada, a 23-year-old Ukrainian woman living in Hungary, said: “When families come here from the frontlines, where they’ve been under bombardment for years, these posters can trigger bad feelings again.” She asked only to use her first name to protect her identity and the people close to her, some of whom still live under Russian occupation in Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t send any weapons, but they help organise peace conferences, with reconstruction,” Vlada said.The topic of “peace” is expected to become a central narrative in Fidesz’s re-election campaign. Fidesz may try to “turn the election into a referendum on war and foreign policy”, said Dániel Róna, a political scientist and director of the independent 21 Research Centre. But Mátyás Bódi, an expert at the independent analytics group Electoral Geography, said the question was “whether that will be enough in the midst of a cost of living crisis”.Electoral Geography’s polling indicates a 7% lead for Tisza.After 15 years of Fidesz rule, Hungarians are struggling with inflation, a failing healthcare system, and deepening problems in education – areas where voters now trust Tisza more, Bódi noted, citing recent research from the independent pollster Policy Solutions.Orbán still holds an advantage on foreign policy, especially on peace and migration. “But we don’t see parties winning elections based on foreign policy,” Bódi said.Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

More people are reading and speaking English, and fewer are reading in Icelandic, a trend she says is being exacerbated by the way language models are trained.She made the comments before her appearance at the Iceland Noir crime fiction festival in Reykjavík after the surprise release of her second novel of the genre, which she co-wrote with Ragnar Jónasson.“A lot of languages disappear, and with them dies a lot of value[and] a lot of human thought,” she said. Icelandic has only about 350,000 speakers and is among the world’s least-altered languages.“Having this language that is spoken by so very few, I feel that we carry a huge responsibility to actually preserve that. I do not personally think we are doing enough to do that,” she said, not least because young people in Iceland “are absolutely surrounded by material in English, on social media and other media”.Katrín has said that Iceland has been “quite proactive” in pushing for AI to be usable in Icelandic. Earlier this month, Anthropic announced a partnership with Iceland’s ministry of education, one of the world’s first national AI education pilots. The partnership is a nationwide pilot across Iceland – giving hundreds of teachers across Iceland access to AI tools.During her time in government, Katrín said they could see the “threats and dangers of AI” and the importance of ensuring that Icelandic texts and books were used to train it.View image in fullscreenKatrín and Ragnar’s second book is set in the small village of Fáskrúðsfjörður, in eastern Iceland, in 1989.Photograph: Arctic Images/AlamyRagnar Jónasson, her co-author, agreed that the language was in grave danger. “We are just a generation away from losing this language because all of these huge changes,” he said.“They are reading more in English, they are getting their information from the internet, from their phones, and kids in Iceland are even conversing in English sometimes between themselves.”Citing what happened when Iceland was under Danish rule until 1918, when the Icelandic language was subjected to Danish influence, Katrín said changes could happen “very quickly”.“We have seen that before here in Iceland because we of course were under the Danes for quite a long time and the Danish language had a lot of influence on the Icelandic language.”Thatchange, however, was turned around rapidly by a strong movement by Icelanders, she added.“Maybe we need a stronger movement right now to talk about why do we want to preserve the language? That is really the big thing that we should be talking about here in Iceland,” she said, adding that the “fate of a nation” could be decided on how it treated its language, as language shaped the way people thought.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The deal would shield Hungarians from skyrocketing energy prices ahead of parliamentary elections next year and potentially boost Orbán’s chances of extending his 15-year rule.Since then,Hungaryand the US have disputed the terms of the deal, which remains just a verbal agreement between Budapest and Washington, and the White House is said to be wary of throwing its full weight behind Orbán as he faces a potential revolt at the polls that could bring the opposition to power.“Orbán hopes words will be enough to keep him above water,” said a diplomatic source in Washington, adding that Trump and his Republican allies had become increasingly sceptical of the Hungarian leader’s chances in next April’s elections.The dispute is whether Hungary has received a temporary or permanent reprieve from sanctions targeted at the Russian energy majors Rosneft and Lukoil, which have continued to supply Hungary and Slovakia despite anger from other countries in the European Union.Hungary has claimed that Trump promised them an indefinite exemption, effectively allowing the country to continue to import energy from Russia. But the administration has said it has only exempted Hungary from the sanctions for one year.“We have received a waiver for an unlimited period from the sanctions. Anyone who states differently wasn’t present during the meeting,” the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said during a press briefing last Saturday, calling media reports “fake news”.Flattery will get you everywhere: Orbán lays it on thick with TrumpRead moreThe deal was important enough for Orbán to give a rare interview to the Hungarian television channel ATV. “The exemption from sanctions is valid as long as he is president there and I’m the prime minister here,” he said, effectively tying the deal to his support in the upcoming elections.Describing their conversation, Orbán said Trump told him the US would “exempt Hungary [indefinitely] from the US sanctions”. Sweetening the deal, Orbán also said Trump had offered a “financial shield” to Hungary that could be worth up to $20bn if funding was cut from the European Union.During the same meeting, Hungary hadcommittedto buying US liquefied natural gas (LNG) valued at $600m and pledged to spend $700m on US military supplies.But after Orbán went public with the terms of the deal, the Trump administration quickly offered a clarification: the deal was just a verbal agreement, and it was just for one year.“In the case of the pipelines on oil and gas, it’s a one-year extension, because it would be deeply traumatic to their economy to cut them off immediately,” the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told reporters on Thursday.Sources at the US state department and in Congress have also told the Guardian that no steps have been taken yet to codify the deal.“All we have heard is that there is a one-year waiver,” said a congressional aide. “We will be receiving some sort of Congressional notification, but we have not received that yet. Among the pro-Orbán circles, there will be claims that will exaggerate the importance of these preliminary statements, both on arms and energy. You can look back at the US-Turkey aircraft deal, where similar things have happened.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision could also be one simply not to enforce secondary sanctions against Hungary, they said.The ambiguity has become a regular feature of the Trump administration’s deals with foreign countries, suggested the congressional aide, and the results of the meeting could have very well been “performative”.Congressional republicans have remained sceptical about Orbán’s close relationship with Russia and his positions on national security issues, including the war in Ukraine, said the aide. “Orbán is still maintaining his close relations with Putin, and he is not being helpful to Zelenskyy,” they said.The congressional aide indicated no details had been shared regarding current or forthcoming arms sales to Hungary.Yet for Orbán, the key result was to return to Hungary with what he and his Fidesz party could claim as a triumph.“For the Fidesz camp, this is a victory. This is how they explain why they can keep utility prices low. Because of the election campaign, this is a strong message”, said Botond Feledy, a Brussels-based Hungarian geopolitical analyst. “The opposition is now asking whether the $700m [arms deal] is worth it for Hungary and why Hungary hasn’t been preparing since 2022 to cut ties with Russian energy sources. They are suggesting that the price of Orbán’s pro-Russian stance has now been paid at the White House,” he added.Trump’s intervention last month in the Argentinian electionappears to have provided a roadmap for other ideological allies around the world to seek US support ahead of crucial elections. But according to a diplomatic source in Washington, strict EU regulations would prevent the US from cutting the same deal to prop up Hungary’s economy as it did with Argentina.“The opposition seems more values-aligned to Republicans anyway,” said the aide, referring to the opposition leader, Péter Magyar, who recently praised Trump in a social media post.Explore more on these topicsHungaryViktor OrbánEuropeUS foreign policyRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

What we have seen in these escalating attacks is that they are going after trains, especially trying to kill the drivers.”In a country as large as Ukraine, the railways are critical. The rail network carries more than 63% of the country’s freight – including grain shipments – and 37% of passenger traffic, according to the state statistics service. Military assistance from foreign countries often arrives by train.No civilian airports have been in operation since Russia’s full-scale invasion, so most people travel in and out of the country – including visiting world leaders – by train.“It’s not just about the quantity [of attacks], it’s also the approach of the enemy forces,” said Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, the head of the Ukrainian state railway, Ukrzaliznytsia. “Now, as they have very precise Shahed drones, they are targeting individual locomotives.”Efforts to better protect the network have come into force, including equipping trains with electronic systems to counter drone strikes and raising dedicated air defence teams from among railway staff.Next day delivery, no weapons allowed: the unstoppable postal service keeping Ukraine goingRead moreEarlier this year, the main building at the station in Lozova, in the Kharkiv region, was badly damaged in a drone strike.

It happened at 2.44am. There were five trains on the station. The first one, a small suburban train, was due to depart two hours later.“It was clear they were targeting the station. They wanted to do it. And they did it.”Tkachenko gave a tour of the station, pointing out a damaged platform and the main waiting room, which are now out of action. The facade of the main building is scorched and collapsed in places. A pile of twisted metal sits on the disused platform.Tkachenko explained why the station was targeted. “Lozova is on a major junction,” she said. “You can go in four directions, to Dnipro, to Sloviansk, Poltava and Kharkiv.”View image in fullscreenA train damaged in a Russian attack on Kyiv in August.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesThe lines are used for passenger traffic, freight, and military support, including the evacuation of wounded soldiers from fighting on the eastern front.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They want to destroy the high-voltage lines.”Oleksandr Podvarchansky, who is in charge of the track in the Lozova area, described what happened when air raid sirens sounded. “The main task is to protect people’s lives,” he said. “Every single air alarm, we have to stop and use a bomb shelter. If there is a train on the tracks we move it to the nearest station so people can evacuate.”Kuleba said Russia had three objectives: destroying Ukraine’s logistics in the south to prevent the movement of goods to seaports; disrupting rail traffic close to the frontlines in regions such as Chernihiv and Sumy; and “destroying everything” in the Donbas,Ukraine’s industrial eastern heartlandcomprising Donetsk and Luhansk regions.The network has also been targeted by bomb threat hoaxes, including against a recent international service. Few officials doubt that Russia is responsible.While tracks can be repaired quickly – often within a day according to Podvarchansky – damage to rolling stock is a more worrying issue.In a recent interview with Associated Press, Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian military and drone expert, said trains were particularly vulnerable to drones because they were relatively slow and followed predictable routes.As the range of Russian drones increases, and the technology becomes ever more sophisticated, more of the railways are coming within range. “If the Russians keep hitting diesel and electric locomotives, the time will come very soon when the track will still be intact but we’ll have nothing left to run on it,” said Beskrestnov.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRail transportEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

And that is sitting outside [in Jordan and Egypt], not able to come in. And that is the case for the other UN agencies because the restrictions and the constraints are still there.”She estimated that only about half, “if that”, of the 500-600 daily truckloads needed were getting into the devastated territory.View image in fullscreenNatalie Boucly speaking at a conference in Nicosia, Cyprus, last year.Photograph: Yiannis Kourtoglou/ReutersBoucly said Israel as an occupying power was “not abiding by international humanitarian law and international human rights law”, referencing the fourth Geneva convention as well as a recent advisory opinion from the international court of justice thatsaidIsrael had to ensure the people of the occupied Palestinian territory had “the essential supplies of daily life”.The same ICJ ruling, issued on 22 October, concluded that Israel had an obligation to cooperate with Unrwa. The court foundno evidencethat Unrwa lacked neutrality or that significant numbers of it staff were members of Hamas, claims repeatedly made by Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.Israelsevered diplomatic relations with Unrwaafter accusing the body of having been infiltrated by Hamas and allowing “widespread and systematic” misuse of its facilities by terrorists. The ICJ opinion noted that nine Unrwa employees were dismissed over possible involvement in the 7 October 2023 attacks but said Israel’s broader claims were not substantiated.Boucly said she had received no indication that Israel was going to change its no-contact policy towards her agency.Unrwa was created in 1948 to aid the 700,000 Palestinian refugees displaced in the war around the establishment of the state of Israel. It was meant to be temporary. Nearly eight decades later, Unrwa is a vital supplier of health, education, social welfare and other services in the occupiedPalestineterritories and neighbouring countries, where 5.9 million Palestine refugees are registered.“It is not the time for Unrwa to collapse,” Boucly said. “[We are] irreplaceable because nobody can pick up the slack.”In Brussels, she was expected to discuss with EU officials a $200m (£152m) shortfall in the agency’s funding until March, among other topics.“We were meant to be temporary. The only reason we’re here is because there’s a collective failure of the international community to come to a political solution to this conflict,” she said.Boucly said that for the first time since the1993 Oslo agreementthere was light about finding a lasting political settlement to the decades-old conflict. While stressing it was not for the UN to decide the terms of a settlement, she warned of the risks of allowing “this uniqueopportunity” for peace to slip away.“Unless you have a political solution … neither the Israelis, nor the Palestinians will live in peace,” she said.She argued that European governments should exert “a different sort of moral pressure on Israel … that you need to have a reconciliation process, that military might is not going to make you live in peace.”View image in fullscreenA boy walks near an Unrwa school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City that was hit by an Israeli strike in July.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersBoucly, who was employed in Jerusalem in 2023, recalled the trauma experienced by Israelis after the 7 October attacks, which triggered a backlash against Unrwa. She said she had been verbally assaulted and colleagues were physically attacked as attitudes to the agency changed in Israel.While crediting the Trump administration for theceasefire deal, she voiced worry that a lot of the peacemaking effort was happening “outside of the usual tools of multilateralism and the usual UN construct around peacekeeping”.As such, she said crucial details were missing, such as the membership and terms of reference for theproposed board of peaceto be chaired by the US president. “You have to know where you are sailing, otherwise the winds are going to take you to a different destination,” she said.Unrwa is providing a few hours of schooling a day and mental health support to about 40,000 children via 280 “temporary learning spaces” in shelters in Gaza. But its work is hampered because it is not allowed to bring pens and notebooks into the territory under import rules imposed by Israeli authorities, it has said.The children at these centres have endured two years of unimaginable trauma that for many has involved being forced to move multiple times, the deaths of close family members, hunger, relentless bombing and destruction.By early September at least 2,596 children in Gaza hadlost both parentsand a further 53,724 had lost either their father (47,804) or mother (5,920), according to Gaza health ministry statistics cited by the UN’s child protection agency, Unicef.Boucly said Gaza’s orphans would have “nothing to lose unless they see a future for themselves. Unless you offer something to these kids … we cannot exclude another terrorist attack. We cannot exclude armed groups being formed [or] much worse.”Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He ruled out any foul play, saying it was an accident.Most of the dead were police and forensic officials.

According to local media, small successive explosions prevented immediate rescue operations.The police station blast came days after Monday’sdeadly car explosion in New Delhi, which killed at least eight people near the city’s historic Red Fort. Indian officials called it a “heinous terror incident” carried out by “anti-national forces”.The blast happened hours afterpolice in Kashmir said they had dismantled a suspected militant celloperating from the disputed region, arresting at least seven people, including two doctors from Indian cities, and seizing a large quantity of bomb-making material in the city of Faridabad.Indian security agencies have since carried out a series of raids in Kashmir as part of their investigation into the car blast, questioning hundreds and detaining scores.Police had brought the explosive material seized in Faridabad to Kashmir as part of their investigation, adding that they were “kept securely in an open area” at the police station, where the investigation that led to the suspected militant cell began last month, according to Prabhat, the top officer.He said a team of experts was taking samples for forensic investigation when the blast occurred, calling it an “accidental explosion”.“Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaKashmirSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The pace and scale of migration is placing immense pressure on communities.”However, the majority of asylum seekers currently receiving support are unlikely to be affected. Government sources said rules that mean most asylum seekers are not allowed to have jobs will not change.There are about 100,000 people in receipt of asylum support in the UK, the vast majority of whom are accommodated by the state. About a third remain in hotels, althoughLabourhas pledged to end this practice by 2029.About 8,500 people in asylum accommodation have the right to work because they entered the country on a visa and later claimed asylum.Those without visas whose claims remain outstanding after a year through no fault of their own are sometimes permitted to take on paid work, but only in a limited number of fields where there is deemed to be a significant shortage of suitable candidates.The UK wants to emulate Denmark’s hardline asylum model – but what does it actually look like?Read moreAlthough there are about 19,000 people who have been waiting for more than 12 months for an asylum decision, the Guardian understands most do not meet this criteria and not all of those eligible are in employment.The government did not specify how much it expected to save as a result of these measures but it added that asylum seekers who break rules could also be excluded from financial support, which could further reduce costs.A spokesperson said: “In a historic move, automatic handouts for those seeking refuge will end.“Introduced in 2005 under EU law, the legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support has meant guaranteed, unconditional financial assistance for anyone who claims asylum and would otherwise be destitute.“That is ending. Support will no longer be a given; it becomes a discretionary power.“This means theHome Officecan deny assistance to those who can work, have assets, fail to comply with removal directions, engage in criminality, disrupt accommodation settings, or work illegally.”However, sources indicated these were not “blanket” rules and cases would continue to be assessed on an individual basis, with mitigating factors taken into account.The changes are perceived as a pitch to Labour voters who are considering backing Reform at the next general election. The plans are thought to be unpopular with some of the party’s MPs, particularly those worried about losing support to the Greens and Liberal Democrats, although the government hasindicated a rebellion is unlikely to be tolerated.Government officials are also expected to launch a consultation on “additional requirements migrants could have to follow to receive and retain benefits” with those who “contribute and integrate” given priority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Danish overhaul is considered to have helped the party resist electoral challenges from the populist right.After excluding data from 2020, when major travel restrictions were in place because of the pandemic, the number of successful asylum claims processed in Denmark is at a 40-year low.Although those targeted by foreign regimes are normally given protection, the Danish government reserves the right to return refugees to their home countries when it is deemed safe.Denmark also tightly controls which refugees can bring family members to the country. Those who live in housing estates earmarked as “parallel societies”, where more than half of the people are from “non-western” backgrounds, are not eligible.The law also enables the state to demolish housing within these estates. Although the government says this is aimed at promoting integration, an EU official recently raised concerns about potential discrimination. The left of the British Labour party has been vocal in its criticisms of the Danish system.Reform’s lead in the polls has been fuelled in part by a rise in small boat crossings over the last five years, a trend that successive governments have struggled to reverse.The party has promised those who arrive in Britain via small boats would not be allowed to claim asylum if it took power.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabourHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident at a London station.Williams, of Peterborough, is due to appear at Cambridge crown court on 1 December.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Thepay settlement he reached with resident doctorslast year avoided a winter plagued by NHS strikesBut it also criticises significant aspects of his performance, including the way he handled theabolition of NHS Englandand his lack of action to stem the exodus of senior GPs.The findings threaten to puncture Streeting’s reputation after a turbulent week during which he wasforced to deny accusationsfrom allies of Keir Starmer that he was lining up a leadership challenge against the prime minister.Wes Streeting’s gamble with the NHS is greater than any play for Downing Street | Gaby HinsliffRead moreStuart Hoddinott, the IfG’s associate director and the author of the report, said: “There have been some positive steps: performance is trending slowly upwards in hospitals, there’s been a genuinely large increase in GPs and the rate at which hospital staff are leaving their jobs is the lowest on record outside the pandemic.“But that has been undermined by a chaotic and incoherent approach to reforming the service. The announcement ofNHSEngland’s abolition was abysmally handled and management cuts in integrated care boards have been a needless distraction.”He added: “Worse than that, nothing the government has done will address the ongoing exodus of GP partners, and it has taken decisions that may actively harm the adult social care sector.“The further decay of general practice and social care would be a disastrous legacy for Streeting and the government.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said:“While the report acknowledges our success in delivering record numbers of GPs and appointments, it ignores our work to reform primary care and shift care out of hospitals, including £1.1bn extra investment, and the creation of new neighbourhood contracts to deliver a truly neighbourhood health service in every part of the country.“Far from diverting money to hospitals as the IfG claims, integrated healthcare organisations will ensure funds are diverted towards prevention and community care to keep people out of them.“We are succeeding in our efficiency drive, with our move to bring NHS England back into the department freeing up more than £1bn a year that will be reinvested into frontline services, and a recent report showed we are exceeding our targets in improving NHS productivity.“We reject the notion we should go slower or do less, with our reforms and modernisation to date already delivering millions more appointments, cutting waiting lists and ensuring patients can benefit from the latest treatments and technology.”Government officials believe their political success hinges on whether they can improve NHS performance, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has made it one of the top three priorities in this month’s budget.As Streeting is widely tipped as the person most likely to replace the prime minister should he leave before the next election, he is facing even closer scrutiny over his performance at the health department.Despite Streeting’s promises of sweeping reforms to the way the health service is run, the report finds that in many areas performance has stagnated in the past year, and in some cases even declined.It criticises the health secretary’s decision to abolish NHS England as a rushed, poorly explained distraction, calling it “a case study in how not to make complex policy decisions and announcements”.Streeting hasin recent daysbeen rebuffed by the Treasury in his demand for over £1bn to cover redundancy costs stemming from that abolition.The report also accuses the health secretary of pulling the NHS in contradictory directions, for example, by saying he wants to shift more care into the community but then proposing new “integrated health organisations”, which could end up allocating more money to hospitals.The report adds that Streeting has provided very little detail on how his plans would be implemented, beyond relying on emerging technology such as voice-capture tools to take notes for GPs.The NHS is still struggling to improve productivity, the report finds, with fewer than 10% of areas managing to raise the number of elective procedures they carry out by any more than the number of extra staff they hire.As a result, it warns: “The government will struggle to meet its flagship target that 92% of patients should wait no longer than 18 weeks from referral to starting consultant-led treatment of non-urgent health conditions. And it has little chance of meeting national waiting time targets for A&E and cancer treatment.”Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingNHSLabournewsShareReuse this content"

His comments referenced all four Laney campuses, and included the field house, the location where he was fatally shot.James Beere, the actingOaklandpolice chief, described the shooting during a Friday briefing. “This was a very targeted incident,” he said, noting that Beam and the suspect had been acquainted but were not close.Beere also stated that the alleged shooter came to campus for a “specific reason”, though he declined to elaborate. He emphasized Beam’s community presence, saying Beam was “open to helping everybody in our community”.According to a reporter for theCitizennews outlet who attended a Wednesday meeting at Laney’s downtown campus, Beam used that gathering to express his unease about current security measures. Beam urged officials to reinstate armed security guards, citing past thefts at the field house, where he worked daily.Beam had described how stolen items were never recovered and no suspects were identified by the college’s security contractor. He also questioned a recent idea to arm six guards, asking whether it would sufficiently address the problem.The district had reportedly previously ended its partnership with the Alameda county sheriff’s office five years earlier and shifted to an unarmed security force, according to theMercury News.The 66-year-old coach was shot Thursday at Laney College and died the following day. The shooting was the latest incident in an epidemic of gun violence afflictingschoolandcollegecampuses across the US.Tributes and expressions of grief have sincepoured infrom both professional and high school sports communities following Beam’s death.Beam’s coaching career began with a dominant run at Skyline High, where he led the team to 15 Oakland Athletic League titles from the 1980s through the early 2000s. He later achieved similar success at Laney College before stepping away from coaching last year to focus on his duties as athletic director. His influence reached a national audience after Netflix highlighted Laney’s football career in its 2020 season of Last Chance U.Explore more on these topicsOaklandGun crimeCaliforniaUS crimeNetflixWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

This time by the President of the United States.”Greene did not specify any threats against her that had been received by security firms, but said that “as a woman I take threats from men seriously. I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims ofJeffrey Epsteinand his cabal, must feel.”Greene also said that as a Republican who votes “overwhelmingly” in favor of party legislation, “his aggression against me also fuels the venomous nature of his radical internet trolls (many of whom are paid), this is completely shocking to everyone” .The accusation echoes claims made by Trump and administration officials that Democrats have used “paid actors” at protests.In a later post on X, Greene posted a chart of rising average grocery bills, calling it “the ultimate warning to all of my Republican colleagues” and equating cost-of-living pressures to a vote in Congress over the release of further Epstein files next week.“You vote NO on Tuesday to release the Epstein files and face severe outrage from America,” she warned. “Republicans don’t have support from women and this right here is a perfect example of why.”The post is the latest in an increasingly bitter war of words with Trump, primarily over the release of government-held documents relating toJeffrey Epstein, which Greene supports. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, is expected to hold a vote next week to decide whether to release the entirety of unclassified communications and documents.What’s happening with Marjorie Taylor Greene? Why the Maga loyalist has won some Democratic fansRead more“Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!” Trump fumed on social media, a day after ending his support for Greene, calling her “Wacky Marjorie” and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in the next midterm election “if the right person runs”.Earlier on Saturday, Greene postedon Xthat she never thought she would be in the position of “fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are”.The dispute between Greene and Trump, simmering for months, has broken out into the open as the once solid Maga supporter has found herself opposing Trump on a series of issues, including US military aid to Israel, the government shutdown and the so-called “Epstein files”.That has led Trump to accuse Greene of going “Far Left” as she offered a series of dissenting opinions against the Maga mainstream. Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months was “COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” adding: “I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Greene added: “I don’t worship or serveDonald Trump.”Trump has indulged flame wars before with otherwise loyal political allies, includingElon Musk, only to make up after a cooling-off period. Like Musk, Greene’s newfound opposition appears rooted in what both see as a dilution of Trump’s “Americas first” political philosophy, including grappling with foreign peacemaking projects.The trajectory of Greene’s dissatisfaction dates to at least May, when she announced she wouldn’t run for a Senate seat and attacked Republican donors and consultants who feared she couldn’t win. She later said she wouldn’t run for Georgia governor and attacked what she said was a political “good ole boy” system in the state.She sided with Maga dissenters, including Tucker Carlson, in June over possible US efforts at regime change in Iran.But as the Epstein files controversy heated up in recent months, she placed herself in opposition to the administration’s reluctance to release the documents and videos in full. In September, she said she wanted to expose the “Epstein rape and pedophile network” and asked people to remember she is “not suicidal” should something happen to her.Earlier this month, Greene sharply criticized her party during an appearance on The View, describing the Republican-controlled Congress as “an embarrassment” for not being in session for more than a month and saying she’d grown “really tired of the pissing contest in Washington DC between the men”.Asked whether she planned on becoming a Democrat, she said both political parties had failed and called for women to step in and steer the country. “Our red-white-and-blue flag is just being ripped to shreds,” she said. “And I think it takes women of maturity to sew it back together.”Explore more on these topicsMarjorie Taylor GreeneDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinRepublicansHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Another woman was reportedly asked “how far she was willing to go” to save enslaved children.Ballard, who investigated child sexual trafficking as a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), was portrayed in Sound of Freedom by the actor Jim Caviezel, whose own repetition of QAnon theories earnedcondemnationfrom the movie’s director, Alejandro Monteverde.Despite being a surprise summer hit at the box office, Sound of Freedom was variously described as “QAnon adjacent” and “Maga-friendly” by critics, using the “Make America Great Again” slogan favored by supporters of Donald Trump.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUtahUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

This is uncharted territory for the Spaniard, who will compete in the title match of the Association ofTennisProfessionals’ season-ending tournament for the first time.Earlier this week, Alcaraz sealed the year-end No 1 ranking ahead of Sinner by rolling through his round-robin group with a flawless 3-0 record. He will attempt to close out his individual season, by far the best of his career, by winning an incredible ninth title of 2025.No matter how things play out, this is a fitting climax to a year that has been defined by the dominance of the two rivals. Alcaraz and Sinner have split the four grand slam tournaments between them for the second consecutive year, with Sinner winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon while Alcaraz took the French Open and US Open.Either Alcaraz or Sinner has won the last seven tournaments when both players have been present in the draw and they have faced each other in six finals this year. Alcaraz has won seven of their last eight meetings, establishing a 10-5 overall lead, meaning Sinner will be looking to definitively halt Alcaraz’s momentum in the match-up.Sinner continues to perform at such a consistent, high level that has allowed him to rapidly rise up the list of all-time great men’s tennis players. In a season that included a three-month doping ban between February and May, Sinner will attempt to win his sixth ATP title of the year in his 10th final. The 24-year-old has won 30 consecutive indoor hard court matches and 14 matches in a row after his recent triumphs at the Vienna Open and Paris Masters. He has also won 18 consecutive sets at theATP Finals.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz celebrates after beating Félix Auger-Aliassime.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images“Making three times consecutive finals in Turin means a lot to me,” said Sinner. “It’s a great atmosphere, great place for me to play tennis and also a great place for me to close this beautiful season I’ve played in. Tomorrow I will enjoy, I will obviously try my best to get the best possible result but in any case, it has been again an amazing week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their form this week only further illustrated the challenge before him. While the Australian barely survived the group stages, qualifying through tie-break rules despite losing two of his three matches, Sinner eased through his group without dropping a set.For more than an hour, however, De Minaur threw everything he could at the Italian, playing some of his best tennis of the tournament in the process. He forced himself inside the baseline, frequently having to half-volley ground strokes as he tried to maintain his court position. The Australian also served well, saving Sinner’s first seven break points as they reached 5-5, and he used his stupendous defensive skills to make the court seem as narrow as possible to his opponent.His best efforts were far from sufficient. As has been the case every time they have faced each other, Sinner completely overpowered De Minaur with far more potent ground strokes. He also continued his own brilliant serving form during the tournament, emerging from their tight opening set having landed 82% of his first serves. With the first set secured, Sinner opened his shoulders and hit his helpless opponent off the court to reach another final in front of his buoyant home crowd.Explore more on these topicsATP FinalsJannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazTennisAlex de MinaurAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Benn came close to sealing the knockout he craved in the last minute of the fight when he twice dropped Eubank Jr heavily.Conor Benn defeats Chris Eubank Jr in middleweight boxing rematch – live reactionRead moreA shuddering combination from Benn had an initially delayed reaction but the right hand that smashed into the side of Eubank Jr’s head finally sent him toppling to the canvas. He rose to his feet but was soon down again as Benn threw punch after punch at his wilting and shrunken frame. Eubank Jr staggered to his feet just before the referee completed his count. The fight would surely have been waved over – but the last bell echoed above the bedlam.The wait for the scorecards was a formality as Benn was declared the overwhelming winner by margins of 119-107, 116-110 and 118-108. He was exultant as beating Eubank Jr in crushing style followed a grim three years for a complicated and sometimes haunted man who tested positive twice for clomifene in 2022 and then lost a wild and testing battle against Eubank seven months ago. But he had stressed this week that he would be much more clinical and disciplined in the rematch.View image in fullscreenConor Benn lands another blow on Chris Eubank Jr at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesHe kept to his word but Eubank Jr, who usually campaigns at least two weight categories above Benn, looked worn out and debilitated by his draining battle with the scales and the fact that a prohibitive rehydration clause prevented him adding more than 10 pounds a day after the official weigh-in. It was, clearly, a fight too far for the 36-year-old.The atmosphere was typically raucous as Benn marched slowly from his dressing room to the sound of Ready or Not from the Fugees seguing into a mashup of the old Phil Collins song which his dad, Nigel, used for many of his ringwalks in the early 1990s. Father and son took the time to dance together and embrace before the live drummers kicked in and Benn Jr moved purposefully to the ring.A cascade of boos greeted Eubank Jr, looking resplendent in a white fur coat, his father walking close behind him clutching a bag in his hand as Dr Dre boomed around them. And then, suddenly, the rapper 50 Cent became an honorary Eubank, joining junior and senior on their ring walk as he barked out a sample trilogy of tracks. As they closed in on the brightly lit square circle, the expression on Eubank Jr’s face turned stony.Yet, once the fight began, Eubank Jr seemed strangely circumspect against the smaller but far more authoritative man. He looked listless and devoid of any belief. With a third of the bout completed Benn had done exactly what he and his corner had planned and cruised through the first four rounds. Control over drama appeared to be Benn’s mantra and it was no consequence to him that the crowd sounded a little bored as chatting rather than cheering became prevalent.A rangy left jab by Eubank in round five was a rare success for the older man but Benn soon matched him with the exact same punch. Benn, who had been so crude last time they fought, kept up his clinic as the punches flowed. Eubank Jr was down in the last minute of the sixth round but it was an obvious slip. He also swung wildly and missed just before the bell as Benn sealed a shut-out of the first half of a strangely one-sided fight.Confidence surged through Benn as he opened up in the seventh and bullied Eubank Jr against the ropes. A low hum filled the arena as tension drained from the contest. Eubank connected with a jolting jab but Benn’s huge right hand snapped back the head of his increasingly forlorn rival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was also boxing far better than he had ever done before. The crowd began swapping bored whistles from one side of the stadium to the other as a way of entertaining themselves in the absence of any meaningful fight from Eubank Jr.Before the penultimate round Nigel Benn flashed a huge grin and cheery thumbs up on the big screen. Even the brash old fighter could not have expected such a carefree romp. He was on his feet as his son nearly closed the show in the dramatic last round.Benn immediately shut down talk of a trilogy and a rubber match next year. He shouted out that the Benn-Eubank family saga was “over” and stressed that “it’s done”.Eubank Jr said: “It’s one-one. I’ve got to go away and deal with some of the things I’ve been dealing with over the last couple of months. Who knows whether we will see something new with me and him. Maybe we won’t. But right now, it’s all about this man. This is his night.”We can only hope that Eubank Jr will escape this dangerous business and find peace in a different life. Benn can return, then, to his more natural home at welterweight, where he can test himself against opposition far superior to his exhausted domestic rival. The rest of us can also move on, free at last from the hoopla of a manufactured rivalry which has run its course.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

Steve Clarke has Belarus to thank for that, their surprise draw in Denmark leavingScotlandin precisely the position they had sought before this clash with Greece. If Scotland beat Denmark in Glasgow on Tuesday, they will top this section.The dust might just have settled on this preposterous fixture by then. Scotland trailed by three at one point before hauling themselves back into proceedings against aGreeceteam who finished with 10 men.Greece 3-2 Scotland: World Cup 2026 qualifier – as it happenedRead moreGreece’s win by the odd goal in five was a merited one but, after a silent wait for full time in Denmark to arrive, the Tartan Army celebrated as 10 added minutes in Copenhagen drew to a close. Clarke and his Scotland players did not seem to know how to act, which was totally understandable. For all the shortcomings laid bare here, the spirit summoned was quite striking. Clarke’s task in the coming days is to combine that with far more assuredness, especially in defence.“A crazy game, crazy night,” said Clarke, who puffed his cheeks out and shook his head before beginning post-match media duties. “We conceded bad goals and scored good goals. I have said it repeatedly about this group, they give everything. They didn’t give up.“I am pleased that the players still have the opportunity to go directly to the World Cup but disappointed we lost the game. It is not a game we should have lost. I have a mix of emotions in my head just now.”By the end of a bizarre first half, Scotland could either have been faced with an insurmountable challenge or been level. The visitors had Craig Gordon, their veteran goalkeeper, to thank for the fact Greece did not add to their solitary goal. Not at that point anyway.View image in fullscreenGreece's Anastasios Bakasetas (right) scores his side's first goal.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAWhen that early counter arrived, John Souttar was left red-faced after misjudging the bounce of a hopeful punt. Vangelis Pavlidis stole in, the striker’s shot expertly saved by Gordon. The ball broke to Tasos Bakasetas, who slammed it low into the bottom left hand corner of the Scotland net. Albeit messy, the goal was appropriate reward for Greece’s spritely start. Scotland looked petrified.Gordon duly saved twice from Christos Tzolis with the first – of a one-handed nature – particularly impressive. Panagiotis Retsos was next to test the Hearts keeper with a close-range header. As Pavlidis failed to connect properly with a Tzolis cross, Scotland were rocking badly.During first-half stoppage time, Clarke’s men woke up. Scott McTominay, hitherto anonymous, smacked the bar from 20 yards. Ché Adams should have scored with a back-post header but fluffed his lines. Ben Gannon-Doak, sent clean through by McTominay, was similarly wasteful with only the Greek goalkeeper to beat.Scotland actually started the second period reasonably well. Ryan Christie capitalised on a defensive mix-up before playing in Adams for what should have been an equaliser. The Torino forward was ponderous, his eventual shot blocked. The lack of proper threat provided by Adams is a regular source of Scotland weakness.Greece heeded the warning. The substitute Andreas Tetteh rampaged down the left flank before cutting back for Konstantinos Karetsas. The golden boy of Greek football lived up to his reputation with a wonderful, curling shot which Gordon could not halt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gannon-Doak fired high past Odysseas Vlachodimos when meeting a John McGinn cross. Consolation, surely? Think again, said Scotland. Another cross, this time from the captain, Andy Robertson, found Christie for 3-2. Belarus had now edged 2-1 ahead in Denmark; a previously despondent Scotland support were suddenly in raptures. Scotland had 20 minutes in which to salvage the most stunning of points.McTominay spurned a glorious chance, albeit Vlachodimos saved superbly with his feet. Bakasetas in theory made things easier for the Scots by hauling down Lewis Ferguson for a second booking. Clarke by this point had thrown on Lyndon Dykes and Lawrence Shankland to pep up his attack. When George Hirst replaced Gannon-Doak, three minutes from time, Scotland were playing 4-2-4.A goalmouth scramble from a McGinn cross was as close as Scotland came to notching the sixth goal of the night. Incredibly, defeat barely mattered. Clarke is one game from Scottish sporting immortality. The circumstances that brought him to this point were so utterly, wonderfully bonkers.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersGreeceScotlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Pelicans next play at home on Sunday night against the Golden State Warriors.“It really wasn’t the won and lost record as the ultimate determining factor,” Dumars said. “We have to establish who is going to be here in New Orleans going forward and I just did not see that happening.”Rather, Dumars saw a team “losing the same way, over and over again”.“That’s not improvement,” he continued. “We have to establish that we’re going to play hard every night. Before you can become anything in this league, you have to establish that first ... and that’s still what I’m looking for right now.”Team owner Gayle Benson, who has come under increasing public pressure during recent difficult seasons for both the Pelicans and the NFL’s Saints, often spoke glowingly of Green and his family but said she trusted Dumars “to make the right decisions for our franchise”.“I have tremendous admiration and respect for Willie Green, and I truly appreciate all he has done for our organization over the last few years,” Benson said. “This is a tough business and these are difficult decisions. My expectation is to be a winning team that competes for championships.”Borrego was head coach of the Charlotte Hornets for four seasons from 2018 to 2022, going 138-163, including 43-39 in his final season. He also served as interim head coach with Orlando during the 2014-15 season.Dumars said he expects Borrego’s promotion to last at least through the rest of this season but couldn’t guarantee whether “unforeseen” circumstances might change that.Borrego “has sat in the head-coaching seat before in theNBAand understands the job”, Dumars said. “So, we have great faith and confidence in James going forward.”Green, hired to his first head coaching job in 2021 by former Pelicans basketball operations chief David Griffin, went 150-190 in four-plus seasons.His Pelicans teams made the playoffs twice, losing in the first round to Phoenix in 2022 and Oklahoma City in 2024. The Pelicans qualified for the Western Conference play-in tournament in 2023 but were eliminated by Oklahoma City.Green’s job in New Orleans was made more challenging by star power forward Zion Williamson’s frequent injury absences. Williamson – the 2019 first overall draft pick out of Duke who has averaged 24.6 points per game during his career – played in just 134, or about 39%, of the 340 games Green coached. Williamson has missed seven games this season, hampered first by a bruised foot and then a strained left hamstring.Dumars, hired to take over for Griffin this year, chose in the offseason to stick with Green, who was entering his final season under contract.“I’d seen some of the Pelicans when they were fully healthy a few years ago and it seemed that Willie was doing a good job. I thought it was only fair to give him an opportunity,” Dumars said. “It was just as simple as: He’s been here, give him a chance to have a fresh start with me and go forward and build.”Dumars provided Green with a roster that included the additions of free-agent veterans Kevon Looney, Sadiq Bey and Jordan Poole, along with two first-round draft picks – Jeremiah Fears (seventh overall) and Derik Queen (13th overall).The Pelicans opened the regular season with a six-game skid that included three 30-plus-point losses. Green briefly seemed to be finding his footing when the Pelicans won two straight, but they have since lost four in a row, including a 118-104 defeat at the hands of the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night in NBA Cup play.“We’re not status quo people. We’re just not,” Dumars said. “We can’t sit on our hands and we can’t sit here and go, ‘Well, it’s going to get better one day.’ Like, that’s just not the way we’re going to approach it.”Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans PelicansNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

This is a tough question to answer. The body of work is huge and varied. The foot deodorant ad perhaps, which depicts Neymar’s feet literally on fire, ablaze with some kind of divine eau de toenail.Or the new one for a brand of açaí berry death-gloop sorbet product, which shows Neymar holding up twin cones, like phials of luminous unicorn-sperm, and looking as though he’s just been hit over the head with a rock and it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him.For me the real No 1 is his turn as the face of Brazil’s leading car battery provider. In part because of Neymar’s take on the role of battery installer guy, which is sexy-moody maverick genius. Tailored green overalls. Hair perfectly feathered. A stare into the camera which is steely and masculine, but also tender and playful.Mainly it’s the basic premise of a Neymar-branded car battery. How long before the misgivings set in as your mechanic comes twirling out of the toolshed, cheekbones glittering? How far down the road will you actually get with this thing before your steering wheel flies off and your wipers start whizzing round like novelty bow ties? Er … I usually have Dave. Is Dave around? You know what. I might just go to Autobloke on the ring road.You may ask at this point: do we need to think about Neymar? Is Neymar still a thing? The answer to which is yes. We live in a Polycrisis World, and Neymar is still the most captivating of polycrisis footballers, one who is now entering perhaps the final lurch in his own narrative arc.Bellingham and Foden return to give Tuchel’s England a headache at No 10 | Barney RonayRead moreIn another version of the present Neymar would be playing at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium against Senegal on Saturday, one of Brazil’s few remaining fixtures before next summer’s World Cup. Instead he has spent the week banished to a kind of internet rage-dungeon, driven there by footage of his comeback appearance for Santos, who made the terrible mistake of signing Neymar in January and are now in danger of being relegated with six games to go.The clips range through: Neymar miskicking in front of goal; Neymar doing bad, slow skills; and Neymar being a really terrible guy, apparently hooked up to a wireless electric shock machine that keeps forcing him to flail his arms at his increasingly bedraggled teammates. At one point he walks back from halfway like the world’s most awful PE teacher to scold his defenders over knocking it long, performatively passing short to one of his centre-backs, who then hoofs the ball upfield in comedic fashion.View image in fullscreenNeymar’s move to Santos has not worked out with the Brazilian club facing relegation and rancour.Photograph: Jorge Silva/ReutersHe even looks in bad basic physical shape. It is genuinely disturbing to see this perfect sprite, a footballer made entirely from dandelion spores and rainbow dust, now with the classic inflated head of the mid-30s man beginning to go to seed. Not that there’s any great concern in the immediate response. This is where we are in the life cycle. It’s time to punish Neymar. Pile it on. Let’s burn this thing to the ground.And yet it seems next summer’s World Cup is still not considered a total no-go zone, at least not by everyone in Brazil. This may be a classic sporting delusional state. Neymar hasn’t played for Brazil for two years. Even Carlo Ancelotti, the great pragmatist, football’s ultimate aura-dad, sounded sketchy this week, advising Neymar to give up playing on the wing and turn himself into a false 9, which sounds a bit yeah-you-do-that-catch-you-later.For all that Neymar was selected as recently as March before puling out injured. This workmanlikeSeleçãocould probably still use some kind of functional late-stage version. Brazil remains a sentimental country. And there is always space for genius.Mainly though, it is easy to forget how good he is, or was. Neymar is one of four out-there, everything-all-at-once football geniuses to have appeared in my lifetime, the other three being Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi.For all the absurdities of his career he has also remained an absolute footballing machine, with 445 goals and 286 assists in 742 games to date, according to Transfermarkt. But its not the numbers. It’s the light and the beauty, the ability through it all to make this look like a kind physical art, to compact an entire narrative of preternatural skill vision and heritage into 10 seconds of an otherwise forgettable afternoon.It is a vanishing quality of fantasy and pure expression. The industry can’t produce it. The harder it tries, the further it recedes. And perhaps this explains why the base note of late Neymar, beneath the internet mockery, is sadness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis week Nilton Petrone, a famous Brazilian physiotherapist, described Neymar as “the last genius” of Brazilian football. After the Flamengo game Santos director, Alexandre Mattos, wrote on Instagram: “Geniuses are misunderstood, it has always been that way in human history … everything is bigger for you, but you are bigger than everything.” This may or may not be true. But it is the key thing about Neymar, the sense of an entity trapped within the machine. For all his histrionics and poor behaviour, no single figure embodies so perfectly the horror and brutality of modern football.Neymar’s career has been above all a relentlessly disgusting thing. Every move has been destructive, through the oddities of his Barcelona transfer to the emptiness of the PSG propaganda move that disrupted an entire transfer economy, those peak years when he really could have been anything, but which were spent instead dancing on crutches in a solid gold top hat, dining on butterfly wings, leasing a yacht made entirely from parmesan cheese.The move to Al-Hilal was an absurdity, with its guarantee of three dedicated supercars, a house with three saunas, a pool at least 40m long, plus a private plane and all expenses paid for his 30-strong entourage; in return for which a footballer who talks about love and Jesus and justice would provide his second great career turn as a beard for repressive Gulf state.The frustration comes from the glimpses of something else through all this, of an essentially limitless basic talent, that figure made from silk thread and sherbet, twirling in the light like a flake of god’s dandruff.The standard response is disdain and disgust at the sense of waste. But this is also a confusion of cause and effect. Because above all Neymar is our monster, our own shared cartoon showman. He didn’t make this world. He has simply lived inside it, taken it literally, a funfair mirror reflection of the way Big Football takes that thing you love and transforms it into something else, a commodity, a product, a geopolitical tool.For all his wealth and fame his existence has also been brutal, from a childhood in the glare of expectation, to the rolling televised colonoscopy of his home World Cup, to the existential emptiness in his fly-on-the-wall Netflix documentary, which details in brilliant close-up detail the basic boredom and pointlessness of Neymar’s daily existence.“No one knows anything about me,” he says at one point in this man-as-commodity horror story. This will probably remain the case now. Barring some dramatic reversal in fortune there is only the tiniest chance of one last World Cup for this most divisive, beautifully gossamer talent. But it could still feel like a small note of human redemption; and not just for him.Explore more on these topicsNeymarBrazilcommentShareReuse this content"

James wheeled away in delight with his obvious relief shared by 3,000 Wales fans filling three sides of the Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz.World Cup roundup: Anarbekov produces heroics to deny BelgiumRead moreMoments later, however, James was booked and another late caution for Ethan Ampadu means both midfielders are ruled out of Tuesday’s crunch game with North Macedonia through suspension. That Cardiff City Stadium contest is a game Wales must win to overtake North Macedonia and secure a more favourable draw in the playoffs in March. If Wales fail on Tuesday then they will still reach the playoffs because of winning their Nations League group.Craig Bellamy had an unfamiliar view from the stands, the Wales manager serving a touchline ban after receiving a second yellow card in the competition last month. Bellamy’s assistant Piet Cremers took his place in the technical area and four of Wales’s starters – James, Ampadu, Joe Rodon, Neco Williams – were a booking away from missing the final qualifier. Two of them came unstuck in incidents that could really hurt Wales.Cremers said: “It’s never nice to lose players through suspension or an injury. But I’ve learned very quickly in this job that there’s nothing you can do about injuries and suspensions. You have to deal with it and we’ve got a really good squad. Players who have played before and know the detail.”Liechtenstein, ranked 206 out of 210 teams in world football, had not scored in their six qualifying defeats and conceded 23 at an average of nearly four per game. Wales predictably dominated possession as Liechtenstein lay in a low defensive block and got bodies behind the ball.The home goal remained unthreatened until Nathan Broadhead’s pressing forced an error and James saw his effort from the edge of the box pushed aside by Benjamin Büchel. The same combination worked the next opening, James finding Broadhead this time with a precise ball over the top. Broadhead’s excellent touch took him past Büchel but the Wrexham striker could not convert from a tight angle.View image in fullscreenLiechtenstein’s Benjamin Büchel punches clear, beating Dylan Lawlor, Daniel James and Joe Rodon to the ball.Photograph: Romina Amato/ReutersWales thought they had broken the deadlock after 26 minutes when James headed a deep Sorba Thomas corner back into a congested six-yard box. Büchel was flustered under pressure from Dylan Lawlor and Rodon, and his weak punch fell to Broadhead who drove home emphatically. But Welsh celebrations were curtailed when the Albanian referee, Juxhin Xhaja, was sent to the pitchside monitor and decided that at least one of the Wales centre-halves was in an offside position from James’s header.Wales raised the tempo after the break and Thomas delivered a cross to the far post from which Daniel James rattled the woodwork. Williams then headed wide from inside the six-yard box as it began to look like one of those nights for Wales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He cut out Buchel with a delightful ball across the face of goal, and his namesake Jordan had the straightforward task of ending Welsh anxiety.Cremers said: “We knew we had to take care of today. We did that and now our focus goes to North Macedonia. It will be another difficult game in Cardiff but we play at home, we’ve got our fans in numbers and we’ll look to turn it into a positive result.“This is a type of game where everyone expects you to win 5-0, 6-0, 7-0, but when you come to these places it can be a difficult game. We’ve seen that with teams that have played here before, like Belgium who struggled to score goals in the first half.

He was given a glimpse into the fragile state of a side that, shorn of several big names, collapsed in the second half having previously competed well. They prop up Group B and can thank their lucky stars that their better fortunes in the Nations League have earned a shot at playoff redemption.Maybe Alexander Isak will be match-fit by then and able to make the difference Sweden crave. His return from the bench for half an hour, shortly after Granit Xhaka’s controversial penalty had restored Switzerland’s lead, was welcome although he appeared decidedly rusty. Potter expects to hand him a longer outing when they host Slovenia on Tuesday for a dead rubber that could, at least, be used to take some confidence into the winter.Jordan James strike gives Wales crucial World Cup qualifier win in LiechtensteinRead morePotter has form for creating miracles in Sweden and it may be a stretch to suggest he requires another. Their position is wretched but there were mitigating circumstances here: Isak may have been undercooked but Viktor Gyökeres, Dejan Kulusevski, Lucas Bergvall and Victor Lindelöf were among those missing altogether. There is still time to create a functioning unit from players of that quality, although the margin for error is scant.“In the end we came up a little bit short against a team that, on the night, are in a better place than us,” Potter said. Switzerland will compete in North America next summer unless they finish their campaign with an improbable six-goal defeat in Kosovo. They are balanced, wily, practised and clinical, and juice the maximum from their resources. As reference points go, Sweden could find significantly worse.View image in fullscreenGraham Potter said he had enjoyed the buildup and he was greeted approvingly by the away fans.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesAt half-time Potter might have sensed a smoother transition to international management than anyone had imagined. He said afterwards that he had enjoyed the buildup and there was no doubt he embraced the occasion, belting out the national anthem before kick-off and being greeted approvingly by the pocket of away fans in the south-west corner.His scratch team were undone from Switzerland’s first serious attack, Dan Ndoye getting away too easily down the right and crossing for a first-time Breel Embolo finish, but they swiftly heaved themselves off the canvas.They deserved the parity earned when Benjamin Nygren, the Celtic forward, just about beat Gregor Kobel after good work from Anthony Elanga. Potter had spoken about instilling a resilience, a togetherness, that had eluded Sweden in recent months and for a time they showed something akin to the collective spirit that has spurred their most successful predecessors. Shortly before the interval they should have gone ahead when Alexander Bernhardsson burst through and, perhaps hindered slightly by a heavy-ish touch, allowed Kobel to make a decisive block.“Those are the margins that you need,” Potter said. Sweden are not currently a team that land on the right side of them. The second half was chugging along acceptably from their perspective when Gabriel Gudmundsson, recently introduced to replace an injured Emil Holm, needlessly sold Viktor Johansson short with a back-pass. In nipped Embolo, who tumbled under the keeper’s challenge. Had Johansson really instigated contact? The referee, Erik Lambrecht, thought so and the video assistant official agreed. It looked soft but Xhaka, standing over the spot-kick, was never going to worry about that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Embolo could have scored again and eventually Ndoye, the impressive Nottingham Forest winger, shot low under Johansson. The party could start in Geneva, whose stadium produces a racket quite unbecoming of such refined surroundings, and a marvellous run from the youngster Johan Manzambi in added time brought a finish to match.Isak had barely been given a kick, a few pieces of smart link-up play around halfway the sum of his meaningful involvement. “It’s not an easy situation to come into,” Potter said. “But I thought his attitude was great. He’ll get better and better the more he plays and the more he trains. So hopefully on Tuesday we can see more of him.” Sweden will have to if Potter is to revive their fortunes, not to mention his own.Perhaps motivation can be found from the way Switzerland, so buoyant by the end, basked in the adulation of their support when the job had been done. This is the standard and they look capable of improving on their traditional last-16 finish when the serious business starts. “We need to make sure we’re celebrating like they were celebrating in March,” Potter said. The scale of his task was made glaringly apparent here.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersSwitzerlandSwedenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A sloppy pass from Arthur Theate allowed the teenager to bear down on the Belgian goal and shoot into a gap Matz Sels left at his near post.That was followed by sustained Belgian pressure and a series of excellent saves from Anarbekov, who denied Vanaken, Leandro Trossard and Charles De Ketelaere in the first half. Three minutes into the second half, Vanaken, the captain, stole in between the home defence to easily head home from Timothy Castagne’s cross and level, with the goalkeeper having no chance to save it.Kazakhstan were down to 10 men when Islam Chesnokov was dismissed for a trip from behind on Jérémy Doku. Initially, he was shown a yellow card but after a review the Lithuanian referee, Donatas Rumsas, upgraded it to red.

The England captain has 23 goals in 17 appearances for Bayern Munich this season, while for his country it is three in four. If he scores against Albania here on Sunday, he would equal Pelé’s record in international football. Kane has 76 goals from 111 caps. The Brazil legend finished with 77 from 92. One more detail: Kane has failed to score in only six matches for club and country this season.It is a time of excitement and possibility. Bayern are laying waste everyone, winning 16 of their 17 games, the only blot coming last Saturday when they drew at Union Berlin;Kane saved them from defeatwith a late equaliser. They are fancied to win the Champions League plus everything in Germany.Thomas Tuchel wants England substitutes to channel anger into World Cup victoryRead moreMost important for Kane, most tantalising, there is the World Cup next summer whenEnglandwill be among the favourites. Their record in qualification has seen to that – seven wins out of seven, with seven clean sheets. The Albania game is the final one. England guaranteed their place at the finals after match number six.It did not feel incongruous to ask Kane about the Ballon d’Or, how he felt about his chances of winning the prestigious individual award. His answer spoke volumes about his mindset.“I could score 100 goals this season, but if I don’t win the Champions League or the World Cup, you’re probably not going to win the Ballon d’Or,” he said. “It’s the same with [Erling] Haaland, it’s the same with any player. You have to be winning those major trophies. We’re in great shape at Bayern Munich so that maybe makes the odds a little bit more in my favour. Same with England.“Hopefully, if things go my way for club and country then I’m definitely going to be in the conversation for a trophy like the Ballon d’Or.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane scored his 75th and 76th goals for England against Latvia in October.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesTeam glory is everything and in terms of England Kane believes the squad is in the right place underThomas Tuchel, having suffered a blip this time last year. It was when Lee Carsley was in caretaker charge and the squad was undermined by withdrawals for the must-win Nations League game against Greece in Athens.Kane worried the culture instilled by Gareth Southgate wasin danger of ebbing away. It is now back to its most robust, nobody wanting to be seen to look for an excuse. Tuchel has spoken about creating a “competition where if a player pulls out of a 50-50 situation, the door will be closed as someone else will take the shirt”.For Tuchel, squad chemistry and the commitment to the collective is fundamental, even more so than team selection and tactics. So it was hard to ignore the example of Marc Guéhi in the week. The Crystal Palace defender had picked up an injury against AZ Alkmaar on the Thursday before last and according to his club manager, Oliver Glasner, could not walk and “if he arrives with crutches for England, they will send him home”.Guéhi reported for duty and was a part of the meetings leading up to Thursday’s2-0 Wembley win over Serbia, if not the training sessions. Only on Friday did he withdraw.View image in fullscreenPelé finished his international career with 77 goals – Harry Kane has scored 76.Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/Alamy“Yes, 100%,” Kane said when asked whether England had the culture to win the World Cup. “It’s better than where we were last year. There was a transition stage with new managers and temporary managers with Lee. So there is maybe room for a little bit of an excuse there. But representing your country is the biggest honour and, when you’re trying to build a culture and a winning mentality, you need the players there as much as possible.

You can see with this camp … Marc had a little injury, but still wanted to be around the group and the meetings and learn from what we’re trying to do. I definitely think the team is in a really good place going into the new year.”It is clear Kane has grown as a vocal leader in the past 18 months or so. He spoke calmly but incisively at Euro 2024 about the criticism from former England players, while his comments about the withdrawals for the Greece game were similarly hard-hitting. It is also evident just how much Tuchel is leaning on Kane to help him with his messaging to the squad.After the team secured their qualification to the World Cup with the5-0 win in Latvialast month, Kane spoke in the dressing room to say that everyone had to show up in November and “keep this thing going”. Tuchel said on Wednesday that it was “basically the headline” for the camp.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said Harry Kane’s comments in October set the tone for November’s England camp.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesWhen Kane speaks, people listen and he was interesting on two others issues – the importance of set pieces and Phil Foden as his understudy in the No 9 role, even if the Manchester City player brings a “false” profile to it, as he did when he came on against Serbia on Thursday.“We want to build a book of set plays … like an NFL playbook where you look at the opposition, see if they are zonal or man-mark and pick what we want to do,” Kane said. “Ultimately, the best team at set plays normally go on to be the best team in the tournament.“With Phil, there has been a lot of talk throughout his England career about where he should play and clarity is the thing he probably needs. The boss has made it pretty clear he sees him as one of the false 9s or as a No 10. Phil looked sharp against Serbia and he just wants to prove a point again.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandHarry KaneWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThomas TuchelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tuchel does not want any needless slips from England, who have already won their qualifying group, and will even tell his players to think twice before fouling an opponent who is through on goal.Tuchel’s back to the future England can play with fire and fury at the World Cup | Jonathan WilsonRead more“It is important,” the German said. “I’m aware of it and we will talk about it. No red cards please. We are through and we are in a position with last man then the player holds the shirt he gets the red card. If there’s a doubt then it would be smarter not to do it.“If he goes in the last man example and if we can avoid it no red card of course. But I don’t want to make it too big a subject because then you have a cloud above you. But if you have the choice don’t do it.”England will recall Wayne Rooney missing the start of Euro 2012 after picking up a needless red card at the end of qualifying. Tuchel wants clearer thinking. He is big on behaviour and also addressed Djed Spenceappearing to snub Thomas Frankafter Tottenham’s defeat by Chelsea earlier this month.Tuchel was not impressed with Spence walking past the Spurs manager. He did not consider leaving the full-back out of this squad but has spoken to him about the incident. “I didn’t like it,” Tuchel said. “Because the players know they are not only national players when they are the 10 days in camp, they are always national players and the standard of behaviour is always important.”England, who are yet to concede a goal in Group K, have travelled to Tirana without Ezri Konsa after the centre-back picked up a minor knock. Marc Guéhi is already out, meaning Dan Burn could partner John Stones in central defence.Tuchel is weighing up whether to make major changes to his starting XI. He suggested that there could be an opening next to Declan Rice in central midfield, raising the prospect of Adam Wharton or Jordan Henderson coming in for Elliot Anderson, while the big call is whether Jude Bellingham replaces Morgan Rogers in the No 10 position.Rogers started in thewin over Serbia on Thursdayand was replaced by Bellingham in the second half. The latter went on to combine with Phil Foden when Eberechi Eze scored England’s second goal.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham could replace Morgan Rogers in th No 10 role.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersHowever, Tuchel said England became “a little disconnected from front to back” after Foden, Bellingham and Eze came on.

We missed sometimes our trigger and we were not so sure who attacks the goalkeeper and we were not so close as we want to be but nothing big. We saw from the data that our physical output was one of the highest that we had with the national team, so it was good.”Tuchel said club considerations would not come into his selection decisions. “We think about the players and took already care of some of the players,” he said. “Declan and Morgan Rogers play a lot of minutes and we took them off after 65 which makes a big difference and we will work in the same way tomorrow. Our first thought is about the player and then we implement a certain style. We cannot now allow ourselves to run less, and we have only this camp to keep things going for ourselves”Tuchel was unmoved by a suggestion that Rogers’ understanding of England’s pressing triggers could see Bellingham become an impact player from the bench. “Jude will always be an impact player because he is too good to not have an impact,” he said. “We didn’t know 100% what was coming from Serbia and we identify ourselves through our high press and work rate.“I just felt Morgan played the last matches together with Declan and Harry [Kane] and they had an understanding in the middle, and it might be too difficult to adjust. I said it also to Jude. But Jude can start any match for us, there is no doubt. He will always have an impact when he plays. He is too good not to have an impact.”Tuchel said he was no longer experimenting. He has not named a conventional No 9 to provide cover for Kane in this squad but added that it is unlikely he goes to the World Cup with only one striker.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersAlbanianewsShareReuse this content"

It was a statement 3-0 victory for Andrée Jeglertz’s side thanks to goals from Rebecca Knaak, Bunny Shaw and Lauren Hemp. It was one that truly announced their title credentials as they consolidated their place at the top.Manchester City v Manchester United: Women’s Super League – liveRead moreIn contrast, it was a result that signalled back-to-back WSL defeats for Marc Skinner’s side for the first time since May 2024, leaving them seven points off the league leaders. Their ability to juggle domestic and European football with a thin squad has been hotly discussed and it always felt like this was the week that would truly test this capability. Unfortunately for the visitors, they looked fatigued, the historic win against PSG clearly having taken a toll.The United manager was not ready to give up their title challenge but admitted that they needed to strengthen.“We deserved it. We gave City those goals,” he told BBC Sport. “It wasn’t like they dominated us; that’s the scary thing.”“We’ll see at the end of the season,” he continued. “I still think you can catch them. I don’t see anything exceptional with them … What we need to do is use the winter window to recruit the people we need to help to support this team.”Skinner had freshened things up with a handful of changes. Ella Toone, Elisabeth Terland, Dominique Janssen and Leah Galton all added energy, although the dropping of the in-form Melvine Malard to the bench raised a few eyebrows.Manchester City, in contrast, have no such scheduling worries. Jeglertz made one change with Lauren Hemp making her first start since recovering from injury.The storm clouds started to gather for United from the start. This was a show of strength from City whose dynamic attack played with and pulled the visitors apart with a sublime first half performance in which they scored three in 21 minutes. This was no mean feat against the second-meanest defence in the WSL, one that had conceded just six this campaign.View image in fullscreenBunny Shaw scores Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesThe warning signs came early when Vivianne Miedema used her strength to bundle Julia Zigiotti Olme off the ball, only to drag her shot wide. Hemp was at the heart of it, exploiting the space left by Jayde Riviere down United’s right Her deliveries were consistently dangerous and led to an opportunity for Yui Hasegawa that Anna Sandberg scrambled off the line.United had several forays forwards, their direct style giving them options but they could not trouble Ayaka Yamashita. City, meanwhile, were strong in possession, teasing their opposition and trying to pull them out of their structure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A delivery to the back post was headed across goal by Shaw for Knaak to nod home. It was City’s seventh headed goal of the campaign.They extended their advantage just before the break. When Jade Rose was allowed to maraud through the middle, the pitch opened up. Kerstin Casparij picked the ball up on the right before delivering a pinpoint low cross for Shaw to bundle home. Four minutes later, they had a third after a swift turnover in possession afforded Hemp the space to drive home from distance.Malard entered the fray in the second half but it was too late to change the course of the game. Former Manchester City player Jess Park came closest, hitting the post, but the visitors were creatively abject and failed to register a single shot on target.The hosts, meanwhile, could have extended their lead when a delightful Miedema long ball sent Shaw away only for her to fluff her lines but it mattered little. Having failed to beat any team who finished above them last season, Jeglertz’s side now have victories against Arsenal and Manchester United to put them in a strong position after nine matches.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The first was awe, that somebody so powerful and so quick would still have the composure to finish as he did. And the second was that this didn’t feel entirely fair. It was as though Gulliver had landed himself a deal in the Lilliput Premier League.The same evening, Liverpool, who have at times struggled physically in the Premier League this season,bullied Real Madrid, their threat at set plays so marked that eventually it was the 5ft 7in Alexis Mac Allister who headed the vital goal. The following day,Newcastle swatted Athletic Bilbao aside, largely by being bigger than them: for the opening goal, the Spanish side’s defence appears to have looked at Dan Burn and decided there was no point even trying to mark him.The Premier League has had a physical advantage over most of the rest of the world for years, but it is particularly pronounced now. If the elite level of the game really is turning en masse towards a more direct style, focused increasingly on set plays, English football is leading the charge – and it is a charge towards a way of playing with which it is extremely culturally familiar. To watch Arsenal against Crystal Palace followed by Real Madrid against Barcelona at the end of last month was to witness two extremely different versions of the same sport.View image in fullscreenAnthony Barry, Thomas Tuchel’s assistant (right), says they want a style that allows England’s players ‘to take the handbrake off’.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesWhich perhaps explains why whenThomas Tucheltook the England job he talked of high-tempo, high-octane football. But we’ve heard that before; it tends not to work, partly because most international tournaments are played in high heat and partly because the limited time available to international managers necessitates simplification. Playing football that is both rapid and coherent takes hours of work on the training pitch. International teams can be one or the other but it’s very hard for them to be both at once, at least not for protracted periods.That’s also whysui generisplayers are rarely as effective for their national sides as they are for their clubs. A club can spend time finding ways of maximising the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of a player with an unusual set of attributes – as Liverpool have done over the past decade with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah, or Manchester City with Phil Foden.A national team cannot – and that’s the main reason none of those three players, for all their obvious qualities, have been as effective in international football as they have been domestically. Whether a maturing Foden playing in a City side that is far less esoteric than its immediate predecessors can find a role with England will be one of the major questions for Tuchel between now and theWorld Cupnext summer.As Tuchel has settled and performances have improved, so the rhetoric has changed. His assistant, Anthony Barry,last week spokeof a “heat-proof game model”, and crucially that did not seem to mean just playing slower. Whereas England have in the past attempted a patient possession game alien to most of the players, essentially trying to take on teams more familiar with possession football at their own game, Barry spoke of implementing “a style that allows them to move and run like they do every week, that resonates with them and allows them to take the handbrake off. They must be stuck less in thinking and more in doing.” The aim is to take advantage of the “athleticism, the versatility, the physicality, the honesty” of the Premier League.Which makes complete sense, but does perhaps demand the question: why hasn’t this worked before? To which there are probably three answers.First, that Premier League referees are – or are at least perceived to be – less likely to penalise physicality, which leads to players playing within themselves. Second, that the physical nature of the Premier League makes it exhausting. The energy and percussiveness that makes Premier League sides so combative early in the season can leave them exhausted by its end – which probably also helps explain the underperformance, relative to their extreme wealth, in the Champions League.View image in fullscreenHarry Maguire heads England’s first goal past Robin Olsen of Sweden during their 2018 World Cup quarter-final, one of a series of set piece successes for Gareth Southgate’s side.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesBut the third reason is perhaps the most intriguing, which is that English football has not previously had a period like that of the past 15 years in which passing out from the back, seeing the game as being one of possession rather than territory, has been the default.And that, along with the advances in youth development embodied in the elite player performance plan and theEnglandDNA project, means this is probably the most tactically and technically sophisticated cohort of English players there has ever been.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will be playing direct football with experience of a possession-driven world.Bellingham and Foden return to give Tuchel’s England a headache at No 10 | Barney RonayRead moreThere is even a precedent, albeit one that was never really built on. Before the 2018 World Cup, Gareth Southgate, England’s then manager, decided that dead balls offered the most bang for training-ground buck, a relatively limited amount of practice could yield significant impact on the pitch. The result was an England team that terrified opponents from corners and unexpected passage to the semi-finals.It was never entirely clear why the policy was less effective thereafter – a sense that an emerging England were better than that? Opponents working out counter-strategies? – but the presence of the Aston Villa set-piece guru Austin MacPhee among the Portugal coaching staff is evidence that other countries have realised how important dead balls might be.But that’s where England have a huge advantage: they have, in Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka, the two best dead-ball deliverers from the best side at dead balls in the best league at dead balls. And if it takes them 90 seconds to deliver each one, that’s just more time to recover.The traditional England strength that has so often been a tournament weakness might next summer be an actual strength again.Explore more on these topicsThomas TuchelInside footballEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

A time for the heart to hammer with excitement, when horizons are broadened inexorably. For minimal sleep and maximum fun. And for one or two tall stories, a bit of personal reinvention, perhaps.Take one new law student at Brasenose College, because he can certainly spin a few yarns. About the time, for example, he was coached by Yaya Touré at the Tottenham academy. He did not recognise him at first but then saw him on the ball and the penny dropped.Next Generation 2025: 20 of the best talents at Premier League clubsRead moreAbout when he trained with the Spurs first team while he was still a schoolboy. Or, more recently, when he was a part of theManchester CityUnder-21s squad and would regularly work with the seniors. You want to know what it is like in a Pep Guardiola session? To have Kevin De Bruyne run at you with the ball? This guy has the answers. But the thing is that there is nothing made up, zero embellishment. If anything, he is a reluctant raconteur.Han Willhoft-King is the 19‑year‑old who seemingly has it all. A standout football talent, long tipped to make an impact in the professional game as a deep-sitting midfield controller. A star of the classroom, too, with the knack of grasping everything so quickly. His A-level grades in maths, economics and history? A*. A*. A.Willhoft-King was, in the end, the kid who had to make a choice. Between a boyhood dream, the one that millions harbour but so few can realise – a career as a footballer. And an elite-level educational pathway. He is aware of what everyone thought towards the end of last season, what they continue to think.“I don’t know many people who, when they reach Man City Under‑21s, would pack it in at that point,” Willhoft-King says. “Because when you are playing for Man City Under-21s, the expectation would be to pursue a career.”Willhoft-King was that person. He decided after the early weeks of the season to apply to universities and sit the law national aptitude test, which he aced despite giving himself little preparation time. Oxford invited him to interview and the offer of a place came in January. It burned away at him and the past few years have, frankly, been an emotional rollercoaster.View image in fullscreenHan Willhoft-King during an Under-18s match against Chelsea in February 2024 – he suffered a host of injuries as a second-year scholar at Spurs.Photograph: Andrew Fosker/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockWillhoft-King’s decision to enrol at Oxford followed plenty of soul-searching and there is really only one question for him. He says he was asked it “by about 90 different people” in a matter of days at Oxford once the word had spread about his football life. Why?The simple answer is the injuries. Willhoft-King was flying in his under-16 season at Spurs in 2021-22, the club that he joined at the age of six. They had scouted him at TFA, the north London grassroots club at which he played with Myles Lewis‑Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri. Both are now established at Arsenal. There were England Under-16 caps for Willhoft-King and the involvement in first-team training at Spurs under Antonio Conte, where he remembers the kindness of Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Eric Dier.Willhoft-King’s first big injury struck towards the end of that season and it would undermine him for the remainder of the calendar year – when he had started his scholarship at Spurs. He would suffer further injuries in his second season as a scholar and then again at City in 2024-25; he was out from September until the new year. After that, with the City Under-21 team settled, he found it impossible to break in.The injuries are only one factor. Willhoft-King has always felt the pull of academia, which probably comes from his father, Jorg, a former university lecturer in philosophy who now works for a company that mentors international students, and his mother, Laura, who is an architect.Willhoft-King attended Highgate Wood comprehensive school until Year 11 and Spurs got him personal tutors for his maths and economics A-levels. “I’d do that around twice a week … we’d do, like, two hours and the rest of it was essentially self-study,” he says. He did his history A-level while at City.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Don’t get me wrong, I still loved it. But I felt I could be doing moreIt was during his second year as a Spurs scholar, which he describes as a “pretty dark time” mainly because of injury, that he started to think about going to a US university. His interest was piqued when the club brought in a guest speaker from an agency that helped players in England to get sports scholarships in the US.Willhoft-King had beennamed by the Guardian in September 2022as the most promising first-year scholar at Spurs and the agency used the coverage to push him to US universities; the University of California, Los Angeles and Harvard were especially keen. He was not enjoying life at Spurs and came to see the US as the answer. The idea was that he could combine education and the professional football dream by ending up as an MLS draft pick.Willhoft-King turned down contract offers from Spurs and accepted a place at UCLA to start in January 2025. At that point two things happened. Firstly, he signed for FC Cincinnati 2 – who play in MLS Next Pro – and travelled out to begin training with them. It was a six-month deal to tide him over until UCLA but he lasted only a couple of weeks because City offered him a one-year contract with the option of a second year. He knew that he had to accept.“At that point, the plan was still to go pro and I felt like I’d always regret it if I didn’t join Man City,” he says. “I would always say: ‘What if I’d taken that chance?’ Now I’ve had that and I can step away from football knowing I’ve given it my best shot. That’s a lot more comforting for me.”View image in fullscreenHan Willhoft-King admits injuries were a factor in steering him towards studying law in Oxford.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianWillhoft-King talks about feeling “starstruck” at first when he and his under-21 teammates were called up by Guardiola for first-team sessions, which tended to involve them mimicking the pressing patterns of upcoming opponents.“Tottenham is a good team but Man City is another level,” Willhoft‑ King says. “De Bruyne, Haaland … these are the best players in the world. But you also realise they are normal people. They have a bit of banter, they call each other out for making mistakes. And seeing Pep … he is just so, so animated. The energy he brings, the hand gestures, raising his voice. It’s actually pretty remarkable.“Then … I don’t want to say disillusioned but you realise … well, training with the first team became a thing that no one was really looking forward to, strangely enough. Because you would just be pressing. We would be running after the ball like dogs for half an hour, 60 minutes. It’s not a very pleasant experience, especially when you are trying to press De Bruyne or Gündogan or Foden. You can’t get near them, so the feeling of not wanting to do this overcomes being starstruck.”Disillusionment feels like a good word to sum things up, even if Willhoft-King continues to love playing the game and has the varsity showdown against Cambridge at the forefront of his thoughts. It is worth noting that City would have been happy to give him the extra year. So, in the final analysis: why?“I wasn’t enjoying it,” he says. “I don’t know what it was, maybe the environment. I’m bored often, as well. You’d train, you’d come home and you wouldn’t really do anything. If you contrast it to now … I’m struggling to find hours in the day. I’m either studying, going out with friends, playing for the university first team, also my college.“I always felt understimulated in football. Don’t get me wrong. I still loved it. But I always felt I could be doing more. I was wasting hours of the day. I needed something different and Oxford excited me; the people, too. I guess that’s the reason. Injuries were a big factor but that’s the easy answer. I felt I needed something a bit more … mainly intellectually, which sounds quite pretentious. But, yeah.“Say I had a career in League One or the Championship … you make good money. But how much would I enjoy it? In my head I wasn’t sure. Also, best-case scenario – you’ll play for 10, 15 years and after that, what? I thought going to university would provide a platform for me to do something at least for longer than the next 10 to 15 years. So, it’s a bit of a long-term thing, as well.”Explore more on these topicsFootballUniversity of OxfordManchester CityTottenham HotspurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Twelve months ago, Ford narrowly failed to clinch a home victory in this same fixture, but he was a pivotal figure on Saturday as his side gained their revenge with a first win over New Zealand in south-west London since 2012.“George is a brilliant player, an outstanding leader and an even better person,” the head coach said after the fly-half contributed 13 points to seal his team’s 10th successive Test win this year. “I know you like to talk about 12 months ago and the ball hitting a post. But when he pulls on the England shirt he is just such a consistent performer.Fantastic Ford steers battling England past All Blacks in Twickenham thrillerRead more“He made brilliant decisions and executed perfectly. I am pleased for him and all the players. They should enjoy themselves tonight and have a good night out.”Ford’s all-round tactical assurance and calm were exemplified by the two first-half drop goals that shifted the momentum of the contest after the All Blacks had taken an early 12-0 lead. “It was always part of the plan,” Ford said. “You want to come away with something when you get to that end of the pitch. Sometimes the drop goal is the way to go … it’s important to get rewards for the work the forwards are doing.”Ford and Borthwick were also heartened by England’s assurance in the final quarter as they pulled away to record a ninth win against New Zealand in the long history of the fixture. Borthwick believes his team have further improvement in them and also highlighted Maro Itoje’s eve-of-game captain’s speech.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje’s motivational speech paid dividends in the buildup to England’s 10th successive victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I heard him address the team this morning,” said Borthwick. “He talked about when the team were 14- or 15-year-old boys, dreaming of playing for England and playing here against teams like New Zealand. He asked the players to go out and play with that intent of a 14 or 15-year-old with a dream. The boys took those dreams on to the pitch today and they were outstanding.“We know [an improved world] ranking helps, but this isn’t about that. This is about trying to achieve special moments and special memories and today is one of them. Hopefully, there’s a load of young future rugby players watching around the country who want to wear the white shirt and get great victories.”Itoje said England had been keen to make a statement even before the game kicked off by standing up to the haka. “As a group of leaders we came up with what you guys saw.

The roar that followed has to be up there with one of the loudest this stadium has heard. It was the replacement’s only kick at goal of the game and he had nerves of steel to seal the victory.Jones had said he wanted his team to make the pressure Wales are under feel like a “burden”, and for a large portion of the game they did that with brave attack. But a few tries went begging for them too, as well as a few penalty kick misses.There were four cards in the game – Adams’ red and three yellow cards for Japan. Jones, who joked the last-minute loss made him want to “kill someone”, added he thought all of those decisions were “farcical”. “I think we are absolutely ruining the game of rugby,” Jones said. “I don’t think any of the actions were intentional, I don’t think they deserved to be sin-binned. Any of them. I think we have to have a more sensible approach to the game.“There is going to be contact with the head, unless it is reckless which I didn’t see any of those actions being. A penalty is fair enough … The game of rugby is about having 15 players on the field and I think World Rugby should be looking at this very closely.”Quick GuideWales v Japan teams and scorersShowWalesMurray; Rees-Zammit, Llewellyn, B Thomas, Adams (Tompkins 60); Edwards (Evans 79), T Williams; Smith (Carre 48), Lake (Belcher 77), Griffin (Assiratti 48), D Jenkins (F Thomas 79), Beard, Wainwright (Plumtree 48), Mann, Cracknell.Red cardAdams (40).TriesEdwards, Rees-Zammit, Tompkins.ConsEdwards 3.PenEvans.JapanYazaki; Ishida (Ueda 78), Riley, Lawrence, Osadal; Lee (Komura 77), Saito; Kobayashi (Furuhata 77), Sato, Tamefusa (Takeuchi 49), Uluiviti (Hockings 49), Dearns (capt), Cornelsen, Shimokawa (Paul 69), Makisi.Sin-bin:Uluiviti (25), Makisi (29), Hockings (80).TriesIshida, Makisi.ConsLee 2.PensLee 3.RefereeMatthew Carley (Eng).Attendance61,324.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was a must-win for Wales as if they had lost they would have been leapfrogged by the visitors in the world rankings. That would have given Wales a stiffer task at the Rugby World Cup draw, on 3 December, as they would have dropped to 13th, meaning they would be in a group with two of the top 12 in Australia. So this game was a must-win but they had to do it without their captain, Jac Morgan, who was ruled out with a dislocated shoulder.The home side were bolstered by Louis Rees-Zammit, who made his first start and scored his first international try since returning to rugby from trying to make his name in the NFL. The hope of Wales finally winning at home was palpable before kick-off, with the atmosphere absolutely electric. The lights went down but a red undertone remained, with a pyrotechnics show making the Principality Stadium feel like a cauldron.Quick GuideRoundup: Ireland demolish Australia, South Africa sink Italy despite redShowMack Hansen claimed a first-half hat-trick to setIrelandon course for a record 46-19 win over his nativeAustraliain Dublin. The Canberra-born Hansen, who started at full-back for the first time at Test level, celebrated his return from a foot injury by crossing three times in the opening 28 minutes to delight a capacity Aviva Stadium crowd. Second-half scores from Caelan Doris, Ryan Baird and Robbie Henshaw ensured head coach Andy Farrell again came out on top against the former Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt.Australia trailed by just five points at the break following converted tries from Len Ikitau and Fraser McReight and claimed a late consolation through Billy Pollard. But Ireland were deserved winners ahead of completing their autumn campaign at home to South Africa, the world champions, next weekend. The fly-half Sam Prendergast kicked seven points, including a drop goal, for the dominant hosts, before his replacement Jack Crowley slotted a further nine.South Africashrugged off a red card for the second successive match to power to a 32-14 win over anItalyside that threw away a golden opportunity to earn a rare win over the Springboks in Turin on Saturday.Franco Mostert was shown a red card after 11 minutes but Italy failed to make their extra man count, with Paolo Garbisi guilty of missing kickable penalties.Tries from Marco van Staden, Morné van den Berg, Grant Williams and Ethan Hooker earned South Africa a comfortable win after they withstood enormous early pressure from Italy, who scored one second-half try through Ange Capuozzo.Guardian sport and PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A cacophony of noise flooded the stadium as Dan Edwards darted over but thanks to the skill of Japan’s Faulua Makisi it was the visitors next putting pressure on. The No 8 was instrumental in two dangerous attacks which led to a try by Kippei Ishida. Japan were the better side in the first half but things took a turn as they were handed two yellow cards for Epineri Uluiviti and Makisi. But despite being depleted, Japan did not concede and Wales had their own card to deal with as Adams’ illegal clear-out was upgraded to a red card after a bunker review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ofcom has said the delays were due toa court challenge from the Wikimedia foundation– the charity behind Wikipedia.The watchdog said it had the “highest respect” for bereaved families and pointed to achievements under its watch, such as age checks for pornography sites and a crackdown on child sexual abuse material.“We are working with urgency to drive tech firms to deliver a safer life online for children and adults in the UK, and while the job is not done, change is happening,” a spokesperson said.The Molly Rose Foundation, a charity founded by Molly’s family, has submitted a letter to the UK government calling on ministers to extend a legal requirement for transparency from public officials to apply to tech companies as well.The letter urged Alex Davies-Jones, the victims minister, to expand the remit of the public authority (accountability) bill, which introduces a “duty of candour” for public officials.The bill, brought in after criticism of how police officers presented evidence at the Hillsborough inquiry, requires public bodies and officials to help investigations – including coroner’s courts – by providing information and evidence proactively, without favouring their own position.The foundation believes that requiring companies regulated by the OSA to abide by the same rules would prevent them from dragging their heels over submitting evidence in the case of a death where social media use was potentially involved.The inquest into Molly’s death was subject to delays owing to wrangles withMetaover submitting evidence.The letter said: “This shift would fundamentally reset the relationship between tech companies and their victims – a move that would require tech companies to act transparently and expeditiously when responding to legal requests.”Recent legislation has bolstered coroners’ powers, enabling them to demand evidence of social media use from tech companies under the OSA and prevent important data from being deleted, but the letter’s signatories believe tougher powers are needed.Among more than 40 signatories were members of the group Bereaved Families for Online Safety and the Meta whistleblower Arturo Béjar.A government spokesperson pointed to the legal changes enhancing coroners’ powers to require information from tech firms.“The Online Safety Act supports coroners conducting inquests and families seeking the truth in compelling companies to share data fully where there is evidence of a link between a child’s death and their social media use',” said the spokesperson.“As promised in our manifesto, we have also strengthened this by also giving coroners the power to request that data is preserved to support inquests. We will not hesitate to act, and will work with families and campaigners to ensure we protect families and children.”In the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Here’s how to weather the data stormNaomi AldermanSat 15 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 04.18 ESTShareWe all live in history. A lot of the problems that face us, and the opportunities that present themselves, are defined not by our own choices or even the specific place or government we’re living under, but by the particular epoch of human events that our lives happen to coincide with.The Industrial Revolution, for example, presented opportunities for certain kinds of business success – it made some people very rich while others were exploited. If you’d known that was the name of your era, it would have given you a clue about what kinds of events to prepare for. So I’m suggesting a name for the era we’re living through: the Information Crisis.It’s not a single moment; it’s an epoch – we’re in the middle of it already and it is going to continue for the rest of our lives. And I’d argue that this is the third great information crisis human beings have gone through: following the invention of writing and the Gutenberg printing press, we are now witnessing a crisis caused by digital communications technology. These prolonged crises aren’t just neutral technological improvements; they change us psychologically and socially in profound ways that cannot be reversed.View image in fullscreenNaomi Alderman.Photograph: Phil Fisk/The GuardianWhat we can see from the last two information crises is that they involve enormous leaps forward in knowledge and understanding, but also a period of intense instability. Following the invention of writing, the world was filled with new, beautiful ideas and new moralities. And there were also new ways to misunderstand each other: the possibility of misreading someone entered the world, as did the possibility of warfare motivated by different interpretations of texts. After the invention of the printing press came the Enlightenment, an explosion of new scientific knowledge and discovery. But before that period, Europe had plunged into the Reformation, which led to the destruction of statues and other artworks and many institutions that had been working at least adequately until then. And, to get to the heart of the matter, the Reformation in Europe meant a lot of people got burned at the stake, or killed in other terrible ways.I’m not just talking about literal “burning at the stake”, I’m using it as a shorthand for the things people end up doing in the throes of a doctrinal dispute that are completely against the values they would otherwise claim to hold. They are things that involve turning a living, breathing person into a symbol, something that can be treated with extreme cruelty to make a point. When I talk about “burning at the stake” I don’t mean criticising someone’s views in mature debate or protesting against government policies. I mean the things that demean you as a human being if you do them to others. I mean the point when the desire to just win an argument turns you into someone who goes against all your other values. There is never a good enough reason to burn someone at the stake.I think the following is incontestable: the only way to get rid of all opinions that are different from yours is by carrying out unthinkable human rights atrocities. (And this doesn’t actually work: there are still, in fact, both Catholics and Protestants.)We can already see how this type of thing becomes more common during an information crisis because we’re now in another one. We’re overloaded and overwhelmed by information. We don’t have the social and informational structures in place yet to manage it. My suggestion is that this enormous information wave makes us anxious and angry.How? All this information introduces us to all the things we don’t know, all the ways in which we’re not experts. We might end up expressing an idea online that we’ve heard many times in our social circle only to be jumped on by 50 people who know more and tell us that our ideas are stupid, old-fashioned and even prejudiced. If this ever happens to you, it might make you feel profoundly unsettled, frightened, out of touch. That might be a good thing. It’s also an emotionally destabilising thing. It works the other way around, too. When we can see everyone else’s opinions, it turns out that someone we really liked may hold an idea that we find stupid, old-fashioned or even prejudiced. It’s the “I used to like Uncle Bob until I saw his posts on Facebook” syndrome. We’re left wondering who we can trust and whether we’re actually surrounded by upsetting idiots. All this can leave us feeling isolated and misunderstood, unsupported, frightened, worried and angry.Well, that’s probably very much how it felt in Reformation Europe to find out that your next-door neighbour had a very different idea from you about whether the bread and wine of the sacrament were really the body and blood of Christ.Which is to say: sadly we can expect this to get worse before it gets better. But there are tools and techniques we can use in the current information crisis. There are ways we can be better equipped to deal with the era we find ourselves in.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Tim Alexander/The Guardian1Find a fact-checker you trustJust as after the print revolution in early modern Europe, it is now massively easier to access scientific information. In a few seconds I can find a video clearly explaining particle physics, chemical bonds or how vaccines work. And at the same time, it is also extremely easy to find very plausible-looking information that is completely false about how vaccines are actually terrible and suggesting solutions that I really don’t even want to write down here.But unlike people living through the print revolution, we have sophisticated and trusted information-dispersal networks that are still fairly robust. The BBC has a good fact-checking service. Snopes and PolitiFact are good. There are others, and it’s worth getting familiar with them. Fact-checking is a specialised skill, though, and it is becoming more challenging as the fakes get ever more convincing.2Notice how you feel before you share informationGoodness knows, I have sometimes shared information on social media that turned out to be false. It’s very embarrassing, and I feel the urge every time to double down on my mistake and claim that there is some way in which it sort of is true even though it’s definitely not.These days, I try to notice how something I want to share on social media is making me feel. If I have a very strong feeling of any type, I use that as a cue to slow down and check my facts. It could be a strong gleeful feeling of: “Oh, this is rich.” Like a tweet I saw recently claiming to be by Donald Trump from a few years ago, saying that if the Dow drops 1,000 points in a day, the president should be impeached. “Oh, this is rich,” I thought to myself. Of course, it’s fake. Or if I feel “Oh God, that’s dreadful, what those people are doing”, that’s also a good sign it might be fake. If it feels too perfectly tailored to me, if it presses my buttons, if it precisely tickles me where I like to be tickled or hurts me where I am vulnerable to being hurt, that’s a sign to check the facts.3Resist the urge to shame others onlineWe’re going to need some new social norms to survive this crisis. Getting into the habit of pausing online whenever you feel a strong emotion and a desire to repost is one new norm to learn ourselves, and teach to children. Another is how to behave when you see someone sharing something you believe to be false. Don’t embarrass them in public. It’s going to happen to you one day, too. Think about how you’d like that person to approach you. A private note, where you’re on their side. It is extremely easy to alienate people via text communication because of all the oral-culture things that are missing from text. “Argh, that made me laugh so much but I don’t think it’s true?” Probably one of the ways that we get through this is by trying not to pointlessly alienate the other humans.4Give institutions the benefit of the doubtInstitutions that are sources of basically truthful information are going to be particularly vulnerable when, inevitably, they do get something wrong. There is no such thing as an information system that never gets anything wrong. What we’re looking for is a rapid acknowledgment of the problem, lack of defensiveness, curiosity about how it happened, a focus on systems and not individuals as the way to make sure it doesn’t happen like that again. That’s the ideal.Even with the ideal system, in an information crisis there will be plenty of people willing to tear down a good-faith truth-seeking organisation over errors, who will use an error or a bad member of that organisation as evidence that nothing from that source can be trusted.So, which institutions are we being tempted to condemn root-and-branch because of some mistakes and abuses? What large, trying-to-be-helpful-but-sometimes-failing associations would various rulers like to break up and destroy because they represent alternative sources of authority to their own narrative, and also there’s money to be made?View image in fullscreenIllustration: Tim Alexander/The Guardian5Try not to ‘hate read’The internet allows every person to access precisely the opinions that most please or enrage them – being enraged is a particular form of being pleased, actually. Finding things on the internet to “hate read” is a way of feeling great about yourself, because you’re not as stupid and wrong as those other people. The internet allows and encourages us to either find opinions that we wildly, enthusiastically agree with or conversely the most ridiculous and objectionable and stupid forms of the views on the other side of any issue.In every information crisis, there is a tendency to cut ourselves off and look not at the community around us but at the particular information that makes us feel comfortable and right. What we lose via giving in to that tendency is shared reality. That is, a reality we all consent to. Once you’ve lost that, it’s easy to dehumanise others, to start to believe that people who disagree with you aren’t really people at all.6Recognise humanityThis is about not treating people as symbols. About the sense that we are not surrounded by cretinous, vicious imbeciles but mostly by careful, thoughtful people who may disagree with us but usually have good reasons for doing so and with whom we could have a reasonably civilised conversation and find many points on which we do agree. I know that saying this already makes me sound like a utopian. I know that it feels as if we probably are surrounded by cretinous, vicious imbeciles a lot of the time. That’s because we’re already right in the middle of an information crisis.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Tim Alexander/The Guardian7Ignore the opinions of othersIf you agree that at least some of the reason that conversation and debate feel so fraught right now is because of our new communication technologies, maybe that helps with taking a step back, not immediately shouting angrily at someone who disagrees with you, online or in real life. Having thought about this a lot, I increasingly take everyone’s emotions seriously, and treat very few people’s opinions seriously. Everyone has an opinion. Unless the person is an expert it’s a mistake to treat their opinion as very important.8Use your smartphone judiciouslyA smartphone designed by people who care about your wellbeing wouldn’t be asking you to log your mental health with it – don’t do that, really really don’t do that – or even give little passive-aggressive screentime notifications. A smartphone designed by people who care about your wellbeing would prompt you to choose apps to disable after a certain point in the evening, would ask to be turned off for a certain number of hours in the day. It would presume that in general your life is better if you are not spending all day looking at a device, and try to facilitate that. As smartphones don’t do that, we need to treat them with caution. Or even get rid of them; a lot of people are doing that.9Limit social mediaLikewise, in an ideal world, social media apps would make it extremely easy not to see content that you didn’t want to see. It would be simple to “whitelist” accounts, topics, video channels, types of content. That is to say, if social media apps were designed with public service in mind, it would be straightforward to tell them, for example, “I only want to see my friends’ pictures of their family, their pets, their recipes, their updates about their career” or whatever it is that you want to see, without having to confront their political opinions. We are living through a time when we are going to be winding each other up a lot. It is all right to want to preserve relationships with family members and friends by only seeing their politics when you choose to engage with it.And see people in person. If we rely on technology for human connection over in-person interactions, it will leave us feeling more lonely. If you’re feeling more isolated than you were just a few years ago, technology might be the reason. Start by understanding that loneliness isn’t just something that’s happening to you because you’ve done something wrong; it’s a feature of the historical era we’re living through. Make an arrangement to see someone, in person. Your friends would like to hear from you.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Tim Alexander/The Guardian10Don’t cut children off altogetherThere are some online services that allow whitelisting for the children’s version but not for the grown-up one. This in itself is terrible for adults and for children. It creates a cliff-edge where either you’re – let’s say – under 13 and you can only see a few child-focused things on the internet, or suddenly you’re 13 and you get the full firehose of internet horror straight in the face. It means childhood is more denuded of opportunities for entertainment and culture – if everything is accessed via a parent’s smartphone then how do children play music for themselves, or browse radio stations? And it means that there are no helpful on-ramps where parents can slowly decide over the years which more adult-oriented content they can tell their child is ready for. “Protecting the children” is a terrible framing for this. We all need technology that at least allows us the option to take care of ourselves.11Campaign for better lawsAlthough these problems would happen to some extent without technology companies, it is clear that many tech companies now are exacerbating them. We need laws that put us in charge of our own smartphones and our own social media, that mean that we can say exactly what we want to see on them and when. We deserve smartphones and social media that protect our wellbeing and that of our children – countries need to work together on new laws to force the tech companies to do this.12Avoid pointless argumentsThese days, on Bluesky, I have the words “not getting into pointless arguments on the internet is an act of revolution” in my profile. It keeps me honest. Sometimes I feel tempted to get into a pointless argument. Sometimes someone else has to say, “I thought you didn’t believe in doing this”. And I stand back and go, “Oh yes, arse, I haven’t lived according to my own values here”.Here’s a rule I have developed for myself: never talk about a culture-war topic with anyone who only wants to talk to you about that topic. These conversations can only be helpful if they happen as part of a relationship. If you’re going in cold on a very hard topic, you will not be able to experience each other as people, only as opinions or symbols.Ultimately, don’t let the worst “the other side” has done become the new low bar for your own behaviour. Don’t treat people as symbols. Consider the possibility that where reasonable people disagree there may be some useful truth on both sides, even if it’s only the truth of – as we say these days – “lived experience”. Don’t try to get anyone fired today. Don’t insult or berate someone today. Don’t trawl through someone’s social media going back decades to dredge up the worst thing they’ve ever said, today. Don’t, fundamentally, burn anyone at the stake today.Don’t Burn Anyone at the Stake Today (and Other Lessons from History About Living Through an Information Crisis) by Naomi Alderman is published by Fig Tree (£16.99).

They’re a middle-class couple calledJoe and Eileen Baileyand they live on Long Island. At one point the imaginary couple, who feature inSchumer’s 2007 book, Positively American, were called the O’Reillys. According to the Hill, one Schumer aide said the name then was changed because the publisher thought O’Reilly was “too ethnic” for mass consumption. Another aide said that claim was false, and Schumer just wanted a name that “sounded more national”. Naming strategy aside, the key point here is that Schumer has said he runs all his policy decisions by this completely fictional couple. He’s referred to themhundreds of timesthroughout his political career.With that in mind, you can probably thank the Baileys for the latest Democratic disaster. The US government has just emerged from the longestshutdown in history. About 700,000 federal employees workedwithout pay, desperately needed food benefitswere disrupted,court caseswere delayed, national parks closed and flights gotcancelled.All this pain was supposed to be in service of a very specific gain. Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown because they wanted to take a stand on healthcare. The24 million peoplewho get their health coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces (commonly known as Obamacare) are going to see their premiumsmore than doubleafter an enhanced tax credit expires at the end of the year. The Democrats want to extend the credits; the Republicans have refused to commit to avote on the issue.You can certainly argue that shutting down the government to force a vote on Obamacare subsidies was the right thing to do. But it is very hard to find any strategic sense in putting Americans through a world of pain for 43 days only to shrug your shoulders and give up. Particularly as Schumer himself said the subsidies were a “life or death” issue and there was “no fucking way” the Democrats would cave on it.But cave they did – and just as it looked like their strategy was paying off. An NBC pollreleased on 2 Novemberfound that voters said Trump and Republicans in Congress were more to blame for the ongoing government shutdown than the Democrats. You could argue that people were starting to turn on Republicans and their hand would be forced. But the Democrats once again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Seven Senate Democrats andone Democratic-aligned independentbroke with the party last weekend to vote for a bill that would reopen the government. Those expiring tax credits that Schumer said were a “life or death” issuewere left unresolved.Schumer, to be clear, voted no on the bill. But he’s the Democratic leader, he’s supposed to keep his party in line; the buck stops with Chuck. Nowat least ninefurious Democrats are calling for 74-year-old Schumer, who is clearly not being advised well by his imaginary friends, to step aside. Axiosnotesthat “this represents Democrats’ largest groundswell against one of their leaders since last year’s effort to push then President Biden off the presidential ticket”.Among the lawmakers demanding Schumer step aside is Ro Khanna, a California representative who has been outspoken about how the Democratic party has forgotten how to fight and needs “a total makeover”. Khanna, who co-chaired the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign and isexpectedto be a 2028 presidential candidate, has noted that Schumer has lost touch with the zeitgeist on multiple levels. Schumerrefusedto endorse Zohran Mamdani, for example. And the top Senate Democrat, who told the New York Timesin Marchthat his “job is to keep the left pro-Israel”, does not seem to understand why so manyyoung Democratsare aghast at Israel’songoinggenocide in Gaza.“Senator Schumer caved on protecting people from losing their health insurance,” Khanna told me in a statement. “There are 20 million people in this country who are about to see huge premium hikes and we got no concession. We need Medicare for All and we need a politics of morality and truth-telling. That includes a moral voice on Gaza and stopping bombs to Netanyahu. His time is up.”Unfortunately, US politicians are not very good at voluntarily ceding power with dignity.EightDemocratic members of Congress have died in office since November 2022. And last month Eleanor Holmes Norton, an 88-year-old Democratic congresswoman representing Washington DC, was described in a police report as experiencing “early stages of dementia” after being scammed in her home (her office told NBC Washington “the medical diagnosis included in the police report was based on an assumption the reporting officer was unqualified to make”). Nevertheless, the calls for Schumer to step aside are getting louder, and harder to ignore. The 74-year-old can gracefully step aside now or he can wait be humiliated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who manybelieve will challengeSchumer for his Senate seat in 2028.Whatever Schumer does, I suggest he stop his conversations with the Baileys stat. We don’t need you talking to your imaginary friends, Chuck. We need you listening to the concerns of real people.Record numbers of young women want to leave the USForty per cent of women aged 15 to 44 say they would move abroad forever if they could, according to asurvey from Gallup. That’s four times higher than the 10% who wanted to leave in 2014 and more than double the number of young men (19%) who want to leave the US right now. It’s almost as if young women aren’t keen on being treated like walking wombs.Megyn Kelly says Jeffrey Epstein might not have been ‘an actual pedophile’The podcaster and former Fox and NBC News hostsaid on her showon Wednesday that she had heard Epstein “was into the barely legal type… like he liked 15-year-old girls … There’s a difference between a 15-year-old and a five-year-old”.“I realize this is disgusting, I’m not making an excuse for this,” she said, noting that “every time we talk about Epstein, it makes your skin crawl” – but it’s a bold move to publicly split hairs about preying on vulnerable teenage girls.Kim Kardashian lashes out at psychics after failing the bar examFirst Kardashianblamed ChatGPTfor causing her to fail her legal exams; now she’s attackingpsychics. “They all collectively, maybe four of them, have told me I was gonna pass the bar, so they’re [the psychics] all full pathological liars,” Kardashian said in a TikTok video. Who could have seen this coming, eh? Not the psychics, that’s for sure. Forget the spiritual advisers, Kim.

The experiment only played male voices because it was meant to show physical violence is not necessary to scare off gulls, and men are more likely tocommit crimes against wildlife.

Why has Swift, who once wanted ‘to be on the right side of history’, said nothing?Sat 15 Nov 2025 06.41 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 07.33 ESTShareIn the last two weeks, the Trump administration has used music from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in three posts on social media. Thefirst, shared by the official White House account on TikTok, was a patriotic slide show of images set to lead single The Fate of Ophelia. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, the video cuts to pictures of the US flag, President Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and the first and second ladies. The second and third were posted by Team Trump, the official account for the Trump Campaign.One, set to Father Figure, riffs on the lyric “this empire belongs to me” with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”, while theother, celebrating Melania Trump winning something called the Patriot of the year award, is soundtracked by Opalite.The Trump administration has found itself in dicey waters for using popular music in the past.The White Stripesand the estate ofIsaac Hayeshave both attempted to sue the administration for using their music without permission, while artists including Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have released statements demanding Trump stop using their songs at campaign rallies and public appearances. Most recently,Olivia Rodrigo condemnedthe administration after the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram account used her song All-American Bitch on a video promoting its controversial deportation efforts (the song was later removed by Instagram).Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueSwift, however, has said nothing in public. The silence is surprising from an artist known to be litigious over unsanctioned use of her music or likeness: she has previouslysued a theme parkfor playing her music without a licence,come for Etsy sellersfor using lyrics from her songs in unofficial merch,taken on YouTubecreators over copyright infringement anddemanded retroactive songwriting creditsfrom newer artists (including Rodrigo). (Her representatives did not respond to a request for comment.)That Swift and her team haven’t issued a statement distancing her from a president mired in scandal and an administration criticised for censorship, violent immigration raids and far-right policies, is curious. Once politically shy, she appeared to fullyembrace and advocate for progressive values in 2018, so much so that her decision to speak out about politics became the narrative tent pole of her documentary Miss Americana. She has subsequently endorsed Democratic political candidates, supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 American presidential election, and criticised the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade. “I need to be on the right side of history,” she said in Miss Americana, apparently defying the advice of team members including her own father.It is now unclear whether that statement still stands. If it does, Swift seems less interested in telling us so: she hasn’t denounced ICE raids or commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict.It’s a non-position that chimes with those of other once vocally liberal celebrities who have now clammed up about politics. Jennifer Lawrencerecently saidshe would no longer publicly discuss the president as it would just “add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart”. Instead, “a lot of the movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape”, she said, “and that’s how I feel like I can be helpful”. Other stars who endorsed Harris alongside Swift in 2024, including Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry, have similarly remained schtum. Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney has refused to engage with the fraught political discourse,even after being revealed as a registered Republican.Like Lawrence, Swift may believe that publicly opposing the Trump administration would further fracture an already crumbling nation. She may be quietly supporting those whose lives have been affected by the government’s attacks on immigrants and minorities. And there is risk in speaking out: after Swift endorsed Harris, Trump said he “hates” Swift, and asthe Jimmy Kimmel fracasdemonstrated, the government isn’t afraid to use its heft to silence critics.Fear of retribution hasn’t muffled other stars, though: both Rodrigo and Billie Eilish have made their feelings about the Trump administration clear, as have artists including Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Madonna and Bruce Springsteen.Of course, Swift has more to lose than most. Despite critical brickbats for The Life of a Showgirl, she has never been more popular, at least commercially. Aforthcoming Disney-produced docuseriesgoing behind the scenes of the Eras tour is hotly anticipated. And there are her upcoming nuptials to Travis Kelce. Their relationship has turned them into jingoistic emblems for red-blooded (and red-hatted) Americans: the late conservator commentator Charlie Kirkvociferously approved, while other Maga voices suggested their union would encourage Americans to procreate. It has helped reshape Swift’s image so much that even Trump softened on her: “I think that she’s a terrific person,” he said while congratulating the couple on their engagement.View image in fullscreenRed-blooded Americans … Swift with her fiance, Travis Kelce, of the Kansas City Chiefs.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesThe president may also see some of himself in Swift, a staunch businesswoman who releases multiple editions of her albums to generate extra revenue and secure high chart positions – seemingly timed to prevent other artists from reaching No 1. It’s telling that Swift’s attention right now appears to be on blocking Spanish star Rosalía from scoring a No 1 album withLux, by releasing a new streaming-exclusive variant of The Life of a Showgirl. If that is the case, this money-grubbing, competition-destroying approach to pop stardom is paralleled in Trump’s profit-driven mindset, and her self-interest even perhaps has a parallel with his protectionist economic policy.Jennifer Lawrence says speaking about Trump would ‘add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart’Read moreSwift, as with corporations such as Disney, Meta, Paramount and Walmart, might see kissing the ring as economically advantageous. There is even a whiff of conservatism to the material on Showgirl that feels in step with Trump 2.0: Cancelled! defends those who have faced public backlash, while on Wi$h Li$t she fantasises about a white picket fence lifestyle, a basketball hoop and to “have a couple kids / Got the whole block looking like you.”It is difficult to forget the young woman of Miss Americana who so passionately rejected the advice of those around her in order to speak up for what she believed was right. Whatever you think about celebrities’ impact on politics, Swift’s platform is so monumental that any public opposition to the Trump administration would be valuable, be it through her art or her actions. It may further fuel what is already a fiery and divisive political climate, but her influence gives her the potential to galvanise thousands in rejecting increasingly regressive and terrifying social and political norms.But if Showgirl is indicative of Swift’s current preoccupations, she has never been more insular. Vengeful, self-absorbed and lacking imagination, it is the product of an artist who seems disconnected from the anxious state of the world. “I protect the family,” she sings on Father Figure. Once, you knew exactly what that meant. Now, it’s not so clear.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

So why is no one watching her films?Sat 15 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 06.11 ESTShareIwas on a walk around my local area in London when I was stopped in my tracks by a young man sauntering past me, wearing stone-wash jeans, a pair of shades and a “Reagan-Bush ’84” T-shirt. He gave off an incredibly smug air but, to be fair, he did look good. It’s a nice T-shirt, not like those garish Reform-branded football kits, so I could see why it might be appealing. A quick search informed me that for gen-Z rightwingers in the US, it has become the “conservative takeon a band shirt or the once-ubiquitous Che Guevara tee”.That casual display of conservative aesthetics reminded me of something else too: a much discussedcover of New York magazinefrom earlier this year, after Trump 2.0’s inauguration, which showed young rightwingers celebrating as they “contemplate cultural domination”.“Conservatism – as a cultural force, not just a political condition – is back in a real way for the first time since the 1980s,” the journalist Brock Colyar wrote. Perhaps, given the way the British and American cultural spheres seem more enmeshed than ever, it was only a matter of time before I happened upon a Republican T-shirt in my back yard.View image in fullscreenCover of New York magazine from January this year.Illustration: Mark Peterson/Redux for New York MagazineThe US right has long had designs on controlling culture – frustrated by the idea that, despite many political successes, the arts remain in the grip of a liberal-left orthodoxy. (It’s neatly echoed in Britain by debates about BBC “wokeness”.) If there is anything members of the Maga movement want more than their guys in office, it is to feel that their worldview is reflected back to them whenever they turn on a screen or head into a gallery. That is what lies behind Donald Trump’s attacks on the Smithsonian museum, which he seeks to purge of “improper ideology”, and his threatened imposition of100% tariffson non-US-made films.But as we draw to the close of the year, what has come to pass from this prediction of a conservative seizure of culture? There were early claims of victory. In the Atlantic, after the latest season of The White Lotus came out, the commentator Helen Lewis wrote that it was “the first great work of artin the post-woke era”. The critic Kevin Maher in the Times proclaimed simply that “woke is dead” and that “middle-aged white men” are back in – he cited the return of Mel Gibson, who has been repeatedly accused of bigotry, and his forthcoming follow-up to The Passion of the Christ.What caused the biggest stir, however, was the trajectory ofSydney Sweeney, the breakout Euphoria actor who fronted an advertising campaign by American Eagle that played with the idea of her having “great jeans/genes”. Some critics saw the advert as flirting with white supremacist eugenics. Meanwhile, Sweeney, who was reported to haveregistered as a Republicanvoter in Florida a few months before Trump’s election, has been hailed as representing a return to more “traditional”, white-centric beauty standards in the culture.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump and ICE, is due to perform at Super Bowl 2026.Photograph: Alexander Tamargo/WireImageEarlier this month, when addressing the controversy in aninterview for GQ, the journalist Katherine Stoeffel said the criticism centred around the idea that “in this political climate, white people shouldn’t joke about genetic superiority”, offering Sweeney the opportunity to clarify. With startlingly empty eyes, Sweeney answered: “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.” For this, rightwing zealots see her as leading the great unwokening of Hollywood: stars, rejoice! You need no longer kowtow to cancel culture. Perhaps she simply thinks the furore is silly and doesn’t want to entertain it. But presented with the chance to distance herself from such a divisive narrative that’s been projected on her, why would she not?If there is a great popular desire for fewer woke cultural figures, the verdict is still decidedly out: Sweeney’s latest film, Christy, in which she portrays the boxer Christy Martin, has recorded one of theworst opening weekendsin box-office history. (It follows on from her box-office bombs of Eden and Americana, which opened in the US this year.) A few flops don’t tell us everything. But as Sweeney is perhaps the most talked about star of the year, it raises a question: the right may be determined to disrupt Hollywood and the arts, but does it actually care enough about it to consistently show up? Buying a political T-shirt is an easy commitment; having to sit through a two-hour biopic to prop up the conservative-leaning lead star, less so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It may cry out for the Super Bowl half-time show to feature a Nashville-approved conservative singer, but it will have to get on Duolingo in time to understand record-breakerBad Bunny’s 2026 performance, in which he’ll most likely cuss out Trump and ICE entirely in Spanish.Contemporary conservatism has failed to become cool because its instincts are more about edgy provocation than any serious appreciation of art and culture.Great art will always be about expanding our worlds, not making them smaller. Even Kelsey Grammer, arguably Hollywood’s most prominent conservative, knows this: despite being an open Trump supporter, he has affirmed his decades-longcommitment to diversity, which includes executive-producing the 2000s sitcom Girlfriends, about four Black women in Los Angeles.Those predictions about a post-woke Hollywood also look laughable considering some of the great woke film successes of the year: takeSinners, an African-American horror film scored with southern Black music, orOne Battle After Another, about an ex-revolutionary and his mixed-race daughter fighting against explicitly racist US state authorities. Both have garnered critical success (the former doing very well at the box office) and have Oscars buzz. The young mixed-race actor Chase Infiniti looks in much better stead than Sweeney.In the end, people will queue up for what they want to watch and listen to. When most people ask for culture recommendations, they don’t ask “Is it diverse?” or “Is it conservative?”, they ask, “Is it any good?” So perhaps Sweeney should spend more time letting us know why her films are worth watching rather than what colour her eyes are.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

Because while the Nationals wag theLiberal partydog, the Labor party is failing to sell its own policies to the nation, and the rest of us who care about effective climate policy are being drowned out.What’s amazing is that the Nationals – with less than 4% of the vote at the last federal election – have been able to get away with prosecuting such a fact-free, yet influential case that’s now dictating Liberal party policy and, to some degree, public sentiment.Take Senator Bridget McKenzie opining without challenge on ABC Radio Melbourne last week that renewable energy and climate policy are economically negative for our country.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailVoices that cut through with facts and reason are few and far between. I can’t figure out if they’re cowed or just don’t know how to get into the fight.There’s a useful articleherethat sets out the evidence (not opinion) that renewables provide the cheapest form of energy; that coal-fired power is much more expensive and that global gas prices have driven energy costs up over the last few years – not therenewables transition.And yet, Sussan Ley has been allowed to spin the line that because of the push towards net zerothere’s been a 40% increase in power costs since Labor took government.It is absolute, unadulterated rubbish.2:17What does net zero emissions actually mean? And is it different to the Paris agreement? – videoJust a reminder that if theCoalitionhadn’t undermined all efforts to speed up the transition to renewable energy between 2013 and 2022, even as dozens of coal-fired power stations were decommissioned, we wouldn’t be here.The removal of coal from the system combined with multinationals starving the east coast of gas at a reasonable price and the impact of international energy prices put massive upward pressure on electricity costs.In a nutshell, that is why the transition is taking longer and is more expensive than it would have been if the Coalition had not been actively sabotaging effective energy policy sinceMalcolm Turnbullwas toppled as opposition leader as far back as 2009.Now they are at it again.Google “what is the cheapest form of energy in Australia?” and you landon this very informative reportfrom the Climate Council which says: “On average in 2024-25, thewholesale price for power from renewables(the price electricity retailers pay, which accounts for up to 40% of our power bills) was $74/MWh – compared to$135/MWhfor power from coal and gas.”The same evidence-based report sets out data from the Australian Energy Market Operator, the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Commission showing thatgasis the big driver of price spikes in the grid.And yet, the spurious misinformation that’s being pushed by the fossil fuel companies and their proxies, swallowed by theNational partyand now propagated by the Liberals is running wild around the countryside.Labor has been slow to push back, while the renewable energy sector has shown itself to be at best weak, at worst useless, when it comes to rebutting big coal and big gas, which are successfully standing up a lie largely unchallenged.I for one am not going to just sit here and let this stand, because the big risk is that this doubt-seeding causes even the most ardent supporters of net zero to start wondering: is it all worth it? Indeed, can it be done? Or worse, should we just give up?To the Nationals’ eternal shame, it is regional economies who are most affected by climate change and stand to gain most from action to mitigate fire, flood, storm and drought.Everyone is letting them down with lies, delays and failure to make the argument.Malcolm Turnbull accuses Liberals of ‘Trumpian campaign against renewables’ after party dumps net zeroRead morePeople keep asking me whetherthis week’s eventsstrengthen the position of community independents.Probably.

Last year, Universal Music Group (UMG), alongside labels including Warner Records and Sony Music Entertainmentsued two AI music startupsfor allegedly using their recordings to train text-to-music models without permission.But last month,UMG announced a dealwith one of the defendants, Udio, to create an AI music platform. Their jointpress releaseoffered assurances that the label will commit to “do what’s right by [UMG’s] artists”. However, one advocacy group, the Music Artists Coalition,responded with the statement: “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership’, but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps.”The lawsuit is one of dozens across US courts. As artists, publishers and studios argue that the use of their material in AI training is copyright infringement, judges are struggling to reconcile copyright law with a technology that undermines the very concept of authorship. For many, this is as much a legal question as it is one of justice. InAndersen v Stability AI, one of the first class-action lawsuits over an AI image generator, artists allege that the use of their artwork to train AI models without credit, compensation or consent “violat[es] the rights of millions of artists”.That creative workers bear the brunt of the AI boom is not in question – generative AI isalreadydisplacing creative labour. In January 2024,more than a third of illustratorswho responded to a Society of Authors survey said they had lost income due to AI, and one study projects a21% revenue lossfor audiovisual creators by 2028.In response, a new wave of activism has united entertainment executives and artists to take on the tech industry withsocial media campaigns, crowdfundedlobbying, and lawsuits. TheHuman Artistry Campaign, an industry-artist coalition founded on the principle that “AI can never replace human expression and artistry”, rallies creatives and executives to jointly endorse legislation protecting artists from AI and big tech. But some artists, creators and civil liberties groups warn of another danger: big content.What might the consequences be of well-intentioned working creatives taking the side of large media conglomerates that have longexploited their labourandaggressively expandedcopyrightagainst public interest? While some artists insist that an “enemy of my enemy” approach strategically justifies joining big content’s side, this won’t work if big content and big tech seem to be going from “enemies-to-lovers”.Dave Hansen, copyright lawyer and executive director of the non-profit Authors Alliance, argues that copyright lawsuitswon’t protect artists against AI. Instead, they’ll lead to exclusive licensing deals between large media and tech companies while “everybody else gets sort of left out in the cold”. History supports the cynics. When the tech and entertainment industries negotiated licensing during the rise of streaming,labelsandstudiospocketed the profits and left musicians, writers and actors behind. Will AI licensing deals be any different? When the AI company Runway and Lionsgatestruck a licensing deal, the CEO of United Talent Agency, Jeremy Zimmer, said: “If I’m an artist and I’ve made a Lionsgate movie, now suddenly that Lionsgate movie is going to be used to help build out an LLM for an AI company, am I going to be compensated for that?” In some multimillion dollar deals between publishers and AI companies, authors weregiven neither compensationnor thechoice to opt-outof datasets.Even if US courts rule that tech companies must pay for AI training data, working artists are unlikely to benefit. Creating a licensing regime under the current imbalance of power could embolden media companies to pressure artists into signing away their training rights as a condition of employment. Voice actors havealready been askedto sign such contracts. Nor would mandatory licensing rein in big tech. Companies such as Google and OpenAI can afford to pay the cost of licensing this data; smaller, open-source AI developers cannot. Ironically, the quest to take down big tech through copyright is further consolidating power in its hands.Too many of the solutions proposed in the name of “protecting artists” would not only fail to do so, but potentially hurt artists and the public at large. In the US, the proposed NO FAKES Act, supported by major entertainment coalitions, would create a federal “digital replication right” to regulate deepfakes: nonconsensual AI replicas of a person’s voice or likeness. However, civil liberties groups, including the Center for Democracy and Technology and the American Civil Liberties Union,have criticised the bill’s vague language, weak protections for free speech and potential for abuse. The NO FAKES Act would allow individuals – includingchildren– to license and transfer their digital replica rights for up to 10 years (five for children). It’s easy to imagine studio executives salivating over the prospect of pressuring young artists into signing away control of their own faces and voices.Why do these solutions fall so short? Because many of these copyright lawsuits, licensing solutions and digital replica rights are Trojan horses, inside of which sits big content. TheCopyright Alliance, an influential non-profit advocating for the interests of the “copyright community”, argues for strong copyright solutions to generative AI. While it claims to “advocate for individual creators”, its board of directors is stacked with industry executives from media giants such as Paramount, NBC Universal, Disney and Warner Bros.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because big content needs artists. Its media empires need artists’ labour to profit, its lobbying needs artist support to seem legitimate and its new AI business partners need artists’ art.This fact points to a strategy that entertainment executives fear far more than AI, one that would empower artists to challenge the status quo across big content and big tech: organised labour. Unionised creative workers, such as those in the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, have securedmeaningfulprotectionsagainst AI through strikes and collective bargaining. Copyright is a tool too antiquated, too static and too indelicate to bear the task of deciding the future of an already precarious creative labour force. If big content truly cared about protecting artists from AI, it would stop trying to sell their voices as training data and start listening to them.Alexander Avila is a video essayist, writer and researcherExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionUniversal MusiccommentShareReuse this content"

Newton’ssecond law of motionwill be familiar to anyone who’s ever studied physics. For some who struggled with that course, it may bring back painful memories. But for me, as an awkward teenager, it was oddly comforting – proof of an ordered, structured universe where cause always led to predictable effect. I carried that belief into university, where I studied physics, and even into my career. If I just worked hard enough, success would be mine.But nine months into my first job, I got made redundant. It turns out that life doesn’t always obey Newton’s laws.Losing your job is tough for anyone. But for me, it was devastating. I had worked so hard, yet somehow I had still failed. It felt like a violation of everything I thought I knew about how the world worked. And on top of this, I was completely burned out after months of manic work.My employer was not a company run by sadists who delighted in playing with the hopes of naive young graduates. There was a broader context to this layoff. And once I had passed through the shock and numbness, I could begin to see it. It was the summer of 2001, and all was not well with the world. The dotcombubble burstinghad sent financial shock waves around the globe, forcing my company – a management consultancy – to cut jobs.And the crisis itself wasn’t even unique. Similar things happened during the2008 sub-prime mortgagecrash. In 2011, there was the eurozone crisis. In 2013, the rupee crashed. In 2015, turbulence on the Chinese stock market.No one saw any of these crises coming – or at least not precisely. And in almost every case, they weren’t triggered by some enormous, dramatic event but by small, seemingly innocuous failures that snowballed into something far larger.UK 18- to 24-year-olds: we would like to hear your experiences of trying to find a jobRead moreAnd this is where ideas from physics come in again. While Newton’s second law of motion proved an imperfect way for me to analyse the world, there are other ideas from my studies that have helped me understand these crises, and our place within them. All the above events are examples of chaotic systems – ones that, in theory, can be explained by cause and effect, but in practice are so sensitive to conditions that tiny variations can spiral into radically different outcomes.Take the “three-body problem”, made famous by the Liu Cixin novel and the recent Netflix adaptation. If you have two planets orbiting each other, you can predict their paths for ever. But add athirdplanet, and suddenly the forces interacting between the three bodies become so complex that the mathematics explodes into unpredictability. The system is still governed by clear laws, but an infinitesimally small shift can throw the whole system off balance.This idea doesn’t just apply to things as big as the financial system or astrophysics; we can see such complexity and unpredictability in our own lives. For many, the response is control: we optimise our schedules, work harder, operate at maximum capacity. I know I certainly did. I assumed the way to get ahead was to work as hard as humanly possible. But physics teaches us that, for systems susceptible to chaotic forces, this actually makes us more fragile, not less.Think of a power grid. Most of the time, it hums along without problem. But during an unexpected surge – for example, when millions of air-conditioners are switched on at once during a heatwave – the system can overload and shut down. To prevent this, engineers design grids with slack in the system: surge capacity to absorb unexpected spikes. A grid that operates at 80% survives a sudden spike in demand; one at 100% causes blackouts.As a young graduate, I had been living without any surge capacity, at the limit of my abilities. And that’s perhaps why losing my job was so painful. But the truth is, most of us do the same. We convince ourselves that if we just push harder, we’ll be fine. But the more we operate at our limits, the more vulnerable we become.Arecent reportfrom Mental Health UK revealed that 91% of UK adults have experienced high or extreme stress in the past year, with young people feeling it most acutely. Meanwhile, nearly half of young workers regularlywork unpaid overtime. Among all UK desk workers, 84%feel pressuredto work overtime regularly and 65% have to work at weekends to get their job done. We’re a nation of power grids running at 100%, wondering why we’re burning out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnd from my own personal experience of burnout, I’m reminded of another idea from physics. You can heat water gradually and nothing seems to change – until you reach a critical threshold, boiling point. And suddenly the whole system transforms –undergoing what’s known as a phase transition – from liquid to gas. People can absorb strain for a while, operating at maximum capacity, appearing fine. But stress doesn’t accumulate linearly. It builds until a critical point, and then the system flips. That’s why burnout often feels sudden, even though the pressure has been building for months or years.Over the years, I’ve learned techniques to build my personal surge capacity. I try to always leave enough slack in my day for the unexpected. And I’ve learned that recovery isn’t a luxury, it’s essential.But we’ve built an economy that celebrates overwork and treats burnout as personal failure rather than as a design flaw. The recentKeep Britain Working reviewrevealed an alarming increase in people dropping out of the workforce due to mental health conditions. Could it be that the overwhelming nature of work itself – the expectation to operate at 100% capacity with zero surge capacity – is what’s making people unable to work at all?Until we recognise that resilience requires inefficiency – that robust systems must have slack – we’re just optimising our way towards collapse. Newton’s second law still holds. I just wish someone had told me that it’s not just about how much force you apply, but knowing when to ease off.Zahaan Bharmal is the author ofThe Art of Physicsand a senior director at Google, writing in a personal capacityExplore more on these topicsMental healthOpinionWork & careersHealth & wellbeingHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Now, Close alternates the glamour of the red carpet with living in a red state. She talks about the joy of her ‘undefined’ lifeByEmma BrockesSat 15 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 14.16 ESTShareMost of us don’t live our lives in accordance with a governing metaphor, but Glenn Close does. The 78-year-old was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, a town in the north‑east of the US that, to the actor’s enduring irritation, telegraphs “smug affluence” to other Americans. In fact, Close’s background is more complicated than that, rooted in a childhood that was wild and free but also traumatic, and in an area of New England in which her family goes back generations. “I grew up on those great stone walls of New England,” says the actor, chin out, gimlet-eyed – Queen Christina at the prow of a ship. “Some of them were 6ft tall and 250 years old! I have a book called Sermons in Stone and it says at one point that more energy and hours ran into building the New England stone walls than the pyramids.”If the walls are an image Close draws on for strength, they might also serve as shorthand for the journalist encountering her at interview. Close appears in a London hotel suite today in a military-style black suit, trim, compact, and with a small white dog propped up on a chair beside her. For the span of our conversation, the actor’s warmth and friendliness combine with a reserve so practised and precise that the presence of the dog in the room feels, unfairly perhaps, like a handy way for Close to burn through a few minutes of the interview with some harmless guff about dog breeds. (The dog is called Pip, which is short for “Sir Pippin of Beanfield”. He is a purebred Havanese and “they’re incredibly intelligent”. Most dog owners in the US have the emotional support paperwork necessary to get them on a plane but, says Close, laughing, “That’s really what he is!”)Anyway, none of this matters – neither the reserve nor the canine distraction – because, of course,Glenn Closeis completely irresistible. How could she not be? The intensity of her most famous roles, from Alex Forrest, the “bunny boiler” in Fatal Attraction (1987), to her maniacal Cruella de Vil in 101 Dalmatians (1996), to Joan Castleman, the seething protagonist of The Wife (2017), makes her that rare thing, a movie star who is also beloved as a character actor. Long before A-list actors made a stampede towards television, Close was churning out five seasons of Damages, the great New York legal drama that ran from 2007, and her choice of projects remains improbably broad. After our meeting, she will fly to Berlin to film the sixth instalment of The Hunger Games, in which she will play Drusilla Sickle, then return to London to film Maud, a drama for Channel 4, all the while appearing on Disney+ in Ryan Murphy’s new schlock divorce drama, All’s Fair, in which she stars alongside – broad church, indeed – Kim Kardashian. Close, who has been known to lobby for a role after she has been turned down for it, has never won an Oscar, and if it’s a weird glitch in Hollywood history, from certain angles the omission works in her favour. Taken alongside the impossible grandness of a Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett, Close remains the more nimble and interesting performer.View image in fullscreenPortraits: David Vintiner/The GuardianActually, I suspect Close can be extremely grand in her way; she’s just better at clothing it in a down-to-earth manner. Her newest release isWake Up Dead Man, the third Knives Out mystery by Rian Johnson for Netflix – first film, fantastic; second, a mess; this one, a return to form with a starry ensemble cast that includes Andrew Scott, Josh Brolin and Kerry Washington. (Brolin plays a Trump-like preacher in a small town in upstate New York, thumping his pulpit and leading people towards mutual hatred and suspicion.) Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc is funnier than ever (the best joke involves a snippet of music from Cats and some organ music from Phantom of the Opera). But the standout role in the movie is Close as Martha Delacroix, a righteous woman quivering with religious fervour – or “a sad character with no life outside the church”, as Close puts it – with the creepy habit of materialising behind people and making them jump.The role was an easy yes for Close because of Johnson’s reputation. “I leapt at it!” she says. “I’d heard from absolutely everyone what a wonderful human being Rian Johnson is. And he really is. He’s incredibly bright and funny, and wonderful. I mean I’d marry him if he wasn’t already married.” Dry pause. “And if he’d have me, at my age.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m not a hugely social person. But I have neighbours who I really, really like’Poor Martha: stricken with guilt, fanatical to the core – a spoofy role, says Close, that “you have to play for real. If you try to be funny, you’re not funny. And the behaviour is funny because it’s written well.” It’s the quality of the writing that often draws Close to a project, and in this case, “Rian said he worked on the plot for eight months before he actually started writing”. Unlike the lastKnives Outfilm, in which Johnson skewered the tech bros with a laboriousness that made the experience of watching it exhausting, the new movie takes on demagoguery without overtly wagging the finger. “It’s not making huge statements,” says Close, “and at the end, it’s like, order is restored and hope is possible.”Close keeps a small apartment in Greenwich Village in New York – “where I started my career” – but her own source of hope and stability is her newish base outside Bozeman, Montana. This is where the actor’s extended family now lives – her sister and brother, who moved there in the 1980s, followed more recently by her older sister, and finally by her daughter, Annie, with Annie’s husband, Marc (the couple moved from LA and earlier this year had their first child). Close joined them permanently in 2019, and her wonder and enthusiasm for a tight-knit family, all living in one place – “It’s such a gift! All the cousins will grow up together!” – indicates how far it is from the way she was raised. But we’ll get to that.I don’t live a life that is saying, Look at who I am, I’m a big famous actress. I never haveI tell her I have been onher Instagram page– she looks theatrically appalled: “I’m sorry!” – and was surprised to see photos she posted from a recent anti‑Trump, No Kings march in that part of the world, which skews heavily Republican and libertarian. “Yeah, it’s very red. We have a university in Bozeman, which is a blue island in a largely red state. So it was amazing that so many people came and stayed the entire time. They’d made their signs. I think everyone is just longing to be able to somehow let other people know how they feel. I’ve actually thought about going down to the courthouse with a sign.”Montana’s reputation is deceptive in other ways, too. It is cowboy country – “Just around the corner from me is where Bob Redford filmed The Horse Whisperer,” says Close – but has long been popular with the ultra-wealthy in search of peace and stunning scenery. Michael Keaton has a ranch there, as does David Letterman; Ted Turner owns one of the largest ranches in the state. Close is living much more modestly and says she is working on finding her own community. “I’m not a hugely social person. But I have neighbours who I really, really like, and in my little community there’s a women’s club I’ve been to once and really enjoyed it.”View image in fullscreen‘She will always be relevant.

The image of a Montana version of the Women’s Institute featuring Glenn Close on the cake committee is … unexpected. What do they do there? “People bring little cakes. The community will have potluck dinners. You get to meet Betty Biggs, whose family’s been ranching there for five generations, and she’s just a very interesting woman. I’m not somebody who would run to a ‘women’s club’, but I really enjoyed it, that sense of community.”The other notable thing about Close’s social media feed is that the photos she posts of herself divide neatly into two categories: red-carpet ready and just woken up. For a movie star, and an older one at that, the 78-year-old is startlingly happy to appear bare-faced, hair puffing wildly off her head like “the endless work of dreaming”, as Marilynne Robinson once memorably wrote of a character.“No makeup, yeah,” says Close with a sly grin.Is that low-key political, the decision to appear unmadeup?“I don’t think of it as political. I’m lazy. And I don’t think makeup necessarily makes you look better. It’s all about lighting. It really is. So I put a ton of light on my face and can look … OK. But, you know, I don’t want to spend that much time on my face if I don’t have to.” For The Hunger Games, she’ll be in makeup for two and a half hours a day. “So when you’re home you don’t want to have to do anything. I’d much rather be myself.” From an engagement point of view, it seems to be working – Close punches the air – “I got up to 1 million [followers]. I don’t know who they are, but thank you.”If Close enjoys a tightly controlled version of letting go, it adds to her reputation as someone who, despite her status, enjoys sitting outside the entertainment bubble.I can’t imagine the crowd at the women’s group in Bozeman, for example, is particularly wowed by the actor’s Hollywood status. “No,” she says. “But then I don’t live a life that is saying, ‘Look at who I am, I’m a big famous actress.’ I never have. I have a little house in town and I sit on the front porch and say hi to people as they go by.”The ability to derive happiness from small things is often most acute among those who were raised to take nothing for granted. For the first time in decades, Close is living near to her siblings, and one result of this arrangement is that they are able to pick over the carcass of their childhood endlessly. In fact, they talk about it “too much”, she says. Specifically: the abrupt change in circumstance that came about with their surgeon father’s decision, when Close was seven, to join Moral Re-Armament, a rightwing religious cult founded in 1938 by an American minister called Frank Buchman, and move the family from Connecticut to Switzerland.Close won’t talk publicly about the details of the cult. She will only say that she still has triggers from the experience, which she has described as “a kind of psychological abuse couched in underlying misogyny”. Buchman’s movement posited what he called a “God‑controlled Fascist dictatorship” as a countermeasure to communism, and before burning out in the late 1960s it was weirdly popular – particularly in Britain, where its most famous adherent was Daphne du Maurier. When Close talks about her background, she focuses on the foundational years until she turned seven, which she characterises as happy and free, a case of she and her siblings running unsupervised around rural Connecticut. “What has sustained me is the landscape of my childhood, which becomes your DNA. One of my earliest memories is being on my grandfather’s farm in back country Greenwich, which was very pastoral then. And I just was a little feral child. My insides need nature.”The regional stereotype of people from New England is similar to that of England proper: buttoned up, unshowy. “You don’t display yourself,” says Close, with a smile. “My mother – we all just adored my mother, and she was the most unmaterialistic woman ever. I never went shopping for entertainment and, now that I look back, I think it’s one of the ways that a girl could possibly start defining herself, if you go and shop. But I hate shopping.” If Close’s mother was repressed, it was in part because, like a lot of women of her generation, she had neither the life nor the opportunities that, looking back, her daughter would have wanted for her. “Oh, I think she could’ve been an artist. She was really good at sculpturing. She could probably have been a writer.”It’s insane that what happens at a certain time in your childhood is, she taps her chest, right hereWhat did she do with that energy? She sighs, then bursts into rueful laughter. “Sublimated it to my father.” Close hoots. “Cooked! Cooked him meals that he would then eat in three minutes.”Did her mother put some of that energy into shaping her?“Oh, I was completely undefined for a very long time. I still am undefined.”Maybe that’s better – to be undefined rather than rigidly holding to someone else’s mould. “Yeah, I guess so! You pull yourself together. You take all these bits and pieces and there’s … Martha.” Or Cruella, or Joan Castleman. “I’d like to think of it as confidence. I haven’t always felt that way.” It’s the process of piecing together the minutiae of a character that Close loves most about acting. “For example, the character I play in The Hunger Games, I started thinking about these little, tiny details that set off my imagination, and that’s where I like to live. This thing I’m going to do here [Maud, the Channel 4 drama]: same thing; I don’t have her yet. I do love that.” It’s the singularity of the chase that Close enjoys, but “it’s also collaborative. I have a wonderful wig guy, and [finding the character] will be a combination of hair, makeup, clothes. If someone can’t collaborate, they shouldn’t be in this profession. You can’t do it yourself.”View image in fullscreen‘My daughter is all earth and I’m all air and water. I’m not into all that but it’s interesting’In her early 20s, Close got away from her parents and the cult to study drama and anthropology at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. She was married by then, to Cabot Wade, a man she had met in a music and performance group affiliated with the cult and from whom she would separate within two years. She has said that acting saved her, although the impression one gets is that talent of equivalent size in any direction would have been enough to yank her out of that world. Life moved on, she became Glenn Close, but the memories and their impact remain. “It never leaves you,” she says. “It’s insane that what happens at a certain time in your childhood is,” she taps her chest, “right here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When Close talks about nature, or the soothing effect of returning in her mind to the happy first seven years of her life, it is with an unusual intensity. This is what I mean by her grandness; not in the sense of airs and graces or the affectation that runs rife in her industry, but a kind of operatic quality I suspect comes from the habit of having to get up the juice to overcome difficult experiences.After college, Close moved to New York to try to make it as an actor. “I have a beautiful wooden troika,” she says, “which is [a toy] made of Russian smooth painted wood: three horses, a sledge and a man and a woman in the back under a rug you could take off and on. My grandfather got it from my uncle, who was killed in world war two, and it came to me and was my treasure. I used to play with it in the snow. When I first moved to New York and had my apartment, I’d gotten this cheap shelf and I put my troika on it and it collapsed. And the troika fell on the floor and all the horses’ legs were broken. And I remember I sank down to the floor and sobbed.” She pauses. “All the rejection I’d had, everything.”She stayed weeping on the floor until something occurred to her. “It was the image of the stone walls. And I remember thinking: you get up. YOU GET UP.” She hisses it. “Get. Up.” Jesus. A real red-earth-of-Tara moment. Close got up and carried on.The funny thing is, she says, in spite of this image of trauma surmounted, “I’m not as fierce as I seem.” She has said that Annie, her daughter, is fiercer. After her first marriage, Close married twice more, to James Marlas, a businessman, and most recently to David Shaw, also a businessman, from whom she divorced in 2015. In between, she had a relationship with John Starke, the film producer and Annie’s father. How is Annie fiercer, I wonder? “Oh, Annie would say [when Close was dating], ‘Mom, he’s an asshole.’ And I’d say, ‘Yeah, but he wasn’t always an asshole. I mean, why is he an asshole? What was in his childhood?’ She’d say, ‘Mom! He’s an asshole.’”That feels like a very generational shift, from apology to no tolerance when it comes to bad behaviour. “Well, my daughter is all earth and I’m all air and water.” She smiles. “I’m not into all that but it’s interesting.”Close is at her most formidable perhaps when she is pursuing a role. Several times in her career she has lobbied hard for ones she knew she wasn’t in the running for. When she auditioned for Fatal Attraction, she went into the audition knowing she was nobody’s favourite, and her soul “shrank to the size of a walnut”. To secure her role as Mamaw, JD Vance’s grandmother in Hillbilly Elegy, the 2020 adaptation of Vance’s memoir, she wrote the director Ron Howard a letter campaigning for the part. And in one of her earliest stage roles, the 1976 Broadway musical Rex, about Henry VIII, she messed up the audition. “SoI wrote a letter and said I’d like to audition again, and I ended up getting cast as Mary Tudor.”View image in fullscreenAs Mamaw in Hillbilly Elegy (2020).Photograph: Lacey Terrell/NetflixView image in fullscreenAs the titular character in Albert Nobbs (2011).Photograph: Roadside Attractions/Sportsphoto/ AllstarIf one didn’t know better, one might suspect that this ability of Close’s to appeal to directors and casting agents to give her another chance is a highly effective audition shtick. “WhenI auditioned for a play called Albert Nobbs, which I ended up doing the movie of years later, I started auditioning and I just sucked. And I stopped the audition and said, ‘I’m boring myself to tears, so I must be boring you, and I think I’m going to go home.’ And at the end of that day, they called my agent and said, ‘That’s the most interesting thing that happened to us all day.’” She was, she says, “terrible at auditioning” and after that particular flameout hired an acting coach recommended by Kevin Kline. “And said to him I really want this part; and I worked with him, went back and got the part.”On the subject of Hillbilly Elegy, the film and the book are now thoroughly tarnished by association with President Trump’s vice-president. Doesn’t the fact the film animates the origin story of JD Vance besmirch her memory of making it? “No. Not at all. Because I spent time meeting [Mamaw’s] daughter, or a niece, and looked at how she sat, talked, laughed, held her cigarette. What was in her house. I got very specific ideas. I don’t regret that at all. I think a lot of times a woman like that would be looked down on. And I also think I did her justice and I loved her.”Given the amount of time Close spent researching Vance’s extended family in Appalachia, does she have any insight into why that part of the world pivoted so decisively to Trump? “I love reading history, and the great leaders through history were very eloquent people. We have not had … I think Obama was eloquent, but I was less and less aware of a kind of eloquence that you need to bring a people together. And I think you need to be sensitive to what people are dealing with. But you also have to be able to communicate with them. And I think people started to think that nobody cares.”It isn’t the characters of Mamaw or Albert Nobbs, for that matter, that Close is most commonly identified with. Her most enduring role is almost certainly Alex Forrest, the book editor turned stalker who lit up the nightmares of every cheating man in the late 1980s and beyond. At almost 40 years distance, many of us who saw it as teenagers still remember vividly the most gruesome jump scares. And, says Close, “It really holds up. Kids are still watching it. I did some masterclasses in the theatre department of Indiana University, which is a wonderful campus, and before I did it I wanted the kids to see Fatal Attraction. They came in afterwards with their mouths open.”Is the Forrest character, on whom the film heaped scorn in a way that today seems starkly misogynistic, still relevant? “I think it will always be relevant,” she says. “To me she’s a tragic figure.”View image in fullscreenClose with, from left, Sarah Paulson, Teyana Taylor and Kim Kardashian at the world premiere All’s Fair last month.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesWhich brings us, in a roundabout way, to Kim Kardashian. All’s Fair, the new Ryan Murphy drama for Disney+, features a roster of impressive women, including Naomi Watts and Sarah Paulson, and one slightly boggles at the idea of them acting alongside Kim Kardashian in her first major role. I would infer that the quality of the writing may not have been the main incentive for saying yes to this particular job – but it does sound as if it might have been fun. So … how’s Kardashian to work with?“She’s lovely! And very smart. Very, very conscientious with her kids. When we were filming she was going through working towards her law degree, and near the end she would have flashcards. She now has her law degree, and I asked her: are you going to practise?And she said: no, I just want it in my back pocket.”But I mean … she’s not got any acting background at all. “No. But she surrounded herself with really good people.” Close indicates herself and bursts out laughing. If that sounds arrogant, she says, “I swear to God, I’ve seen all nine episodes and it’s pretty fucking good. It is what it is: it’s juicy and outrageous at times and touching.”What is so striking about Close’s current slate of performances is the amazing expanse of energy she is able to summon. I tell her I’m 49 and exhausted most of the time.“Shame on you!!” she hollers. Well, yes. I don’t have your wall system, I say.“You have walls all through your country!” I know, but Hadrian’s Wall doesn’t work as a metaphor for me. Anyway, the question is: how does she do it? “I’m energised when I have to be. I’m very good when I’m working, when I have a schedule imposed upon me. I’m not necessarily that good when I’m at home trying to figure out what to do for the next hour, because I always just want to read a book, and I know I can’t do that.”Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery review – whodunnit threequel is murderously good funRead moreIt seems to me that Close has spent her life pushing through a determination to be happy. But I wonder if she thinks that ability is innate, or a function of sheer force of will? “Good question. I think when I’m with my family I’m very happy. I’ve been unlucky in love, which is sad. It’s not something that I’ve spent a hell of a lot of time thinking about, but I’m happy that my daughter has a mate for life. In fact, none of my generation in my family have been successful [in their relationships], except my brother. We’ve all had multiple marriages. But I think the next generation are much more…I think they’ve found life mates, and that’s fantastic.” She laughs. “But I … don’t mope around.”“GET UP!!” I exclaim, startling us both.“Get up,” hisses Close.Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is in cinemas from 28 November and on Netflix from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsGlenn CloseKnives OutinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I’d always wanted to work with animals, and I had just landed a job as a vet nurse in Melbourne. I was still learning the ropes, but I imagined I would stay there for years, building a life around the work. Then, five months in, the vet called me into his office and told me it wasn’t working out. “It’s not you,” he said, “I just really hate training people.” His previous nurse had been with him for decades; she knew his every move. I didn’t. And just like that, I was out of a job.I drove home crying, feeling utterly adrift. I wasn’t sure whether to try again at another vet clinic or rip up the plan entirely and do something else. After spending a few days floating around aimlessly, trying to recalibrate my life, I turned on the TV, needing something to take my mind off things. And there he was:Billy Connolly, striding across a windswept Scottish landscape in his World Tour of Scotland documentary.I had always liked Billy: I’d watched plenty of his standup shows on TV, laughing at his stories about growing up in Glasgow. But this was different. The programme, which had come out a few years previously, in 1994, was a love letter toScotland, full of history, humour and stunning scenery. I had never studied British or Irish history at school, so everything he was talking about – the castles, the battles, the wild coastlines – was brand new to me. I found myself completely transfixed.It wasn’t one joke or moment that got me, it was the combination of it all: his warmth, his irreverent humour and the rugged beauty of the country. I thought: I have to go there.Six months later I had saved enough money to book a trip. I flew into Edinburgh, and as soon as I stepped outside the airport I felt a jolt of recognition, as though something had clicked into place. It was like I had grown up in the wrong country. I spent the first week on a coach tour of the Highlands, then hired a car and drove around the south. I got hopelessly lost more than once – this was pre-GPS – but I loved every moment.When I returned to Melbourne, I knew I hadn’t had my fill. Two years later I applied for a UK work visa, signed up for a live-in pub job in London, and flew back across the world. The plan was to stay in London for a few months, then head up to Scotland to work and explore. Things didn’t go exactly to plan. A bar job in Scotland fell through, and I ended up following a friend to Belfast on a whim. I thought I’d stay a couple of months. I’ve now been here for 26 years.There was something about Belfast that drew me in. It was a smaller, more approachable place to build a life, and I felt people were willing to give me a chance in a way I hadn’t experienced before. I worked in a bar, and it was there that I met my future husband, who was also working there at the time. We got engaged a year later, and eventually fought a long, hard battle with the Home Office to get permanent residency, which I finally received in 2018.My parents were supportive of my decision to come here, although I think they assumed I’d be back after two years. I sometimes wonder how different my life would be if I hadn’t turned on the TV that day; if I’d just stayed home feeling sorry for myself instead of being inspired by a mouthy Glaswegian wandering around Scotland.Thanks to that chance moment 28 years ago, I have a life I love: a home, cat, a husband, and a deep connection to the UK. Without meaning to be, it was a real sliding doors moment, and a fork in the road. And I’m so glad I chose this path.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

As she does so, she’ll join us to answer your questions.Peaches, AKA Merrill Nisker, emerged from Toronto’s underground scene in the late 1990s – her peers included Feist, her flatmate above a sex shop – but really came to fame in the early 00s after she moved to Berlin. Her debut EP, Lovertits, was a cherished item on the era’s electroclash scene but it was the a joyous, profane dance-punk track Fuck the Pain Away, from her debut album The Teaches of Peaches, that really took her into the mainstream.It began a run of brilliantly named albums – Fatherfucker, Impeach My Bush, I Feel Cream and Rub – graced by the likes of Iggy Pop, Soulwax and Kim Gordon, but there’s been a long gap since the last of those in 2015. Thankfully, the follow-up No Lube So Rude is set for release in 2026, and the first single Not In Your Mouth None of Your Business is a complete triumph: a pounding manifesto for liberation and resistance aimed at anyone trying to strip away queer rights. Peaches is also going on a 27-date North American tour from February, donating a dollar from every ticket to organisations upholding trans rights.She has enough amazing music and globetrotting experiences to fill multiple lifetimes, so please post your questions on it all in the comments below before 1pm GMT on Tuesday 18 November. We’ll publish her answers in the 21 November edition of the Film & Music section, as well as online.Explore more on these topicsPeachesFilm & Music reader interviewElectronic musicPop and rockDance musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why has Swift, who once wanted ‘to be on the right side of history’, said nothing?Sat 15 Nov 2025 06.41 ESTLast modified on Sat 15 Nov 2025 07.33 ESTShareIn the last two weeks, the Trump administration has used music from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in three posts on social media. Thefirst, shared by the official White House account on TikTok, was a patriotic slide show of images set to lead single The Fate of Ophelia. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, the video cuts to pictures of the US flag, President Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and the first and second ladies. The second and third were posted by Team Trump, the official account for the Trump Campaign.One, set to Father Figure, riffs on the lyric “this empire belongs to me” with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”, while theother, celebrating Melania Trump winning something called the Patriot of the year award, is soundtracked by Opalite.The Trump administration has found itself in dicey waters for using popular music in the past.The White Stripesand the estate ofIsaac Hayeshave both attempted to sue the administration for using their music without permission, while artists including Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have released statements demanding Trump stop using their songs at campaign rallies and public appearances. Most recently,Olivia Rodrigo condemnedthe administration after the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram account used her song All-American Bitch on a video promoting its controversial deportation efforts (the song was later removed by Instagram).Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueSwift, however, has said nothing in public. The silence is surprising from an artist known to be litigious over unsanctioned use of her music or likeness: she has previouslysued a theme parkfor playing her music without a licence,come for Etsy sellersfor using lyrics from her songs in unofficial merch,taken on YouTubecreators over copyright infringement anddemanded retroactive songwriting creditsfrom newer artists (including Rodrigo). (Her representatives did not respond to a request for comment.)That Swift and her team haven’t issued a statement distancing her from a president mired in scandal and an administration criticised for censorship, violent immigration raids and far-right policies, is curious. Once politically shy, she appeared to fullyembrace and advocate for progressive values in 2018, so much so that her decision to speak out about politics became the narrative tent pole of her documentary Miss Americana. She has subsequently endorsed Democratic political candidates, supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 American presidential election, and criticised the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade. “I need to be on the right side of history,” she said in Miss Americana, apparently defying the advice of team members including her own father.It is now unclear whether that statement still stands. If it does, Swift seems less interested in telling us so: she hasn’t denounced ICE raids or commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict.It’s a non-position that chimes with those of other once vocally liberal celebrities who have now clammed up about politics. Jennifer Lawrencerecently saidshe would no longer publicly discuss the president as it would just “add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart”. Instead, “a lot of the movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape”, she said, “and that’s how I feel like I can be helpful”. Other stars who endorsed Harris alongside Swift in 2024, including Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry, have similarly remained schtum. Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney has refused to engage with the fraught political discourse,even after being revealed as a registered Republican.Like Lawrence, Swift may believe that publicly opposing the Trump administration would further fracture an already crumbling nation. She may be quietly supporting those whose lives have been affected by the government’s attacks on immigrants and minorities. And there is risk in speaking out: after Swift endorsed Harris, Trump said he “hates” Swift, and asthe Jimmy Kimmel fracasdemonstrated, the government isn’t afraid to use its heft to silence critics.Fear of retribution hasn’t muffled other stars, though: both Rodrigo and Billie Eilish have made their feelings about the Trump administration clear, as have artists including Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Madonna and Bruce Springsteen.Of course, Swift has more to lose than most. Despite critical brickbats for The Life of a Showgirl, she has never been more popular, at least commercially. Aforthcoming Disney-produced docuseriesgoing behind the scenes of the Eras tour is hotly anticipated. And there are her upcoming nuptials to Travis Kelce. Their relationship has turned them into jingoistic emblems for red-blooded (and red-hatted) Americans: the late conservator commentator Charlie Kirkvociferously approved, while other Maga voices suggested their union would encourage Americans to procreate. It has helped reshape Swift’s image so much that even Trump softened on her: “I think that she’s a terrific person,” he said while congratulating the couple on their engagement.View image in fullscreenRed-blooded Americans … Swift with her fiance, Travis Kelce, of the Kansas City Chiefs.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesThe president may also see some of himself in Swift, a staunch businesswoman who releases multiple editions of her albums to generate extra revenue and secure high chart positions – seemingly timed to prevent other artists from reaching No 1. It’s telling that Swift’s attention right now appears to be on blocking Spanish star Rosalía from scoring a No 1 album withLux, by releasing a new streaming-exclusive variant of The Life of a Showgirl. If that is the case, this money-grubbing, competition-destroying approach to pop stardom is paralleled in Trump’s profit-driven mindset, and her self-interest even perhaps has a parallel with his protectionist economic policy.Jennifer Lawrence says speaking about Trump would ‘add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart’Read moreSwift, as with corporations such as Disney, Meta, Paramount and Walmart, might see kissing the ring as economically advantageous. There is even a whiff of conservatism to the material on Showgirl that feels in step with Trump 2.0: Cancelled! defends those who have faced public backlash, while on Wi$h Li$t she fantasises about a white picket fence lifestyle, a basketball hoop and to “have a couple kids / Got the whole block looking like you.”It is difficult to forget the young woman of Miss Americana who so passionately rejected the advice of those around her in order to speak up for what she believed was right. Whatever you think about celebrities’ impact on politics, Swift’s platform is so monumental that any public opposition to the Trump administration would be valuable, be it through her art or her actions. It may further fuel what is already a fiery and divisive political climate, but her influence gives her the potential to galvanise thousands in rejecting increasingly regressive and terrifying social and political norms.But if Showgirl is indicative of Swift’s current preoccupations, she has never been more insular. Vengeful, self-absorbed and lacking imagination, it is the product of an artist who seems disconnected from the anxious state of the world. “I protect the family,” she sings on Father Figure. Once, you knew exactly what that meant. Now, it’s not so clear.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But could he have been Hannibal Lecter to Jodie Foster’s Clarice Starling?The intriguing prospect is raised by an unlikely 33-page draft script for The Silence of the Lambs lurking in a collection of the late actor Gene Hackman’s possessions thatgoes up for auctionlater this month.From Unforgiven to The Firm: Guardian writers pick their favourite Gene Hackman moviesRead moreThesale of more than 400 itemsfrom the estate of Hackman – who won Oscars for his roles in The French Connection and Unforgiven – follows his death earlier this year at the age of 95 and contains more than one surprise.The story of the partial script dates back toHackman callingThomas Harris’s The Silence of the Lambs “one of the most cinematic books I’ve ever read” and buying a share of the film rights. “Gene wanted to direct, and play Hannibal Lecter,” Harris’s agent, Robert Bookman,told Deadline in 2017.Work on a screenplay was under way when Hackman suddenly got cold feet and abandoned the project, apparently because it was too dark. Bookman recalled: “Gene Hackman’s daughter read the book. And she called her father and said, ‘Daddy, you’re not making this movie.’”The Silence of the Lambswas released in 1991, directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Anthony Hopkins, and won all five of the top Oscars. Hackman’s first instinct had been on the money.View image in fullscreenHackman pictured in 1996.Photograph: Ron Davis/Getty ImagesAnna Hicks, the head of private and iconic collections at Bonhams, says via Zoom from Los Angeles: “I guess he was the original person to latch on to the rights for that and try and make the movie. Then I found online that, basically, within his own circle people were like, ‘This is too creepy, don’t do it.’ It’s very interesting to see that he started that project but was like, OK, maybe not.”In February, Hackman and his wife,Betsy Arakawa, were found dead inside their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Authorities determined that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer’s diseaseabout a week after Arakawa, 65, died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare disease spread by the droppings of infected rodents.The Gene Hackman Collection: A Life in Artoffers a poignant epilogue with annotated scripts, call sheets, posters and behind-the-scenes photos from films such as Mississippi Burning, Runaway Jury, Hoosiers, Unforgiven and Bonnie and Clyde. There are Golden Globe trophies as well as the Cecil B DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award complete with a handwritten acceptance speech. (The Academy does not allow the resale of Oscars.)But perhaps the great revelation of the auction has nothing to do with the movies. When retired from acting in 2004, he left Hollywood for a somewhat secluded existenceat the end of a cul-de-sac in a gated communityin Santa Fe, exploring a rich and varied hinterland of writing novels, collecting art and painting pictures.More than 70 of Hackman’s works are for sale and on display at Bonhams in Los Angeles. Hicks says: “He was quite a private person and it comes as a surprise to a lot of people. The first thing that everyone says is: This whole wall? He did all of this? When did he have the time?“Within the Santa Fe community we’ve learned there were more people that knew he took art classes from some local artists who are selling some of the journals he had from those classes. Some of his teachers have given us nice quotes about working with him and how dedicated he was to mastering what he was trying to do.”She adds: “To the global audience it’s an outlier. It’s not something anybody knew about him but it’s also cool to see behind the artist’s eyes instead of just in front of the camera.”View image in fullscreenAn image of the Santa Fe studio from the Gene Hackman Collection.Photograph: BonhamsAmong the items being auctioned are Hackman’s seascapes, still lifes and copies he painted of HenriMatisse’s Fruits and Bronze and Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night. He has a particular gift for portraiture, though buyers should not expect to find pictures of his film co-stars: most of the subjects are anonymous, implying his art was cordoned off from the Hollywood persona that defined his public life.Hicks says he clearly studied hard and took his time. “We have books of sketches that show over this time period how he went along and became better and better at it. That’s one of his strongest areas of work. There are a lot of Santa Fe landscapes and still lifes as well but the portraiture is probably my favorite of all the things he did.”Working in an artist’s studio, Hackman made a 14in-tall bronze bust of Arakawa, a classical pianist who was his wife for more than 30 years. The original signed plaster cast is included with the lot. Hicks explains: “We found a book from the studio that he worked in talking about it. He made the mould and somebody else helped him make the bronze. It’s beautiful.”Hicks sees a clear dialogue between the Hackman’s art and the works he collected, particularly in the study of the human form and the use of colour. His taste spanned categories of postwar and contemporary art, western and Native American art, photography and prints.In 1997 Hackman boughtFigure on the Jettyby the American modernist Milton Avery. Depicting a lone figure on a jetty gazing out to sea, the painting is thought to be inspired by Avery’s summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in the late 1950s. It hung in Hackman’s personal library and is expected to fetch between $500,000 and $700,000.View image in fullscreenMilton Avery – Figure on the Jetty.Photograph: BonhamsAndrew Huber, Bonhams head of 20th and 21st century art, weighs in via Zoom from New York: “It’s exactly what you want from a Milton Avery. A good variance in the colour palette. It’s just before he had a medical issue that diminished him towards the end of his career. Great at-the-beach scenes of this scale and oil on canvas is something the market’s looking at, not just the American market but also internationally.”Other notable works includeGreen, 1986by Richard Diebenkorn, estimated at $300,000 to $500,000, a colour etching regarded as Diebenkorn’s most important print of his prominent Ocean Park series. There is a monumental bronze by Auguste Rodin, estimated at $200,000 to $300,000. The catalogue also includes a likeness of Hackman from portrait artist Everett Raymond Kinstler, who painted US presidents and drew for comic books.Founded in 1793, Bonhams has previously handled the estates of celebrities including Lauren Bacall,Diahann Carroll, Siegfried and Roy and Roger Moore. The Hackman sales are structured into a live auction of 13 premier fine art pieces in New York on 19 November and two subsequent online sales. Listings start as low as $100 for Hackman’s everyman Winmau dart board or $600 for a shot at his Seiko diver’s wristwatch.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s actually a term for it –limerence– and this is the unsettling undercurrent of Tanya-Loretta Dee’s promising debut monologue, in which she also stars. There are very interesting ideas at play here, particularly to do with the fine line between sexual desire and something much wilder, more animalistic and untameable. But the production needs more fire and intensity. It unfolds at a slight distance and never quite pulls us deep inside this young woman’s fevered breakdown.The story revolves around Bex, who works in a Peckham party shop by day and has an awful lot of sexual fantasies by night. Into Bex’s life walks James. With his middle-class wardrobe and middle-of-the-road job, James is from a different world. At first, he is Bex’s fantasy prince. But as their relationship fractures and warps, Bex’s fantasies turn in on her, separating her from real life and the people who care about her.View image in fullscreenAbstract wasteland … Mydd Pharo’s set creates an eerie mood.Photograph: Zoe Birkbeck PhotographyDee develops an intimate rapport with the audience, helped by a flurry of witty asides. She has a good stab at bringing the other characters in Bex’s world to life, including her harassed best friend Greta, and her distant and disturbed mother (easily the most interesting character). But James is never anything more than a caricature: a bit of a brute who is easy to loathe and hard to like. That takes a lot of heat out of the production and makes Bex’s suffocating infatuation very tricky to buy into.There is also something just a little too controlled about Dee’s performance. She never lets herself off the leash. Instead, it feels as though Cheng Keng’s restless lighting design and Mydd Pharo’s abstract and moody set – a barren wasteland filled with long grass and grotty mattresses – are left to create an eerie mood never quite matched by the script or performance. Director Sophie Ellerby could have pushed things much further, surrendering to the darkness and chaos that glimmer beneath this script but are never given full expression.AtTheatre503, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSexreviewsShareReuse this content"

But he is also a product that has to be created.”The Vatican got to work on Leo’s image immediately after his election in May. Within days, Leo, a passionate tennis player,welcomed the Italian world No 1, Jannik Sinner, to the Vatican. In a video of the meeting, Sinner, 24, gave the pope a tennis racket before handing him a ball and asking him to play. Looking around the room, Leo joked: “Here we’ll break something. Best not to!”View image in fullscreenPope Leo meeting Jannik Sinner in the Vatican.Photograph: Vatican Media/EPAIn June, Leo hosted Al Pacino in a private audience and this week met the Italian singer Laura Pausini.Munsterman said: “They began with sport and now it’s culture, especially as we are in a very visible culture of Netflix and films, etc. It is a way of getting this pope into contact with popular culture, and I think it’s smart.”Severina Bartonitschek, the Vatican correspondent for KNA, a Catholic news agency in Germany, said such audiences were “not for fun” or “because the pope wants to meet some VIPs”.“We’re talking about positive PR for both sides because also the actors need some attention from the media to get their next job,” she said, adding that if the pope wanted to “he could also establish a topic in his speech because it will get attention”.Bartonitschek described the papal audience as the perfect opportunity for “great photos and positivity” from the Vatican to hit the world’s press, which beyond the Catholic media tends to focus on church scandals.She added: “No one outside the Catholic bubble talks about the pope normally, and about Leo especially. Francis was easier to handle because he perhaps found it easier to [connect] to the secular world.”But Francis, too, tapped the world of popular culture to spread his messages.In June last year, heheld an audiencewith more than 100 comedians, including Jimmy Fallon, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Stephen Merchant, and urged them to use their powerful gift of humour to spread laughter “in the midst of so much gloomy news” while telling them that laughing at God “is not blasphemy”.Francis also met plenty of Hollywood stars and other celebrities during his 12-year-papacy, including Leonardo DiCaprio, with whom he discussed environmental issues, Angelina Jolie and Bono. The Italian-American director Martin Scorsese also has close ties with the Catholic church and ismaking a film featuringconversations between himself and Francis, including the late pontiff’s final in-depth on-camera interview.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVVaticanThe papacyReligionCate BlanchettChris PineSpike LeenewsShareReuse this content"

The musician, Davide, wears achiton(tunic), as do the guests; the mosaic floor, decorated vases and flicker of flames from the sconces add to the sense that we’ve stepped back in time.This is Moyseion, a one-of-a-kind hotel-museum in the famous troglodyte city of Matera, in Basilicata, known for itssassi– cave dwellings carved into the limestone mountainside. Every detail has been carefully designed to transport visitors to Magna Graecia, as this area of southern Italy was known when it was ruled by the ancient Greeks from the 8th-6th century BC.View image in fullscreenDreamed up by owner Antonio Panetta, an artist and lawyer turned hotelier who grew up nearby, the idea was to create “an immersive experience of history – a living work of art, where archaeology, myth and hospitality combine”. Four years in the making, it opened fully this summer in a series of restoredsassiclose to the city centre.Replicas of museum artefacts are on display, from urns to jewellery, while the handmade furniture copies designs seen on ancient pottery – three-legged tables, wall-mounted torches, vast wooden chests. Eight of the 16 stone dwellings are inspired by ancient Greece – high wooden beds, natural fabrics, cabinets with items depicting daily life of the era. They’re spacious, comfortable and remarkably calming (mod cons such as mirrors and hairdryers are carefully hidden from view). Other rooms reflect pre-Greek periods.View image in fullscreenThe lobby of hotel-museum Moyseion.Photograph: Adriano FedeleIn the basement, the Sanctuary of Waters is a multilevel spa dedicated to the goddess Demeter, evoking sacred sites of a lost world. It’s a moodily lit space with pools, statues of deities and stone basins based on Hellenistic thermal complexes. The floor mosaics are replicas of archaeological finds.But what really makes this place special is the young in-house team of archaeologists, classicists, musicians, performers, costume designers and dancers that bring everything to life with a passion for history that they’re keen to share. Staff have worked with international specialists in everything from ancient music to choreography and cuisine to ensure an authentic experience – it took a year simply to master the circular breathing needed to play theaulos, Davide tells me. Guests become part of the action as they take part in daily rituals and symposiums. I’d worried it would feel like a theme park, but as I wander around in mychiton, a musician playing a specially createdtrigonon(small triangular harp), it somehow feels magical, not gimmicky.Matera is layered with history and its location on the edge of a ravine adds to the dramaMatera itself is layered with history. Believed to be the third oldest city in the world, after Aleppo in Syria and Jericho in Palestine’s West Bank, its location on the edge of a ravine adds to the drama. We arrive at night, a bright moon hanging above the rocky limestone landscape and maze of honey-coloured streets, like a timeless nativity scene. No wonder this place has had a starring role in countless films, from Mel Gibson’s controversial The Passion of the Christ and the 2016 remake of Ben-Hur (both times standing in for Jerusalem), to James Bond’s famous car chase through the old town in No Time to Die.View image in fullscreenDavide, dressed in achiton, plays theaulos, an ancient Greek wind instrument.Photograph: Caroline GavazziWe explore thesassiwith guide Sandra, navigating the winding streets and piazzas, a jigsaw puzzle worthy of an Escher drawing. Divided into two ancient districts, Sasso Caveoso and Sasso Barisano, with the medieval Civita (old town) between, dwellings were both natural and human-made, partly dug into the rock and extended over millennia. Some were homes, some became part of the many monasteries and churches, incorporated into newer buildings that rose above them. Later, grand villas and palaces sprang up, such as Palazzo Viceconte (a Bond location), and Palazzo Malvinni Malvezzi, where Francis Ford Coppola is shooting his new film, Distant Vision, opposite the 13th-century romanesque cathedral.By the 1950s, however, the city had been dubbed the “shame of Italy” due to the poverty and unsanitary living conditions in thesassi. A 1952 law declared them uninhabitable and more than 15,000 people were moved to new, modern quarters on the outskirts of town. The cave dwellings stood empty until the late 1980s, when people slowly started moving back to restore them as hotels and restaurants. Unesco world heritage status came in 1993 and it was a European capital of culture in 2019, putting the city firmly on the tourist map.View image in fullscreenBreakfast at Moyseion.Photograph: Adriano FedeleAt every turn there is something new to gawp at. We visit the preserved cave house in Vico Solitario, which shows how life would have been when it was last inhabited in 1956 – mules and chickens living alongside the family, shelves and niches carved into the walls. We admire frescoes in churches excavated into rock – the Santa Maria de Idris and adjoining San Giovanni in Monterrone on a rocky spur with amazing views are among the most impressive.Even breakfast is an experience, the menu carefully researched and curated by food anthropologists and historiansI loveMusma, a wonderful sprawling gallery space that’s part 16th-century palazzo, part ancient cave complex, dedicated to contemporary art and sculpture. We visit artists keeping traditional crafts alive, too, weaving cloth on looms and carving wooden bread stamps, once used to imprint the owner’s initials on huge durum wheat loaves before they were cooked in the communal ovens.On a dine-with-locals experience we’re welcomed into the home of Marisa and Fernando and feast on endless plates of fried olives, bocconcini and artichoke, homemade pasta andfichi d’india(cactus fruit) as they share stories of Matera past and present. One afternoon we cross the suspension footbridge over the Gravina River to the other side of the gorge and climb to Murgia park, a vast wild rocky plateau pocked with hundreds of rupestrian churches (churches carved into rocks or cave walls). It’s the perfect vantage point to look back and watch the sunset paint the pale limestone town rose gold.View image in fullscreenA musician plays a trigonon in Moyseion’s spa, based on a Hellenistic thermal complex.Photograph: MoyseionBut it’s time spent at Moyseion and the people we meet there that stick in my mind. The ritual held in the water sanctuary each day, where we follow performers playing the lyre and recreating mythical tales of gods and goddesses; the evening symposiums where wine, music, dance and conversation are shared, as they would have been in ancient Greece.Even breakfast –akratisma– is an experience, the menu carefully researched and curated by food anthropologists and historians, and prepared by chef Vita. The table is laden with various breads and cheeses and cakes –melitouttamade with yoghurt, honey and cinnamon,plakousmade of filo pastry with ricotta, figs and walnuts. There’s barley salad with pomegranate, spreads made of wild onion, mushrooms or olives, quails’ eggs and sausage. The hotel has also started hosting courses and residencies in ancient music and dance, the first focusing on the lyre, working with Lotos Lab, a research centre in Cambridge, and world-class scholars.Matera has an important archaeological museum (closed for refurbishment during our visit), but few visitors to the city actually go, Panetta tells me. “People don’t want to just observe history and stare at things in a museum, they want to experience it in a real way,” he says. “When guests come here, they soon realise this is not Disney. The past is still alive in our souls – we want you to feel the past in the present, to make the past live again.”The trip was provided byMoyseion.

That said, even when it’s made on an industrial scale, chutney usually features just fruit, sugar, vinegar and perhaps some pectin.

I like to order it atYau’s in Broughtonnear Scunthorpe orChi’s in Kentonin Devon, where it arrives as a small, fluffy, delicate omelette, barely able to hold itself together for the amount of vegetables woven into it. Over rice, it is a form of heaven on a Saturday night. I haven’t tried to replicate that specific joy here, but this is a homespun version, for those Saturdays when neither Chi’s nor Yau’s are within range.Mushroom egg foo yung over buttered riceYou’ll need a good nonstick pan, and make sure to cook the vegetables until there is no water left in the pan, or the omelette will become very delicate.Prep10 minCook45 minServes4350g jasmine rice80g unsalted butter4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced300g shiitake mushrooms, halved and thinly sliced4 tsp mirin2 tbsp light soy sauce, plus extra for serving8 medium eggs¼ tsp fine sea salt20g chives, finely chopped4 tbsp neutral cooking oil– I use rapeseedFor the sauce2 tbsp crispy chilli in oil2 tbsp light soy sauce2 tbsp rice vinegarFirst, cook the rice. Put it in a sieve and rinse under the cold tap until the water runs clear. Tip the rice into a pan for which you have a tight-fitting lid, add 600ml just-boiled water and bring to a boil. Cover, turn down the heat to a whisper and leave to cook for 15 minutes. Take off the heat, remove the lid, put 30g of the butter in the centre of the rice and cover again.Make the serving sauce by mixing the chilli oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar in a small bowl.Melt the remaining 50g butter in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat and, when it foams, add the garlic and mushrooms, and fry, stirring – the mushrooms will release water, so make sure to cook them until it’s all evaporated. Add the mirin and soy sauce, cook for a further minute, until the sauce evaporates, then take off the heat and leave to cool.In a bowl, whisk the eggs with the salt and two-thirds of the chives (save the rest for decoration).Once the mushrooms have cooled a little, add them to the egg bowl and mix well. Put a tablespoon of oil in the empty frying pan on a medium heat – to test it’s hot enough, put the tip of a wooden spoon in the centre of the pan: if bubbles form around it, the oil is ready.Ladle a quarter of the omelette mix into the hot oil, then move in the sides to make a roughly 15cm-diameter circle, spreading out the mushrooms evenly as you do so. Cook for about 90 seconds, or until golden brown underneath, then flip (I do this using one spatula under the omelette and another one on top) and cook for another 30 seconds. Slide out on to a plate, cover with tin foil to keep warm and repeat with the remaining oil and omelette mix.Spoon a quarter of the rice on to each of four plates, top each one with an omelette and a sprinkling of the reserved chopped chives, and serve with the chilli vinegar sauce alongside.Join Meera Sodha at a specialeventcelebrating the best of Guardian culture on Wednesday 26 November, hosted byNish Kumarand alongside writersStuart HeritageandTim Dowling, withGeorgina LawtonhostingYou be the judgelive.
