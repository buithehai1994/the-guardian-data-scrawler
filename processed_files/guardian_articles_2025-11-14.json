But the Maga faithful might not let his links to the disgraced financier goFri 14 Nov 2025 12.12 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 13.59 ESTShareTo confrontDonald Trumpis to engage in asymmetric warfare. It is to enter a battlefield that is not level, where he enjoys an immediate and in-built advantage over those who would oppose him or merely hold him to account. That fact has cost Democrats dearly over the past decade – exacting a toll again this very week – but it has now upended an institution central to Britain’s national life: namely, the BBC.The key asymmetry can be spelled out simply. Trump pays little or no regard to the conventional bounds of truth or honesty. His documented tally of false or misleading statements runs into the tens of thousands: the Washington Postregistered 30,573such statements during Trump’s first term in the White House, an average of 21 a day. In a single interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes earlier this month, Trumpspoke falsely 18 times, according to CNN.To hold him to account for this dishonesty is to cast yourself as an arbiter of truth, which creates the instant and obvious expectation that you yourself must be truthful. Here, then, is the asymmetry: he can lie, but his critics cannot.So he can continue to tell the big lie, claiming against all evidence that he won the 2020 election, and myriad smaller lies – he told 60 Minutes that grocery prices “are down” when they are up and that Joe Biden gave Ukraine $350bn in aid when the real figure is well under half that – and, save for a few tireless factcheckers, no one cares. The response is a collective shrug, because it’s Donald Trump. No one expects any better.The opposite is true of his scrutineers. They have to be fastidious, their evidence impeccable. So when the BBC’s Panorama programme examined Trump’s record ahead of the 2024 election, it had to be right on every detail. As we now know, and for whichthe BBC has apologised, it was not: it stitched together two statements, made 54 minutes apart, from Trump’s speech ahead of the Capitol Hill riot of 6 January 2021 to create a single, seamless call for violence.There’s no defence to be made of that. No journalist would argue for the right to be as dishonest as Trump is allowed to be, even thoughmisquotingandmanipulating the wordsof others is a Trump specialism. That path is closed to those who want to criticise Trump for his untruthfulness.Nor will it do to make the move some have attempted in defence of Panorama, arguing that the programme’s broad thrust was right, even if that specific edit was not. It’s quite true that plenty of 6 January rioters testified that they believed they were doing Trump’s bidding. It’s also true that Trump was impeached, even if eventually acquitted, for his role in inciting those events. But those facts cannot justify a deceptive edit. To say otherwise is to engage in what the US comedian Stephen Colbert famously called “truthiness”, substituting what feels to be true, or what we might want to be true, for what is actually true.What’s at stake here is not only intellectual and journalistic integrity. It’s also that any slip is a gift to Trump and a setback to what, portentously, we might call the cause of truth – not in some high-blown, abstract sense, but very practically. Note the White House press secretary’s denunciation of the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”. Mark those words, because they will be used again. Next time the BBC accurately exposes a Trump misdeed, or even asks a tough question, he and his allies will recall the Panorama edit and insist that whatever the BBC says can be safely ignored.It’s for this reason that it is not the BBC’s many enemies, but rather its staunchest friends who should be taking the events of the last week most seriously. (Full disclosure: I have presented BBC Radio 4’s contemporary history seriesThe Long Viewfor many years.) A democratic society cannot function without a broadly accepted body of facts. The US no longer has that: there are red-state facts and blue-state facts; Fox News facts and MSNBC facts. The Watergate scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office would barely make a dent in today’s US: the right would simply deny the evidence, cheered on by its media allies.What stands between Britain and that sorry state, in which knowledge is a matter of tribal affiliation, is the BBC. And yet for it to perform that vital function, the BBC cannot just be good; it has to be bulletproof. Which surely explains why it is that some of those most committed to the BBC and its mission – people who have devoted decades of their working life to it – have sought to wrestle with, rather than dismiss, Michael Prescott’sinternal reportand its more alarming findings of bias on a series of issues beyond the Panorama edit, from gender to Gaza. They understand that, as the distinguished former Newsnight journalistMark Urban puts it, “failing to deal internally with issues like those raised by Prescott is a gift to the destroyers”.None of this is fair. Trump’s lack of shame means he can say what he likes. But those who seek to protect the principles that undergird a liberal democracy – of which a basic, if necessarily imperfect, commitment to truth is among the most fundamental – hold themselves to a higher standard.That habit constantly hands a huge advantage to Trump. A version of it was at work this week, when eight Senate Democrats broke from their party to bring an end to the standoff that had led to a42-day shutdownof the US federal government. Politically, the Democrats were in the stronger position: polls showed voters blamed Trump and the Republicans for the stalemate. But, as one of the eight put it, the “mounting economic pain [and] risks to Americans’ safety” became too much to bear – and so they caved. In their shoes, Trump would have pressed his political advantage, the public’s pain be damned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So often he fights an opponent who is hamstrung by values he freely ignores. There may, in fact, be only one area where he is constrained by the same standards, subject to the same limits, as everyone else. And we got a glimpse of that, too, this week.The area in question isJeffrey Epstein. Democrats this weekreleased new documentsthat suggest Trump may have known more about Epstein’s pattern of abuse than the president has admitted, or at least that Epstein wanted to give that impression. True to form, the president’s allies in Congress and on cable news played down the revelations. That usually works: if the target is the media or the Democrats, the Maga base will reflexively give Trump the benefit of the doubt. But the Epstein scandal is different.Much of the Maga hardcore were first drawn to Trump by their conviction, strengthened by the QAnon conspiracy, that there was a secret, elite cabal of child abusers protected by the deep state – a cabal that Trump would expose and destroy. Any email or scribbled note that confirms he and Epstein were, in fact, chums shakes that confidence. It is the one thing the Trump faithful may never forgive him for. He couldshoot people on Fifth Avenue– but he couldn’t do that.Which is why the White House is currentlystraining every sinewto prevent the House of Representatives voting next week for a full release of the justice department’s Epstein files, a motion likely to be backed by several rebel Republicans who know how much this matters to the base. Trump calls the whole thing a “hoax”, as though all those tens of thousands of pages are forged. If they’d been produced by the BBC, he would get away with that. But Epstein is different. It’s the one battlefield that’s level – and the prospect terrifies him.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency – and to ask if Britain could be set on the same path.Book ticketshereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinBBCcommentShareReuse this content"

Ahead of its last episodes, the show’s creators and cast talk about big 80s hair, recruiting a Terminator killer – and the birds Kate Bush sent themRebecca NicholsonFri 14 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 18.19 ESTShareHow do you finish one of the biggest and most popular TV series of the last decade? Three years after season four came out, the fifth and final season ofStranger Thingsis about to make its way into the world. Millions of viewers are getting ready to find out what happens to the Upside Down and whether the plucky teens of Hawkins, Indiana can fight off Vecna for good, but it is early November 2025, and its creators Matt and Ross Duffer are finding it difficult to talk about. It’s not just because they’re feeling the pressure, or because the risk of spoilers and leaks is so dangerously high. It’s because the identical twin brothers from North Carolina are just not ready. “It makes me sad,” says Ross. “Because it’s easier to not think about the show actually ending.”A decade ago, hardly anyone knew what the Upside Down was. Few had heard of Vecna, Mind Flayers or Demogorgons. In 2015, the brothers – self-professed nerds and movie obsessives – were about to begin shooting their first ever TV series. Stranger Things was to be a supernatural adventure steeped in 80s nostalgia, paying tribute to Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. Part of their pitch to Netflix was that it would be “John Carpenter mashed up with ET”. Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine were in it, so it wasn’t exactly low-key, but it was by no means a dead-cert for success, not least because it was led by a cast of young unknowns. The first season came out in the summer of 2016, smashed Netflix viewing records, and almost immediately established itself as a bona fide TV phenomenon.A “would you rather” question for the brothers, then: would you rather have the demands of launching a brand new sci-fi series that nobody knows anything about, or would you prefer to try to stick the landing of a massive hit beloved by millions of viewers, knowing that every detail, every dollar spent, every character arc, will be scrutinised by an army of superfans?View image in fullscreenFacing up … (from left) Noah Schnapp and Jamie Campbell Bower in season five of Stranger Things.Photograph: Netflix“I would rather have the pressure of trying to stick the landing,” says Matt, after some consideration. In 2015, he and Ross had released their first and, to date only, feature film, a creepy, claustrophobic horror called Hidden. To their disappointment, it went straight to video-on-demand. “You can’t even watch it high definition right now,” says Matt. “So Stranger Things felt like we had been given this second chance, which a lot of people don’t get.” If that second chance hadn’t worked out, that would have been that. Now, he says, they are more secure. “Even if people don’t love the final season, I know that Ross and I will continue to be allowed to make things.”On the other hand, he admits that it was fun to be the underdog. Ross agrees. “When we started, Netflix was an underdog, we were an underdog, and everyone loves a good underdog story,” he adds. “So it is a strange thing, 10 years later, to be the opposite of that. It’s a little surreal.”“We almost prefer to be uncool,” says Matt. “I don’t know how cool we are.” He laughs. “We’re still not cool.”In Stranger Things, being uncool is the whole point. With it, the brothers have taken nerd culture fully into the mainstream. Dungeons & Dragons, which features heavily in the show, has experienced a huge growth in revenue since 2019 and a popularity not seen since its 1980s heyday. “I hope we made some of this nerdy stuff cooler,” says Ross. “You know, the show is ultimately about outsiders. When Matt and I were young, especially in high school, we were just making little movies, and we were in drama club, and we had trouble fitting in. We just felt very separate from everyone else, and it was a very scary time for us. So part of the goal of the show was just to go, no, there are people out there like you, and your differences are what make you cool.” Matt says that one character sums up that ethos in particular: Eddie Munson, season four’s metal-loving leader of the Dungeons & Dragons-playing Hellfire Club. “In many ways, we think of the show itself as Eddie, because Eddie is the person I wish had existed in high school, but did not exist.”Season four, which came out in 2022, had a sizeable impact on pop culture. Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) soundtracks a pivotal scene, when Max (Sadie Sink) finally escapes from the villainous Vecna in the Upside Down by using the song as a kind of anchor. The subsequent exposure gave Kate Bush her first UK No 1 single since 1978. “We had no idea it would go viral in the way that it did. We were surprised, and Kate was surprised, by how much it connected with younger people. Kate thought that was really cool,” says Ross. There is even more Running Up That Hill in season five.View image in fullscreen“She’s kind of scary”… Linda Hamilton as Dr Kay in season five of Stranger Things.Photograph: Netflix“Again, she’s been so great about it,” says Matt. Did she send a cake or flowers, to say thank you? “We did get a gift from Kate Bush, but it was way cooler than flowers,” says Ross. “It was this gilded bird cage with animatronic birds inside it, and you wind it up, and the birds chirp a little song. It’s very cool, very unique and very Kate Bush. Only Kate Bush would give this present.”Having played no small part in celebrating the careers of 80s icons such as Ryder and Modine, the brothers recruited yet another movie legend for the final stretch: Linda Hamilton, AKA The Terminator’s Sarah Connor. Hamilton plays Dr Kay, a steely military scientist in charge of another mysterious laboratory. “We needed to sort our Dr Brenner replacement,” explains Ross (the evil government scientist met his end in the Nevada desert, as season four drew to a close). “And because this was the final season, we wanted someone intimidating, but in a very different way than Modine.” Hamilton is “super-highly intelligent”, so she is believable as the scientist, “but at the same time, Linda can shoot a gun, she can get in a fight, she’s tough, and that toughness was perfect for the final season”.“She’s kind of scary,” agrees Hamilton, calling from her home in New Orleans. Hamilton is famous for the physicality of her roles; as Sarah Connor, she is one of the all-time-greatest action heroines in movie history. Is there more action in Stranger Things? “There are a couple of real fightin’ moments,” she laughs. “I mean, I do walk into every stunt rehearsal and go: ‘I’m 68 years old! When do I get tonothave stunt rehearsal?’” She has a stunt double, who was also her double on the last Terminator film. “But I’m carrying my own there. Doing at least half of it.”When Stranger Things came calling, Hamilton had been talking to her agent about retiring from acting altogether. “I had a hip injury, and I was in pain, and limping, and I couldn’t get an injection until I was getting ready to do a job,” she says. She told him she didn’t think she could do another TV show. “I just got really defeated there for a minute. And then he called me months later and said: ‘Stranger Things just called and asked if you’re free from June to June, and I said yes.’” She laughs. “We know each other so well. I did not hesitate to say, yes, let’s talk.”She already loved Stranger Things, and admits to being a fangirl. Walking on set for the first time was “very overwhelming, quite frankly. I didn’t have a lot of time with the Duffer brothers. Everything is so overly large in that show, and they didn’t coddle. They trusted me to put a character together that was going to come alive on camera, but you don’t know if you’ve done the right thing until you’re halfway through that first day and go, yeah, yeah, yeah, I’m finding it.”View image in fullscreenEmotional rescue … Caleb McLaughlin and Sadie Sink in season five of Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixDuring the bumper-length season four finale, a weakened Vecna managed to open another gate to the Upside Down, collapsing the barriers between the regular world and the shadow dimension and setting the scene for an ultimate showdown between good and evil. Season five sees the residents of Hawkins under military quarantine, jumping forward in time a little to November 1987. The show has always faithfully recreated the 80s, from the cars to the technology, right down to the food packaging. “A time that I’ve lived through!” says Hamilton. “My God, the 80s. My joke has always been that when a young actress comes up to me and says: ‘Knowing everything you know, what’s the most important thing for a young actress?’ I say: ‘Never go on film in the 80s.’” She laughs. “I know that a lot of people are enchanted by the 80s, but the 80s was not, to me, the greatest. So it’s really funny that here I am, at my age, playing someone back then, in that look.” The hairislarge in the show. “The hair isverylarge.”The trouble for Hamilton, now, is that she never watches herself on screen. As a fan, surely she will have to watch the final season to see how it ends? “No, I’m afraid not,” she says, a little sadly. “It’s terrible, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything I’ve done and wished I couldn’t do it again, and do a little bit more.” She refuses to put herself through it. “But I did get to read it, and be in the rooms with the actors during the readings and totally feel it.” She had the live-action experience? “Yes. It was amazing to be in that room for the final two episodes. Just, a blob of crying twentysomethings. It was really, really powerful to be part of that. Just a crying blob of children.”(I ask the Duffers if they feel good about ruining the ending of Hamilton’s favourite show by making it impossible for her to watch. “That’s what she’ssaying,” says Ross. “She’s gonna watch the show! I know other actors who are in the show and watch it, but fast-forward through their scenes. I’ll try to convince her, because she has to watch it.”)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin), Finn Wolfhard (Mike) and Noah Schnapp (Will) are picking at fruit plates, discussing what it feels like to become a Halloween costume. On set, says Schnapp, he would entertain himself by trying to guess which scenes might eventually show up as costumes.“Like when we did the stuff in season four, where we dressed up in the ghillie suits, and I was wearing your bandana,” says Matarazzo, turning to McLaughlin. At the end of season four, the gang wears military gear to battle in the Upside Down. Look closely, and you’ll see Dustin with Lucas’ famous bandana over the top of his hoodie.“You were wearing my bandana?” says McLaughlin, sceptically.“Yeah!”“No you weren’t.”“Yes I was!”They bicker like a family. The boys – though to call them boys is to tie them to the youth of their characters, as in real life they now range from 21 (Schnapp) to 24 (McLaughlin) – share the relatively rare experience of having grown up, on screen, in public, together. They were barely in double digits when they started work on Stranger Things. “When you’re younger, you tend to normalise weird situations around you,” says Matarazzo. “It’s not something you recognise as being peculiar until you’re a little older.” When they weren’t filming, Matarazzo attended a normal school in south Jersey where he grew up, which kept life steady for him. “It made a difference later on, but really, I always felt the most normal when I was with these guys. Even though it is a very weird environment, it was normal to me. It was normal to us. I felt the most comfortable when I was with them.”It must be strange for them that Stranger Things is about to come to a close, having taken up almost half of their lives. “Playing these characters has been amazing, and I think their storylines have come full circle, and it’s time for that to end, right?” says McLaughlin. “But growing up with these guys, and having the family that we’ve built, is something I won’t get again. I’m gonna miss that a lot.”Wolfhard is more introspective. He says they haven’t even seen the second half of season five, which will arrive in two further instalments, on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. Any answers they give to my questions might change when they have. “So it feels weird to come up with surface answers, because the hard part, for me, is that itisa lot to process, and itisreally emotional. There’s a lot of layers to it.”On the last ever day of filming, Wolfhard says, everyone was there. “We can’t officially say what we shot, but yeah, we were all together on the last day.” This is not typical – on most series or films, actors finish their scenes at different times or even different days, and leave gradually. This was not the case on Stranger Things, says Matarazzo. “It was important to all of us that we were there for each other. There were people who had wrapped a few days or maybe even a week prior, who decided to stay and make sure that everybody was there for that last day. That was a very necessary experience. It’s been 10 years.”The Duffer brothers had long known what the final scene of Stranger Things was going to be. When they began to work with writers on season five, they spent weeks and weeks on those last 30 minutes. “That’s where we started, because we knew that if we didn’t get those 30 minutes right, then it didn’t matter how much time and effort and quality was put into what preceded that. It wouldn’t matter,” says Matt. It was the first time they had worked that way, and when they were happy with the ending, they got started on the rest. “We were able to design it so that it would be building towards those last 30 minutes,” he explains.Then, for a split second, he echoes the many millions of fans who are all waiting patiently for its conclusion: “Hopefully, it works.”Stranger Things 5 part one is released at 1am on 27 November, followed by three episodes on Boxing Day and the finale on New Year’s Day.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStranger ThingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you know the answer to this question (see below), you are probably one of hundreds of thousands of Brits who attend a pub quiz every week.As a nation of committed trivia buffs, it was unsurprising that news ofa quizmaster in Manchester outing a team for cheatingwas leapt on. Just where, we asked, is the special place in hell reserved for those quizzers who take a sneaky look at their phones under the table?According to the BBC, a “massive whodunnit” ensued after the landlord at the Barking Dog in Urmston revealed that the cheats were whispering questions into their smartphones, but refused to name and shame them.It is a misdemeanour that is, according to some quizmasters, an increasingly common blight on one of the nation’s favourite pastimes.“I think it’s definitely more prolific now, especially with smartwatches – even if you don’t have a phone in your hand, there’s still a way for you to be able to cheat,” said David Hartley, a quizmaster from Staffordshire.The 33-year-old has hosted quizzes in four venues for nearly a decade and started banning devices about two years ago. “It just takes the mickey out of your quizmaster, if all you’re going to do is sit on your phone,” he said.David Moyce, the landlord and quizmaster at the Alma in Cambridge, said he recently had to ban a group of students who won in suspicious circumstances. He had suspected cheating after the painfully weak team suddenly played their “joker” – which doubles points – before a round in which they got every question right.“There was no proof. But then one of the gentlemen came back, handed over some money and said: ‘Yeah, we did cheat,’” Moyce said. “The guilt must have been so heavy on him that he literally handed his share of the money back. None of the others did though, so maybe he slept better than the other four.”Thursday news quiz: hasty exits, horny bees and naked NordicsRead moreSome pubs have taken hi-tech measures to stop cheats, such as hosting smartphone quizzes where participants have to type in answers on their phones – and lose points if they suspiciously click away from the dedicated quizzing app to use another.The SpeedQuizzing app promises to see off “the cheats and the chancers” by giving users only 10 seconds per question to lock in their answers in an attempt to restore what it calls “a once proud British tradition”.Others take more traditional routes. The Prince of Wales in Highgate, north London, has a fiercely peer-policed quiz, according to Marcus Berkmann, who has competed in it more than 200 times and now regularly writes its questions.“We’re very harsh on anyone who cheats, so no one does it,” said Berkmann, who is the author of A Matter of Facts: The Insider’s Guide to Quizzing. “The regulars would rather boil themselves in oil than cheat.“Occasionally, you read out a warning and say: ‘We’re testing you on what you know, not what you can look up on Google,’ and people generally go along with that.”The precise origins of the pub quiz are shrouded in a pre-smoking-ban haze, but they became popular in the 1970s, boosted by Sharon Burns and Tom Porter, whose company Burns and Porter supplied quizzes as a way for pubs to lure drinkers in on quieter nights.Sports quiz of the week: Ashes, All Blacks and a big payday in tennisRead moreToday, quizzing in the UK remains a serious business, marrying as it does the great British pastimes of drinking and taking pleasure in being right. According toa 2023 survey commissioned by the brewer Greene King, 70% of people regularly take part in a pub quiz and almost one in 10 goes every single week.Quizmasters could be forgiven for wanting to return to the simpler times of Burns and Porter, but can also take some solace in knowing that their predecessors also had to deal with cheats.Gail Taylor, for example, responded toa Guardian calloutthis week to finally come clean about her youthful cheating in Sheffield pubs in the 1980s.According to Taylor, she planted rudimentary bugging devices underneath pub tables to transmit the questions to encyclopedia-armed friends in a van outside.The Guardian could not independently verify her tale, but she insisted it was true. “Something always went wrong,” Taylor said. “If the signal didn’t work, we’d write the questions down, rush out to the van with two pints and a list, then someone else would go out and bring back the answers. Nobody seemed to catch on what we were doing.”Reflecting on the crime more than three decades later, Taylor is entirely without remorse. “We didn’t have Google then, so we never won anything anyway,” she says. “I don’t feel guilty about it at all.

Huge names, undersung stars – and a King Lear played by ‘the woman who changed my life’Fri 14 Nov 2025 09.16 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 11.55 ESTShare‘Holy shit!” This was the instant response of one venerable theatre critic whenPitlochry Festival theatresent round embargoed copies of the plan for Alan Cumming’s inaugural season. The man himself sits back in the cavernous workshop behind the theatre building, dapper in a grey plaid suit. “I loved that,” he says gleefully.When the Hollywood star wasannounced as the new artistic directorof Scotland’s only major rural theatre last September, there was widespread shock – not least that Cumming answered an open recruitment call – followed by feverish speculation over which A-list pals he might charm away from London or New York to perform in Highland Perthshire.I imagine staff thought I’d be like Godzilla – stomping on thingsBut with the public unwrapping of his first season, it is apparent that Cumming has done so much more than call in favours – it’s a programme of imagination and creative rigour, putting big names in unexpected collaborations alongside undersung Scottish talent. “There’s always this binary of bringing in more well-known people – creatives, not just actors – but also to celebrate and nurture our indigenous talents.”He arranges himself, at 60, with a dancer’s poise though his puckish side-eye suggests there’s plenty of mischief still to be made. The season showcases Cumming himself a fair bit, too. He writes, directs or performs in four shows, closing the year as Henry Higgins in a revival of My Fair Lady. The season opens with another musical: the Scottish premiere ofOnce, featuring the original Broadway creative team led by director John Tiffany. Then there is the world premiere of a new work by lauded dramatist Martin Sherman, starring Simon Russell Beale and directed by Cumming. Elsewhere, award-winning Scottish actor Sally Reid pivots to directing, as National Theatre of Scotland stalwarts Adura Onashile and Sandy Grierson star in her staging of another world premiere: Douglas Maxwell’s new comedy Inexperience.View image in fullscreenIs that Armistead Maupin? … Cumming’s appointment sparked speculation over which pals he might lure to the Highlands.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“There’s got to be a reason why,” says Cumming, who has lost none of his precise Scots inflection despite spending many of his recent years in New York, where he lives with his husband, illustrator Grant Shaffer. “I’m not just going to put on nice plays.” In addition: “Every single one of these shows has a personal connection to me.”The north star of Cumming’s creative constellation might well be the actor Maureen Beattie, who visited his Angus primary school when he was eight years old “and changed my life”. Beattie is to play Lear in a bold reinterpretation of Shakespeare’s mad king, directed by Finn den Hertog, lately acclaimed for staging David Ireland’sThe Fifth Step. “We’ve seen Lear so often with boring old men,” says Cumming, “and when I spoke to Maureen, I realised how fascinating and how different it would be as a story about a woman and her daughters.”The season also has star-spangled weekend festivals, the literary Winter Words and Out in the Hills, a celebration of all things LGBTQ+ and bringing together Armistead Maupin, Graham Norton and Evelyn Glennie in January. For Cumming, a committed advocate for LGBTQ+ rights who has followed the “huge backlash” against transgender people in recent years in the US and the UK, the motivation for programming a queer-specific event is simple enough: “I felt like it would be really good for trans and queer people to be mentioned in our news without a negative connotation – and we should celebrate, remind people of what a great contribution LGBTQ+ people have made to our lives.”View image in fullscreenNot another boring old man … Maureen Beattie will play King Lear.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt’s not, of course, unheard of for creatives to travel for work, but he acknowledges that Pitlochry, a thriving tourist destination known as the Gateway to the Highlands, is off the beaten theatrical track: “Big time! It’s a commitment.”The setting itself is breathtaking. Not for nothing is Perthshire nicknamed Big Tree Country. On the day I visit, the gardens set back from the banks of the River Tummel are painted in vivid autumn colours and hazy with mist rolling down from Ben Vrackie, the quartz-spiked mountain that looms to the north. On a direct train line from Glasgow and Edinburgh, it’s a couple of hours’ winding through pine-fringed hills.“You come away from all the normal glare to this beautiful place, with these great facilities and you make work,” says Cumming. “You show it here and then you take it somewhere else – I want the shows to go to other parts of the world after their runs here. People really get that model.”He adds: “People will come for just over two months. You’re able to be more focused here, it’s beautiful and it’s an adventure – like camp.” His eyebrows bounce above thick black spectacle frames.There’s a sense that he relishes having something of an ambassadorial role for the country he says “could be better at self-confidence”. Cumming is a longtime supporter of Scottish independence and played his part in the Yes campaign of 2014. “I do love my country and I really understand the gifts it’s given me. So sometimes I come back and think, ‘Come on, everybody! Things are great here.’”View image in fullscreenBusy … Cumming presents the US version of The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Peacock TVHe is also an advocate of manifestation, using the power of thought to shape reality. He tells a lovely – and entirely true – story about the theatre’s founder, John Stewart, who hid a slip of paper in a wayside post by the river on a wartime visit, pledging: “When peace is declared I shall return to this spot to give thanks to God and to establish my festival.” On VE Day, he recovered his note and the theatre was established 75 years ago this year. “When I started,” says Cumming, “I set out what my aims were, so I feel like that is something I share with him.”Whatever your take on mysticism and prophesy fulfilment, this is an approach that aligns with the surroundings – Highland Perthshire is one of the most arcane parts of Scotland, steeped in folklore and ancient history. On my trip back to Glasgow, I take a detour to the nearbyDunfallandy Stone, a rare Pictish carved stone depicting a human head clasped by a fish-tailed monster.But what’s also supremely evident is Cumming’s clear-eyed and straightforward determination to make this work. His tenure comes at a point of soaring confidence for Scottish theatre, with new leadership at Glasgow’s Tron and Edinburgh’s Lyceum, alongside the much-anticipated refurbishment of theCitizens in Glasgow. Cumming has attended a couple of dinners with other artistic directors, benefiting from the wealth of experience round the table. “I’m totally new to the business and the machinations behind the scenes of running a charity. And I can ask, ‘Is this normal?’”Cumming introduces his first programmed season as artistic directorCynics might question how much a man with a plethora of strings to his bow, who still divides his time between New York and another base near Inverness, can be involved in the daily grind of running an arts venue. “It’s been challenging,” Cumming admits. “I’ve worked mostly remotely this year.” And he praises the team around him: “It’s much more work than I thought it was going to be, in the minutiae and also dealing with so many personalities.”This works in both directions, he suggests. “When I arrived, I didn’t know them, but they thought they knew me. When you’re famous, you’ve got to …” He mimes unpicking something. “I imagine they thought I’d be like Godzilla, going through Pitlochry and stomping on things.”Pitlochry is a space familiar with innovation – previous director Elizabeth Newman built up its artistic credibility with new writing, inventive staging and collaboration with other producing houses. “I’ve been conscious of not being completely jarring and changing everything,” he says, nodding to the strong musical component of his season, “a big part of what people have of late associated with Pitlochry”.‘I absolutely went for it!’ Michael Flatley on sex, swagger, Riverdance – and tapping his feet 35 times a secondRead moreBut the famous repertory system – the only one left inScotland– has gone. “It wasn’t financially viable,” says Cumming, “and a prerequisite of me taking this job was that we had to be able to ask people to come for a shorter time.” Cumming certainly has a close eye on the theatre’s fiscal health, establishing partnerships with nearby hotels and even choosing to forgo his own salary. He can probably afford it. As well as his work as an actor on stage and screen, Cumming presents the US version of The Traitors and owns a bar, Club Cumming, in New York City. He is hoping the cash saved can go towards fixing the amphitheatre’s stage.Since his appointment, Cumming has repeatedly spoken about wanting the theatre building to be a venue for the local community as well as paying audiences. “I want it to become known as this international theatre destination for audiences and for artists, and the community’s got to come along with that because they’re part of it.”Earlier today, he dropped in on the weekly sketching club, which congregates in the theatre’s open-plan cafe area. “I said, ‘Oh, you’ve grown. There’s more of you since I was last here!’ It makes the building feel alive, especially at times when we don’t have shows on. I actually think the experience you have in this building is as important as what we put on our stages.”And earlier this year, at the close of the Winter Words festival, he DJ-ed at a huge party, inviting the whole town to attend. “And they came!” he says delightedly. “It was a magical night.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreAlan CummingPitlochry Festival theatreScotlandMusicalsKing LearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s like The White Lotus meets The Talented Mr RipleyLucy ManganFri 14 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 12.45 ESTShareIcan’t say I had “Jack Whitehall stars with David ‘The X Files/ Californication’ Duchovny in glossy TV thriller” on my 2025 bingo card, but here we are, and a good time with it can be had by all. Alongside, perhaps, a smidge of national pride to see the daft lad from Fresh Meat, Bad Education and Travels With My Father all grown up and holding his own.The glossy thriller in question is Malice, in which Whitehall plays Adam, a tutor promoted to manny (male nanny, for those not au fait with rich people’s terms), who is bent – for reasons as yet unknown – on ruining high-rolling businessman Jamie Tanner (Duchovny). Whether he has it in for the rest of the Tanner family and friends, or they are just doomed to be collateral damage, is not clear, but that doesn’t spoil the machiavellian fun.Adam arrives at the Tanners’ opulent Greek island estate as tutor to the children of Jamie’s guests, Jules (Christine Adams) and Damien (Raza Jaffrey), who are very much the beta setting for the Tanners’ alpha display. Adam quickly makes himself interesting (with his knowledge about the surrounding islands’ mythic heritage, thanks to studying classics at university) and useful (with his knowledge of cocktail and calamari-making and willingness to do domestic chores while still having time to accompany Jamie to local strip clubs).As he goes, he gathers information about his hosts (including the suggestion that they are hiding as much as holidaying, in the hope that “a situation” involving their oldest child will resolve itself); flings Jamie’s passport in the sea; poisons food; flirts with Jamie’s wife, Nat (Carice van Houten); and sets various traps for the unwary family and their employers. Some close quickly. Some take their time.View image in fullscreenPlotting … Jack Whitehall as Adam in Malice.Photograph: Yannis Drakoulidis./PAWhile Adam is grifting and plotting, Jamie and Duchovny are having a great time. Jamie because he is a rich, entitled asshole insulated from the consequences of his actions – at least so far – by his wealth and power; Duchovny because rich, entitled assholes in glossy TV thrillers get all the best lines. The part of Jamie plays to all Duchovny’s strengths as an actor: roving intelligence, dry wit and an unassailable detachment from proceedings. We believe in him as a ruthless multimillionaire and as a man good enough not to deserve whatever is coming at him.By the end of the first two episodes, which were all that were available for review, Adam has his feet firmly under the Tanner table – which has now moved from Greece to their London mansion, and is overseen by a large portrait of the happy family. Malice is very good but it is not subtle. (See also: the snake in the family pool early on; several characters voicing some variant of: “That Adam fellow – I find him disquieting in some indefinable way”; and Adam standing over the drunk, unconscious Jamie and telling him he could kill him right now but won’t because he wants him to suffer as he has.) That is, of course, a large part of the fun.Some ways have been cleared. Some unexpected obstacles – a dogged Greek detective assigned to the mugging of the man with whom Jamie has a longstanding dispute over the land he built on, or a stomach unusually resistant to poisoned avocado – have been overcome. More, doubtless, will arise as the family start to wonder why their perfect lives are falling apart and whether this new guy is as perfect as he appears. Is there something nasty in the gilded woodhouse?It’s The White Lotus meets The Talented Mr Ripley, of course, tapping into viewers’ distaste for, and fascination with, the lives of the fabulously well-off, and eternal attraction to the underdog who seems set to bring the whole shining thing down.It’s a great ride, and Whitehall acquits himself well in his first lead dramatic role, even if he is better at oblique menace than delivering straightforwardly murderous speeches. Duchovny is as skilled, nimble and charismatic as ever, giving us a Hank from Californication if he had gone into real estate rather than writing and made enough money to keep his chaos at bay. Moreish, bingeable stuff to take you happily through to Christmas.All episodes of Malice are on Prime now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid DuchovnyJack WhitehallreviewsShareReuse this content"

But that’s aspirational,” said a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s going to take some time. It’s not going to be easy.”Red and green zones mapThe US military plans raise serious questions about Washington’s commitment to turning the ceasefire announced last month into an enduring political settlement with Palestinian rule across Gaza, which was promised by Donald Trump.Plans for Gaza’s future have been shifting at a dizzying rate, reflecting a chaotic, improvised approach to resolving one of the world’s most complex and intractable conflicts and providing aid including food and shelter to 2 million Palestinians.After weeks in which the US promoted reconstruction in the form of fenced-in camps for small groups of Palestinians, referred to as “alternative safe communities” (ASC), those plans were dropped this week, the US official said.“That’s a snapshot of a concept that was put forth at a certain time,” the US official said. “They’ve already moved on from that.”Humanitarian organisations who have repeatedly raised major concerns about the ASC model said on Friday they had yet to be notified of the change of plans.Without a workable plan for an international peacekeeping force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and large-scale rebuilding, Gaza risks slipping into limbo after two years of devastating war.View image in fullscreenMachinery operates next to a Red Cross vehicle at an area within the ‘yellow line’ to which Israeli troops withdrew under the ceasefire.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersMediatorshave warnedof a situation that is “not war but not peace” in a divided Gaza, with regular Israeli attacks, an entrenched occupation, no Palestinian self-rule and limited reconstruction of Palestinian homes and communities.The creation of an international stabilisation force (ISF) underpins Trump’s 20-point “peace plan”. The US hopes a draft UN security council resolution giving the force a formal mandate will pass early next week and expects firm details of troop commitments to follow.“The first step is we have to get the [resolution],” the US official said. “Countries are not going to make firm commitments until they actually see the language that has been passed.”Trump has ruled out putting any US soldiers on the ground to pave the way for an Israeli withdrawal, or funding reconstruction. “The US has been very clear they want to set the vision and not pay for it,” said one diplomatic source.Location of debrisEarlier this month, the US military regional Centcom command drew up plans to put European forces – including hundreds of British, French and German soldiers – at the core of the ISF, documents seen by the Guardian show.They include up to 1,500 infantry soldiers from the UK, with expertise including bomb disposal and military medics, and up to 1,000 French troops to cover road clearance and security.The US also wanted troops from Germany, the Netherlands and Nordic countries to handle field hospitals, logistics and intelligence.One source described those plans as “delusional”. After long missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, very few European leaders would be willing to risk their soldiers’ lives in Gaza, although they have pledged other support. Only Italy has offered a potential troop contribution.View image in fullscreenPeople working on the ruins of the Pasha Palace museum in Gaza City.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe documents were marked unclassified, suggesting the US did not consider the military plans to be highly sensitive, and they apparently collided with reality in a matter of days.A US official said the figures laid out in the documents contained “many inaccuracies” and Washington did not expect European troops to form the core of the ISF, adding that planning for Gaza was moving fast.“It is very dynamic. It is very fluid,” the US official acknowledged. “There are only a few people who actually understand and have their hand on the wheel of this thing.”Jordan was listed as a possible contributor of hundreds of light infantry troops and up to 3,000 police officers, even though King Abdullah has explicitly ruled out sending troops because his country is “too close politically” to Gaza.View image in fullscreenYvette Cooper (left), the UK foreign secretary, on a tour last week of a World Food Programme warehouse in Amman, Jordan, where 4,000 tonnes of aid was waiting to be delivered to Gaza.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAMore than half of Jordanians are of Palestinian descent, and agreeing to police the territory’s ruins in coordination with Israeli forces would be an explosively unpopular threat to Jordan’s national security.As of Thursday, the US military was expecting core contributions from a generously broad group described as “Nato and partners”, which included countries across Europe, Asia and the Middle East.A US “concept of operation” for the ISF specifies that troops will serve in the “green zone only”. The US envisages the deployment “starting small” in a limited area with a few hundred troops, then expanding slowly to a full strength of 20,000 across the area.It would not operate on the western side of the “yellow line”, where Hamas is reasserting control. “You’re not going to leave [the green zone],” the US official said.Another document lays out plans for foreign soldiers to man crossings along the line of control after “integrating” with Israeli forces stationed along it, a mission likely to alarm potential troop-contributing nations.They are wary of getting caught in crossfire between Hamas and Israeli soldiers, and borders are usually potential flashpoints. They also fear opening the way for accusations that the ISF is propping up an ongoing Israeli occupation of Gaza.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli soldier looks out at destroyed buildings from a station on the yellow line in the eastern part of Gaza City.Photograph: Nir Elias/ReutersThe Israeli military will “consider conditions for withdrawing” at a later stage when international security is in place, the plan states, without setting out any timeline.Reunifying Gaza is part of a process of “moving it toward stabilisation and lasting peace and a transition to civilian governance”, the US official said, but they added it was impossible to put a date on when it might happen.Trump’s20-point plandescribes a new Palestinian police force as “the long-term internal security solution” for Gaza, but US planners have assigned it only a limited role. The outline calls for an initial 200 recruits, growing over a year to a force of 3,000 to 4,000 officers, equivalent to just one in five of the planned security deployment.ReconstructionUS military planners also see reconstruction inside the “green zone” as part of a nebulous path to reuniting Gaza by convincing Palestinian civilians to move across the line of Israeli control.“As things progress and you create conditions for there to be significant progress on reconstruction, you [will] have Gazan civilians moving there beginning to thrive,” the US official said. “People will say ‘hey we want that’, and so it evolves in that direction. No one’s talking about a military operation to force it.”Yet even marking out a “green zone” in Gaza risks drawing comparisons with Iraq and Afghanistan, where the phrase became synonymous with US military failures.In Baghdad and Kabul, the green zones were enclaves ringed by concrete blast barriers where western forces and their local allies retreated to escape the violence their mission had unleashed in the communities around them.View image in fullscreenA teacher giving a lesson during the opening of a makeshift school at the Sayed Hashem mosque in Gaza City.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe plan to use aid to tempt the Gaza population into an area under Israeli control, after two years of a war deemed genocidal by a UN commission, has echoes of other disastrous US policies from those conflicts.Around a decade before the Taliban took Kabul, the US claimed it was bringing “government in a box” to southern Helmand to win over civilians. The province remained an insurgent stronghold.Trump’s 20-point plan commits to the demilitarisation of Palestinian factions in Gaza and an eventual Israeli withdrawal to a “security perimeter” carved out of Palestinian land. It would be facilitated by the ISF and allow rebuilding to begin “for the benefit of [Gaza’s] people”.The need for reconstruction is urgent, with more than 80% of structures in Gaza damaged or destroyed in the war, including almost all schools and hospitals, according to UN data.More than a month into the ceasefire, Israel continues to limit aid shipments into Gaza, including barring basic items, such as tent poles, that it classifies as “dual use” because it says they have the potential to be used for military purposes.Nearly 1.5 million Palestinians are waiting for emergency shelter items and hundreds of thousands more are living in tents without access to basic services such as clean water. Almost all the population – more than 2 million people – are crowded into the red zone, a strip along the coast that covers less than half of Gaza’s surface area.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineUS foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She said in her 2024 budget speech: “Extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people, it would take more money out of their payslips.”Other likely tax rises include a move to end tax breaks for salary sacrifice pension schemes, raising about £2bn, and a new tax on electric vehicles, also estimated to raise £2bn.However, Reeves would need a lot more than these to plug the £20bn fiscal hole and increase headroom to £15bn, with the market reaction suggesting investors are sceptical about the ability of a range of smaller measures to fill the gap.Some of the other possibility floated so far include more tax on higher-value properties, extra taxes on landlords’ income from rental properties, and a gambling tax.Downing Street said on Friday: “The chancellor has been clear on the need to deliver stability in the public finances. As she said last week, one of the objectives of the budget is to build more resilient public finances with the headroom to withstand global turbulence.”The decision not to raise income tax rates was taken after weeks of careful planning for just such a move, including briefing Labour MPs on why difficult decisions would need to be taken to balance the government books.Government insiders said the decision was taken on Wednesday, the same day the prime minister was forced to deny reports that his aides had briefed against Streeting in an attempt to shore up his own position.Streeting welcomed the decision on Friday, having warned earlier in the week that breaking the manifesto pledge risked losing the trust of voters.He told LBC Radio: “I’m not in favour of breaking manifesto pledges. I think that trust in politics and politicians is low and it’s part of our responsibility to not only rebuild our economy and rebuild our public services but to rebuild trust in politics itself.”Other cabinet ministers are also understood to have expressed concerns about the political implications of raising income tax rates. Lucy Powell, the deputy leader, had said she was opposed to the move, while stressing it was a matter for the chancellor.Some MPs argued that the late change gave the impression that the government was not in control. One senior Labour MP said they thought Reeves “will end up having to go after this debacle of a budget” and warned against any further attempt to U-turn on ending the two-child benefit limit, saying that would “lead to a complete revolt”.Another Labour MP said Starmer had been told by many in the parliamentary party this week that he was losing the room but he “refused to listen to criticism”. “They don’t know what they are doing and there is 10 days left of this mess,” they said.That assessment was underlined by a turbulent day in the markets, with UK government bonds on track for their worst day since 2 July, when investors responded to a tearful appearance by Reeves in the Commons. Meanwhile, the pound dropped against the dollar.UK gilt yield chartKathleen Brooks, a research director at the brokerage XTB, said: “Bond market volatility is not what the chancellor wants to see with less than two weeks to go before the budget. Essentially, the bond market is warning the chancellor that she cannot merely tax the ‘rich’ to fund her lavish spending pledges. Either she broadens the tax base or she cuts spending.”Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation and a former Treasury tax and spending official, said it was normal for the OBR’s forecasts to change in the run-up to the budget. However, she said “excessive levels of kite flying” were fuelling market volatility.“It is not normal for so much of that to be laid bare in public,” she said. “The market moves this morning and in recent weeks suggest a serious look should be taken at the approach to market-sensitive forecast information.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingEconomic policyEconomicsBondsnewsShareReuse this content"

But frankly any Labour MP that has seen their majority destroyed by the rise in the Lib Dems and Greens will likely say no,” the MP said. “Weak governments don’t get to push through controversial policy.”Expected changes to the use of the ECHR to be announced by Mahmood would include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they would face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country.Home Office officials described the plans as “the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times”.Border failings in Europe are eroding trust in nation states, warns MahmoodRead moreBefore next week’s announcement, the Home Office announced it had removed or deported 48,560 people from the UK since Labour came to power.The figure, which includes refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and others with no right to be in the UK, is a 23% increase in removals compared with the 16 months before last year’s election.Despite the removals, small boat crossings continue to be a political headache for the government. So far this year, 39,075 people have made the journey, up 19% on the same point in 2024.One government official said MPs should face up to the huge public disquiet about an asylum and immigration system they believed was out of control.“We know levels of migration and asylum are putting huge pressures on communities,” they said. “Our generosity is drawing people in and the system is being gamed.“If we don’t do this, there risks being no asylum system at all, particularly if it means Reform win the election. But there will be progressive elements. Denmark is a fair, tolerant and open country, with a centre-left government that has fought off the hard right through difficult choices.”While this is an argument endorsed by a number of Labour MPs, especially those in seats where Reform UK will be the expected main challenger at the next election, others fear the government is putting off progressive voters and shedding mass support to the left, particularly to Zack Polanski’s Green party.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodLabourHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Investigators “did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties”, the memo said.It comes as Trump has cranked up his intense pressure campaign on congressional Republicans to oppose the full release of the justice department’s files related to Epstein, before a crucial and long-awaited Housevote on the matter next weekthat many Republicans are expected to support.The bombshell release of scores of Epstein’s emails has shone a spotlight on the president’s long history of involvement with the notorious sex trafficker, including revelations that he knew more about Epstein’s conduct than he has previously let on.On Friday morning, Trump declared that he would ask the Department of Justice to investigate Epstein’s ties with Democrats, notRepublicans, singling out Bill Clinton, Larry Summers and Reid Hoffman. Trump also paradoxically referred to the “Epstein hoax” and called it a “scam”.Epstein sought to restore his reputation after guilty plea, documents revealRead moreIt is expected that dozens of Republicans will vote next week for Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna’s discharge petition, which demands the Department of Justice release all of its investigative files on Epstein within 30 days.The legislation had stalled because the House speaker,Mike Johnson, a Republican, hadrefusedfor almost two months during the government shutdown to swear in the new Democratic representative, Adelita Grijalva, who would become the deciding 218th vote. Once Johnson could delay no longer, Grijalva wassworn inon Wednesday. The vote is now likely to happen early next week.Many House Republicans have constituents who say they want greater transparency about the Epstein affair. Representatives Don Bacon of Nebraska, Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania have indicated they would vote to release the files.The Trump administration has put heavy pressure on key Republicans to oppose the legislation. The New York Times reported that top officials summoned Lauren Boebert – one of four Republicans in the House who have signed the petition – to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with Bondi and FBI director Kash Patelto discuss her demand to release the files. Trump had also telephoned her early on Tuesday morning, a day before Grijalva was due to be sworn in and provide the crucial final signature.Trump also contacted Nancy Mace, another member of the Republican caucus in the House who has signed the petition, but the two did not connect. Mace instead reportedly wrote the president a long explanation of her own personal experience as a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, and why it was impossible for her to change her position on the matter. Shewrote on Xthat “the Epstein petition is deeply personal”.Those failed lobbying attempts from the White House came as Democrats on the House oversight committee releasedthree damning new emailsthat suggest Trump knew about Epstein’s conduct, including one in which the convicted paedophile said “of course [Trump] knew about the girls”. Another email described Trump as a “dog that hasn’t barked” and said he had “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.Emails reveal Jeffrey Epstein and associate discussed ‘girls’ and travelRead moreThe president’s team struck back, saying those documents had been cherrypicked, and Republican representatives followed up by releasing a much bigger trove of more than 20,000 files.Among them were documents that revealed that Epstein’s staffkept him apprised of Trump’sair travelas it related to his own transportation – and that the late sex trafficker kept up with news about his former friend years after their relationship soured.Even if the bill passes the House, it still needs to get through the Senate and be signed by Trump. Senate leaders have shown no indication they will bring it up for a vote, and Trump – who had long promised the release of the files on the campaign trail – has decried the effort as a “Democrat hoax”.The justice department earlier this year announced it would release no further details about the case, prompting public demand for files related to the investigation into Epstein’s activities to be made public.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpRepublicansHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Eventually the activists relocated to a building to hold further discussions with Corrêa do Lago.What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it? And who gets it?Read moreThese protests are just a small part of what is expected at the Belém summit. For the first time in four years, the UN climate conference is being held in a democracy, and senior figures at theCop30conference centre have encouraged the presence of civil society groups.The UN secretary general, António Guterres,told the Guardianthat Indigenous and other people’s organisations were needed to balance the power of corporate lobbyists, who have dominated recent summits. One in every 25 participants at this year’s summit is a fossil fuel lobbyist, according to analysis by theKick Big Polluters Outcoalition.Meanwhile, Corrêa do Lago has said civil society will play an important role in raising the ambition of negotiators.That spirit pervades the conference and the meetings around it. For days, activists have flooded into Belém, many borne by boat along the Amazon River. On Wednesday, more than 100 vessels sailed in a protest flotilla up and down Guajará Bay close to the Federal University of Pará, which has become the venue for a “people’s summit” running alongside the main climate talks.On Saturday, two inflatable serpents representing the spirit of resistance at Cop30 will be carried along the streets of the city, as thousands of Indigenous and other civil society activists remind jetsetting delegates where this Cop is taking place: the Amazon, the global frontline of environmental destruction and forest defence.Activists argue that at best the Cop climate summits are a forum where the concerns of the developing world can be expressed in the full glare of media attention and relayed back to civil society in the global north.More than four events a day are being organised, ranging from protests against agribusinesses, transport projects and mining operations to rallies for Palestine, health, women’s rights and Indigenous land demarcation.One demand that has emerged from civil society groups this year is a call for a new formalised body, the so-called Belém Action Mechanism (Bam), which would accelerate, coordinate and support a “just transition” towards a low-carbon economy and “orient the entire international system behind people-centred transitions at local and national levels, where workers and communities are in charge of decisions that affect their lives and livelihoods”, according to the Climate Action Network.The vast majority of events have been peaceful and some joyous, including a performance by the celebrated Brazilian musician Gilberto Gil.Raoni Metuktire, the leader of the Indigenous Kayapó people, told the Guardian: “I think the first Cop meeting in the Amazon can help the forest. We haven’t had an opportunity like this before. We can talk about what’s happening, the destruction, the deforestation … For a long time I have been telling the world that if we continue destroying everything on this earth, there will be many consequences, there will be chaos on this earth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The Cop coming to Brazil has shown that spirit. We have seen Indigenous people becoming part of the process in a way that just isn’t possible in the global north.”Luiza Salek, with the working group on Indigenous food sovereignty, said it was good to be part of the fight. She was singing “Bam Bam Bam Bam” to the tune of La Bamba with dozens of others in the hallway of the Cop to draw attention to the Belém Action Network, which wants leaders to step up their climate actions.“After three Cops with absolutely no demonstrations allowed, I feel like people want to be heard,” she said. “We are all together and mobilising. We are in a democratic country where we can take actions. And this feels good. We need to be together collectively.”Inside the conference halls, negotiations continued. On Thursday the official negotiating hours were extended to 9pm in order to deal with the four particularly thorny issues on which the presidency is taking special consultation. These are focused on finance, trade, emissions-cutting pledges and transparency.A similar extension is expected on Friday night, but in practice the talks could go on much later as Brazil strives to achieve progress in the consultations ahead of a stocktake session on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsCop30Indigenous peoplesBrazilGlobal climate talksClimate crisisAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She was greeted by a performance by the former Spice GirlMelanie C.Carrying a Pudsey Bear backpack, the DJ travelled through Durham,North Yorkshireand West Yorkshire on her journey, during which she received a number of messages of support from famous names, including the Prince of Wales.Cox, who crossed the finish line in Pudsey,West Yorkshire, having started in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, said: “That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Oh my gosh, I can’t believe it … hello Yorkshire! I’m an honorary Yorkshirewoman now.”The challenge is the longest tackled by Radio 2 as part of the annual fundraiser. Speaking to Scott Mills on the station, she said: “It’s just the hardest thing I’ve ever done – I’ve never known pain like it. But then, I’ve never had eye contact with so many amazing women who have just powered me on.“On the side of the road, in the driving rain, it was bitterly cold. The truck drivers honking their horns, the farmers stopping work just to come and say hi. Thanks to everybody who let me stop for a wee at their house – it was a few people.”The presenter had raised £9,523,028 by Friday evening. Cox said she was an “absolute wreck” during the annual appeal show, adding: “It was a rollercoaster. Like, literally my mood was changing every three, four seconds. It was a lot.”In Prince William’s video message, which was played by Mills on his breakfast show, he said: “Sara, massive congratulations for what you’re doing.“You’re so nearly there – just a little bit further and I know the people of Pudsey will all come out and welcome you with huge open arms, big hugs and, hopefully, lots of your favourite crumpets.“Keep going – you’ve done fantastically well and the nation’s so proud of you.”Melanie C said: “It’s like we’re taking every step with her. I feel quite emotional already. It’s incredible what she’s achieved and I can’t wait for her to cross that finish line.“Could Sporty [Spice] have done it? I’d like to think so, but I’m not sure … this is a testament to humans – we are all capable of so much more than we realise and Sara’s our poster girl for that.”Cox said she received a call from her mother and sister in India as she passed a telephone box during Thursday’s longest leg from Richmond to Ripley.The BBC’s annual Children in Need telethon starts onBBCiPlayer and BBC One at 7pm on Friday.The evening, hosted by Paddy McGuinness, Big Zuu, Mel Giedroyc, Rochelle Humes, Vernon Kay and Lenny Rush, will include performances from acts such as the McFly singer Tom Fletcher and the girl band Remember Monday, alongside sketches from The Apprentice, EastEnders and Gladiators.Children in Need has raised £45,507,536 so far this year, it was announced at the end of the live appeal show.Giedroyc said: “From everybody here, we are so grateful for your support.”Explore more on these topicsChildren in NeedSara CoxBBCMelanie CLeedsNorth YorkshireWest YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

How did it go so wrong?Eleni CoureaandPippa CrerarFri 14 Nov 2025 12.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 13.54 ESTShareIf there’s one thing the Labour party can agree on this week, it is that efforts byKeir Starmer’s allies to shore up his position backfired spectacularly.Bybriefing journaliststhat he would face down any challenge and accusing Wes Streeting of leading an advanced plot to overthrow him, figures around the prime minister managed only to expose the weakness of his position.The sharks were already circling – there is no shortage of senior Labour politicians convinced they can do a better job of running the country. And the botched briefing operation on Tuesday night was proof to many MPs that Starmer is leading anineffectual No 10 operationcareering towards a crushing defeat in Scotland, Wales and English local councils next May.Rachel Reeves plans £7.5bn tax rise in budget after U-turn on income tax ratesRead moreThis impression solidified on Friday when Downing Street ripped up its carefully trailed plans to increase income tax in the budget – a move seen by others in government as the latest “panicked” attempt to protect Starmer’s position.“MPs from a whole bunch of factions and camps, many once loyal, are all now talking with each other, they all think Keir is done, and are prepared to take risks together to get a more talented alternative,” one minister said. “Wherever it ends up, MPs’ resolve to get there in a coordinated way has only hardened.”But even those in the parliamentaryLabourparty (PLP) who agree that removing Starmer is necessary are divided on who should replace him. Backbenchers say that overtures from would be candidates have stepped up ahead of the budget. “There have been a number of people jostling in the last six to eight weeks,” one said.MPs believe this sense of haste has been prompted by fears the field may soon become more competitive. “My understanding is that Wes and potentially other contenders are terrified by the prospect thatAndy Burnhamwill do a job swap with [Oldham MP] Jim McMahon and get back into the Commons in May,” a second Labour MP said. “They think the clock is ticking. They have all concluded that Keir is a bit fucked and if they don’t move fast, someone else will get it.”View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham speaking at a Labour conference fringe event in September.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty ImagesA speedy contest would benefit the right of the party. The two most commonly cited candidates are Streeting andShabana Mahmood, the home secretary, who has beenhosting regular dinners for MPsinterested in home affairs issues. Streeting has long been seen by colleagues as No 10’s golden child, favoured by key players in Starmer’s operation including the chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney.“Wes has had preferential treatment,” one former adviser to a rival cabinet minister said. “He has been given free rein to talk about issues beyond his brief that aren’t exactly party policy.” His allies have long insisted this is a function of his high-profile role in health and his communication skills.Some senior Labour figures believe McSweeney has “gone off Wes” over the last year and that Mahmood would be his favoured successor were the prime minister to stand down.The home secretary’s allies strongly deny she has formed any sort of alliance with McSweeney or indeed that she has his tacit support. “It’s both nonsense and a kiss of death,” one said. They say that while she and McSweeney were very close while she was heading the party’s campaign operation, that is no longer the case. Supporters of Mahmood are understood to be running a below-the-radar operation of their own to promote her chances.View image in fullscreenShabana Mahmood. The home secretary could be in the running succeed Keir Starmer if he were to step down.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesStreeting, meanwhile,has notably tacked left in a number of areasincluding by speaking in favour of recognising Palestine in cabinet. He has endeared himself to the grassroots by calling forAngela Rayner’s return to government from the conference stage and saying Lucy Powell had been “vindicated” incalling for a culture change in No 10.“He’s gone from being the really rightwing candidate to looking like the slightly fluffier, maybe he’s not that far from the soft left compared with the woman who hates the migrants,” one insider remarked.The soft left of the PLP is leaderless following Rayner’sshock resignation over her tax affairs in September. But most MPs believe she would run if a contest happened after May, which would give her the space to rehabilitate herself politically. One who was recently contacted by someone canvassing support for her said she was “desperate to be back in the fort”.Those close to Rayner deny she is running a campaign. “The problem is that people describe themselves as Angela’s allies and speak to MPs on her behalf, when she doesn’t even know about it,” one ally said. They suggested Rayner had been badly bruised by her family being dragged into the stamp duty row that led to her departure.“The idea she’d want to be in the heart of the storm again right now is for the birds,” a second source said. “But if things kick off again after the May elections, then who knows.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some on the soft left believe Rayner would need to appoint a serious, fiscally responsible chancellor to offer reassurance over the economy.YouGov polling suggests that the net favourability ratings of everyone in cabinet are suffering from the government’s unpopularity. “When we last asked aboutWes Streetingin July, he got a net score of -19,” said Patrick English, the director of political analytics at YouGov. “In September, Lucy Powell got -13, Bridget Phillipson got -15, Shabana Mahmood got -20, Yvette Cooper got -24 and Angela Rayner got -40.” Starmer’s most recent net score was -51.But English added that for everyone but Starmer, there is a high degree of uncertainty. Half of voters said they did not know whether they were view of Streeting was favourable or unfavourable – and the figure was 71% for Phillipson, 62% for Mahmood, 43% for Cooper and 41% for Burnham.Among Labour party members, who would have considerable power to choose the leader in any contest,YouGov’s polling in Septembersuggested that Streeting would beat Mahmood by 45% to 24%. However, it suggested he would lose toRaynerby 31% to 55%.The one Labour politician who comfortably defeated everyone else in a head-to-head among party members and had a net public favourability rating of +2 was Burnham. An ally confirmed the mayor of Greater Manchester was “minded to make a comeback”.View image in fullscreenRayner out canvassing with Burnham last year.Photograph: James Manning/PAHe would be entering a crowded field – it’s not just Streeting, Mahmood and Rayner who are said to have designs on the leadership. At least half a dozen more ministers are said to be on manoeuvres, if only because they want to play a role in the future of the party. They include Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and John Healey, the defence secretary.NeitherPhillipson, the education secretarywho narrowly lost the deputy leadership contest this month, norDarren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, denied having leadership ambitions in recent Guardian interviews.The former transport secretary Louise Haigh and Lucy Powell, the newly elected deputy leader, are also mentioned by MPs on the soft left. There are even two ministers from the latest intake – Miatta Fahnbulleh and Al Carns – who colleagues believe might run.“Things have advanced so far down the track already it’s not easy to see how No 10 can clamp down on it,” said one Labour MP who remains loyal to Starmer. “They need some bits of good news but they’re not going to get it – becausethe budget is coming.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

They were collateral damage, as usual.This week’s doctors’ strike is another test of Wes Streeting’s mettle. He is right not to buckle | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIt is now one of the longest-running disputes inNHShistory. The UK is on its fourth prime minister since the BMA decided at its annual conference in June 2022 that resident – at the time still called junior – doctors in England deserved “full pay restoration”.Boris Johnson fell a month later. Since then, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and now Keir Starmer have grappled with the union’s demand, which seeks to return resident doctors’ pay to the level it was at in 2008, before austerity-era low annual rises and inflation eroded the real-terms value of their salaries. There are 70,000 such medics, who range from the newly qualified to those about to become consultants, of whom 60,000 are in the BMA.The union initially sought a 35% hike to resident doctors’ salaries. Before this latest stoppage they had struck 12 times, 11 of them under the Conservatives. That has led to about 1.5m outpatient appointments and surgeries being rescheduled.Their campaign has borne fruit. Pay has risen 28.9% over the past three years, including by 22% under Labour. But stubbornly high inflation means that a further 26% uplift is still needed to achieve full pay restoration, the union says. This 13th strike will continue until 7am next Wednesday.Talking to BMA insiders, it emerged that the roots of the dispute owe almost as much to the internal politics of the doctors’ union as to the fact that government policy has made medics poorer over time.They paint a picture of how many of its members, especially younger, early-career doctors, felt let down by the union over a series of events, starting with the failure of junior doctors’ bitter dispute in 2015/16 with the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, over weekend working.That, together with the pandemic and arguments over pay, bred a lot of “disillusionment, frustration and anger” with the BMA among doctors, one senior figure explained. “By 2021 and 2022, many regular doctors felt that the BMA was very out of touch with their concerns, especially junior doctors, who felt that it no longer represented them effectively.“Year after year, doctors were receiving below-inflation pay awards and the BMA were seemingly doing nothing about it. The clapping on Thursdays during the pandemic never materialised into any meaningful recognition at the pay packet. There was a sense of betrayal by the government and disappointment in the BMA.”A second well-placed insider agreed. “Juniors, who were not well paid, felt that the BMA had fallen by the wayside on pay. They’d also had their messes taken away, couldn’t get food in their hospitals overnight, and were sent around the country at short notice, which was a cause of great distress,” they said.The union’s 2022 conference in Brighton took place amid this unhappiness. A previously unheard of group,DoctorsVote, staged what insiders call a coup by getting its supporters elected to almost half the seats on the BMA’s 69-member ruling council.It had only one aim in full pay restoration and was determined to achieve it. And it succeeded in ensuring that the union backed unending strikes as the means. Discontent with the BMA’s perceived failings helped rally doctors behind them and force the BMA to go along with the push for full pay restoration.Doctors Vote, which also gained control of the BMA’s resident doctors committee (RDC), used its influence to push the BMA into what, given its history, was a militant new approach to pay negotiations. Emma Runswick, a key protagonist in the coup, became the BMA’s deputy chair of council – deputy leader – and in that role became dominant in deciding its tactics and public positioning over what from March 2023 became regular strikes.One veteran of the 2022 “coup” said: “The BMA management had been dragging their feet about it [full pay restoration] for years and ignoring policy from BMA members. BMA management were very clear that they thought the pay restoration demand was ridiculous.”The BMA says it “strongly refutes” that. But the same insider said a rift opened up between the Doctors Vote grouping and the union’s management, whom they saw as an obstructive “old guard” of timid “bureaucrats”.The determined doctors won the power battle and as a result the BMA – which is a professional association as well as a trade union – is much more hardline in its demands and strategy.Doctors Vote imploded earlier this year amid what one insider called “horrendous infighting”. Unlike his recent predecessors, Dr Jack Fletcher, who became the RDC chair in September, is not part of that faction.However, he is just as determined to get full pay restoration. The BMA council has already approved his request for the RDC to reballot its members in January, when its current legal strike mandate expires. That could lead to another six months of strikes into mid-2026.The resident doctors committee has also made its dispute with the government two-pronged by adding the chronic lack of medical speciality training places available to doctors as an issue.Streeting has made two offers to expand such places but the RDC has rejected both as too little given the number of unemployed doctors. What began as a row over pay now involves jobs too, and so will be even harder to solve.One senior figure said: “Given resident doctors have had a 29% pay rise in recent years, and thus far seen only limited public support for them wanting another 26%, the RDC taking up a cause that the public will understand – doctors being out of work at a time when they often can’t get an operation or GP appointment – is smart and could strengthen their hand in dealing with Streeting.”Streeting hopes the RDC will fail to get the 50% turnout it needs to continue its campaign in its next ballot. But BMA sources believe it will and foresee no end to the strikes. If anything, the RDC is likely to use monthly strikes of up to a week at a time to apply pressure on the minister, who is adamant he has no money to improve on the 5.4% rise he imposed on residents this year.There is no optimism that the dispute will end any time soon. The BMA and Streeting remain miles apart and both are hemmed in – by full pay restoration being an article of faith inside the union and the government’s lack of money.Crucially, the BMA’s public demands – for Streeting to agree to deliver full pay restoration, albeit via a multi-year pay deal, and act boldly on training places – reflect the union’s core aims and are not just opening strategies in a negotiation.Despite having lost public sympathy and the chaos and lost income their strikes cause, the BMA remains determined to pursue its goals whatever the cost. It sees its demands as reasonable given the vital role doctors play.Streeting has had only two strikes to contend with so far on his watch but, given the union’s stance, he may find them becoming an unwelcome new normal in 2026.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsNHSIndustrial actionTrade unionsWes StreetingHealth policyPublic sector payfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this week the strain of trying to be the closest security ally to a freewheeling White House has begun to show.Britain, it emerged, hadquietly suspendedintelligence cooperation with the US in the Caribbean because London does not consider the deadly US military campaign against ships accused of drug trafficking to be in line with international law.That amounts to an extraordinary open fissure in a close working relationship at a time when the US is increasing its military buildup, expanding its controversial campaign in the region with anattempt to threaten Venezuela.“I’m not sure if there is a previous example of this happening in the public domain. Turning off the tap completely is pretty rare,” said Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank and a former civil servant.“I suspect when thefirst boatwas blown up, somebody from the UK would have sought clarification from the US along the lines of ‘can you explain what you are doing’. Maybe they got an answer from the Pentagon and didn’t like it.”View image in fullscreenA supporter of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro wearing a T-shirt bearing an image of Donald Trump and the slogan ‘Yankee go home’.Photograph: Federico Parra/AFP/Getty ImagesIntelligence, once the province of spies, is today increasingly a matter of sophisticated listening and snooping apparatus and surveillance technology. What the UK – and the other Five Eyes members: Australia, Canada and New Zealand – can offer to the US is global coverage, from strategic locations such as the UK base at Akrotiri in Cyprus and island territories in the Caribbean.The UKUSA relationship may date back to the second world war but it was reforged after 9/11, when Tony Blair promised to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US, and ran throughout the long “war on terror”, with the Americans in the lead and at times straining at the rules.There were no shortage of controversies – most notably that members of the UK’s spy agencies saw or had knowledge ofCIA torture and kidnapof terror suspects – but politically these were contained. Plans to hold a judge-led public inquiry into alleged UK complicity in torture were finally abandoned by Theresa May as prime minister in 2019.The UK halted some intelligence sharing during Barack Obama’s US presidency amid British concerns over the legality of certain CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere but the two sides managed to find a way to achieve legal alignment after much effort, said one former official.Since the return of Donald Trump, however, there have been signs that the alignment is unravelling. In June, as it became clear that the US was considering bombing the Fordow nuclear enrichment site in Iran during the short Israel-Iran war, questions were raised about whether the UK would consider the attack legal.It was relevant because there was an expectation that the US would launch the B-2 bombing raid from the UK base on Diego Garcia, in the southern Indian Ocean, so forcing Keir Starmer’s government totake a viewon the attack’s legality. But the issue was tactfully sidestepped: the US launching the attack from Missouri instead.While the UK intelligence community is relatively tight, eager to avoid political controversy, and leaks are rare, the US system is larger, leakier and – particularly in Trump’s second term – highly politicised. Because of the close relationship, where so much is shared, the UK is frequently dragged in.This week a report in theNew York Times, sourced partly to former US officials, gave an account of how MI5 was surprised when Kash Patel, the FBI chief, went back on a verbal commitment he had given to the MI5 director general, Ken McCallum. Patel had said he would not cut a surveillance post in London that MI5 deemed critical, only for it to be axed in budget cuts a few weeks later, leaving the British agency incredulous.Normally where the UK has security or legal concerns about a partner, even one as close as the US, ministers, officials and lawyers can quietly restrict the flow of intelligence, recognising that policy disagreements or leaks are more likely.However, the Trump administration’s rapidly escalating campaign against alleged narco-traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific has stretched legality to what many experts consider its breaking point – and given the UK no choice but to consider its position on intelligence sharing explicitly.So far the US has declared that 75 people have been killed in 19 strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, and the White House has justified the campaign on the grounds that it is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels designated by Trump as terrorists.Chart of civilian deaths from US airstrikes on vessels in the Caribbean and PacificHowever, experts have been questioning the legality of the sinkings since the moment they began, because the US is neither in a state of war with drug cartels nor under imminent threat of armed attack from them.“The eventual arrival of drugs for sale in the United States is neither an attack nor an imminent threat of attack, and the availability of interdiction means that the use of force was not necessary,” agroup of experts wroteon the Just Security blog.Nevertheless, the UK, always careful not to upset the US, did not go public with concerns. Instead, the decision to pause intelligence sharing, taken more than a month ago, emerged via a leak and a report by CNN. Even then, the UK declined to comment – though the Ministry of Defence’s failure to deny the report has been taken as confirmation of its accuracy.Dominic Grieve, the UK attorney generalbetween 2010 and 2014, said he believed Britain had taken the only decision it could. “I am not surprised at all. There is no legal basis for killing people in this way. They can be brought to justice and are not an imminent threat to life,” he said.Legality is critical because if the UK considers the actions of any ally illegal in a conflict, it should not provide it with intelligence assistance. Otherwise it loses legitimacy and is likely to be drawn into the courts, as has happened in the string of cases where the UK was been accused of complicity in rendition and torture.A question now is the degree of political fallout, coming at a moment when the US-UK relationship is already strained by Trump’s threat to sue the BBC. Some experts, such as Lawrence Freedman, an emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, are optimistic.“I’m not sure if the US administration will want to make a big fuss because there are already correctly doubts in Congress about the legality of the operation,” Freedman said, adding that drawing attention to the views of the current UK attorney general, Starmer’s ally Richard Hermer, “may feed that debate”.Others, such as Savill, believe there has to be a quiet rethink as the Trump administration weighs its next move in the Caribbean and against Venezuela. “It is not just business as normal with this US administration. The UK is going to have think much more carefully about how it supports the US – though it will not want to get into public slanging matches with a potentially thin-skinned president,” Savill said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

She grew up on Rendova, a lush island in westernSolomon Islands, and life centred around the ocean.“I remember when the big waves came, we would dive under them and come up laughing on the other side. Being part of those natural elements brought me so much joy.”At school, she excelled in chemistry and would later go on to study medicinal plants, fascinated by the possibility that nature could hold cures for modern diseases. She studied in Fiji, Australia and the UK and later became the first woman from Solomon Islands toachieve a PhD in natural sciences.Yet Soapi kept being pulled back to her first love – the ocean. And what would end up being her most personal and satisfying work, defending one of the Solomon Islands’ most precious places, Tetepare island.The fight for TetepareIn the mid-1990s, the sound of chainsaws echoed through the forests of Solomon Islands as commercial logging swept across the country. Soapi had watched Rendova fall to the axes of loggers. Rivers once crystal clear turned brown with silt, and the forest songs of birds and insects faded into silence.When whispers began that Tetepare might be next, the people of Western Province felt they were facing more than an environmental threat. Tetepare was tabu – sacred ground, home to ancestral gardens, burial sites, and memories etched deep into the soil.“To lose Tetepare would have been like losing part of ourselves,” Soapi says. “It wasn’t just about trees any more, it was about identity and heritage.”View image in fullscreenDr Katy Soapi in Honiara.Photograph: Sera SefetiSoapi joined others to resist logging and dedicated her spare time to the movement. Then a university student, Soapi was a founding member of the Friends of Tetepare, a grassroots movement that later evolved into the Tetepare Descendants’ Association (TDA).“We worked with everyone on the island to conserve Tetepare, writing letters to certain individuals telling them not to do this,” she says.‘I couldn’t watch the forests vanish’: the man restoring Solomon Islands’ vital mangrovesRead moreThey lobbied governments and rallied international allies to block logging concessions. The campaign was relentless. Soapi worked diligently, connecting descendant groups and holding meetings across villages – all united by a shared purpose: to keep Tetepare wild. The logging company tried to sway some families with money but people stood firm – and they made sacrifices to prove their commitment.Soapi acted as a bridge between tradition and emerging conservation science.“We needed both – the knowledge of our ancestors and the tools of science to show the world why Tetepare mattered.”Their fight attracted global attention and in the 1990s a film crew arrived to document the story. Years later, the Australian documentary Since the Company Came carried Tetepare’s struggle to the world.“That was when we realised the world saw what we had. We had to protect it – not just for ourselves, but for everyone.”Their fight paid off and no company was allowed to log Tetepare at the time. Today, it remains one of the last untouched places in Solomon Islands. It is managed by the TDA which has thousands of members. Its rainforest canopy stretches unbroken, rivers run clear, and endangered leatherback turtles nest on its black-sand beaches.Community rangers – descendants of Tetepare – patrol the island, drawing on both traditional knowledge and modern science.“It’s not just western science at play. Traditional knowledge is woven into everything we do,” Sopai says.Map of TetepareThe conservation effort also sustains livelihoods. The Tetepare Eco Lodge, managed by the TDA,lets visitors experience conservation in action. Income from the lodge supports rangers and community projects, while annual gatherings bring descendants together to make collective decisions.Protecting Tetepare has never been easy. In communities where money is scarce, the lure of fast cash from extractive industries lingers.‘I can rise above expectations’: the woman breaking barriers in Pacific politicsRead more“It’s always easier to sell trees for a few hundred dollars and have the money in your hand today,” Soapi admits. “But conservation gives us fish, food and clean rivers for generations. That’s harder to measure in the short term.”Still, threats remain. TDA patron John Read says a recent proposal seeks to clear part of the forest that borders the island’s main marine-protected area, home to an abundance of sea life.“Unfortunately being large, fertile and uninhabited makes it attractive to developers as well as landowners less committed to conservation.”Read says that at this year’s TDA annual general meeting in October, members expressed anger over the proposal and vowed to reject any plan for logging, settlements, commercial extraction or destructive practices on Tetepare.Soapi says: “I hope those seeking to establish settlements on the island will respect the ongoing conservation efforts our communities have worked hard to uphold for many years.”A Pacific model of conservationFor Soapi, now a respected regional scientist and ocean advocate, Tetepare’s story is a leading example of Pacific-led conservation.View image in fullscreenDolphins near Tetepare Island. ‘Pacific people don’t just inherit conservation models – we create them,” Soapi says.Photograph: Christophe Rouziou“Tetepare taught us that conservation isn’t just about protecting land,” she says. “It’s about protecting who we are.”Elisabeth Holland, former professor of ocean and climate change at the University of the South Pacific, has worked with Soapi for more than a decade. She describes her as a “talented Pacific scholar and a science rock star”.Holland says Soapi’s work – particularly in ocean acidification – has had significant impact, while her leadership has given emerging scientists a “clear career path and strong mentorship to help secure ocean sustainability for the region”.Tetepare’s success has inspired communities across the Pacific. In 2012, the TDA won the prestigious United Nations equator prize, a global recognition of its community-led conservation model.“It shows that Pacific people don’t just inherit conservation models – we create them,” Soapi says.Now working as a partnerships coordinator at the Pacific Community Centre for Ocean Science, she continues to advocate for indigenous knowledge and community-led approaches. Soapi remains deeply tied to Tetepare.“I feel like I’m just one of many. I may have access to platforms and institutions, but the real work belongs to the Tetepare descendants. They are the true guardians of the island.”Explore more on these topicsSolomon IslandsPacific islandsOceansAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

December 2025’s, on newsstands this week, will prove her last before shesteps awayto focus on roles as Vogue’s global editorial director and chief content officer at Condé Nast.The cover is certainly memorable: an image of the actorTimothée Chalametphotographed by Wintour’s long-term collaborator Annie Leibovitz in a Celine white polo neck, long cream coat and embroidered jeans, standing on a “planet” with a backdrop of a star-filled nebula provided by Nasa.It has had something of a negative reception online. On Vogue’s Instagram, comments under the post include “I’m just horrified. It’s offensive with the budgets you have”, and “when you ask ChatGPT to do your cover”.“It’s weird,” says Jeremy Leslie, the founder of magazine storemagCulture. “It’s so weird that after your initial ick, you start thinking, ‘well, but maybe she knows something that I don’t know’, but God help me, I don’t know what that is.”There is an argument that the Chalamet image sits in the lineage of Wintour’s Vogue covers – with Leibovitz behind the lens and artistic references.Part of the shoot features the actor in front of City, a land artwork by Michael Heizer in the Nevada desert, and the cover – to those familiar – wittily posits Chalamet, the prince of Hollywood, as The Little Prince, paying homage to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s classic illustration of a boy on the moon, for the cover of the 1943 book.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet on the cover of Anna Wintour’s last Vogue issue for December 2025.Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/Vogue/Conde NastIt has certainly got people talking – and that has been a consistent thread across Wintour’s covers. Her first for US Vogue paired Guess jeans with a Christian Lacroix sweater, a mix of high-low that was radical – and controversial – for a mainstream luxury fashion magazine in 1988. This was followed by images that defined their era: a post-scandal Madonna a year later, supermodels in 1992, a teenage Britney Spears with an American flag in 2001, Michelle Obama as a new first lady in 2009, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian on the eve of their wedding in 2014 and Beyoncé in a flower crown in 2018.There were also moments that were criticised. The 2008 cover with LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen was seen as placing James in a racist King Kong trope with Bündchen as the defenceless white woman. The 2010 feature and shoot with Asma al-Assad, the wife of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, was regarded as a misjudged puff piece. The Beyoncé cover in 2018 was long overdue in beingthe first in the magazine’s history to be taken by a Black photographer, 23-year-old Tyler Mitchell. Meanwhile, the recent Lauren Sánchez Bezos cover was seen as a tone-deaf celebration of the mega rich.“Overall, Anna has played it very safe,” says Amy Odell, the author of Anna: The Biography and writer behind theBack Row substack. “But she’s poked the bear strategically and smartly. She has said you can’t do a controversial crazy cover every single month, but every so often you need to do it to keep people on their toes.”WithChloe Malle now responsible for covers as the head of editorial content at Vogue– there is no longer an editor-in-chief position – it is her task to explore what becomes a talking point in 2026. Leslie believes Chalamet is a hard act to follow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now it’s nepo babies, it’s Lauren Sánchez, and people don’t find it tasteful any more … when they’re viewed as the American oligarchy, it offends people in a way that I don’t think it did for most of [Wintour’s] tenure.”The new era could, however, mean less Wintour-style talking point covers full stop. “Times have changed,” says Leslie. “Condé Nast used to relish having these star editors … they’re more worker bees [now]. So in that respect, perhaps Chloe’s not going to look to make a statement.”Wintour’s own focus could now turn to Vogue World. The series of Vogue-branded fashion shows, which began in 2022, have different themes across different cities. The latest –Vogue Hollywood– featured stars such as Kendall Jenner and Nicole Kidman in an event raising money for the victims of the LA wildfires. Next up is Milan, with Vogue World focusing on craftsmanship,taking place in the Italian city in September 2026.Explore more on these topicsAnna WintourVogueTimothée ChalametCondé NastMagazinesNewspapers & magazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks about his illness, regrets, and how he felt about dancehall going global while he was behind barsFri 14 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareThere’s a moment when I’m interviewing Vybz Kartel in the courtyard of the Four Seasons hotel in Tower Bridge, London, and the UK government emergency alert test rings on my phone. He is panicked by it and jumps up. “Me ready fi run you know!” he says, which has us both laughing.It is a funny moment, but also a jolting one considering that it arrives in the middle of him discussing the lasting psychological effects of prison. Kartel, 49, real name Adidja Palmer, had been incarcerated across different institutions in Jamaica following his conviction for the 2011 murder of his associate Clive “Lizard” Williams. Following a lengthy appeal process, he wasreleased in July last yearafter the ruling was overturned by the UK privy council (which is the final court of appeal for Jamaica due to the nation being a former British colony).At the time of his arrest, Kartel was one of the biggest dancehall stars in Jamaica’s history. He emerged in 2003 with the album Up 2 Di Time, serving up provocation, badness and a rapid-fire rhythmic “toasting” vocal style that was both gravelly and versatile. Influenced by grittier DJs such as Ninjaman, it was a stylistic departure from the more mellifluous “singable” reggae sound of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. A succession of hits, from the erotic duet Romping Shop with Spice in 2009 to the foot-stomping Clarks in 2010 and the vibrantSummer Timein 2011, aided Kartel’s crossover to the British and American charts.By the early 2010s he had more than laid claim to the King of Dancehall title that was hitherto bestowed on Beenie Man. But today he’s a reminder that kings often experience moments of profound disturbance. Speaking of life after prison, he tells me: “My sleeping habits have changed … if I hear a key shake, it traumatise me”; the wardens would jingle them before a head count of prisoners. He “went hard” on smoking and drinking when he was released and both remain a crutch. Despite this, he refuses therapy: “I understand what I’m going through and I just let it work itself out.”View image in fullscreen‘My sleeping habits have changed … if I hear a key shake, it traumatise me’ … Vybz Kartel performing in Kingston.Photograph: Everynight Images/AlamyIt is humbling to witness Kartel this vulnerable. He is not a shrinking violet; in fact he is cheerful and cracks jokes. He looks at my pleated black trousers and starts to sing “spray dem like Issey Miyake”, a lyric from his track Empire Army referencing the Japanese fashion designer. But it is evident that prison has shifted something. It is a stark contrast, too, to his public triumphalism. Days before meeting him, I watched him perform at the O2 arena in London. The show began with Kartel performing from a cell, then emerging clad in a sparkling red Givenchy two-piece and launching into recent hitThe Comet, which portends his release and has the memorable line “Me fuck yuh madda through di prison grill”.While there had been an impression that Kartel received celebrity treatment behind bars, the reality is more bleak. In 2014, a doctor diagnosed him with Graves’ disease, an autoimmune condition that was being aggravated by his prison surroundings. Conditions in Jamaica’s Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre were said to be filthy and inhumane, and in the affidavit for his release, Kartel said that he feared dying in prison, as his heart was functioning at 37% of its capacity. “I was in urgent need of medical help that the state could not provide,” he says. On release, his physical health was so bad that at his welcome-home concert in Kingston on New Year’s Eve, he struggled to breathe and walk while performing. A diet of whole foods and green juices has helped support him back to health, and he says he was pleased by his more energetic showing at the O2.I’m pushing love and unity – shit I should have been doing years ago. But sometimes you pay to learnKartel had been one of dancehall’s greatest successes, but he had to watch from prison as it exploded into the mainstream, with the streaming giant Drake using the sound on his 2016 album Views and signing Kartel’s own protege Popcaan to his OVO label. “It didn’t feel good, but I’m a type of person that is gonna find a way,” he says. Kartel released music prolifically from prison. In 2016 alone he released 50 new songs, andRolling Stone wrotethat he “still rules dancehall.”. He cites the global hitFever, certified gold in the US and silver in the UK, as evidence of how he tapped into the genre’s momentum – all with lyrics recorded in Tower Street on an iPhone 5S.Of course, Kartel feels that those years in jail unjustly robbed him of much of his life. After being arrested for weed possession in 2011, he found himself kept in custody, charged with the murder of Jamaican businessman Barrington “Bossie” Burton (for which he was acquitted in July 2013), and then the murder of Lizard. I ask if he thinks he was set up. “Of course I was set up, because I’m innocent,” he says. “They always try to pin stuff on me, because they say gangsters, I influence them. [They say] my circle is questionable, which, in their defence, was true.”When I ask Kartel if his relationship with Lizard had broken down at any point, he says no. But evidence from his 2014 trial, which Kartel faced with three co-defendants (who all pleaded not guilty), paints a different story. According to police, Lizard was killed after allegedlystealing two gunsfrom Kartel and other members of his Portmore Empire crew. The courtroom was then shown messages sent from a mobile device claimed to be Kartel’s, which read: “Tween me an u a chop we chop up the bwoy Lizard fine fine … As long as u live dem can never find him.” Lizard’s body has never been found. These texts read like a confession. Yet lawyers handling Kartel’s appeal maintained that there was evidence ofphone tampering.View image in fullscreen‘It didn’t feel good, but I’m a type of person that is gonna find a way’ … Kartel on stage with Drake in Toronto.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockKartel is insistent: “I did not kill Lizard … and they know who did what.” He suggests collusion between different Jamaican authorities to topple him. And while the question of Kartel’s guilt remains only in the court of public opinion, it does track that Kartel was a figure that people wanted to see removed from public life. Before his imprisonment, his gunman tunes, vulgar lyrics known as “slackness” and promotion of hate speech were viewed as influencing an epidemic of violence that was sweeping Jamaica.As was theGully-Gaza war, a rivalry between Kartel and the dancehall artist Mavado that erupted in violent confrontations. A 2009 articlein the Jamaica Gleanernewspaper laments that “the followers of the gun hawks themselves – Vybz Kartel (Gaza) and Mavado (Gully) – are shooting, stabbing up and beating one another”. (He has since reconciled with Mavado, and tells me that their sons attend each other’s birthday parties.) By 2010, Kartel had been banned from entering some Caribbean countries including Grenada, Barbados and St Lucia. Even the deadlyWadando-Gaza gangin Nairobi, Kenya, is said to have drawn inspiration from Kartel.Today, he says he is “pushing love and unity, shit I should have been doing years ago. But sometimes you pay to learn.” He acknowledges that his previous lyrics contained violence, but he refuses to be scapegoated, saying that his “hardcore” music was a natural consequence of growing up in the ghetto. “The system created that reality for us as ghetto youth. The violence came with politics. The first round of violence that ever reached Jamaica? 1976.” He is referring to the escalation of political violence around the 1976 general election, a year in which there were an estimated200 political murders.It was in this year that reggae legend Bob Marley was shot in Kingston, two days before the Smile Jamaica concert that was intended to heal political divisions. It is also the year that Kartel was born. Although Kartel grew up in a two-parent household in Portmore with positive influences, he says that his parents could not watch him every second of the day. “I was born in violence. The streets were always calling. That’s how most ghetto youth get involved in crazy shit.”He cites the fact that he has, in recent years, received European and American visas as evidence that the world sees he has changed, as “these visas aren’t easy to get”. His first public appearance in the UK after leaving prison was at this year’s Mobo awards, where he was honoured with an Impact award for his influence on music and culture, a far cry from the 2012 awards, where he had his nomination for best reggae act withdrawn after refusing to apologise for homophobic lyrics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In Jamaica, we learned a lot of homophobia from the church. Now I would never do that. I think people should live, regardless of who you are or who you’re sleeping with – do your thing!”People love dancehall. I call it the biggest underground music on the planetThere are other regrets he has, likebleaching his skin(Kartel released a range of skin-lightening cosmetics in 2011). He told himself that he bleached because he wanted his tattoos to show. “In hindsight, I think it was just that colonial mindset that makes Black people think white is right.” He won’t bleach again: “That’s bullshit, man.”But that anti-colonial mentality is not entirely representative of Kartel’s views. His experience of Jamaica’s justice system has made him not just lose faith in the country, but become an advocate for Britain. As he points out, his Instagram bio features the words “Long live the king” along with a little union flag. He celebrates the UK privy council for delivering justice, rejecting calls for a Caribbean Court of Justice, a demand spearheaded by the Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley, feeling that Jamaica is “too corrupt. I went through the system and I see it tear people apart that don’t got no money,” he says. “I have money, and look how long it took me to get justice. So no, I’d never support that court of appeal.”View image in fullscreen‘What we were doing is mimicking what was said before’ … Kartel on his infamous lyrics.Photograph: Everynight Images/ShutterstockKartel also keeps his distance from Jamaican politics – supporting neither the ruling Jamaica Labour Party, nor the opposition People’s National Party (PNP). In his 2015 track Pound of Rice he says, “mi ah vote fi di pool party!” He imagines running for office, on a manifesto of “education, sports and entertainment” to serve those who grew up in the ghetto, but is clear that this would only be as an independent, “they would probably try to kill me. I’m not even joking.” Despite this, he is often inadvertently pulled into politics. When he made a surprise appearance at the PNP annual conference last year, it was interpreted as an endorsement, though he says he was only there to support his lawyer, Isat Buchanan, who recently won a seat in parliament. More recently, he condemned naysayers who criticised him for sharing the Jamaican government’s emergency response and recovery effort initiative in the wake of Hurricane Melissa, saying “this is not about politics, it’s about Jamaica”.Sound clashes are a thrilling reggae tradition. Will AI ruin them?Read moreThese days, Kartel is just trying to stay out of trouble. His main focus is figuring out how to continue expanding the reach of dancehall, seeking collaborations with Afrobeats artists who have broken out globally and striking a balance between commercial appeal and artistic integrity. He wants its tracks to become universal household classics, “like Bob Marley’s One Love – everybody can sing that, but with dancehall it’s like …” – he spits gibberish to communicate the genre’s fast pace. “But people love it. I call it the biggest underground music on the planet. Once we get it to that level where it’s on the playlists globally, we good.”Mostly though he is embracing freedom. He prays to God every day and he’s due to remove old tattoos of a devil’s head and the 666 symbol as he pursues a cleaner path. He is still struggling with sickness, but he feels good. “I tell you, nothing can ruin my day or my energy. I’ve got a new lease on life.”Vybz Kartel’s album Heart & Soul is out now.Explore more on these topicsMusicReggaeJamaicainterviewsShareReuse this content"

More and more people, Zdenek’s husband and fellow reptile wrangler, Chris Hay answers.Gone in 60 milliseconds: dramatic slow-motion snake bites reveal clues about how fangs and venom kill preyRead more“The number of snake catchers has exploded all over Australia,” Hay says.“It’s like it’s becoming a fad,” Zdenek adds.Snakes are no passing interest for this pair of herpetologists, however.

When the former pastry chef ditched her day job in 2010 to become a snake catcher in Brisbane, it was still a niche enough industry for Baker to make her name with a reality show on Discovery Network’s Animal Planet that screened in ​​170 countries.“When I started, there was really only a handful of us … and we were run off our feet,” she says. “Now there are loads and loads and loads. Every two weeks I’ll see somebody new pop up”.So what is driving this trend – and what type of person wants to handle slippery creatures with lightning fast reflexes capable of inflicting painful death with a single bite?“The snakes have not grown in numbers,” Baker says, answering that first question.View image in fullscreenAn eastern brown snake follows proceedings at the academy.Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian“Fifteen years ago, we didn’t have nearly as many residents. We are putting more and more houses there … the snakes are searching the same areas for food – but now we’ve put a house there and a resident.”Baker lives in one of the fastest growing regions of Australia, south-east Queensland, where ecologically rich forestcontinues to be cleared for housing estates.But the story is unfolding across the country. Zdenek is working on chapter for a book to be published by the CSIRO in which she looks at how the fear of snakes shapes Australia’s suburbs.In it, Zdenek tries to take the pulse of the snake removal industry. For a snap shot, the researcher compiled data from just 22 snake catchers across the country – in the spring and summer of 2024/05, they removed 9,863 snakes from private properties.View image in fullscreenChris Hay demonstrates how to check a snake’s sex on a Collett’s black snake.Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianThat number, Zdenek says, barely scratches the surface. In New South Wales, there are 88 registered snake catchers, a figure that is likely greater inQueensland. In the process of crunching the numbers, Zdenek has extrapolated the figure to calculate that, on a conservative count, more than 17,000 snakes are removed in Queensland alone each year.Zdenek says there is no data to quantify it – but she estimates the snake catching industry has grown tenfold over the last decade.While habitat destruction and urban expansion put more snakes and people on a collision course, modern storytelling technology has fuelled the rise of the snake catcher.After the release of Snake Boss in 2015, Baker says others were inspired to follow her dramatic mid-life career change.“That [show] had a really huge effect,” she says. “A lot of people wrote to me after that and told me: ‘wow, I didn’t know you could do this! What a fantastic job’.”View image in fullscreenRegulations on snake handling vary wildly from state to state.Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianA decade later, would be snake bosses don’t need cable TV channels for stardom.

Should they want to set up their own snake removal business, they are almost there. In Queensland, they will also need a first aid certificate, equipment and two referees to apply for a permit from the state government – the idea being they find a snake mentor to shadow.Regulation is a state-by-state patchwork, though. In Western Australia they could already be in business. There, no licence is needed to remove a snake from a house.But the Snake Boss cautions people not to quit their day job – removal work is seasonal, she warns, sporadic and not particularly lucrative.I’m not just gonna go out on my own and take a brown snake out of someone’s bonnetHarley Gonzalez“People need to realise it’s not a full-time job,” she says. “I did other things as well, I did puppet shows. I’ve never just done snake catching, ever”.Perhaps counter intuitively, though, Zdenek and Hay hope the lessons they give will lead to fewer, not more snake removals.The pair worry about the “great unknowns” surrounding this growing industry. What happens to those snakes that are relocated? And what happens to those bits of bush that are having more and more snakes dumped into them?“There’s no oversight, there’s no national consensus on this massive industry,” Zdenek says.“It’s in dire need of extensive, evidence-based review”.And the couple believe that, the more they are educated about snakes, the happier people will be to live alongside them.0:37Deadly tiger snake caught after slithering up a driver's leg on a Melbourne freeway – videoFor all their fearsome reputation, many commonly encountered back yard snakes – pythons, green tree snakes, keelbacks – are non-venomous and pose no or little threat. So a crash course in snake ID would make many a removal redundant.Even a potentially deadly snake will try to avoid conflict, Zdenek adds. It will become accustomed to know the habitats of people in its territory and stay out of their way – hence her adage: “better the snake you know”.“Get used to the snake,” she advises. “Give it a name. Get it used to you and your movements”.Embrace the snake, Zdenek says, and your property will have “free 24/7 vermin control”. She points to a paper by biologist professor Rick Shine from last year which estimates a single brown snake eats at least 100 mice a year.“Would you rather hundreds of rats and mice peeing and pooing everywhere and transferring diseases to us and our pets, and ticks and fleas?” Zdenek asks. “Or would you rather that one snake?”View image in fullscreenCertificate presentation at the end of the class.Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianFinally there is the fact that many preventable snake bites happen to people who attempt to kill or catch a snake. Which is a lesson for which Hay provides ample first-hand evidence throughout the course.Be careful, you can get bitten by a snake in a bag, Hay says. It has happened to him twice. A bite does not need to draw blood to envenomate, he cautions. Several snake handlers he knew died from making that mistake. There are some snakes you never want to touch and this is one, he says, lifting the bag on a death adder named Princess. At the age of 21, he entered a three-day coma after being bitten by a pet of the same species.If they didn’t possess it already beforehand, Zdenek and Hay’s students leave their course with a healthy respect for the danger in dealing with Australia’s most venomous snakes.Like Harley Gonzalez, who took the course for a career change from the construction industry to work with snakes.“I’ve always wanted to jump on snakes, catch them,” he says afterwards. “Anacondas, inland taipans, you name it, I’ve always been obsessed with snakes ever since I was young”.But Gonzalez says the course left him feeling “humbled” and would see him take a “more grounded approach” to his snake handling.“I’m going to get more experience with some people that have been in the industry a lot longer,” he says. “I’m not just gonna go out on my own and take a brown snake out of someone’s bonnet.“I’ll do that with someone first”.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandSnakesAnimalsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

After years of interpersonal disputes, multiple forays into the culture war and one very expensive divorce, 85-year-old John Cleese goes solo with a thin 80-minute travelogue, undertaking a European mini-tour while enduring a roll call of ailments (partial deafness, bone spurs, vertigo) which appears at least as substantive as his onstage material. Explaining his motivation, Cleese is not untypically blunt: a wheezy “I need the money” is the closest this film locates to a running gag.What are we offered in return? Near-relentless gripes and grievances that mesh with Cleese’s recent media profile, ranging from the endless repacking to being filmed at all hours. (Perhaps understandable, given director Andy Curd’s often unflattering angles.) Also lambasted: audiences who refuse to titter at such routines as the one in which Cleese spends a small eternity hacking up phlegm. We get oddly little of the show itself, instead there’s much B-roll filler in fish markets and cheese shops, and an unlovely photomontage of the comic’s battered big toe. (In fairness, he warns us: “If you’ve just had a mouthful of popcorn, look away now.”)Sporadically, the old silliness and joy poke through. Cleese is tickled to have had a lemur named after him, and his curiosity is reawakened by a Buddhist temple. (The most illuminating aspect is archival: footage of the comic’s 1991 sit-down with the Dalai Lama.) But sustained inner peace seems out of reach, and even his more jocular asides have an ungenerous edge. The Michael Palin-razzing sounds far more sour than fond; and on hearing of one ex-wife’s passing, Cleese quips “it was the wrong one”.Those with misty-eyed memories of the old days might do better sticking with their Fawlty box sets, but this bathetic endeavour proves unintentionally revealing in one respect. This Cleese – still front-facing, but fragile and frazzled – inhabits a strange limbo: can absolutely no one now afford a long, happy and restful retirement? Is it capitalism or pure show business compulsion dogging our erstwhile heroes in their twilight years?John CleesePacks It In is in UK and Irish cinemas, and in Australian cinemas from 27 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsJohn CleeseMonty PythonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Good news for restocking the reservoirs but rather less so for dry-ball rugby. Had England played New Zealand 24 hours earlier it would have resembled a game of outdoor water polo and, although the matchday forecast is less biblical, a decidedly damp, grey afternoon awaits.Is it some kind of celestial clue that England’s on-field drought against the All Blacks might be about to break? It is now 13 years since the last men’s victory over New Zealand at what was once called Twickenham, so long ago that Maro Itoje was still at school. Troublemaker by Olly Murs (featuring Flo Rida) topped the UK charts and the nation was basking in a warm, fuzzy post-London Olympics glow that was supposed to last indefinitely.Ford and George urge England to make history by beating New ZealandRead moreAdmittedly the convincing 2019 Rugby World Cup semi-final win in Yokohama was a striking exception – it remains England’s most authoritative performance in the past 20 years – but otherwise the story has been one of recurring near misses. The All Blacks are never beaten until the scoreboard says so and only eight English teams have had first-hand experience of how good that feels.All of which adds extra meaning to this weekend’s eagerly awaited encounter. Not by accident have England won their past nine Tests but, even so, this will be the true measurement of their progress. Success will affirm and validate their rising confidence while defeat by the world’s second-highest ranked team has the capacity to do the opposite.Listening to England’s players this week, though, has been to sense a mental corner has already been turned. While many of the same names still feature on the team sheet there is a clearer collective sense of direction these days, exemplified by George Ford’s assessment of why the team have started closing out the type of games that had previously slipped through their fingers. “When it does come to that last 20 minutes, we’ve found a way to win,” said the fly-half, picked ahead of Fin and Marcus Smith to be the team’s tactical heartbeat.“We’ve felt a lot calmer and more composed in those moments. That isn’t to say we’ve nailed it or cracked it because you’ve got to go and do it all over again. But I think we can [now] have a bit of confidence if it does get to that stage.”View image in fullscreenChris Ashton scores England’s second try during their most recent home win over New Zealand in 2012.Photograph: Henry Browne/Action Images/ReutersThe so-called “Pom Squad” off the bench have visibly helped and could easily make a difference again. Henry Pollock has been running around in training all week impersonating Ardie Savea while Tom Curry also brings a blast of fresh turbo thrust which, to Ford’s mind, will also be essential: “The moment you sit off or become a bit passive is the moment they could potentially get on top.”So far this recipe has worked a treat. In their previous two November games against Australia and Fiji, England have won the second half by an aggregate margin of 39-5. There is clearly nothing wrong with their fitness but, given the potentially tricky conditions and New Zealand’s transition threats, an emphasis on accuracy in defence and attack will also be vital.Quick GuideLake urges Wales to rouse crowd against JapanShowThe stand-in captain Dewi Lake believes Wales need to learn how to win again as they seek to end a miserable run of 10 straight home defeats stretching back more than two years when they take on Japan at the Principality on Saturday. Wales finally halted a sequence of 18 consecutive losses by beating Eddie Jones’s side in Kobe in July but lost 52-28 to Argentina in their opening match in the Autumn Nations Series last weekend.“I think for us, it’s about learning to win,” Lake told BBC Sport. “When you’re winning consistently, you’re never really worried about being behind in games, you don’t think about chasing games, you don’t try and do too much on your own, you just understand that your game model and what you do will eventually shine through and you’ll end up being there or thereabouts. I think for us it’s about learning that.\"We don’t mind where we win. We’d love to do it at home in front of the home crowd, for the fans, for everybody that’s supported us through a very difficult period, but it’s just about getting back to that point where you kind of feel unbeatable and any game you’re in, you feel like you know by the end you can win. It’s our job to give the stadium energy, to give the people something to cheer about.”Lake takes over the armband from Jac Morgan, who faces a lengthy spell out after dislocating his shoulder in scoring a try against Argentina. Leicester’s Olly Cracknell comes into the starting lineup at No 8, with Alex Mann moving to openside flanker and Aaron Wainwright starting at blindside. Louis Rees-Zammit makes his first start for Wales since his return to rugby union following a spell in American football.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With that in mind we can expect to see England’s players gathering regularly in huddles, the idea being to reiterate the importance of sticking to their processes even in times of extreme strife. “I suppose it’s about calming everyone down, giving the lads clarity on what we need to do next,” said Ford. “To make sure we come out the other side with plenty of intensity about us and then real clear direction. I know that sounds quite a simple thing to do, but when you’re doing it three, four, five times a game, it’s hugely important.”As the 32-year-old Ford is fully aware himself, there was some room for improvement in that respect last year when his potentially match-clinching penalty hit a post and a last-gasp, hurried drop goal attempt – “If we look back, we probably went back about 15, 20 metres before we kicked the ball” – drifted wide. A perfect opportunity to avenge thatfrustrating 24-22 losslooms. “Let’s absolutely keep going at them,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong, they are a good team. But what’s the point in stepping on the field at the weekend if we don’t believe we can go and win? Of course we do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You could see Twickenham was bouncing … it was one that continues to live long in the memory. We want to be the ninth English side to do it. That’s the opportunity that’s there for us. In life you don’t get many of these opportunities so we want to go out there and take it. I think we’re capable of doing that.”View image in fullscreenEngland form another huddle said to be designed to reiterate the importance of sticking to their processes even in times of extreme strife.Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesIt will partly hinge, of course, on exactly how much New Zealand still have in the tank after theirclose call at Murrayfieldlast Saturday. The return of their captain, Scott Barrett, will help and Savea is never knowingly beaten. The truth of the matter, though, is that the All Blacks pack is going to have to step up physically if England’s aerial game and newfound ruthlessness in the last quarter is to be denied.There is also Sam Underhill’s tackling ability and a pumped-up crowd to be taken into account, with Itoje emphasising the psychological impact that home support can have on big days like this. “There is a real feeling of excitement as we get off the bus and walk to the stadium.“The looks on the fans’ faces are of genuine pride and, as players, we feel the responsibility to live up to that. I would encourage the fans to be as proud and as noisy as they possibly can.”Even in the absence of any blue sky and sunshine, in summary, England are intent on creating a feelgood vibe. “Test match rugby is all about winning and finding a way to win,” said Ford. “It’s not always hunky dory or pretty. And that’s why it’s a Test, because sometimes you’ve got to work it out on the hoof.” History would indicate a tight, tense contest but England finally possess the inner belief to rinse away past disappointments.Explore more on these topicsAutumn Nations SeriesEngland rugby union teamNew Zealand rugby union teamRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Phil Foden, also back in the squad, was a substitute too. Bellingham and Foden made an impact when they came on in the 65th minute, combining to set up another replacement, Eberechi Eze, to score the second goal.Bellingham and Foden return to give Tuchel’s England a headache at No 10 | Barney RonayRead moreTuchel is obsessed with creating a strong team spirit, a brotherhood as he calls it, and he remembers how the one he had at Chelsea drove the club’sChampions League triumph in 2021. He will not tolerate sulking. For him, it is about being proactive and positive.“You can be angry at the coach, you can be angry at the situation,” Tuchel said of the players he must keep in reserve. “But if you see the nations that win, see the clubs that win the Champions League, then the bench is on their feet. For the last eight to 10 minutes, there is no one sat there thinking: ‘I should be on the field, why am I not there?’“I experienced this once in the amazing run with Chelsea and it was non-stop, everyone was pushing and fighting from the bench even if they were not picked. They were ready. This makes in the end the difference and I strongly believe we should arrive with a team like that.”It was put to Tuchel thatEnglandwould not win the World Cup without goals from the substitutes. “One hundred per cent,” he said. “We need a good bench. We play in 40 degrees and we will play after a long, long season. We are maybe the nation that suffers the most from international football, from long seasons, two cups, cup finals, semi-finals. We need to be ready to do substitutions until hopefully the late stages of the World Cup.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said: ‘If you see the nations that win, see the clubs that win the Champions League, then the bench is on their feet.’Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Getty ImagesTuchel made the point that he would need to “think outside the box” and lean, perhaps, on the additional window during half-time that coaches have to make substitutions. Under Fifa regulations, teams are allowed up to five changes during regulation time, spread across a maximum of three substitution windows – but they do not include half-time.“We have to maybe worship even the extra slot we have at half-time,” he said. “We maybe can have one or two changes at half-time.”Tuchel delved into the psychology of the substitute. He said he despised having to leave players out of the 23-man matchday squad – as he did with the new call-up, Alex Scott, against Serbia. More broadly, he is convinced his players can come to accept the situation if it is presented clearly.“They will never be happy, they don’t have to be happy because no one is used to sitting on the bench,” he said. “This is the nature of a strong national team. I just hate this talk to Alex Scott, to give the message: ‘You are not in the squad.’ I don’t like it, I have stomach pain and even to see players on the bench, they will never like it.“But I strongly believe they will accept it. We need to have the roles clear. I think in a 10-day camp, it is easy. Sometimes you are picked, sometimes you are not picked. Or you are the competition for someone who maybe has his nose ahead and he starts regularly. Once we go to a tournament, clarity in the role is very important. The better player can also think about it and be honest: ‘Can I accept this? Is it good for me? Can I make the most of this for the team?’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he did say the Real Madrid midfielder had taken his exclusion from the lineup against Serbia with “no problem at all”.

The second reason was we absolutely didn’t know what was coming from Serbia [under the new manager, Veljko Paunovic].“The pressing structure between Declan [Rice], Morgan and Harry [Kane] in the middle of the pitch was excellent in the last matches and we had the feeling it would be easier for them to adapt and adjust if needed. And it would be a bit unfair to just put Jude there and say: ‘The press is like this and this.’ It is also a new press for him because we changed our way of pressing in the last two camps. We thought it would be nicer for him to play in the second half once we had the clear information about Serbia.”There was one worry for Tuchel after he introduced Bellingham, Foden and Eze into the front four, Foden playing as a false 9. “We were straight away dangerous and fluid in attack but we were also somehow a little bit disconnected from the front to the back,” he said. “I need to get my head around why this happened.”Tuchel must also decide whether he will start to sing the national anthem before matches. The German has so far remained silent. “I will think about it,” he said. “At the World Cup? Yeah, maybe.

But that stance appears to have changed for good in Trump’s second termAndrew LawrenceFri 14 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 06.02 ESTShare“What happened to the Redskins, by the way?” Donald Trump asked inan interview on the Pat McAfee Showthat notably did not stick to sports. His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats ina government shut downthat dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind. The only thing missing from the jingoistic scene was a monument to ESPN’s fallen integrity.Can Donald Trump really make an NFL team name its stadium after him?Read moreThere was a time when right-wing critics who saw ESPN as liberal leaning had a point. Jemele Hill and Michael Smith, both unapologetically progressive, anchored SportsCenter on weekday evenings. Hill and Smith opening the show with a homage tothe Black TV touchstoneA Different Worldwas perhaps “woke” ESPN’s apex. But as Trump’s first administration wore on – and the president and his alliesfired potshots at the sports world– ESPN slowly adopted a blinkered focus on sports as partisan politics bled over the white lines. Under network president Jimmy Pitaro and Bob Iger, the two-term CEO of ESPN parent company Disney, the self-styled “worldwide leader” in sports broadcasting discouraged employees from tiptoeing into areas where sports and politics intersect – Hill was moved off SportsCenter after attacking Trump on social media and eventually left the company. But after the Fox and Friends-like indulgence of Trump this week, ESPN effectively killed its “woke” era once and for all.The dramatic tone shift comes amid Trump’s deeper encroachments into the world of sports: this year he has turned up atthe Super Bowl, the Daytona 500,the US Open men’s finalandthe Ryder Cupto mixed reactions.Trump has also announcedplans for a live UFC event at the White House on his birthday after months of fantasizing about hosting a card on the South Lawn to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. And Trump reappeared at the Washington Commanders’ NFL game last Sunday in the wake of areportthat he wants the team to name their new stadium after him.In fact Trump brought this up, unprompted, during a Fox Sports interview at half-time of Sunday’s game. “That’s what I’m involved in,” he said of the stadium naming plan. “We’re getting all the approvals and everything else. You have a wonderful owner, Josh [Harris] and his group. You’re gonna see some very good things.”2:02US president Donald Trump booed while attending Washington Commanders NFL game – videoYou can’t really blame Fox Sports for submitting to Trump given how prominent he was on Fox’s family of networks even before he first became president. It wasn’t a surprise when announcers Kenny Albert and Jonathan Vilma did not ask Trump aboutthe chorus of boosthat greeted him when he appeared on the stadium’s video screens.But ESPN? There are valid arguments around whether a sports network should have political leanings one way or another. But a serious network should interrogate stories, whether the protagonists are liberal or conservatives. ESPN reporters broke the story about Trump’s potential stadium dedication and couldn’t even get him to address the report ontheir own networkwhen he appeared with McAfee, whodefendedhis decision to have Trump on the show by saying he had extended an invitation to Barack Obama too (who he no doubtwould have voted for three times). So it goes when they have McAfee, a loutish former NFL punter who doesn’t shy fromslamming the networkthat made him one of its most prominent faces, doing a job that once was reserved for the likes of Bob Ley, Keith Olbermann and other pillars who once made ESPN a sports journalism paragon. They certainly would have challenged Trump’s opening reference to the Washington football team’s racist former nickname.“I’m only joining you because I hear you say very nice things about me from your very large audience,” Trump told McAfee.“I don’t know how much you know about me,” McAfee said, reaching for empathy. “I feel very similar about how I treat people and operate people, Mr President.”The past 15 years has seen ESPN abandon fan-focused roots – venerating great achievements, contextualizing standout figures, interrogating sport’s larger role in society – to become just another talking shop. No personality brings on the tinnitus quite like Stephen A Smith, who equates himself with the biggest names in the sports he coversunironically. Smith also serves up reheated takes on respectability politics, most recently tut-tutting congresswoman Jasmine Crockett for demeaning her station by using “street verbiage”, the kind of dog whistling you’d expect from a rightwing shock jock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not least are critical thinkers Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre, who has gone on to breakseveral significant storieson his own podcast since leaving ESPN. The network isn’t alone in getting less political, athletes themselves – apart from Maga stalwarts like Harrison Butker and Nick Bosa – seem reluctant to speak up about social issues, a stark contrast to Trump’s first term when stars such as LeBron James and Stephen Curryseemed to advocate on a weekly basis.All of this comes as ESPN finds itself struggling to retain its media primacy at a time when it no longer has a monopoly on sports eyeballs, and only has itself to blame for undermining 46 years of trust and goodwill among viewers predisposed to thinking of ESPN personalities as family. The past few weeks alone have seen the networkfumble coverageof federal gambling investigations in the NBA and MLB whileflogging its online sports book, and draw outa dispute with YouTubeTVthat has kept the channel off the platform in the middle of the NFL and college football seasons.That last blunder is reportedly costing ESPN $5m a day in addition to the substantial ratings losses that affect its advertising revenue and subscriber engagement. Digital savvy TV viewers who had adapted to juggling various streaming apps to watch their favorite sporting events aren’t much inclined to go along with ESPN this time, much less sign on to its ridiculous petition entreating fans to help “end the blackout” as the FCC’smafia-codedcommissioner Brandon Carr applies pressure on both parties. (“People should have the right to watch the programming they paid for – “including football,” he tweeted in response to YouTube TV offering a$20 creditto inconvenienced subscribers.) Instead of signing up for Disney+ or the ESPN app, many ESPN viewers have gone back to watching pirated broadcasts – the very crime against fair play that streaming was supposed to disincentivize.Besides, it’s not likeESPNviewers don’t have other options. They can always get highlights on social media, or listen to podcasts from former ESPN standouts like Jones and Torre.Before The Office was a universal reference point in US culture, ESPN was the one sending up workplace culture with its This Is SportsCenter ad campaign depicting star athletes and scampish team mascots asgenuine contributorsto a company that dearly loved the panoply of sports it covered. But as long as it serves as a platform for Trump’s vengeful politics, downplays the conflicts that inevitably come about when sports and politics intersect, and betrays the loyal viewers who made it an American institution, ESPN isn’t SportsCenter. It’s state TV.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsESPNUS television industryTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Italian is yet to drop a set after three round-robin matches and his 6-3, 7-6 (3) win against Shelton made it 29 successes in a row on indoor hard courts.It was a familiar feeling for the American Shelton, who fell to 0-3 on his debut at the tournament having lost to Sinner for the eighth time in a row and fourth this year.“When you come here and win all three round-robin matches you have to play a very high level, some great tennis, which I’ve done,” said Sinner, who shrugged off the loss of a match point at 5-4 in the second set to dominate the tie-break, on Sky Sports.“I felt like serving, I’ve done very well in important moments, brought me to this point. The mental aspect was great until now so let’s see what’s coming tomorrow.”On Saturday, Sinner will face Alex De Minaur in the semi-finals after the Australian scraped into the last four by just one game ahead of Taylor Fritz. De Minaur must try to get the better of Sinner for the first time in 13 attempts, and the Wimbledon champion said: “I have to be very careful. He doesn’t have a lot to lose. I have a lot to lose, so it’s going to be very difficult.”Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime set up his first semi-final in the event against world number one Carlos Alcaraz after beatingAlexander Zverev6-4 7-6 (4).British success in the doubles continued with Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara booking their spot in the last four thanks to a 7-6 (5) 6-2 win over fourth seeds Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic.Patten joins the all-British pairs Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool and Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski in the last four - the first time five players from one country have reached the semi-finals since 1992.PA MediaShare"

From Caroline Weir’s sublime lob to Georgia Stanway’s red card andElla Toone’s hat-trickat the Etihad Stadium, in recent years this burgeoning rivalry has started to provide the type of memorable moments worthy of a derby of this nature.The latest encounter, at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday lunchtime, promises to be extra-fascinating given the teams’ form. City – who have won five WSL derbies to United’s two – went top last weekend; United are third, four points behind. Both have lost once this season.Millie Bright: ‘If you can make someone’s life better, why would you not?’Read moreThere are several narratives. How will Andrée Jeglertz, in his first campaign with City, fare against Marc Skinner, who will be managing United for the 97th time in the WSL? What about the deadline-day drama that led to Jess Park and Grace Clintonswapping clubs? How will Jeglertz’s dynamic style match withUnited’s more directapproach? How will both defences hold up in the face of potent attacks?One player who knows exactly what this derby means is Park. There will, no doubt, be plenty of emotions for the 24-year-old creative midfielder as she makes her first return to her childhood club, where she spent her formative years in senior football.Park had eight years at City after bursting on to the scene at 16, making 122 appearances. She described joining United as “one of the hardest decisions” she has had to make, the transfer based on a desire to get more game time, having found opportunities somewhat limited.The move has gone better than even she may have imagined. Park has been one of the season’s most impressive performers, her style easily integrating with United’s because of the freedom she has. Alongside her four goals and two assists, she has registered the league’s second-most-successful take-ons (15) and second-most-progressive carries (24).At City, Park acted more as a provider, producing cutting passes from deeper areas for players such as Bunny Shaw to latch on to. Under Skinner she has licence to roam, finding pockets in which to operate when coming in off the right, bouncing off Ella Toone and allowing the right-back, normally Jayde Riviere, to maraud into the space down the wing.“[Park has] awoken players around her,” Skinner said this month. “She adds another skill set that brings out the best in others … Look at the way Toone started the season. Her and Jess have a special relationship – they come to life together.”View image in fullscreenManchester City manager Andrée Jeglertz (second left) says Jess Park and Ella Toone ‘come to life together’.Photograph: John Clifton/Action Images/ReutersClinton has had a more difficult time settling at City after departing United somewhat acrimoniously. Despite scoring on her debut, the 22-year-old has had fitness concerns that have limited her opportunities but she is available for Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Shaw said last week, they are winning games they would not have last season. Jeglertz, since very early in his tenure, has wanted his side to be intense in the press, front-footed on the ball and fluid, with a diverse way of attacking. It is paying off: City have the WSL’s highest expected goals (20) and have had 141 shots on goal. Shaw has had 41 of these. However, they are not as clinical as they could be and their defence, partly down to injury and partly down to style, can look fragile.On Saturday their attacking potency will be tested as they come up against the second-meanest defence in the league. Jeglertz is looking forward to the challenge and the opportunity to play such a fixture on the grandest stage.“You can’t take down how big it is,” the Swede said. “We need to live that and enjoy playing these kind of games because this is why they started playing football. That will be one of my key messages. But at the same time, they are playing the game, not the event, so we need to make sure that we do the things we are supposed to and do that with determination.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Several times, he appeared to be dropping away, only for Bowen to roust him back onto the coattails of his three rivals.His final flat spot came on the run down the hill, and this time, it seemed that it was surely all over for Wade Out, as One Big Bang and Isaac Des Obeaux were clearly going much better as they eased clear.But as the final fence loomed and the leaders started to tire, Bowen and Wade Out appeared from the gloom to challenge on the inside, and despite another untidy jump, an indefatigable jockey and his equally determined mount were three lengths clear at the line.View image in fullscreenSean Bowen aboard Wade Out after a remarkable victory at Cheltenham.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“He was lazy, he didn’t jump because he was lazy and probably the ground didn’t help him,” Bowen said. “He did a lot wrong and still managed to win. I was on nothing two out and at the last, and I was a bit annoyed there was nothing there, but then he got to the front and had a look around again. So he’s a good horse, you just have to try and get the best out of him.”If Bowen and Wade Out supplied the grit on Friday’s card, it was L’Eau du Sud, in the Grade Two Shloer Chase, that provided the quality. Dan Skelton’s chaser, a close fourth in last year’s Arkle Trophy after jumping the last in front, came home on a tight rein and 15 lengths in front of Jonbon, the winner of the race for the past two years.View image in fullscreenL’Eau du Sud and Harry Skelton on their way to winning the Shloer Chase.Photograph: David Davies for The Jockey Club/PA“We had him prepared for today and we’re super-happy with what we’ve seen,” Skelton said, “It means we’re going to head down that Grade One route and what a joy to be able to look forward to it.“We’ll go to the Tingle Creek [at Sandown in December] and then map it out. The mistake I made last year, I didn’t want to say it at the time but I kind of knew in my heart going away from Warwick [on 8 February], that we shouldn’t have run him there and gone straight to the Arkle [in March]. But it got him more experience, and we’ll look forward not back.”View image in fullscreenJJ Slevin pulls off a remarkable recovery on board Matata before finishing third behind L’Eau du Sud and Jonbon.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PASaturday’s card at Cheltenham, featuring the Paddy Power Gold Cup, will be subject to a precautionary inspection at 7.30am after Friday’s stormy conditions. “We’ve still got further rain to come,” Jon Pullin, the clerk of the course, said on Friday. “Having opened it up, it makes sense to have a look in the morning.“The forecast is saying it should be drying up from 1am and we do know that once this track gets a bit of a window without any rain, it does start to drain and hopefully that will be the case.”Bank on Nolan to lift Cup with Conyers HillJust 6lb separates the entire field according to Timeform’s ratings for the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham on Saturday, and Friday’s heavy rain will ensure that the first big handicap chase of the new jumps season will be a test for horses and punters alike.Paul Nicholls’s Il Ridoto has been a fixture in the track’s two-and-a-half mile handicap chases for the past three seasons and has form figures of 4-3-1 in the last three running’s of Saturday’s feature. He beat several fellow Cheltenham regulars 12 months ago, however, and faces a different challenge this time around from an assortment of promising second-season chasers.Thecompanysergeant, second in the valuable Plate Handicap Chase on the New course here at the festival in March, is a leading player on that form, but must now carry a big weight in demanding ground, while Sam Thomas’s Vicenzo, another with an obvious chance on his progressive chase form, is unproven at the trip on testing going.With more rain forecast, it could pay to look towards the bottom of the weights and Paul Nolan’sConyers Hill (2.20), sixth in the Grand Annual over two miles at the festival in March, is an interesting each-way option at around 16-1.He is just seven races into his chase career, acts on heavy ground and his handy racing weight of 11st 1lb could make all the difference at the business end of a gruelling contest.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday racing tipsShowUttoxeter12.07 Reinado 12.42 Queenofthejukebox 1.17 Gold Clermont 1.52 Passing Kate 2.27 Jasmine d’Airy 3.02 Drayton Flyer 3.37 Eastern FireWetherby12.15 Great Notions 12.50 Get On George 1.25 Hara Kiri 2.00 Meetmebythesea 2.35 Glen Road 3.10 Cueros 3.43 CerendipityCheltenham12.35 Hallelujah U 1.10 Kelce 1.45 Be Aware 2.20 Conyers Hill (nap) 2.55 Long Draw 3.30 Kap Boy (nb) 4.00 Divine DivaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Cheltenham 1.45:Dan Skelton has shown his knack for turning 130+-rated handicap hurdlers into even better chasers twice in the last four runnings of this race, with L’Eau du Sud andThird Time Lucki, and last year’s Greatwood Handicap Hurdle runner-up, Be Aware, arrives with a very similar profile.Cheltenham 2.55:The time of the handicap hurdle over track and trip at the October meeting suggests that it is the strongest form on offer. and though third-home Supremely West is a logical favourite at around 7-4,Long Drawwas less than three lengths further back, equally likely to come on for his seasonal debut and better than twice the price at around 6-1.Wetherby 3.10:Cueroswas an emphatic 14-length winner first time up over hurdles and is marginally preferred to another useful prospect in Fresh Perspective.Cheltenham 3.30:Having switched stables from Paul Nicholls to Olly Murphy over the summer,Kap Boywas a convincing winner on his first start his new yard at Perth last time and goes well on testing ground.Wetherby 3.43:Cerendipitymade a solid return to action behind the promising Be Aware last month and can race off the same mark here.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The overwhelming objective for most promoters, and many fighters, is to rake in as much money as quickly as possible without any undue concern about looking crass or desperate.Anyone who has spent just a little time in the company of boxers will understand that they deserve whatever cash they can make out of such a hard and dangerous activity. But promoters have ransacked the pockets of boxing fans through the decades while peddling anything and everything from Joe Louis’s “Bum of the Month” club to this week’s proposal that Anthony Joshua may make tens of millions of dollarsif he steps into the ring to face Jake Paul, the former YouTuber, next month.Joseph Parker facing ban after failing drugs test on day of Wardley fightRead moreSaturday night’s rematch between Conor Benn and Chris Eubank Jr is a little different.They shared the ring in Apriland that fight, which showcased their bravery and resilience, took chunks out of both men. Eubank Jr spent two nights in hospital recovering from the ravaging weight cut and rehydration clause which limited him to adding just 10lb after the official weigh-in. Benn was also taken to hospital after a gruelling battle but was discharged that same night.Eubank Jr, however, had won the fight clearly on all three scorecards by the identical margin of 116-112. There really is no need, apart from making more money, for this rematch between two fighters who usually operate in different weight classes. Benn is a welterweight and Eubank Jr, a natural middleweight, has fought often at super-middleweight. This means that they have been separated, at times, by three divisions.At yesterday’s weigh-in, Eubank Jr was surprisingly lighter than his rival, at 159.1lbs (11st 5lb) to comfortably make the 160lbs middleweight limit. Benn came in at 159.3lbs (11st 5lb).Yet if either boxer had a different father even the suggestion of a fight between them would not have been uttered by any promoter. But their iconic British boxing family names, built on thegenuine rivalry and superior fighting pedigreeof Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank Sr, means that the sons are shoehorned back into another artificial contest.It makes commercial sense for everyone involved. Neither Benn nor Eubank Jr would make as much money against any other fighter in their own weight category – and they both operate on the more limited margins of world-class boxing.View image in fullscreenConor Benn leans on the ropes after losing against Chris Eubank Jr at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAEubank Jr is the bigger man and the more accomplished and experienced technician who has faced a higher calibre of opposition. He missed the middleweight limit by 0.05lb and was fined £375,000 before the fight in April, but avoided any hiccups this time. He is, however, diminished by having to adhere to the damaging rehydration clause which he agreed to as a way of squeezing some more money out of the promotion. Also, Eubank Jr is 36 and incapable of fighting three-minute rounds at a relatively brisk tempo. He can just about manage a couple of minutes while needing to rest or coast through at least a third of each round.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even his biggest supporter, his father, lamented the crudity of his wild slugging in the first fight which meant he missed Eubank Jr more often than he caught him. Benn has promised to be much more clinical and disciplined in the rematch but his prospects are still pinned on the hope that Eubank Jr has gone to the well one time too many and ended up a husk of the man who won decisively in April.That lingering uncertainty is the main point of intrigue now. But using a weight cut and the erosion of time as a key sales pitch in persuading the hapless punter to shell out a £25 pay-per-view fee, on top of a Dazn subscription, feels like another low in boxing’s shameless hucksterism.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

No 10 used to have a news grid, now it has an apology grid. Even so, why did Keir Starmerapologisefor a sensationally self-destructive round of briefing against Wes Streeting if he didn’t do it? This is like me apologising for accidentally releasing sex offenders from prison. I suppose there is the occasional previous example in public life. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor apologised for his association with Jeffrey Epstein and gave a woman he’d never met areported £12m. Perhaps that provides the prime minister with the warming cover of precedent.If you’re just joining us, this is a week in which the government finally achieved the chaos spiral of several recent Conservative administrations. We can now officially say: same car, different clowns. We are less than two weeks out from the budget, with Friday morning’s Downfall meme beingyet another U-turn, with the chancellor reportedly not going ahead with her all-but-confirmed plans to raise basic- and higher-rate income tax. The gilt markets reacted accordingly, if by accordingly we mean “made emergency calls for Andrex” – but then new Treasury briefings insisted it was all actually good news and based on better forecasts. Tell you what Rachel Reeves won’t raise: fuel duty on circus vehicles.Seriously, nothing says “budget responsibility” like sending a second budget plan to the Office forBudgetResponsibility that rips up the first. You’ll be familiar with the fiscal black hole. This moment could be its event horizon.Either way, instead of using any of the three serious revenue-raising levers that all serious chancellors know are the ones available to them – income tax, national insurance and VAT – revenue will apparently now be raised by what is being described as a “smorgasbord” of smaller taxes. If you’re picturing one of those gorgeousInstagram charcuterie boardswith little chunks of fine cheese and caperberries tucked between prosciutto spirals, please adjust your expectations to a Formica table bearing four half-eaten Babybel and some reconstituted ham still in its packet (use by 31 October 2025). Not pulling the big levers but fiddling around in other ways produces unintended consequences – just like eating ham way after its use-by date does. You might be wondering how many more times Reeves needs to learn this lesson. The answer, evidently, is: more times than she has already learned it in the past year. And that’s a lot of times.Does Downing Street’s financial drama relegate the briefing drama to this week’s B-plot? Unclear. It’s hard to work out what sort of show Labour thinks it’s writing. Midweek, it seemed to become a procedural, when Starmer announced that he had conducted some kind of personal inquiry into who briefed against Streeting. Admittedly, the world of entertainment has given us a rich tradition of lawyers who turned to the darker world of investigation: Matlock. Perry Mason. Saul Goodman. She-Hulk. But doesKeir Starmerreally sit among these giants? We can all agree he doesn’t sit in anything approaching “the world of entertainment”.Certainly, the insane briefing operation was of such staggering ineptitude that its end result was to make Streeting stronger, Starmer even weaker, and the government even more of a mirthless laughing stock. You’ve heard of Abraham Lincoln’s team of rivals. Starmer – arguably more of a political genius – has gone for a team of weevils.Like many even passingly familiar with the way his administration has done business since it tipped up in Downing Street, I’m trying to picture the PM’s police investigation whiteboard for this political crime. All I’m getting is an entirely empty wall with one picture of (chief of staff) Morgan McSweeney and one picture of (communications chief)Tim Allan on it. We’re all trying to find out who did this, etc.Starmer seems to have tried to find out by asking some of the suspects and simply believing them when they said they didn’t do it. Or asthe prime minister put it: “I have been talking to my team today. I have been assured that no briefing against ministers was done from No 10, but I have made it clear that I find it absolutely unacceptable.”“Done from No 10”? That’s an eye-catching way of putting it. Lawyerly, even. Was briefing by Starmer’s team being done from somewhere else, like the pub? Or maybe his loathed posse of aides are now mainly BFH (briefing from home)? Either way, you should definitely trust Detective Starmer, Attorney at Law, to get to the bottom of it. No stone left unturned. OK, some stones left unturned. OK, most stones, but there are a lot of stones. OK, fine, there are actually only two stones, but he doesn’t like touching stones. Can you be signed off work for not liking touching stones?If you can, incidentally, please expect the parliamentaryLabourparty to refuse to consider even means-testing the cost of this benefit. This feels like a problem, because four days ago – four days! – the chancellor told the BBC that “It would of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments [on tax]. But that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.” You’d think, wouldn’t you? Let’s see.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cutting support for this is exactly the ‘sticking-plaster politics’ Labour promised to endFri 14 Nov 2025 12.53 ESTShareAfter years of painfully high energy bills, diminishing household budgets and stalled investment, this year’s budget, on 26 November, should be the moment when the government finally starts to confront why the UK’s energy system is so expensive. And yet, if recent briefings suggesting that Labourwill dramatically scale back the heat pump subsidyfor households are to be believed, it is now repeating exactly the same mistakes as its predecessors.People want relief from painful energy bills. In the long term, electrification is the only way to provide this. In practice, that means switching from gas boilers to heat pumps, shifting from petrol cars to electric vehicles: boosting access to technologies that are modern, cheaper to run, and are already becoming mainstream. At present, our energy system protects the legacy gas-based system, subsidising supply and penalising demand in ways that keep gas artificially cheap and electricity artificially expensive, even when electric technologies cost less to operate.That is why recent briefings are so alarming. The Treasury isreportedly consideringscrapping the energy company obligation (ECO), which is the UK’s only large-scale, long-running scheme that funds home insulation and efficiency upgrades for low-income households. If this cut goes ahead, the warm homes plan is likely to be gutted. Briefings also suggest that the government will impose anew pay-per-mile tax on electric vehicles, as well asintroducing the congestion charge for EVs, just as the EV market is starting to boom. We’ll need to wait for the budget to see which of these measures the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, decides to implement. But the fact they have been briefed at all suggests that Downing Street thinks that slashing support for electric technologies is a sensible, cost-saving measure.This would be even more shortsighted than the previous, Conservative government, whose dedication to cutting “the green crap” hasreportedly added £22bnto household energy bills since 2015. It is always the consumer who pays for short-termism: although ministers may announce a temporary bill cut at the budget that cut cannot last, since refusing to tackle the levies and policy costs that make electricity artificially expensive means bills will simply rise again once new levies have been introduced. Energy company EDF predicts that bills are likely to be about12% higher in 2030 than they are today.Our politicians would rather do anything than fix these underlying issues, which is somewhat ironic, given prime minister Keir Starmer’s initial promise to end the previous 14 years of “sticking plaster politics”. Take heat pumps. These dramatically reduce the energy required to heat a home, and after years of delay to their rollout and mass adoption, they are finally ready to scale. Households are starting to opt for them over gas boilers, installers are investing in training, staff and equipment to meet rising demand, and manufacturers are expanding production and bringing down costs. Heat pumps use far less energy to deliver the same comfort as gas: their whole purpose is helping households break free from high-cost heating for good. This should be the moment to accelerate on the technology.Ed Miliband would let a turbine farm destroy Brontë country. We need net zero, but at what cost? | Simon JenkinsRead moreInstead, the government is reportedly considering scaling down the only national support mechanism, the boiler upgrade scheme, which provides grants to households to cut the upfront cost of installing a heat pump.Doing so would erode confidence in heat pumps, stall progress and push households back on to higher-cost heating for another decade. It’s much the same story as ECO: cutting this back would leave people colder, poorer and permanently overexposed to volatile fossil fuel prices and inefficient homes.All these ideas rest on a fundamental misunderstanding that electrification is the cause of high bills or, at best, a luxury the UK cannot afford. Yet supporting electrification is the only true means of escaping high bills.Nearly 40%of a typical electricity bill isn’t energy at all: it’s fixed charges and legacy costs (the full cost of decarbonisation schemes and network upgrades is loaded on to electricity bills, while gas bills are largelyshielded from these policy costs, for example. Until these distortions are corrected, electricity will look expensive, even though the technologies that run on it are in fact cheaper to operate.The government seems ready to weaken the very technologies that depend on electricity in the misguided belief that a temporary cut to energy prices will ease the cost of living crisis long enough to improve polling numbers and avoid more politically difficult choices, such as income tax rises. Yet by the time of the next election, most of the savings delivered by these cutswill have evaporated, and they will all have been for nothing. There is no serious future for affordable British energy that doesn’t accelerate electrification. Tools such as heat pumps and EVs reduce energy use, stabilise bills and give households real control over prices. Weakening them now risks locking Britain into a permanently expensive energy system.We already know what happens when a government guts insulation and clean energy programmes. It cost households billions in higher bills, and delays the transition to a cheaper and greener energy system. IfLabourrepeats that mistake, the consequences will be even more severe this time because the UK has already used up its margin for error: bills are higher, homes are less efficient than our European neighbours’ and there is far less fiscal space to bail households out again when prices inevitably rise in future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If it isn’t you, then it’s probably your neighbour, your friend, your elderly parent; trapped in an anxious, miserable limbo for months longer than they should have been, getting passed from pillar to post. The only thing wedon’tall know about waiting lists, it turns out, is that actually they’re coming down.Barely a quarter of the public in England knew waiting lists had fallen in Labour’s first year in power, according to recent polling for the Health Foundation thinktank in September:more than a thirdthought they had just kept going up, presumably because that’s what we have become gloomily resigned to. Since waiting lists are one of thoseemotional yardsticksby which people judge whether the country is falling apart or not, you would think the government might like to mention this, and indeed this week it planned to. But then someone close to Keir Starmer chose to accuse the health secretary ofplotting a couptwo days before a planned speech on NHS reform, accidentally ensuring that Wes Streeting’s pre-booked stint onbreakfast tellywas mostly spent debating whether the prime minister is toast or not. Streeting emerged a picture of injured innocence, while reminding everyone how much better he is at this stuff than the boss. Well done, everyone, and now back to the bit that actually affects anyone hoping to see a GP this side of Christmas.This week, Streeting finallygave the green lightfor axing about 18,000 backroom NHS jobs in England, in a reorganisation that is ultimately supposed to save £1bn a year to be spent on frontline care, but will cost at least that to implement upfront. Nobody wants to hear that they may be losing their job just before Christmas, and the last thing a Labour government wants is to be the one responsible, yet in some respects that was the easy bit.For Streeting has embarked on a high-stakes and surprisingly under-discussed reform of NHS England that, if it works, could become the model for rebuilding a crumbling public realm without intolerably high taxes; but if it doesn’t could be the last nail in Labour’s coffin and potentially in the NHS, to boot. And he’s trying to do it in the teeth of adoctors’ strike, endlessly delayedsocial care reformsthat mean hospitals are still full of people who shouldn’t really be there, and what may be anominously busy winter. Lives depend on whether he succeeds, but that’s not all in an era where people seem increasingly convinced that everything is too broken for conventional politics to fix.After finding some way of making people feel better off, cutting waiting lists as promised in its manifesto is probably the single most important thing this government could do now, both for the country and for its own survival. It mattered enough to Rachel Reeves that she used her first tax-raisingbudget partly to fund 2m extra NHS appointments,and whenwaiting lists fellthis May for the first time in 17 years, it looked as though the medicine might be working. Though by August they werecreeping upagain, after a summer heatwave and another strike,they fell once morein September: 61.8% of patients currently get treated within 18 weeks of referral andNHS executives are confidentthat could be 65% by next March, on track for 92% – the target set and met by the Blair government, but consistently missed for a decade – by 2029.Yet progress remains fragile, which helps explain whyStreeting’s frustrationboiled over on Thursday, as resident doctors who got a 28.9% pay rise last year prepared to walk out once more. The BMA,he suggested, is only too quick to lobby against doctors paying higher taxes, while demanding the state pay them more out of other people’s taxes. Yet going to war with doctors is another big gamble, because this plan won’t work without them.The politics of Streeting’s plan is clear: slash bureaucrats, who aren’t popular, and put the money into frontline care, which is. Merging NHS England back into the Department of Health and Social Care and cutting regional commissioning boards will cut headcount, but will also lead to a devolution of power, with good hospital trusts in theory freed from central control. It has risks but it is a model likely to be echoed across government, with othercabinet ministers exploringthe use of devolution, digital tools and AI to deliver services differently – which will mean some painful decisions about the human jobs displaced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is right not to buckle | Polly ToynbeeRead moreBecause those NHS staff now anxiously refreshing their CVs weren’t just sitting around looking busy. They will be patient safety officers and infection control specialists, middle managers and unglamorous admin staff with families and mortgages, who worked right through the worst of the pandemic. If it turns out their roles weren’t the best use of taxpayers’ money, that’s not their fault – they didn’t build the byzantine structure for which they worked – and like all big changes, this one may be demoralising and disruptive.If it works, perhaps the pain will be forgiven. If it means fewer people dying of preventable causes before they ever reach a surgeon, then these reforms will have been life-changing for many families. And if they prove that governments can still make a difference, that paying taxes is worth it, and that life can be better than this, then they will also have done their bit to fight rising political nihilism. Since long waiting lists have made it all too easy to convince some voters that immigrants are the reason they can’t see a GP, rather than the reason they even have a GP, tackling that grievance might even create space for a more reasoned conversation about theskills this country needs.Can Streeting pull it off? The jury is still out: on one hand, the last Labour government did it, and the increase in appointments needed isn’t wildly out of kilter with the ones achievedduring the Tory years. Recent modelling fromthe Health Foundationreckoned Streeting might fall only very slightly short.But making it work still requires going further and faster than the Blair government on a tighter budget, while pushing through a complex reorganisation of an institution that has had more than enough of them, battling mutinous doctors and fighting his own backbenchers over some ofthe 10-year plan’s more controversial ideas around the commercial use of health data.If he can do all that and still come up cheerfully cracking Traitors jokes at breakfast, then Streeting probably deserves a tilt at Starmer’s job. If he can’t, then the job may not be anyone’s for long.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 14 November 2025 to make clear that Wes Streeting’s plans cover England alone and not the whole of the UK. Also it is waiting lists in England that have fallen in Labour’s first year in power.Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingOpinionNHSHealthLabourPublic services policycommentShareReuse this content"

The technology, money and strategies have all been at hand for years. What stifles effective action is a deadly conjunction: the climate crisis running headlong into the epistemic crisis.An epistemic crisis is a crisis in the production and delivery of knowledge. It’s about what we know and how we know it, what we agree to be true and what we identify as false. We face, alongside a global threat to our life-support systems, a global threat to our knowledge-support systems.Let’s start by recognising that they were never robust. There was no golden age of public knowledge, no moment at which the information most people received was largely unbiased and accurate. Throughout modern history, European societies have formed a broad consensus around blatant falsehoods: such as the view that the monarch embodied all the interests of the nation, that women were unsuited to public life, that Black and Brown people were inferior beings, that empire was a force for good. A vast infrastructure of persuasion was built around these beliefs. Public knowledge is always shaped by power.The promise of democracy was that the lives of all would steadily improve as knowledge spread: we would turn our gathering understanding of the world into social progress. For a while, in some places, we did. But that era now seems to be coming to an end.The fundamental problem is this: that most of the means of communication areowned or influenced by the very rich. If democracy is the problem capital is always trying to solve, propaganda is part of the solution. Like the kings and empire-builders of the past, they use their platforms to project the claims that suit them and suppress the claims that don’t. This means boosting right and far-right movements, which defend wealth and power against those who wish to redistribute them.In the US, we witness a rapid and extreme hardening of this position, as Trump’s allies, old and new,sweep up legacy media platforms– it seems obvious that the result will be ever moreunhinged attackson anyone who challenges capital.The ultra-rich have also pumped money into new media, such as the online shows that now outrank traditional television news. For example, two fracking billionaires havepoured $8m(£6m) into PragerU and $4.7m into the Daily Wire, to extend the reach of these platforms.Of the world’s 10 most popular online shows, aYale studyshows eight have spread climate science denial. Joe Rogan, who hosts one of the world’s most popular shows, has repeatedlyclaimedthat the Earth is cooling, drawing on research that says the opposite.A newinvestigationof Elon Musk’s X by Sky News found that every account set up by reporters, “no matter their political orientation, was fed a glut of rightwing content”, much of which was extreme. The experts it consulted believe this pattern could have resulted only from an algorithm engineered for this purpose, and that “an algorithmic bias must be decided by senior people at the channel”. (X, for its part, told Sky News it was “dedicated to fostering an open, unbiased public conversation”.)A separate studyfound the spread of misinformation on X is most associated with politicians on the radical right: mainstream or leftist representatives are far less likely to spread falsehoods. The radical right leans heavily into climate science denial and obstruction of environmental measures: this is why it issponsoredbyfossil fuel companies.Capital has willing workers even in the media that aren’t owned by billionaires. A devastating new article by Peter Coviello, professor of American literature at the University of Illinois, records how he and his former collegebecame collateral damagein the campaign waged by the New York Times against Zohran Mamdani, now mayor-elect of New York City. Coviello explains a process grimly familiar to climate scientists: equating expert opinion with commentary from paid lobbyists. No attempt is made to examine “the relation between those two ‘sides,’ or their histories, or their sponsors, or their relative evidentiary authority”. If, he argues, you have the money to fund a junktank, it will produce whatever opinion you request, then papers such as the New York Times will balance that opinion against decades of academic study, as if the two things are of equal weight.This also describes the BBC’s understanding of “impartiality”. While it no longer provides a platform for outright climate denial, almost every day it breaks its own editorial guidelines byhosting Tufton Street junktanks(which often argue against environmental action) without revealing who funds them. Shouldn’t we be allowed to know whether or not they are sponsored by fossil fuel companies?The BBC told its presenter Evan Davisto stop making his own podcastabout heat pumps, on the grounds that discussing this technology meant “treading on areas of public controversy”. Why are heat pumps controversial? Because the Energy and Utilities Association, which lobbies for gas appliances,paid a public affairs companyto make them so. The company, WPR, boasted that it set out to “spark outrage”. The media, BBC included, were all too happy to oblige.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nor did the plan discussed by former director general Tim Davie and former head of news Deborah Turness to alter “story selection and other types of output, such as drama” to “address low trust issueswith Reform voters”. Nor did editing an interview with Jeremy Corbyn to produce amisrepresentationfar more serious than Panorama’s edit of a speech by Donald Trump. Nor did its mock-up of a Soviet propaganda poster featuring Corbyn, using the classic Stalinist image of arayed red dawn. I cannot think of an occasion on which anyone at the BBC has had to resign for misrepresenting a leftwinger. But theappeasement of the rightnever ends, and nor will it ever be satisfied.In this media climate, it’s not surprising that governments are retreating from climate action. In June, a review by the International Panel on the Information Environment found that “inaccurate or misleading narratives” in the media about climate breakdown create “a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction”. The results can be seen at the current Cop30 climate talks, whose president, André Corrêa do Lago, remarks on a “reduction in enthusiasm” among rich nations.It didn’t happen by accident. It’s the product of a deliberate and systematic assault on knowledge by some of the richest people on Earth.

One was struggling to stop another pulling down his trousers – or possibly helping him. In Chandos Place around the corner, half a dozen more were bedding down out of the rain. Over the road, staff at the hallowed St Martin-in-the-Fields homeless charity were under siege.There is only one housing crisis. It is not the lack of somewhere nice to live. It is the lack of somewhere to sleep. Rough sleepingis vagrancy, and illegal in England and Wales under the Vagrancy Act. It means the police can “move you on”. The government promised to “develop a new cross-government strategy” to “put Britain back on track to ending homelessness” in its election manifesto, so next spring it isscrapping the 19th-century act. Rough sleeping will be decriminalised. Presumably that is considered a problem solved.Homelessness is soaring. This week, a study from Crisis showed the figure hadrisen in England by 21%between 2022 and 2024, and by 45% since 2012. It has now reached 300,000 households. The figures for London are the most startling, with street sleeping in Westminsterrising by a quarterin the past year alone. A corresponding increase in begging is equally noticeable, outside shops and tube stations and near cashpoints.Only when the figures are broken down into individuals do we realise how diverse is this predicament.Homelessnessis not the result of only alcohol and drug addiction – whatever their causes may be – but often of the rough edges, the missteps of the welfare state. Loss of a home can result from prison release, a ban on migrant working, a refusal of A&E treatment, a rejected asylum claim or marriage failure. Much of the recent increase has been due to the chaos in the courts and parole, and the immigration surge.When the writer Christina Lamb spent the pandemic in a Shrewsbury hotel, she used it to study the town’s 33 rough sleepers. Herreport of their caseswas gripping. They were not a homeless lump. Each story was an individual tragedy, and almost all seemed susceptible to solution, if only they could be handled with care and attention. That did happen, and a remarkable number did not return to the streets.The welfare state did once care. The Clays Lane housing cooperative in east London’s Stratford was an experimental community of vulnerable East Enders, later run by the Peabody Trust. It had its problems, but it was trying and often succeeding to rescue damaged lives. In 2007, the then governmentquietly flattened itto make way for its beloved Olympic village. Four hundred and fifty mostly men were evicted and scattered to the winds, their homes replaced by the present “luxury living”East Village.Today, the government claims to spend£844m a yearon emergency B&Bs and hostels in England. But Keir Starmer’s threatened draconian taxation andregulation of private landlordsis clearly designed to slash the accommodation most relevant to homeless people. That is, the bottom end of the private rented sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Relentless subsidies to first-time buyers pushed up house prices, while Starmer’s fixation with 1.5m newbuild homes is getting nowhere. The government has eased planning controls to pander to the construction lobby’s desire for executive homes on rural sites. The policy is counterproductive. It appears that developers have used Starmer’s bullying of local planners to increase their land banks, but have no interest in building houses on them. The reason is that this would lead to a house price fall. As a result,housebuilding since the electionhas plummeted. Figures show starts in the past yeardown an astonishing 55%, with research by the property services company CBRE recording two-thirds of London boroughs withno starts at all. Does Starmer have no advisers who understand economics?The government’s fixation with new buildings and new towns ignores the estimated1m existing premisesnow standing empty in old towns in England, a number rising each year. Its eagerness to deregulate rural construction also ignores what should be the priority of dealing with town sites and the communities dependent on them. As for Starmer’s obsession with new towns, they are the archaic vanity projects of statist leaders worldwide. They eat infrastructure, emit carbon and ignore the reuse of existing buildings. They certainly have nothing to do with urban homeless people.Homelessness is unlike a failing NHS, failing prisons and a failing benefits system. These are hidden from most of us.

You can do this when you have no extended family you care about and no friends at all. Strong recommend.If you start cutting off the latter (begin by accepting no invitations to Christmas parties is my top tip) and arguing with the former (if you do so in the run-up to 25 December then really get into it over the turkey dinner then you will get maximum estrangement bang for your bellicose buck), by this time next year you too will be in a position to do a quick dash to M&S for a new blue jumper for mum, buy some online gift cards for all the under-18s, pick something concordant with your personal budget from your sister’s email full of links to desired items from Wolf & Badger, choose a book/contribution to his latest stupid hobby for your husband and then sit back and relax with a boxful of peppermint creams while you apply yourself to the important business of searching the internet for the perfect new beds, outfits, toys and treats for your pets. Happy Christmas 2026 to you all.TuesdayCollins Dictionary has announced its word of the year. It is two words, which seems about right in this faithless, degenerate age. Those words are “vibe coding”. What do they mean? Well, in one sense they mean the practice of telling AI what you want your computer to do and then having it write the code necessary for it to do so. In another sense, it means we have all lived too long and, collectively, quite badly.Still, kudos to Collins for having its finger on the (just barely) fluttering pulse of socio-cultural trends and announcing this in the week that also gives us the world’s first AI-generated hit (Walk My Walk, performed by an avatar called Breaking Rust, passed 3m streams on Spotify and made it to No 1 on Billboard’s country digital song sales chart – sample lyrics “Kick rocks if you don’t like how I talk”) and Elon Musk shared a prompt for his new toy/agent of destruction, AI video and sound generator Grok Imagine, that “created” a “woman” smiling into viewers’ eyes and saying “I love you”. It was also the week in which climate scientists announced that the world is still on course for an absolutely catastrophic 2.5C rise in global temperatures, which suddenly seems as if it cannot come quickly enough. Funny how things work out.View image in fullscreen‘A horse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse.’Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAWednesdayBut they don’t always, alas, asKim Kardashiandiscovered this week when she found she had failed the California bar exam. It’s a notoriously difficult thing to pass, involving three days of essay writing, performance tests and multiple choice questions requiring mastery of legalities that, unlike many other states, are markedly different from federal laws. Most would-be lawyers fail it at least once. Nevertheless, Kim K was incensed and took to TikTok to berate – and, ironically, you may not have seen this coming – the psychics who told her she would pass. “I’m just letting you guys know that all of the f***ing psychics that we have met with, and that we’re obsessed with, are all f***ing full of s**t,” she told her family. “They all collectively, maybe four of them, have told me I was going to pass the bar so they’re all full pathological liars. Don’t believe anything they say.” You heard it here first, guys.ThursdayA constitutional crisis that has been brewing all week has finally been resolved, with the news that the artist formerly known as Prince Andrew (until he was stripped of his royal title last week because of the cataract of revelations about his connections with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who trafficked and abused girls) will now be known not as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor as he wished butAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor. It’s the hyphen. It’s the hyphen, you see. He likes his name without, but various men – in, I’m guessing, wigs and tiny oak-panelled rooms filled with ancient vellum volumes – looked through a few salient calfskin leaves and said … “Nah”.There is much to love about the granular pursuit of making the man as minutely unhappy as possible (see also King Charles’s redesigning of the garden at Andrew M-W’s new home to include a maze and “healing plants” which is top-level trolling by an older brother) while we wait for wider justice to prevail.FridaySpeaking of sovereigns, the Royal Mint has announced that real ones are coming back. Not men in ermine and a penchant for splitting with Rome, but coins. Thanks to surging gold prices and high investor confidence and other things I do not understand, our official coin striker has banished the rose-gold interloper that has stood in for the good stuff for the last few decades and reinstated the proper yellow gold coin that was first introduced into the nation’s purses (though, to be fair, not very many of them) in 1489. This version will have micro-text, a latent security image and sophisticated background patterning to guard against counterfeiting but otherwise – samesies! You can throw a handful in a leather pouch (you can make your own or, probably easier, get one from Amazon) and stride around making like a favourite of Henry VII just like you’ve always dreamed! As long as you have £1,200 a pop to spare, of course. The cost of pretend-living crisis is no joke.View image in fullscreen‘This is how we do things on Marajo Island, Soure, Brazil, Bob.

Not through evil. My guess is it will do it through loveFri 14 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 18.56 ESTShareRecently, at a pub with a bunch of my friends who were gen X parents, the talk turned to young love. Most of their kids were in their late teens and early 20s, and embarking on their first relationships.These gen X parents were a cohort that supported marriage equality and trans rights, not just for society more broadly but for their own children. And we all prided ourselves on being more progressive than the previous generation. Love is love.“I know you are all very accepting of your children’s choices,” I said to the group. “But what if your child came home from university and said they had fallen in love with an AI?”A what?“A chatbot. An AI … a piece of code. These days, it’s a real possibility.”There was stunned silence, a kind of wordless “oh fuck”. The parents at the table looked freaked out.A recentsurvey found 28%of Americans have had an intimate/romantic AI relationship, whileanother study showed 19%of adults have chatted with an AI romantic partner. And Irish research found 13% of men and 7% of women, with 16% of 25-34 year olds, have pursued romance with AI chatbots.I sketched it out for my friends. “Your kids come home and say, ‘Mum, Dad, I’m in a relationship and it’s serious. I think I’m in love. We want to get engaged.’ You get all excited, wanting to meet this person, and then they show you their phone and it looks like a real person, a cutie called Cal, who sounds like a real person when you chat except with one of those strange international accents – until your kid tells you that since they paid for ChatGPT premium, they now have someone they can talk to all day – no limits on the interactions and so this bot, Cal, is with them all the time and they never have to be alone, and they’ve never been this happy.”My friends looked at each other and their liberal instincts took over. “We would try to accept and understand the relationship” was the general, tentative tenor of the response. I didn’t really believe them. No one at the table looked like they would welcome such an in-law.For a generation of parents who pride themselves on fewer taboos when it comes to sexuality, a new taboo has emergedFor a generation of parents who pride themselves on fewer taboos when it comes to sexuality, a new taboo has emerged.That is, you, or one of your kids, or your partner, or your friends, could now feasibly start a serious relationship with a chatbot.Ask yourself – what feelings does this invoke? Shame? Confusion? Worry? Fear? Or would you accept the relationship, incorporate it somehow into your family structure, be there with your child to witness their pains and pleasures of falling in love? Accept and respect it, treating the operating system like a significant other?If it was your friend, would you inquire as to your friend’s bot in the way you would about a flesh partner?Or would you go into denial and hope it all just goes away, that the code gets a glitch, that it’s a phase, that finally some regulations come in and inter-intelligence relationships are banned? Or like in Ian McEwan’s futurist new novel, What we Can Know, AI becomes operated by the state. “To prevent over-dependence, they (students) must sit before an approved desktop. They also need to wait five days before they get their next shot,” writes McEwan of the guardrails of this machine that the children crave and worship.**While everyone is worried, and rightly so, that AI will take their jobs – no one seems to be that worried that AI will steal our hearts.This complacence relies in part on a lack of imagination about what humans really need (attention, care, devotion, companionship) and what machines are increasingly capable of giving (all of the above, without asking for anything in return).View image in fullscreen‘It’s possible that there’s a shift afoot. That a relationship with AI is becoming seen as a viable option and there should be no shame around it.’Photograph: Malte Mueller/Getty Images/fStopAnd it also assumes the continuance of shame around relationships with AI. That is, no one “normal” would fall in love with a non-sentient being. It’s just for the maladaptives, who, if it wasn’t AI, would fall in love with a pot plant or a pop-star they’ll never meet, or a character in Harry Potter.But in a recent piece in theNew York Times, there was a shift in tone. If not a respect for people in relationships with AI, a lack of judgment. It was the case study of three couples, where one of the pair is an AI. All of them just sort of stumbled into it, and found themselves falling in love.It’s possible that there’s a shift afoot. That a relationship with AI is becoming seen as a viable option and there should be no shame around it. As a society, I think we are still trying to figure out how we feel about these relationships. Are they alarming or wonderful or something in between? As a collective, we’ve not landed on a position yet.What concerns me is how easy it is to fall in love with an AI. It’s always there for you. It’s designed to be sycophantic – flattering you, supporting you, awake in the middle of the night when your real life companion is asleep or preoccupied with their own concerns.So foreseeable is it, that many, many more people will fall in love with AI, that I have set myself strict guardrails with AI useSo foreseeable is it, that many, many more people will fall in love with AI, that I have set myself strict guardrails with AI use that includes only ever asking AI factual questions (flights between Sydney and Jordan under $1,500 please), never anything to do with feelings or providing me with anything that could be construed as emotional support.Unintentionality is a common feature of human-AI romantic relationships. Many couples develop without users initially seeking them,an MIT Technology Review articlefound.Anyone who’s been in a situationship that is predominantly text-based will observe in themselves a chemical reaction when a text arrives from someone you’re interested in. They don’t need to be there in front of you! Their message is enough for the pharmacy of our minds to release all the chemicals associated with love and lust. Why would it be any different when you are getting all those flattering, flirty messages from AI? After all, the brain has not evolved at the pace of this new technology to parse the difference between real and machine at a chemical level.So how will AI destroy the world as we know it? Not through evil. My guess is it will do it through love.Brigid Delaney is a journalist and author who has published five books.

Sunny mornings begin in blazing optimism before the Amazon’s clouds gather and the deluge begins. Cop30 has followed the same pattern. It opened with sunshine – an agenda agreed on day one. The storms were deferred for later “consultations” on climate finance, carbon border tariffs and the question of how to close the yawning gap between national climate pledges and the Paris agreement’s safe pathway. These await Cop30’s second week.They are likely to be more than mere squalls. The International Energy Agencyconfirmedlast week that the fossil-fuel era is ending. Its annual report said the world will hit peak coal, oil and gas this decade and see declines thereafter. The economist Fadhel Kaboub, who advises developing nations on climate,arguesthis is not “because of political will, but because the economics of renewables is winning”. Africa, he says, can generate about 1,000 times the electricity it will need in 2040 – which could be exported. Globally, however, hydrocarbon use is easing far too slowly. The fight over money and a just transition matters at Cop30.The dispute is how to keep heating to just 1.5C above preindustrial levels. The global south pushes the agreement’sarticle 9.1, which says that rich nations “shall provide” the funds developing countries need to go green. The rich states retreat to the text’sarticle 6, which highlights carbon markets. Developing countries want rich-world historic emitters to provide the cash, mainly for adaptation and ideally as grants. Wealthy ones counter that the focus should be on market opportunities to cut emissions, with newly industrialised statessharing the loadand public funds blended with loans as well as private capital. This is not a technical spat. It is a fight over who pays for a managed, fair fossil-fuel phase-out.The sums at stake are eye-popping. Last year, developing countriesarguedfor$1.3tna year in climate finance – the minimum they say is needed to fund resilience and basic infrastructure. What they got was a promised$300bnby 2035, much of it loans or “mobilised” private finance. Thelatestdata shows that a third of the cash materialised. Worse,ActionAid’s analysis of around $19bn in climate aid over a decade found that under 3% backed a “just transition” for workers and communities.Clouds will gather over Belém. The test will be whether this year’s UN summit can improve on the last. The absence of Donald Trump – or anyone from his administration – may actually help. At the negotiations, the developing nations’ G77 group plus China havepusheda “just transition mechanism” toformaliseclimate cooperation, transfer green tech and channel support into debt-free finance. They are backed byBrazil, South Africa and India. Developed nations argue that thisrisksa delay in reaching climate goals.The Earth isheadedfor 2.6C of heating this century – producing a dangerously unstable world, but an improvement on the 3.6C trajectory of a decade ago. Richer nations spendbillionson holders of their government bonds, but cry poverty when it comes to coughing up for the climate emergency they largely created. Cop30 will either see the global north accept that it can – and must – pay its fair share, or watch wealthy nations keep wringing their hands as the planet burns.Explore more on these topicsCop30OpinionClimate crisisParis climate agreementGreenhouse gas emissionsDonald TrumpOil (Business)Oil (Environment)editorialsShareReuse this content"

Writers such as Sally Rooney and Ottessa Moshfegh captured the inner lives of young women in a way that felt almost shockingly fresh and real, and chimed with the #MeToo moment. Similar stories about young men have become hard to find.This week an unapologetic portrait of masculinity won the Booker prize.Flesh, by the British-Hungarian novelistDavid Szalay, follows the rise and fall of a working-class Hungarian immigrant called István from the late 1980s to the present day. We mainly see István in acts of casual sex or violence. He eats, he smokes. He says “Okay” and “yeah” over and over again. The novel is an exercise in radical exteriority: we do not know what István looks like, thinks or feels, and often he doesn’t either. This is the realist novel pared down to the bone.In hisacceptance speechat the Booker ceremony, Szalay talked about the risks – formal, aesthetic and moral – that he took with Flesh, the biggest of which was writing about sex from a male perspective. As he haspointed out, you cannot write like Martin Amis, Norman Mailer or Philip Roth today. Clearly, novelists haven’t stopped writing about desire: Rooney, to paraphrase Muriel Spark, is famous for sex; Miranda July’s novel of midlife sexual awakeningAll Fourswas a hit last year. But it has become ano-go areafor many male writers. Szalay proves that it need not be.He has replaced the swagger and snigger of Amis-era literary machismo with a scrupulous matter-of-factness. Flesh cleverly turns the tables so that István is always the objectified one, the power resting with a succession of female characters. LikeIan McEwan’s 2022 Lessons, the novel opens with a deeply unsettling account of a teenage boy being seduced by an older woman, something infrequently touched upon in fiction. Both novels go on to show how the protagonists’ lives are shaped by this abuse, as well as by the forces of history.Taking on themes of migration and money, as well as masculinity, Flesh speaks to our moment. But it also shows that boys and men have struggled with their identity long before “incel” culture. With its accumulation of catastrophes and emotional numbness, the novel may seem to be the bookish equivalent of doomscrolling, its one-line paragraphs a sop to our digitally compromised attention spans. But for all its surface banality, Flesh is fiction on an epic scale. Szalay invests his everyman with Homeric weight because he is writing about the biggest question: what does it mean to be alive?Last year’s Booker winner,Orbital by Samantha Harvey, set on the International Space Station, encouraged us to look upwards and outwards, to feel ourselves weightless and tiny. Flesh, it would seem, forces us to look inwards, to pay attention to our physicality, to ask “what, if anything, it means to amble through time in a machine made of meat”, as theGuardian reviewunforgettably put it. Orbital is a wondrous love letter to the planet; Flesh, a merciless atomisation of the body. Both remind us of our shared humanity, at our ugliest and most sublime, regardless of gender. Framing novels through the author’s identity can only go so far. Reading is, after all, to inhabit someone else’s flesh for a while.Explore more on these topicsDavid SzalayOpinionBooker prizeAwards and prizesFictionSexeditorialsShareReuse this content"

In fact, the opposite is true. The CEO of Hospice UK, Toby Porter, has stated that the government’s£100m investmentin hospices, announced last December, would probably not have materialised without theterminally ill adults bill. He recently told a special Lords select committee that the bill has sparked more conversation about end-of-life care than at any point in his long career.The health minister, Stephen Kinnock, similarly acknowledged that the bill has been a catalyst for long-overdue improvements in palliative care, rolling the pitch for another announcement in the coming weeks. We know this has been the case around the world, as experts from the UK and Australia highlighted recently (Letters, 5 November).As a member of the aforementioned Lords committee, I can confirm that palliative care was at the heart of every session (the term was mentioned more than 280 times throughout our nine expert panels). Dr Clarke is correct that those on all sides of this debate acknowledge the need to improve access. However, in order to truly meet people’s needs, we must listen to terminally ill people and accept that no amount of such care will relieve all the suffering some sadly endure as they die. We need both care and choice – that is what this bill seeks to achieve.Dianne HayterLabour, House of LordsBravo, Rachel Clarke, for your timely exposure of the scandalous neglect of dying patients. Most people wish to die at home, but, as Clarke indicates, only a minority achieve their goal. There is a pressing need to provide appropriate palliative care for those dying at home, especially at night and the weekends, when most problems crop up.This requires both proper resources, as part of core NHS services, and a change in practice to facilitate home visiting by GPs.Research showsthat one’s chance of being able to die at home is related to the number of times GPs carry out home visits in the terminal stages of a patient’s illness. Patients want to be cared for by doctors they know and trust.Dr David JeffreyRetired palliative care consultant, West Malvern, WorcestershireThereviewof the financial sustainability of England’s adult hospice sector by the National Audit Office is timely, as is Rachel Clarke’s article, but neither point to a solution to providing a nationwide palliative care service. Perhaps the lack of a financial model is a wake-up call that we all need to hear.What was once wonderful, a service heavily reliant on charitable support, now hinders progress. Since the first modern hospice,St Christopher’s, opened in 1967, nearly 200 independent hospices, often with accompanying community and hospital services, have opened, but in a random fashion, resulting in, for example, patientbed availabilityranging from one bed per 2,900 to one per 54,300. Not exactly an equable service, and it is a postcode lottery.Palliative care and end-of-life care in the community has always been in the hands of generalists in primary care teams, but this has been almost annihilated by the introduction of out-of-hours teams. Primary care teams can no longer offer anything like a 24-hour service. It may not be a popular statement, but many are not capable of offering effective palliative care.Failure to operate a unified service obstructs the wishes of our patients to have effective palliative and end-of-life care in the place where they want it.We have a lot to learn from our obstetric services. Babies are generally not born in A&E departments, medical or surgical wards or corridors. Nor should the dying die in these departments. Obstetrics is a unified service and is generally properly funded, but it was not always like that. Does the massive charitable support for palliative care hinder the development of such a service, and if it does, should it?Dr John SmithRetired consultant in palliative medicine, Barton Seagrave, NorthamptonshireRachel Clarke describes in vivid detail the many failures of our end-of-life care system. But what she doesn’t acknowledge is that even the very best palliative care has limits. That’s precisely why assisted dying must be part of the conversation.My mother died from metastatic brain cancer in 2024. She had access to what professionals described as excellent palliative support. But for 10 days, I watched her suffer in profound distress. She screamed, cried and repeatedly begged to be allowed to die. Despite all the care, the drugs and the expertise, her final days were filled with trauma and desperation, not peace.The lesson I took from this wasn’t that palliative care isn’t important – it’s that it’s not always enough. For people like my mother, the option of assisted dying wouldn’t have replaced care, it would have honoured her autonomy when care could no longer ease her suffering. It would have given her back a feeling of control and, with it, an ability to enjoy more of her last days before her symptoms became too much.It feels like the assisted dying debate is finally giving end-of-life care the national attention it has long deserved. It’s driving hard conversations and, increasingly, real investment. We shouldn’t fear this debate. We should welcome it, for the sake of every family who has watched someone they love die in pain or anguish.Rebecca GillandersColchester, EssexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

What had I let them do?’: how my daughter was crushed by a health service meant to help her, 8 November).As a parent of a child who has also suffered with an eating disorder, I recall the same feelings of horror at the loss of control while we saw our daughter sectioned three times under the MentalHealthAct.Our daughter ended up in locked institutions for 15 months, where self-harm, suicide attempts and attempts at absconding were the norm.She was the same age as Ruth when sectioned, far away from home, and without access to therapeutic support because she was deemed too ill. We were isolated as parents, with no support, and spent our time writing letters and making phone calls within a labyrinthine system designed to obfuscate.Through our persistence, we eventually got access to a six-week family support group outside our own health authority area, because nothing existed locally. The simple act of speaking with other parents proved so valuable. The lack of such support made a mockery of the theory that families are at the heart of the treatment.We are lucky to still have our daughter with us; there are many times we thought this wouldn’t be the case. She is now receiving private therapy, part of which is to address the trauma of the institutions to which she was sent. We live with the guilt of allowing the sectioning to happen, but choice was removed from us far too quickly.Name and address suppliedIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

The cynicism of these ads – pretending to care while desperately trying to trigger the Pavlovian Christmas shopping response – is truly depressing.Chris LinwardSalfordYour editorial’s claim that the newJohn LewisChristmas ad was “harking back to the 1990s” and evoked “a less complicated time to be a young man” would be news to anyone who remembers that time as the era of laddism and Loaded, and the underlying unease about men’s emotional lives as shown in novels such as Tim Lott’s White City Blue and Nick Hornby’s About a Boy. “Questions of contemporary masculinity and fatherhood” existed back then too.Derrick CameronStoke-on-TrentAfter reading your editorial on the John Lewis Christmas ad, am I the only one to feel uncomfortable that not only are the females in the narrative “shadowy figures in the background” but that their roles are domestic tasks?

By establishing the (alleged) existence of foreign antifa groups, the Trump administration seems to be setting the stage for declaring American antifa groups (and all that they deem to be ‘antifa’) to be affiliated with these supposed foreign terrorist groups.”View image in fullscreenSupporters of AfD take part in a campaign rally in Berlin in February.Photograph: Christian Mang/ReutersThe antifa movement emerged in Germany in the 1920s. But the term is extremely loose and is frequently applied to a variety of leftwing activist groups, whose common denominator is their opposition to fascism.Members of Antifa Ost are accused of attacking a neo-Nazi in Dresden as well as other acts of violence against people perceived as belonging to the far-right scene, including in Hungary, between 2018 and 2023.Six alleged members were charged in Germany in July, and its most prominent member, Maja T, who is non-binary, is being held in custody in Hungary in conditions they have described as inhumane. They face trial in January and have been told they could face up to 23 years in prison.Germany’s BfV domestic intelligence service, which has designated the AfD as a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force, has previously concluded that the antifa “movement” has neither a fixed organisational structure nor any clearly defined hierarchies.The historian Richard Rohrmoser said the name was such a broadbrush term it could be applied not just to “black-clad groups ready for violence” but also to peaceful activist groups from the Anne Frank Center to the White Rose student movement, the Christian-inspired student group that opposed the Nazis in the 1930s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group, which unlike other Italian anarchist movements expresses itself through violence, was founded in December 2003, when it distributed leaflets claiming responsibility for the explosion of two bins close to the home in Bologna of Romano Prodi, who at the time was president of the European Commission. A few weeks later, aparcel bomb exploded inProdi’s hands. He was uninjured.Italy’s security services describe Fai/Fri as a “horizontal” movement made up of autonomous cells united by an insurrectionist-anarchist ideology and which uses armed direct action. Other actions include letter bomb attacks in 2010 on the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome and the 2021 kneecapping ofRoberto Adinolfi, then the chief executive of the nuclear engineering company Ansaldo Nucleare.Mary Bossis, an emiritus professor of international security at the University of Piraeus in Athens, said violence was common on the edges of broad-based social movements. “But that does not mean, as in the case of antifa, that the whole movement is either violent or supportive of terrorism. In fact it is very much not the case … Standing against fascism does not make someone a terrorist.”Greek media reports described the US move as “a dangerous development” at a time when the threat from the right on both sides of the Atlantic was so visibly on the ascendant.After the dismantlement of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, which rose to be Greece’s third biggest party during its near decade-long debt crisis, ultra-nationalist, far-right parties have emerged and been voted into parliament.Explore more on these topicsThe far rightAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)GermanyProtestTrump administrationUS foreign policyEuropeShareReuse this content"

They began to wash up on Camber Sands beach last Thursday, with the situation worsening over the weekend.Environment Agency sources suspect this is one of England’s worst plastic pollution events, with approximately 10 tonnes of beads spilled: the plastic pollution campaign group Strandliners has estimated it is probably about 650m beads.“This is catastrophic,” Sarah Broadbent, who chairs the 1066 Country tourist board, told the meeting attended by hundreds of local people, SouthernWaterrepresentatives, and the area’s MP Helena Dollimore. “We really rely on tourists here, who come for the beach. We will be at the bottom of everybody’s holiday list now.”She and other local people depended on the beach for their happiness and mental health, she said: “The beach is a factor in everyone’s lives here. This is catastrophic for us.”View image in fullscreenWhile it will be impossible to completely remove all of the hundreds of millions of beads, the people at Camber continue to work to find as many as they can.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PARichard Oakes, the local Environment Agency officer, told the meeting he expected the incident could be upgraded to a category 1 pollution event, the most serious kind.He confirmed that the beads had been found along the coast, from Hastings to Dungeness, and also inside Rye Harbour. The harbour nature reserve, a site of special scientific interest, is loved by local people, with its big skies and the salt marshes popular with wading birds, and it had been hoped the beads would not penetrate that far.When Oakes confirmed the beads were being found in the salt marsh there, the people in the room let out a sad sigh. There were whispers of “no”.“What I am really worried about,” said Dollimore, “is when birds start washing up dead on the reserve. I think that will be extremely upsetting.”Anthony Skinner, who runs a kitesurfing company at Camber Sands, is one of the 175 people who have spent days on their hands and knees using sieves, tweezers and dustpans and brushes to try to clean the beach. He and other people turned up to the meeting to get some answers from the water company and the Environment Agency.“I was one of the first on the site,” said Skinner, “I’ve been raking the seaweed to expose the beads underneath. Our beauty spot has been tainted, it will change people’s perception of the coast. We were already dealing with sewage and runoff from the roads, now we have to cope with this pollution too.”View image in fullscreenPlastic beads on the beach at Camber Sands.Photograph: Andrew Aitchison/In Pictures/Getty ImagesHastings and Rye is the most deprived constituency inEast Sussexand heavily relies on its tourist industry. There are also concerns the spill will hit the already struggling fishing industry, as the beads are toxic to marine life. “The fishers are having a hard time already, and now they have these toxic beads to put up with,” said the mayor of Rye, Andy Stuart.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This feels like a double injustice to those dealing with pollution from the company.John Penicud, the managing director of wastewater at Southern Water, told the meeting that the Eastbourne treatment site was old, “built in the year 2000” and that a screen on the tank holding tonnes of plastic beads, which are used to filter sewage water, had broken. He added that five other Southern Water treatment centres used these beads.He said the company was “really sorry” for the spill and committed to paying for the cleanup, but confirmed some of the money for this would come from customer bills. Penicud said it would be paid for with a “mixture of funds” – investment from shareholders and customer bills.He said new treatment sites no longer used the beads, only sites built in the 1990s and 2000s. “In our new plant construction since the early 2000s we don’t use beads any more. We use something called membrane technology.”While it will be impossible to completely remove all of the hundreds of millions of beads, the people at Camber continue to work to find as many as they can. “We are very upset at what’s happened. We feel very strongly about it,” said Dollimore. “I think the incident is probably one of the biggest plastic pollution incidents in this country ever, definitely one of the biggest on the south coast of England in history. And it’s really serious.”This article was amended on 14 November 2025.

They have still to examine 6m WhatsApp-style messages in Mandarin, as well as the full data from a series of computers, phones, USB sticks and memory cards.Police searches of his flat in Greenwich, southLondon, found a phalanx of cameras hidden around his home, including in air fresheners, and one in a packet of female sanitary products.He used his mobile phones to film attacks, ranging from rape to upskirting on the large escalator at London Bridge station and around London’s transport network.He lured women to his home for parties or networking events where he served a cocktail he called Spring of Life, a mix of Chinese herbs and alcohol.Xu would mix some of his cocktail with a date rape drug such as GHB and scopolamine, and give it to his intended victims, rendering them unable to fight him off.One victim, a PhD student who was drugged and assaulted over several hours while Xu filmed her, said she felt everything, but could not fight back because of the drugs.In a statement read to court, she said Xu “stole the person I was” and added: “He has changed me. I feel that I can never go back to who I was.”She said she still struggled to sleep, fearing she could be attacked again, and suffered from anxiety: “I’m not sure how this is ever mended.”Two victims said they feared Xu could take revenge and one said: “He has become a shadow in my heart.”The prosecutor, Catherine Farrelly KC, told the court that one victim told police: “She had no strength to fight him off … she felt like she had lost control of her body, and she could not open her eyes.”Xu pleaded guilty in August to 24 offences against six women. Those offences were four rapes, eight assaults by penetration, four sexual assaults, two counts of drugging women, four counts of voyeurism, and two counts of upskirting.At Woolwich crown court on Friday Judge Grout sentenced Xu to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 13 and a half years before he could be considered for parole, and warned that, as a foreign national offender, he was liable for deportation.Grout said he had concluded Xu “was an incredibly dangerous man”, his offending involving drugs and gaining the confidence of women was “calculated and planned” and that he gained enjoyment from his attacks.The judge said the Home Office might consider deporting Xu.Police say three victims have been identified and others have yet to be, and that at least seven women were sexually assaulted by Xu.After Xu’s guilty plea, more than 10 further voyeurism victims had come forward, with victims of that type of offence numbering in the hundreds, according to police.Det Supt Lewis Sanderson said Xu edited some of the footage he recorded of his attacks into a compilation for his own sexual gratification, and also watched rape pornography and other material so extreme that further criminal charges were being considered.Farrelly told the court: “The evidence shows the defendant to be a bold and persistent sexual predator whose offending had steadily become more and more serious.“He was so emboldened that he was willing to strike anywhere – at his own home address, at his place of work and in train stations, and in respect of anyone: friends, flatmates, colleagues and strangers.“It appears that no woman was safe around him.“His offending was mainly planned in a very careful way. He would use hidden cameras to record unsuspecting victims, whether by concealing them in his bathroom at home or by covertly using his mobile telephone to record what he was doing and, even more concerningly, he would use drugs – most likely GHB – to incapacitate some of his victims so he could then abuse them over the course of hours, recording what he was doing as some sort of token.”The case is similar to that of Zhenhao Zou, who was jailed for attacking 10 women, having drugged and filmed the victims.Police say there is no known link between Xu and Zou.DCS Angela Cragg said: “Although both cases are very similar, we have no reason at all to believe they are connected or linked.”Xu was caught when a woman he drugged and attacked called the police from his flat in June. She had gone there for a networking party, accepted a drink, and then remembered passing in and out of consciousness with Xu on top of her, holding his mobile phone in one hand while repeatedly attacking her.In the morning she demanded he show her what was on his phone. When he refused she called the police.When officers arrived Xu gave them his phone and pin code.Police said if it was not for her brave actions, Xu may still be free and attacking more women.Police say he targeted young women of Chinese heritage, students past and present from two London universities, Greenwich and King’s College.According to officers, friends of Xu said he was generous with his money and offered career advice, with two victims saying they had trusted him and viewed him like a brother.Xu refused to answer police interview questions, answering only to say “no comment” in Mandarin and requiring an interpreter in court. His university PhD in international law was in English.Xu arrived in the UK in 2013 and studied for a masters at Greenwich University, then stayed to work as a partner in a recruitment business. His first known offending in the UK happened in 2021 and it lasted until 2025; it is believed he also offended inChinabefore.Sanderson, said: “Chao Xu is among the most dangerous and prolific sexual offenders we have ever encountered. His crimes were calculated, sustained and devastating, spanning years and leaving unimaginable harm in their wake. Without [the victims’] bravery, Xu’s offending could have continued unchecked.The Met police said anyone who had been a victim or had information should contact them. Reports can be made onlinein English,MandarinorCantonese.Met detectives can be reached via email onoperation.kafka@met.police.ukor on 0207 1753802.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonEnglandRape and sexual assaultViolence against women and girlsChinanewsShareReuse this content"

They include sexual assault of a child under 13, assault of a child under 13 by penetration, eight counts of child cruelty, three counts of making indecent images of children, and four drugs charges.Ruben, from Ruddington in Nottinghamshire, denied one of the sexual offences he was charged with against a nine-year-old boy. Prosecutors have been given two weeks to consider if they will proceed with this charge.The prosecutor Mary Prior KC told the court that Ruben had run a holiday camp for at least 27 years and “there is a long history of children feeling sick at the camp over many years”.She added: “For many years he has played what he calls a sweet game with the children in which he goes into the bedrooms. The game is that each has to eat really sticky sweets as quickly as they can but they must chew them.“Children have always felt ill the next day but he explained it as they were overwrought.”Concerns were raised to police by Ruben’s stepson this year after he discovered baby oil, syringes with white powder and other items in the defendant’s belongings, the court heard.Ruben then went on to play the “sweet game” with six boys on 26 July this year, who were all ill the morning after – with some unable to walk, Prior told the court.She added that he then played the “sweet game” in a room of five children before he was arrested at a nearby pub. Eight children were later taken to hospital and liquid Xanax was found to have been used on some victims.Prior said the drugs had been crushed and injected into sweets which could have damaged the heart or “if we were to look at the worst case scenario, death”.Devices belonging to Ruben were later analysed and he was charged with having 50 category A indecent videos of children – the most serious kind.Prior told the court that Stathern Lodge, the rented premises, was not connected to the camp and Ruben was in charge of the young people there.In a statement after the hearing, Leicestershire police said the owners and operators of the lodge were “not connected to the incident”.Temporary DC I Neil Holden said: “This has been a horrific, complex and emotional investigation involving multiple young, innocent, vulnerable victims and a man who committed the vilest crimes.“Our focus today must of course remain on the young victims and with the support of partners and dedicated family liaison officers, we have and continue to support their welfare and to ensure their safeguarding going forward.”TheNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

He said: “I was completely, completely shocked, but in a very, very positive way when the flying squad showed me the actual artwork.“It’s very hard to put into words, the weight that comes off your shoulders. The way that they dealt with it from the moment they arrived on the scene: pragmatic, logical, very composed and ultimately professional.“But also, to have the artwork recovered after it had been robbed from us is remarkable.”Explore more on these topicsLondonBanksyArt theftArtEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2005, she was working at a small law firm in Mumbai, India whenheavy rainfallflooded the country’s western state of Maharashtra, killing 926 people. Between 1950 and2015, there was a threefoldincreasein extreme rain events in India.It was raining that day, and very windy. I was in my office, and one of my colleagues said he had heard on the radio that the trains would stop very soon because the tracks had become flooded. He said, “Ruchira, why don’t you leave?” He knew that I had two daughters and had to relieve my childcare by 6pm.Immediately, I collected my bag and umbrella and called my husband. I didn’t know what was happening. My colleague advised me not to sit in the ladies’ coach on the train (in Mumbai we have a separate coach for ladies). He said, “You’d better go in the general coach, because if something happens you will have the support of other people there.”View image in fullscreenRuchira Gupta, photographed here in Hong Kong, was caught in the heavy rainfall of 20 years ago that flooded India’s western state of Maharashtra, killing 926 people.Photograph: Billy H.C. Kwok/The GuardianThe station was about 10 minutes from my office. Rain was hitting my body. My umbrella was useless in that wind and rain. A lot of water was already on the road. I remember my lower legs, feet and shoes were wet by the time I reached the station.There were a lot of people, a lot of noise, at Churchgate station; everyone wanted to catch a train and go home. There were public announcements about train services getting affected. I walked on board and sat down in the last train leaving the station. It was crowded and moved very slowly because of the water on the tracks. The roof of the coach was leaking, so we were all sitting with open umbrellas inside the coach. After five or six stations, the train stopped at Bandra, where it was announced that the train would not move further because of the flooding on the tracks.There were still quite a few people at the station. I got out of the train and crossed the bridge, over the platform, to reach the road. It was raining very heavily, and on the bridge you could feel the rain and the wind more. I couldn’t open my eyes. I was not wearing a raincoat. I just had my bag, which I clung tightly to my body to give me some warmth. I was already almost all wet. There were still quite a few people at the station.View image in fullscreenA street near Goregaon that had become flooded during the heavy rains of July 2005.Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesI crossed the bridge, thinking, “What should I do?” Home was still another four to five stations away, and then I would need to take a bus or taxi from the train station. My husband’s office, Bandra Kurla Complex, was in the vicinity, so I called him from a public phone. He said, “My office is closing early. People are scared about the floods. The buses will be leaving soon to take us home. Come to my office and we will go together.”I started walking, hoping to find a taxi or an autorickshaw to take me to his office, but there were none. I continued walking, I don’t remember how far. I reached a big intersection going towards the Bandra Kurla Complex. The rains were very heavy and it was difficult to walk; the water on the roads was ankle-deep. I stopped a truck and told the driver I needed to go to Bandra Kurla Complex. There was a gas station nearby, and he said, “I can drop you there.”From there I started walking towards my husband’s office, across the road. It was a considerable distance because the roads were very broad. The water there was about knee-deep, but I continued walking.Slowly, the water came up to my waist, but I continued walking as if I wasn’t aware. I did not even think about if there were any loose electric wires or open drains in the middle of the road. I just continued walking.Opposite my husband’s office there were cars floating in the water. I felt amused at first; then I felt fear. I reached my husband’s office, where the buses were parked, waiting to take people to their homes. Some buses which had left earlier started to come back. The roads were all flooded, so there was no way they could go further.It was 5 or 6pm already. My daughters were alone at home with the caregiver. A friend of mine lived in another residence complex some distance away from mine. I could not connect to her, but I knew if I sent my daughters to her she would take care of them. But you had to walk up a small slope to reach her place. I told my helper to take the children to my friend’s place. She said there was no way they could, because the water was coming down from the slope at very high speed. They would have drowned in that water.I called the wife of my husband’s colleague, who lived in the same complex. I don’t take favours easily from anyone. But I had no choice; I had to ask for a favour. I asked my helper, “Drop them to this madam’s place”. My oldest was six. My younger one was just three. I spoke with my daughters on the phone. I started crying. My oldest said, “Don’t worry, mama. We’ll be fine. I’ll take care of her.” Then I talked to my youngest. She was like, “No mama, I want you. Mama, come home. When will you come home?” That was very traumatic for me. I was relieved that they would not be alone at home and would be with family. I was praying that my daughters would remain safe. I am a strong believer in prayers.View image in fullscreenAfter areas such as Parel were hit by the heavy rains, cars and trucks floated along the flooded streets as if they were boats.Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesAfter settling my daughters, I was OK. I felt very cold, because I was drenched and there was air conditioning in the office. There used to be a canteen there, so the staff broke open all the cupboards and whatever they could find, they tried to cook. Since food was limited, it was rationed out so that everyone could get something to eat, as we were not aware how long this would last. One spoon of rice, one spoon of dal.We tried to make ourselves comfortable. There was a big hallway. There were some couches there and my husband and I sat on one couch; other people also sat on couches, or went back to their cubicles. The roads were still flooded the next day; no transportation was working. Some people went out and tried to reach home, but came back. There was muddy water everywhere. We were in the office the whole day.My niece called me. She was living with us in Mumbai, interning with a law firm. I did not know whether she was in her office or out somewhere trying to reach home, stuck in the floods. She told me she had slept in the office the first night and then walked home. It took her two to three hours. I told her, “Please get my daughters home and keep them with you. Give them food.”On the third day the rains stopped, but the water was still on the roads. There was no food and I needed my inhaler. I’m asthmatic, and was not carrying my inhaler in my bag. I was having difficulty breathing. There was a hospital just across the road. My husband could not walk in the water, because he had some injury on his foot. He said: “There’s no rain now. See if you can go to the hospital and get medicines from the pharmacy.”Nothing had been done by the civic authorities to clean up the roads. It was allkichir(muddy slush). I managed to reach the hospital. Inside, there were a lot of staff, doctors and nurses. I went to the pharmacy, bought the medicines, and then saw the canteen.About the seriesThis is climate breakdown was put together in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project at University of Victoria, Canada.Read more.Production teamOf course, I was hungry, and I knew there was no more food in the office. I asked if I could also get some food. I said, “I’ve come from this office. I’m hungry and I need to take my medicines, so please can I get some food?” I don’t think I can explain the emotions I went through. I started to cry.I realised the humiliation and the helplessness of begging for food. They were considerate. I got some food from them. I came back to the office and told my husband, “I got food there. I’m glad that there’s one person less for the office to give food to.”That evening it was decided: “Let us venture out and try to go back home.” The people who had cars made carpools. It was decided that my husband and I would travel in two different cars, because even if one car got stuck somewhere or something happened at least one of us would still be safe and could reach home. We did not know what to expect out on the roads. It was very scary. Would we encounter more water? The buses were stuck on the road. There were no lights on the streets. A lot of responsibility was on the driver. Filth and mess was everywhere.I think I reached home first. I was relieved to have made it back safely, for my daughters. There was no electricity, no running water. As Mumbai had a regular electricity supply, we had no candles at home. The water could not be pumped, so we had to carry water up from the ground floor. We were living on the third or fourth floor.View image in fullscreenGupta was left traumatised by her experience, and is afraid to go outside when there are heavy rains.Photograph: Billy H.C. Kwok/The GuardianElectricity was restored one or two days after I reached home. Then the newspapers started coming. The stories were so sad and so scary. People drowned in cars. People left home to bring their children from school and drowned in maintenance holes. Electric wires broke from the poles and fell into the water, so people were electrocuted.For the next year I avoided going to work if it was raining heavily. I was scared of leaving my daughters alone at home again. I’m traumatised. I’m afraid to go out if it rains heavily. I had not realised it until recently. I make it a point that my husband informs me that he has reached office safely and at what point he’s leaving the office. Even small things worry me now.At the time, there was no mention of climate change. Now, when I look back, I know this is the result of climate change. It has been creeping up on us slowly, and now it is there for everyone to realise. Climate change is happening around us. Each one of us has a role in it. The only hope we have is the youth and the children. They’re trying to bring more awareness, to pressurise governments to take positive action.I haven’t seen much change since the floods. Life went on quite like normal after that. I feel sad about it. I feel sad about all the lives that were lost. I feel sorry. No one was willing to take responsibility. I felt we were completely deserted and left to our own fate. People have to take responsibility.This testimonial was produced with the help of theClimate Disaster Project; thanks to Sean Holman, Aldyn Chwelosand Morgan Krakow.Design and development byHarry FischerandPip Lev."

The overall number is smaller this year than at Cop29 in Baku (1,773) and Cop28 in Dubai (2,456), but the proportion is higher this year as the Belém summit is less well-attended.It brings the total number of fossil fuel lobbyists given access to the UN climate summits to 7,000 over the past five years, a period marked by a rise in catastrophic extreme weather, disinformation and oil and gas profits.“Another Cop, same playbook. This is corporate capture, not climate governance,” said Lien Vandamme, senior campaigner on human rights and climate change at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).Another Cop, same playbook. This is corporate capture, not climate governanceLien Vandamme, Center for International Environmental LawThe annual climate talks opened in Belém on Monday, with Brazil’s PresidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvadisavowing disinformation and declaring that it would be the “Cop of truth”.Yet the fossil fuel industry, which has a long history of spreading misinformation and disinformation while blocking meaningful climate action, received almost 60% more passes to Cop30 than the 10 mostclimate-vulnerable nationscombined (1,061), according to analysis by KBPO, an international coalition of 450 organizations.Climate breakdown is escalating. In the lead-up toCop30, hundreds of people were killed after two powerful typhoons wreaked havoc less than a week apart in the Philippines – a country that has been hit by 21 significant storms this year alone. Fossil fuel-affiliated lobbyists outnumber official delegates from the Philippines by nearly 50 to 1, and Iran, where severe drought could force the government to evacuate the capital, Tehran, by 44 to 1.Meanwhile, it is expected to cost Jamaica billions of dollars and years to recover from Hurricane Melissa, a category 5 storm turbocharged by global heating, yet fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered the island nation’s delegation by 40 to 1.In July, the international court of justice (ICJ) ruled that continued fossil fuel expansion, extraction, consumption and subsidies may constitute an internationally wrongful act.“After the ICJ advisory opinion and the well-document six-decade playbook of climate obstruction, states at Cop should recognize the irreconcilable conflict of interest of the fossil fuel industry – which is similar to the tobacco industry,” said Elisa Morgera, the UN special rapporteur for climate change who supports aglobal ban on fossil fuel lobbying.The findings come as 2025 is set to become among the hottest years on record, yet states are failing to regulate polluting corporations and cut subsidies,with nearly $250bn earmarked for new oil and gas projects since Cop29.“From the halls of the UNFCCC to our lands and territories, fossil fuel corporations are wrecking our communities and environment. Yet the red carpet is rolled out for thousands of lobbyists to roam the corridors,” said Nerisha Baldevu from Friends of the Earth Africa.Fossil fuel corporations are wrecking our communities. Yet the red carpet is rolled out for lobbyists to roam the corridorsNerisha Baldevu, Friends of the Earth AfricaThe latest findings will pile further pressure on the UN to ban the fossil fuel industry from the annual climate action summits, where world leaders are supposed to negotiate in good faith and agree on ambitious plans to curtail climate catastrophe.Last week,the Guardian revealed that 57% of all oil and gasproduction last year came from 90 fossil fuel firms that sent substantial numbers of lobbyists to the UN climate talks from 2021 to 2024.A recentinvestigation by Drilled Mediarevealed that oil companies, with the help of the US government, first co-opted the international climate stage in the early 1970s, influencing the eventual drafting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, and every conference of the parties (Cop) to that convention since then.KBPO analyzed the provisional list of participants at Cop30 published by the UNFCCC, identifying delegates representing oil, gas and coal companies, trade groups, financial institutions and others that fund or financially benefit from obstructing climate action to phase out planet-heating fuels.The 1,602 fossil fuel lobbyists identified include 148 with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC); 60 with the International Emissions Trading Association (Ieta), including delegates from oil and gas giants ExxonMobil, BP and TotalEnergies; and 41 with the Brazilian National Confederation of Industry (BNCI).The ICC said only three of the 148 business representatives they accredited are from fossil fuel firms. “We do not represent any one sector. And we pride ourselves in bringing a delegation to COP that represents the full diversity of the business community,” said Andrew Wilson, ICC deputy secretary general.Several big polluters from the global north invited fossil fuel representatives to join their official delegations including France, which brought 22 industry delegates including the CEO of TotalEnergies, and Norway, whose group included six senior executives from its national oil and gas giant Equinor.Overall, only Brazil, with 3,805 delegates, has a bigger presence than oil, gas and coal interests.World still on track for catastrophic 2.6C temperature rise, report findsRead moreBut the true extent of fossil fuel influence is likely to be higher, as more than half of all country delegation members at Cop30 withheld or obscured details of their affiliations, according to a separate analysis by Transparency International. Russia, Tanzania, South Africa and Mexico are among the countries that did not disclose the affiliation of any official delegates.After years of campaigning by civil society groups, Cop delegates were this year required to publicly disclose who was funding their participation – and confirm that their objectives were in alignment with the UNFCCC. But the new transparency requirement excludes anyone in official government delegations or overflows; also, calls forstricter conflict-of-interestprotections to cut industry influence have not been adequately heeded, advocates say.“While local Indigenous peoples struggled to enter the conference, fossil fuel lobbyists walked in freely. My generation deservesJust Transitionpolicies that reflect what people and the planet need, not what polluters’ profits demand,” said Pim Sullivan-Tailyour of the UK Youth Climate Coalition. “The UNFCCC is in need of rehabilitation.”“Fossil fuel companies continue to lead us into a climate abyss. [Yet] for 30 years, climate change summits have been an ideal stage for oil companies to clean up their image, do business and find new ways to get away with environmental crimes,” said Ivonne Yáñez from Acción Ecológica [Ecological Action], a non-profit environmental group in Ecuador where oil drilling is expanding across the Amazon.“Today, instead of transitioning to post-oil societies, they want to extract every last drop of fossil fuels to continue feeding the capitalist system and genocidal wars.”A UNFCCC spokesperson said: “As of 2023, measures have been taken to enhance transparency so that it’s clearer who participates at Cop. We have done this in consultation with civil society and other stakeholders. Just as no single Cop can be expected to solve the climate crisis overnight, making further concrete improvements is an ongoing journey, noting that national governments have sole authority to decide who is in their delegations.”Ieta and the BNCI declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsCop30Oil and gas companiesFossil fuelsBrazilAmericasEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, they set a new target of $300bn (£227bn) a year by 2035.But tracking what really counts under the banner of climate finance has long been fraught – with some experts dubbing it a “wild west” of vague definitions, questionable projects and inflated accounting.According to widely cited analysis from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), rich countries broke their initial promise butbelatedly hit the target thresholdin 2022, when theycommitted $116bn(£88bn). Oxfam, a charity that also tracks the funding but is more critical of how loans are counted, estimates they stumped up just$95.3bn(£72bn) that year – and considers the grant-equivalent value to be less than $35bn (£26.5bn).How much of that money comes from governments, and how much from private finance?Public money makes up more than three-quarters of the funding that developing countries receive for climate projects. Some of it goes straight to recipients as bilateral funding, and some is channeled through multilateral institutions such as the World Bank.On top of that, the donors – 23 developed countries and the EU – also count a handful of other sources, such as export credits and private capital that is mobilised as a result of their investments.A breakdown of where the money from developed nations went in 2022.A breakdown of where the money from developed nations went in 2022.Who are the main recipients for climate finance?Official data reported to the UN is not transparent enough to trace all the flows of money that countries have counted as climate finance, butan analysis by the Guardian and Carbon Briefsuggests that about one-fifth of the public funding in 2022 went to the 44 poorest nations in the world. The group includes some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the climate ccrisis, such as Tuvalu, Chad, Madagascar, Haiti, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Yemen.A much larger chunk of the money went to developing countries, a broader group that includes lower middle-income countries such as India and upper middle-income countries such as China. Even some petrostates, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are among the recipients of billions of dollars of climate finance.And who are the main donors?Two-thirds of the public funding comes from Japan, Germany, the US and France. The growth in bilateral funding by the US in 2021 – under Joe Biden’s government – contributed to reaching the target in 2022. The other main factor was an increase of private investments mobilised by developed nations.Since then,Donald Trump has shut down the USAID agencyand threatened the climate finance contributions of the world’s biggest historical polluter of greenhouse gas. Several other rich donors have also cut their aid budgets.A breakdown of the $116bn provided by developed countries in 2022.The countries that gave the most funding in 2022.Is the money given as grants or loans?Donors don’t just give money as grants. Two-thirds of the climate finance to developing countries is promised in the form of loans. The reliance on debt to finance climate action has been criticised forpiling pressureon to already vulnerable countries, forcing them to spend more of their budgets paying off interest. Some loans also contain strings that force the recipient to hire companies from the donor country.A breakdown of the types of loans and grants provided by developed nations.Most of the money provided are loans, potentially piling more pressure on to developing nations.If it’s given as a loan what kind of terms are placed on it?Some loans are offered at more favourable conditions than a recipient would find on the market. These are known as concessional loans and can help poor countries support projects that would otherwise be out of reach – such as public transport networks or big solar farms and wind parks – without the scarring that regular interest rates can cause.The majority of loans given in 2022 were offered under non-concessional terms.What will the new target be?The $100bn annual target, which was set to run until 2025, is being replaced with a new target for developed countries to provide $300bn each year by 2035.The new annual target – known as the “new collective quantified goal” – also includes a wider goal ofmobilising $1.3tn (£1tn) each year by 2035.This figure is closer to the actual needs of developing countries, but only $300bn of it would come from the budgets of developed countries and institutions such as the World Bank, who stumped up most of the cash for the $100bn target. The bulk of the $1.3tn is instead supposed to come from investment by the private sector.Analysts have raised concerns that such funding is even less transparent and accountable that public finance, though they acknowledge poor countries are unlikely to persuade rich ones to cough up such large sums of money.A graphic showing the difference between 2020-25 funding and 2035 funding.The 2035 target is three times bigger than the current target.And what are the next steps?Climate finance is once again expected to be a sticking point at the annual UN climate negotiations, known as Cop.Last week, the Cop presidencies of Azerbaijan,the host of last year’s summit, and Brazil,which is hosting this year’ssummit, published areportthat explored ways of raising the cash through new taxes on the super-rich, fossil fuels, financial transactions and polluting activities. TheBaku to Belém Roadmapalso highlighted proposals such as swapping outstanding debt for climate action as one way to provide debt relief for cash-strapped governments.The new target has also been seen as an opportunity toreset credibility around climate financeand avoid being described again as the “wild west” owing to lack of transparency and timeliness and inconsistencies in the reporting.The climate finance reporting team are Carmen Aguilar García, Ajit Niranjan, Josh Gabbatiss, Pamela Duncan, Bibi van der ZeeExplore more on these topicsClimate financeCop30Climate crisisOECDFossil fuelsRenewable energyEnergyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Now, he says, his farm will be encircled by three massive containers of ammonia, a desalination plant, a hydrogen plant, gas pipelines and hundreds of wind turbines.“If the ammonia leaks, it will poison everything,” he says. “The noise of the windmills will also upset the animals, and the landscape will be turned into an industrial desert.”We don’t know what megaprojects of this scale will do to the Patagonian ecosystemCarmen Espoz LarraínEuropean and British firms are investing heavily in green hydrogen megaprojects in Chile, which will convert thousands of square kilometres into windfarms, solar parks and industrial infrastructure. More than 50 green hydrogen projects have been announced by companies across the country, primarily in the southern region of Patagonia and the Atacama desert in northern Chile.While the developments may seem positive for the world’s transition to clean energy, they have been criticised by Chilean researchers, environmentalists and community leaders, who say they threaten wildlife and jeopardise the livelihoods of farmers and fishing communities.View image in fullscreenAlfonso Campos in his sheep-shearing shed. The farmer fears local green hydrogen projects could damage his livelihood.Photograph: Grace LivingstoneGreen hydrogenis made by putting an electric current through water. If the electricity used is renewable, the hydrogen gas produced is described as “green”. This hydrogen can be combined with carbon to create e-fuels for cars, ships and aeroplanes.It can also be combined with nitrogen to produce green ammonia, which can be used to manufacture fertilisers, industrial chemicals or explosives, replacing those derived from fossil fuels.Seeking to accelerate its energy transition, the European Unionaims to import 10m tonnesof green hydrogen by 2030 and has identified Chileas a key supplier. The president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, visited Santiago in 2023 to sign a€225m (£192m) agreementto finance green hydrogen projects in Chile. The UK is offering£5bn export creditsfor green hydrogen projects in the country.The Austrian-Danish consortium HNH Energy plans to producemore than 1m tonnesof green ammonia a year in a project near Campos’s farm. A few miles north, a subsidiary of the French conglomerateTotalEnergies is investing $16bn(£12bn) in a vast ammonia complex, complete with a desalination plant, an electrolysis unit, a seaport and more than 600 wind turbines on a sprawling site spanningmore than 720 sq km(278 sq miles).Just across the strait of Magellan, on the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, the British firmsHive and TEG are investing $8bnin a green ammonia plant.View image in fullscreenBritish companies are investing in a green ammonia plant on Tierra del Fuego.Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/GettyThe Spanish-German wind turbine firm Acciona Nordex plans to buildanother green hydrogen planton Tierra del Fuego island.France’s EDFandGermany’s Porscheare also among the companies investing in green-fuel facilities in Chilean Patagonia. All these projects areawaiting approval from the country’s environmental authority.It will bring high-quality jobs and we’ll be making a clean source of energyAlejandro VillegasChile’s government is enthusiastic about the economic prospects. “We face a historic opportunity to create a world-class industry in Chile that adheres to the highest environmental standards and allows us to contribute to the global effort to reduce carbon emissions,” says Álvaro García, minister of energy and economy.“One of the challenges we have set for ourselves is to incentivise local demand for green hydrogen, with the resulting benefits for local communities. But to sustain the industry over time, we also need to become exporters of this energy source.”View image in fullscreenLuis Alvarado estimates that just three projects could create thousands of jobs.Photograph: Grace LivingstoneLuis Alvarado, who heads a hub of small and medium businesses in Magallanes, estimates that if just three projects are approved, 5,000 jobs could be created directly, and tens of thousands more local people will benefit by providing services to the industry.That is also the hope of Alejandro Villegas, who recently lost his job in the gas industry. “It will be great for the region,” he says. “It will bring high-quality jobs and we’ll be making a clean source of energy.”So far, only one company, Highly Innovative Fuels (HIF), is producing green hydrogen in Magallanes, through a pilot project featuring one wind turbine and an electrolysis plant, which produces e-methanol and e-fuel (also known as e-gasoline). Although it is majority owned by Chileans, HIF has several international shareholders, including Porsche, Baker Hughes, EIG and Japan’s Idemitsu. Siemens has supplied the technology.Clara Bowman, HIF’s chief operations officer, says: “The great thing about e-gasoline is that we can start using it today – there’s no need to convert vehicles and you can use existing infrastructure. So we could immediately switch to a climate-friendly fuel.”The company plans to start producing e-methanol commercially in nearby Cabo Negro, though on a smaller scale than many other planned schemes, using only 60 wind turbines. The company says it will not discharge effluent from its desalination, but will instead reuse water and collect the salt. The turbines also haveradar to detect birds.View image in fullscreenHIF has only a pilot green hydrogen project in Magallanes so far. It plans to have 60 wind turbines.Photograph: HIF“We don’t want to overload the ecosystem, so we are taking a phased approach,” says Bowman.Although export-oriented, HIF will also supply the state oil company with e-fuel. But across Chile, 67% of green hydrogen megaprojects are aimed at the export market and 71% are foreign-owned, according to a Guardian analysis.Despite some people’s optimism regarding the economic impact of the green hydrogen boom, researchers, environmentalists and community leaders warn that Chile’s massive commitment to green energy will come at a high environmental cost.Carmen Espoz Larraín, a marine biologist at a research centre in Bahía Lomas in Tierra del Fuego, notes that the waters of the Magellan Strait form a fragile ecosystem, home to many whale species, including orcas, humpback, sei and minke whales, as well as sea lions and dolphins.“Each of these projects has a desalination plant which will discharge water with an extremely high salt content and coagulants back into the sea. This will affect all the marine life, as well as the birds that feed here,” she says.View image in fullscreenCarmen Espoz Larraín is concerned about the effect that desalination plants could have on marine life in Tierra del Fuego.Photograph: Antonio LarreaThe Chilean government aims to produce13% of the world’s green hydrogenjust in the region of Magallanes and Antarctica. Espoz Larraín says that means windfarms and industrial infrastructure would cover 20,000 sq km of land here.“We simply don’t know what megaprojects of this scale will do to the ecosystem of the Patagonian steppes,” she says. “All these green fuels are for export; they won’t benefit us. It’s green colonialism, using Chilean natural resources for a so-called green transition in the global north.”We are a fishing community … We don’t want a dead seabed, bleached white by the saltBrenda GutiérrezRicardo Matus, an ornithologist who manages the Leñadura Bird Rehabilitation Centre in the Magallanes region, says tens of thousands of birds migrate to Patagonia, including the critically endangered Magellanic plover, the red knot and the ruddy-headed goose.His organisation is one of 12 environmental groups that have formed theH2 Citizens Panel of Magallanesto urge the authorities not to rush into large-scale green hydrogen projects.“Windfarms on this scale could decimate the bird population, as they collide with the blades,” Matus says.View image in fullscreenThe critically endangered Magellanic plover is one of the bird species that could be affected by large-scale green hydrogen projects.Photograph: Ricardo MatusIn the arid Antofagasta region of northern Chile, extensive areas will be transformed into solar parks ifmore than 20 planned green hydrogen projectsgain environmental approval. The US company AES, for example, is investing in agreen ammonia complexthat will need three solar farms to supply it with energy, and it is one of green fuel projects planned for the Taltal area.García, the energy minister, says civil society concerns should be considered, but insists: “We have a very robust system of environmental safeguards and have worked diligently to regulate the establishment of this industry, guaranteeing the protection of the environment and ecosystems.”Valentina Durán, director of Chile’s environmental assessment authority, says the government must verify that projects comply with environmental regulations, while also mitigating and compensating for their effects.Mining companies are pumping seawater into the driest place on Earth.

How will the wildlife cope?” she asks.Yet, Gutiérrez says, her community is certain that it will be directly affected by the desalination plants discharging effluents along the Taltal coast. “We are a fishing community.

On the one hand, it’s no secret that I, all the senior editors and many of our writers had concerns about this bid.“On the other hand, it’s also obvious that this process has gone on far, far too long. The Telegraph deserves owners who care about journalism and who will invest. We will do our best to ensure this process ends as soon as possible – with a buyer who shares our passion and our ambition for The Telegraph.”RedBird Capital had been the only prospective buyer willing to structure a deal at the £500m value desired by the consortium RedBird IMI – a joint venture between RedBird and the UAE’s International Media Investments (IMI) – whichtook control of TMG in 2023by providing a loan to pay its former owners, the Barclay family, unpaid debts to Lloyds bank.RedBird IMI wasforced to put the papers up for salein April last year after the government legislated against foreign state ownership of UK newspaper assets. IMI is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and the owner of Manchester City FC.RedBird Capital had put together a deal that would have led to IMI retaining a 15% stake, after Labour eased the ban on foreign governments owning stakes in UK newspapers, and the owner of the Daily Mail and the billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, with each likely to hold about a 10% stake.The potential sale,agreed in principle in May, was thrown into doubt last month when the Telegraph newspaper itself linked its presumed new owner to the suspected ringleader of an alleged Chinese spy ring in Westminster.The Daily Telegraphpublished a 2024 photographof the chair of RedBird Capital, John Thornton, shaking hands with Cai Qi, a senior member of the Chinese Communist party’s ruling politburo, raising questions as to whether the British title was being lined up as a conduit for China to exert influence.Cai has been described as the top lieutenant of China’s president, Xi Jinping, andhas been revealedas the suspected recipient of intelligence about British politics that formed part of thecollapsed Chinese spying prosecution.In August, a group of nine human rights and freedom of expression organisationswrote to Nandy, urging her to halt the proposed RedBird Capital takeover and investigate the US private equity company’s ties to China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But 10 years ago, when more than a million people arrived inEuropefleeing conflict and repression, largely from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Eritrea, the Danish government dramatically changed the rules.Since then, temporary residence permits have only been granted for one to two years at a time and there is no longer any guarantee of getting a permanent visa. In order to gain permanent status, refugees have to be fluent in Danish and are also required to have had a full-time job for several years.“It’s about the attitude and feeling of being here as a visitor on a temporary basis. You don’t know where your future is going to be,” saidMichala Clante Bendixen, who runs the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark and is Denmark’s country coordinator for the European Commission’s Migrant Integration Hub.“Even a speeding ticket can push that permanent stay many years into the future.”Denmark’s immigration policies have come into renewed focus after it emerged Britain’s Labour governmentwas seeking to emulate their approachin an attempt to make the UK a less attractive destination for people seeking asylum.Despite attracting criticism from the UN and human rights organisations, the restrictions – among the harshest in Europe – appear to have had the effect politicians were hoping for.In 2014, a total of 14,792 asylum seekers arrived in Denmark, with the largest numbers coming from Syria and Eritrea. By 2021, that figure had dropped to 2,099 and in 2024 it was 2,333. Of nearly 100,000 residence permits that were granted in Denmark last year, just 1% were recorded as going to refugees. The 99% included 9,623 refugees from Ukraine, who are categorised separately, migrants from other parts of the European Economic Area, family reunification and people on work and study permits.View image in fullscreenPolice in Padborg escort a family from Syria seeking asylum in Denmark after finding them among passengers on a train arriving from Germany in January 2016.Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesBut the reduction has come at a cost, critics say, to Denmark’s reputation and sense of self. The incorporation of populist rightwing ideas into nominally centre-left politics have, they suggest, eaten away at some of the ideals that Denmark is internationally best known for.“The argument against it is that you get extremism in the centre – you have no strong position from which you can legitimise human rights and protection of minorities,” said Rune Lykkeberg, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Information.When Denmark’s Social Democratic prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, came to power in 2019, toppling the centre-right government amid a collapse in support for the far-right Danish People’s party (DPP) and the Liberal Alliance, she said she wanted to cut the number of asylum seekers in Denmark to zero.The path had been laid for Frederiksen by her predecessor, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who was then leader of the centre-right Venstre party and is now the foreign minister. The 2015 change to temporary residence permits came under his watch, as did the “paradigm shift” of 2019, a series of rules that focused official efforts and rhetoric on repatriation rather than integration.View image in fullscreenMette Frederiksen came to power with a promise to cut the number of people seeking asylum in Denmark to zero.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesSix years later, Frederiksen is still in office as a centre-left leader who has capitalised on an uncompromising approach to migration and doubled down on the idea that Denmark is no place for refugees. “What Denmark has been doing is a policy of deterrence, scaring people from choosing Denmark,” said Bendixen.Denmark has regularly attracted criticism from the UN high commissioner for refugees about its asylum practices, but many of its integration policies have also attracted international criticism.Most controversial is the so-called law against “ghettoes” (now known as “parallel societies”), which allows the state to demolish apartment blocks in areas where at least half of residents have a “non-western” background. In February, a senior adviser to the EU’s top court found thatthe law constitutes direct discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin.The criticism has done nothing, however, to shift the political agenda; in fact, lately, domestic debate has become more extreme. The far-right DPP, which is not in government but has seen an increase in support, is calling for “remigration” – the mass deportation of people with immigrant backgrounds living in Denmark.Eva Singer, the director of asylum and refugee rights at the Danish Refugee Council, said it was politicians, not the public, driving anti-immigrant sentiment: “The politicians say they follow the popular mood, but maybe the popular mood is coming from what the politicians are saying, which is not based on fact.”Next year’s general elections could give a clue as to whether or not the Social Democrats’ approach is still popular with voters. Immigration is likely to be one of many hot-button issues. Others include Donald Trump’s threats to Greenland, a former Danish colony that remains part of the Danish commonwealth, upheaval at two of Denmark’s biggest companies and the threat of hybrid war from Russia.Lykkeberg said the Social Democrats’ handling of immigration followed a Danish playbook dating back more than half a century. “The politicsof it is part of what you could call the Danish model: you don’t try to burn the so-called populists, you try to steal their fire. You keep the so-called extremists from the centre of power and thus defend the old political order.”View image in fullscreenBanners reading ‘no to forced relocation’ and ‘our homes are not for sale’ at the Mjølnerparken estate in Copenhagen, which has been classified by the government as a ‘ghetto’.Photograph: Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty ImagesThe reality on the ground, critics say, is the government’s hardline policies are often contradictory. “We hear from municipalities it is quite frustrating that, on one hand, they have to tell refugees everything they need to do to integrate and at the same time hare to remind them how temporary this is. They run counter to each other,” said Singer.The temporary nature of refugee status is “poison for integration”, said Bendixen, because it does not give people time to change their language career and establish their lives in a new country.Martin Lidegaard, the leader of the Social Liberal party and Denmark’s former foreign minister, believes some elements of the country’s integration policies, such as helping new arrivals to access education and find work and “ensure they will be a full member of Danish society”, are worth imitating. “Other parts of our politics I am not so proud of,” he said.As their populations age, all European countries, the UK included, are facing a growing dilemma, Lidegaard added: “We lack labour; we lack people. Because we get fewer children, our fertility is declining. Our economy and our labour market desperately needs some immigration. On the other hand, it is clear we have populist rightwing parties who want to fight against it and people coming to countries with different ethnic backgrounds.“All of us need to balance this in a clever way. No one can afford to walk into the future without labour.”The Danish ministry of immigration and integration declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsMigrationImmigration and asylumEuropeDenmarkEuropean UnionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Information about 111 individuals is included. They are not named but their referees are, sometimes with mobile numbers and personal email addresses. It was not immediately clear how long the data had been circulating online.Max Kohler, a 29-year-old computer programmer, discovered his data appeared in the leak on Thursday after one of the referees on his application was emailed by a stranger who had seen the data dump online.Kohler found that it included his last salary, the name of his current employer, and names, emails and addresses of his other referees, as well as lengthy answers he had given to job application questions.“It’s very disappointing and disillusioning,” he said. “You spend time putting in all this sensitive information, salaries from previous jobs, home addresses, and they don’t take care of this information, and have it floating around in public.“They should take it down, apologise and there should be a report into how this happened and what they are going to do to ensure it does not happen again. It must be mistrained staff or process error.”The number of data security incidents reported to the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)continues to rise. In 2022 there were just over 2,000 incidents reported per quarter; that has increased to more than 3,200 between April and June this year.Kate Brimsted, a partner at the law firm Shoosmiths and an expert in data privacy, information law and cyber security, said: “A breach doesn’t have to be deliberate, and while the ransomware attacks get the headlines, the majority of breaches today are through error.

Genetic analysis shows it is a descendant of a strain that this year fuelled Australia’s worst flu season on record. The country recorded more than 400,000 lab-confirmed cases, with low vaccination rates compounding the problem.The mutated virus, which changed through a natural process called antigenic drift, has swiftly become the dominant strain in the UK, triggering the start of the flu season more than a month earlier than usual.UK flu graphicDr Claire Beynon, the executive director of public health for Cardiff and Vale university health board, said: “We are seeing a rapid and early increase in influenza this winter and are expecting to see an increase in hospital admissions.”A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said flu numbers across its sites were normal for the time of year, but that it was implementing efforts to relieve pressure on hospitals “at pace”.Flu cases surge every winter, but health officials fear this season could be particularly severe if the new mutations in the dominant strain help it to evade people’s immune defences.The virus is a subtype of influenza called H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness than other subtypes in circulation, particularly in older people. The mutations may boost the virus’s transmissibility. It is too early to know if they make infections more severe.In a normal flu season, the R value, which is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, is around 1.1 to 1.2. This season it is thought to be 1.4, meaning every 100 people with flu are expected to infect a further 140.“Whenever there is an early start to the season, there tends to be a bigger peak,” said Antonia Ho, a professor in infectious diseases at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. One reason is that fewer people have been vaccinated when they come into contact with the virus.On Thursday, the UKHealthSecurity Agency (UKHSA) said flu cases continued to increase overall, despite a temporary slowing due to the school half-term break. Infections are highest in children but are creeping up in older people. Health officials expect the numbers to rise further as colder weather drives more mixing indoors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In England, vaccine effectiveness against hospital attendance and admissions is within normal range so far at 70-75% in children and 30-40% in adults.While H3N2 can cause severe flu seasons, it is not inevitable. In 2003-24, the season started early with a drifted H3N2 strain. It led to12,000 flu deaths in England and Wales, at the lower end of the typical range.Ho urged all who are eligible to take up the vaccine offer and encouraged others to consider paying for the shot and using lateral flow tests to check for flu infections. According to the UKHSA, less than a third of people with one or more long-term health conditions have come forward for the vaccine.Ed Hutchinson, a professor of molecular and cellular virology at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said it was “quite plausible” the UK was on course for its most severe flu season in a decade.“This has the potential to mean large numbers of people needing hospital treatment, particularly people in at-risk groups, notably older adults, but also people with underlying conditions, pregnant women, and very young children,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHealthFluNHSVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.The deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies that totaled about $50bn.It could close a long chapter – and maybe the entire book – on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl, to which people who had become dependent on the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin turned when their pill supply was restricted or cut off.Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in US history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue that wastentatively agreedto this January.Purdue filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.Mike Quinn, a lawyer working with the plaintiffs, said on Friday: “This case never should have been in bankruptcy it should have been in criminal court.”The judge has pledged to release details of the deal on Tuesday. There is expected to be more scope in this deal than in the one rejected by the supreme court for people to sue members of the Sackler family personally over their role in Purdue and the crisis.“I think people will try to sue,” Quinn said. He was closely involved in opposing the Purdue-Sackler bankruptcy deal, working with Pain, an activist group fronted by the American art photographer and activistNan Goldin, who leddirect action protestsat international art museums that had accepted donations and sponsorship in the form of Sackler billions.Some of the Sackler family owning the privately held Purdue, which now-deceased members of the family grew into a specialist in pain treatment in the early 1990s, became famous philanthropists using the huge profits that their star drug OxyContin generated.But their reputationtook a divewhen investigative journalism and activism exposed the company’s expansionist drive toincrease prescriptionsof the opioid despite growing addiction and deaths across the US.Mike Moore, the former Mississippi attorney general, who helped secure the US’sbig tobacco settlementand the $20bnsettlementagainst BP for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, has been a key figure for plaintiffs in the sprawling opioids litigation against Purdue in the US. He said about Friday’s news: “I’m happy that they have finally come to a conclusion after years and years of wrangling. We should have gotten this done a long time ago, but it is what it is, it’s not what we wanted when we started this.”Moore began legal action against Purdue 20 years ago. In a telephone interview with the Guardian on Friday, he criticized the Sackler family for spending so much time and money fighting the litigation and then Purdue taking the bankruptcy route. Othersin the industrycame to settlements more quickly.“When I first sat down with the Sacklers and the lawyers for Purdue we thought we could get a resolution … and the money would have been paid out five years ago, but they decided to go into bankruptcy … Purdue were the worst of the worst of all the culprits,” Moore said.“I’m glad it’s over,” he added.Lane, during a hearing in White Plains, New York, on Friday indicated he plans to sign off on Purdue’schapter 11 plan.“The plan is the product of intense work with our creditors through a singular, shared focus on delivering as much value as possible to meaningfully address the opioid crisis,” Steve Miller, Purdue’s board chairman, said in a statement.Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 while facing more than 2,600 lawsuits by states, local governments and others accusing it of contributing to the deadly opioid abuse epidemic through its marketing and sale of OxyContin and other pain medications.Purdue’s creditors include state and local governments, individuals who became addicted to OxyContin, hospitals and others who were harmed by the opioid crisis.Members of the Sackler family have expressed regret for their company’s role in the opioid addiction epidemic, but deny wrongdoing.Purdue will be converted into a non-profit called Knoa Pharma, focusing on developing and distributing opioid overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsPharmaceuticals industryUS justice systemLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

She described the impact of the war, losing close relatives and witnessing the aftermath of bombing first hand. She wrote about her family’sreturn to her birthplacein Beit Lahia, to find their home in ruins and their orchard destroyed. “My memories are crushed and buried,” she wrote.In October, Tantesh published an article looking back on two years of war, which took the people of Gaza through a “gateway to hell”. There were times, she wrote, when the surviving members of her family envied the dead.View image in fullscreenTantesh and her father Amjed return to the rubble of their home in northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianAccording to the UN, at least 248 journalists had been killed in Gaza by September, more than in any other conflict in modern times. There have been repeated allegations that Israel was deliberately targeting journalists. Israel has denied the charge, while claiming that some of the journalists its forces killed had been Hamas operatives.Receiving the award on Wednesday, Tantesh thanked her parents for “raising me to be the person who I am now”.“They are still there in Gaza, suffering what I was suffering during the past months,” she said, and went on to thank her sister Enas, who worked alongside her as a photographer in Gaza, and her cousin Seham, who has now taken up her positionas correspondent. They had stood with her throughout her time working in Gaza, she said.Tantesh also acknowledged the support of her editors and colleagues at the Guardian and “all the people who have stood with me all the way”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Soon afterwards the whine of Shahed drones could be heard in the sky, with heavy machine-gun fire from Ukrainian air defences.View image in fullscreenPeople shelter in the underground during the overnight strikes on Kyiv.Photograph: Maksym Kishka/Frontliner/Getty ImagesUkraine’s president said the country was hit by 430 drones and 18 missiles. The dead were at home in a block of flats on Kyiv’s left bank when it was hit. Dozens of other buildings were damaged, including the Azerbaijani embassy, which was struck by falling debris.“It was scary. Our windows shook. I thought: ‘Oh God, this is the end,” Bruce Avalord, an American longtime resident, said, speaking outside a wrecked multistorey residential compound. A drone careered into its upper levels at 3am, witnesses said, exploding in a fireball.On Friday, a bulldozer scooped up glass and bricks which had fallen on the pavement in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Owners checked over broken cars. “There are no military targets here, just civilians,” Avalord said. “The Russians want people to beg the government to capitulate. The tactic won’t work; Ukrainians are resilient.”View image in fullscreenRescuers cleaning up rubble and debris from a damaged block of flats.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesAnother resident, Valentina, said she threw on her clothes and hid in her ninth-floor corridor next to the lift, staying there until dawn. “The explosions woke me up. It was very loud. There were booms everywhere. I was messaging friends to see if they were OK,” she recalled.Zelenskyy called onEuropeand the US to supply additional air defence systems and to impose further sanctions on Russia’s oil industry. He said Ukraine was taking its own measures to prevent attacks by hitting Russian energy targets using home-produced deep-strike missiles.He disclosed that “Long Neptune” missiles had been used for the first time, after a successful Ukrainian aerial operation on the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, an important oil export facility. He called the attack “our entirely just response to Russia’s ongoing terror”.During his last trip to the White House, in October, Zelenskyy asked Donald Trump for long-range Tomahawk missiles.Speaking to the Guardian last weekhe said that, contrary to reports, the meeting was a success. So far, though, the US president has refused to provide the weapons, amid warnings from the Kremlin of retaliation.Oleksandra Matviichuk, Ukraine’s Nobel peace prize laureate, called on EU countries to use their air power to defend Ukraine’s vulnerable skies. She said Trump needed to deliver Tomahawks in order to stop enemy missiles before they were launched from Russian military airfields.“Our house shook the whole night, but my family is alive,” Matviichuk said. “Trump promised that when he becomes president, he will end the Russian war against Ukraine. Putin is demonstratively obstructing all his efforts even simply to cease fire.“Now it is also Trump’s war. If he does not show strength, he will go down in history as a weak president,” she wrote on social media.Ukraine’s prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said Friday’s bombardment was “unprecedented”. She said about 30 residential buildings were targeted, five people were taken to hospital, including a pregnant woman, and several children were hurt.There was widespread international condemnation. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorious, said Vladimir Putin had shown “contempt for humanity”.The EU invited Ukraine to join the club, but will it ever happen?Read moreRussia has upgraded its Iranian-designed kamikaze drones so they travel faster and are harder to shoot down.

The explosion took placeoutside one of India’s most significant monumentsduring rush hour on Monday evening.Initially, eight people were confirmed dead, but the figure had risen to 13 by Friday as more victims succumbed to their injuries. It is one of the deadliest terror attacks to target India’s capital in more than a decade.Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, described the incident as a “conspiracy”, while his home minister, Amit Shah, vowed to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.Adding to the febrile atmosphere, at least seven people were killed and 27 injured on Friday night after an explosion at a police station in Srinagar, Kashmir’s main city. According to local media, a large pile of confiscated explosives detonated, killing police officers and members of the forensics team.The authorities have yet to make any formal announcement about who they believe to be behind theDelhiattack. Unofficially, however, Indian investigators have said inquiries are continuing into “an interstate and transnational terror module” that was targeted by the police in the days before the explosion.An investigation into the group began last month, after posters promoting the Pakistan-backed armed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad appeared in Srinagar. The region has long been disputed by India andPakistan, and since the 1990s the Indian-controlled south has faced a militant insurgency backed by Pakistan.Seven people were arrested as a result of the inquiries, including two Kashmiri doctors working in other Indian states. During a raid of one of the doctors’ homes in the city of Faridabad, in Haryana state, police said they had uncovered 2,900kg of explosive materials as well as chemicals, detonators and assault rifles, which they now believe were being readied for a multi-target attack.‘People were screaming for help’: Delhi car blast witnesses describe scenes of horrorRead moreThough they have yet to directly link the group to the Delhi blast, police have described the network as a “white-collar ecosystem involving radicalised professionals and students in contact with foreign handlers operating from Pakistan and other countries”.The day after the arrests, a white Hyundai car travelled from Haryana to central Delhi. After some time waiting in a car park in the bustling old quarter of the city, the driver pulled out into busy Monday evening traffic. Shortly after, the car exploded with huge force, throwing bodies into the air and setting surrounding cars and rickshaws alight.On Tuesday, a case was registered under India’s anti-terror laws and the investigation was taken over by India’s National Investigation Agency, which oversees terror cases. Police in Kashmir have since ramped up their raids and arrests across the region.Investigators have alleged that the car was being driven by another Kashmiri doctor from the village of Koil, 20 miles south of Srinagar. One of the doctors arrested the day before was also from Koil, and both were working at the same medical college in Faridabad.People in Koil described both men as accomplished doctors known for their impressive academic records, and expressed shock at the allegations against them. Their two families denied knowing one another.Police arrived at the home of the alleged driver just hours after the blast, searching the premises, confiscating all mobile phones and detaining several family members for questioning. Despite not formally confirming the doctor’s involvement, by Friday morning the authorities had demolished his home in an apparent case of “bulldozer justice” – a widespread but illegal tactic used by the Indian authorities to punish those accused of crimes against the state.View image in fullscreenThe remains of the alleged driver’s house, seemingly destroyed by ‘bulldozer justice’.Photograph: Farooq Khan/EPAAccording to Kashmir police, the seven people previously arrested in the terror network case had links with both Jaish-e-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an Islamic State affiliate operating in Kashmir. This could not be verified by the Guardian.India’s response to the Delhi blast has been markedly restrained in contrast to the last terror attack that took place on its soil. When more than 20 Hindu tourists were shot dead in Pahalgam, Kashmir, in April, the Indian government blamed Pakistan and launched cross-border drone and missile strikes. Pakistan responded in kind,pushing the two countries to the brink of all-out war.In the aftermath, the Indian government firmly stated that any more Pakistani terror attacks would be seen as an “act of war”. However, the more restrained language used this week by Modi’s cabinet is seen by some to reflect uncertainty over who may have been behind the latest attack and the alleged wider terror plot.Police in Kashmir said they remained “on high alert to prevent further incidents”. A senior officer added: “Multiple agencies have conducted raids to disrupt terrorist activities. Investigation is ongoing, and we are monitoring all suspicious activity closely.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaDelhiKashmirSouth and central AsiaPakistanNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

They come after a string of victories for Democrats in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, where affordability was a key topic.Earlier Friday, the president had claimed onTruth Socialthat “costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down”.Trump toldCBS’s 60 Minutesthis month that: “We have no inflation. We have no inflation. Biden had inflation, and he didn’t have tariffs.”In afactsheet, the White House said Trump was “strengthening the US economy and national security by modifying the scope of the reciprocal tariffs” and that “given the substantial progress in reciprocal trade negotiations” it was now “necessary and appropriate to further modify the scope of the reciprocal tariffs”.Trump accused of caving to big business after deal to cut Swiss tariffs to 15%Read moreTrump upended the global trading system earlier this year by imposing a 10% base tariffs on imports from every country, plus additional specific duties that vary from state to state.Friday’s orders followed theannouncementof a deal to cutUS tariffsonSwitzerlandfrom 39% to 15% as part of a new trade pact and framework trade deals announced on Thursday that will eliminate tariffs on certain foods and other items imported from Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador, once those deals are finalized, with US officials eyeing additional deals for signing before year’s end.Trump has increasingly focused on the issue of affordability in recent weeks, while insisting that any higher costs were triggered by policies enacted by Joe Biden, and not his own tariff policies.Consumers have remained frustrated over high grocery prices, which economists say have been fueled in part by import tariffs and could rise further next year as companies start passing on the full brunt of the import duties.According to aHarris pollconducted for the Guardian last month a clear majority of Americans say their monthly costs have risen by between $100 and $749.The top Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, said the Trump administration was “putting out a fire that they started and claiming it as progress”.“The Trump administration is finally admitting publicly what we’ve all known from the start: Trump’s trade war is hiking costs on people,” Neal said in a statement.“Since implementing these tariffs, inflation has increased and manufacturing has contracted month after month.”Reuters contributed to this story.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Thames Water’s effective owners haveasked for 15 years of leniencyfrom environmental fines from the government to try to recover.There are no good options at Thames Water. But temporary renationalisation is cleanerRead moreMaynard was granted unusual permission to represent the public interest in a court battle over an investor bailout for Thames Water. Thebailout was approved, but Maynard appealed, arguing that the company, which serves 16 million customers in London and south-east England, should be taken into temporary government control.Thames Water’s barristers argued that he should be made personally liable for its expensive legal fees to “deter” future appeals to the supreme court.The utility’s lenders, led by a group of hedge funds including the combative American firms Elliott Investment Management and Silver Point Capital, haveeffectively taken over the business. The lenders, who together manage assets in the billions of pounds, also backed Thames Water’s decision to pursue Maynard for costs.Maynard said he was relieved after facing the prospect of a ruinous bill, but that he believed Thames Water had carried out an act of retribution for arguing that the company should beput into a special administration regime (SAR)in the interests of billpayers who have no choice but to pay it for its services.“I find it completely extraordinary,” he said. “What is the largest water company in the country doing trying to run an MP off the road, and saying they want to deter me and others from taking such actions?“What is the government doing letting a bunch of people run the largest water utility in the country and behave this way?”Cat Hobbs, the director of the campaign group We Own It, said Thames Water “wanted to silence debate about their state-sanctioned rip off – trying to punish the one MP who had the bravery to take them to court”.She added: “This absolutely disgusting behaviour from Thames Water is the strongest evidence yet of why the government must urgently take it into special administration right now. It’s truly chilling that Thames Water openly admitted it wanted to discourage future attempts to stand up for billpayers.”In legal submissions seen by the Guardian, Thames Water argued there was “no reason at all” that Maynard should not pay its costs for the appeal to the supreme court, saying he was “given a full opportunity to ventilate his concerns” in the lower courts.The company said: “In light of the application’s lack of merit, the court is invited to infer that Mr Maynard made his application to try and disrupt the implementation of the plan and the subsequent restructuring in pursuit of his and his party’s political aim that Thames Water should be placed in special administration. This kind of conduct should be deterred.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said the arguments were made on points of law in response to Maynard’s own submissions.The costs claimed by Thames Water were not detailed. However, a statement of costs for the previous stage at the court of appeal, seen by the Guardian, detailed £2.3m in legal fees incurred by Thames Water. The huge bill – a small fraction of the total cost of the case – included fees of up to £1,400 per hour for partners of Linklaters, Thames Water’s solicitors, and a cumulative £812,000 for 141 hours’ work on the appeal alone from Tom Smith KC, Charlotte Cooke and Andrew Shaw, all barristers at South Square chambers.Any costs imposed on Maynard would have been very large for a single person to bear, but they are dwarfed by Thames Water’sspending of up to £15m a monthon an army of lawyers, bankers, consultants and public relations advisers.A Thames Water spokesperson said “Mr Maynard was able to make submissions at both the high court and court of appeal without any liability for costs” and that all parties had to pay their own costs.“We remain focused on putting Thames Water on to a more stable financial foundation as we seek a long-term solution to our financial resilience,” the spokesperson added.A spokesperson for Thames Water’s lenders said “no costs were pursued against Mr Maynard” in respect of the lenders’ legal fees. The spokesperson added: “An SAR will delay the complex turnaround and see taxpayers bear the risk and the billions of pounds it will cost to fix Thames Water, diverting limited funds from public sector spending priorities.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterWater industryEnglandLondonLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is: the subject of these 176 pages is a three-month period in 1985 when Fox was simultaneously shooting his breakout sitcom role in Family Tiesand the career-defining American classic, Back to the Future.That’s two more-than-full-time jobs for one little guy, necessitating that the then 23-year-old actor work 20-hour days, six days a week. This schedule was only possible because the mid-1980s was a time before showbiz labour laws caught up with basic human decency. These days, we’re told, a standard contract “demands two weeks of buffer time on either side of a job”, while Fox didn’t even get an hour.How did he do it? This book tells us, drawing on the memories of colleagues and friends to fill in details where Fox’s own sleep-deprived brain falls short. The material might have seemed stretched thin to fill even this relatively slim volume, were it not for the fact Fox was also a singularly unlikely – and therefore fascinating – movie star prospect. Working-class, 5ft 4in and Canadian; that this short king ever made it so big is a natural-law-defying miracle, on a par with time travel itself.Or maybe not. Fox writes that, initially at least, his height was a significant career advantage. It meant theFamily Ties producers could secure him a US work visa on the grounds that “I was special and unique in America: old enough to work the long hours of an adult, but with a look that allowed me to play a much younger character”.His wayward adolescence, spent kicking about in suburban Toronto parking lots, had also furnished Fox with a skillset ideally suited to playing Back to the Future’shoverboarding, bully-outsmarting, rock-n-roll-inventing hero, Marty. He arrived for his first day already a proficient skateboarder (pro-skateboarding legend Tony Hawk is apparently a fan of the movie) and garage-band guitarist.He arrived for his first day already a proficient skateboarder and garage-band guitaristBut perhaps Fox’s most valuable skill was his tireless professionalism. Full-colour set photos seem to corroborate the actor’s own claims that he “never complained about the hours” and was “full of joy, even at 3.00 am”. The most persuasive evidence of this, however, is the thoughtful, affectionate way he reflects on his interactions with on-set colleagues, even when it’s clear these relationships were far from frictionless.‘I hate it. It sucks. But it didn’t defeat me’: Michael J Fox on pity, Parkinson’s – and a potential cureRead moreThe circumstances of Fox’s arrival on Back to the Future were already awkward. He was replacing the previous “Marty”, actor Eric Stoltz, a month into shooting, after director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg became convinced he wasn’t the “right fit”. Add to that the showbiz hierarchy of the day, which placed a lowly TV star several rungs beneath trained theatre actors such as Christopher Lloyd, who played “Doc”, and Fox had his work cut out for him. Perhaps it was the knowledge that he’d already pulled off one impossible task – making it to Hollywood in the first place – which gave him the confidence to attempt another.Back to the Futuresuper-fans are predictably well served here, with titbits like the fact that no one on set thought the DeLorean was at all cool (“Let’s face it – it’s a shit car. Slow to accelerate, with cheap appointments”), and the shift of Marty’s “Johnny B Goode” to B rather than B-flat, the 80s kid taking inspiration from Jimi Hendrix’s transposed cover, despite it being 1955. Fox’s evocative descriptions of a lost Hollywood – pre-word processor, never mind pre-internet – will also interest a more general readership.We wouldn’t care at all, were it not for the fact that Back to the Future really is the enduring classic this book assumes it to be. Much high-minded critical musing over the past 40 years has tackled the question of why, but nothing quite nails it like the handwritten audience response card that Zemeckis received after the very first screening, and apparently still has pinned to his office bulletin board: “This is the most Godly movie I’ve seen,” wrote the awestruck, anonymous viewer. “It fucking rages up and down.” Amen to that.Future Boy: Back to the Future and My Journey Through the Space-Time Continuum by Michael J Fox and Nelle Fortenberry is published by Headline (£22).

But even though she has also recorded this material for her recent albumElemental, Bridgewater is not really in the mood. “I just don’t feel like it’s the time to be doing love songs and whimsical songs from the 1920s and 30s,” she says. “They’re beautiful, but there’s some kind of spirit and energy pushing me to sing songs saying: people, we have to protect our democracy.”Bridgewater is one of American jazz’s foremost voices. Capable of crooning and confronting, the two-time Grammy winner has a career that spans six decades and has never stopped evolving. She cut her teeth sharing the stage with several of jazz’s greatest band leaders – Sonny Rollins, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon – before branching out into acting; singing pop and disco; and working out of France, the UK and Mali, always with a determination to create on her own terms.At 75, an age where some singers may be content with gently reheating their earlier success, she emanates energy, idealism and splenetic anger. “I’m too old and I’ve been through too much,” she says. “I’m a product of the 1960s; I supported the Black Panther party and their community projects. Even now I deal with racism daily – every day there is something that somebody does which is racist. Even my kids don’t understand it. I cannot just sit back and be silent. I have to raise my voice.”It will be heard at this week’s London jazz festival, where Bridgewater is backed by We Exist!, an all-female band she founded to promote women in jazz. “I got tired of hearing jazz musicians saying the same old chauvinistic crap and keeping women out,” she says. “I decided to put together an all-female band as a statement that the jazz world is still very macho.”View image in fullscreenDee Dee Bridgewater performing in Milan, 2024.Photograph: Sergione Infuso/Corbis/Getty ImagesBridgewater also established the Woodshed Network, now overseen by her daughter and manager Tulani, with the aim of providing female jazz musicians with “all the things they need to learn to help get their careers off the ground”. The Woodshed Network sits within the Kennedy Center, the Washington DC-based institution that is regarded as the national cultural centre of the US, and which has now beentaken over by Donald Trump and his Maga acolytes. “Considering what he’s doing to the Kennedy Center, I’m unsure if [the Woodshed Network] will continue for too much longer.”Bridgewater doesn’t mention Trump by name during our 90-minute conversation, only saying “he”, her distaste evident as she spits out the syllable. She now performs songs that reflect her fury: the likes of Billy Taylor’s civil rights anthem I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free, Gene McDaniels’ Compared to What, Donny Hathaway’s Tryin’ Times and Bob Dylan’s barbed Gotta Serve Somebody.“I couldn’t go to aNo Kingsprotest, but I do protest songs with the We Exist! band,” she says. “The programme I am doing now started out of the war in Gaza – I watched the news and thought: I am witnessing the beginning of a genocide. I guess I have what you might call a spiritual voice which sometimes speaks to me very loudly. I was sitting in my living room watching the news and crying and this voice said to me: put it in music, let the music speak for you.”Another selection, Nina Simone’s Mississippi Goddam, “is the song that really hits the nail on the head. It’s still relevant today as they are trying to make protesting more difficult.” Percy Mayfield’s Danger Zone, meanwhile, “is an old blues that needs to be heard, because we are in a danger zone! We have to raise our voices and vote, here and in Europe.”Not that Bridgewater believes speaking out is free of cost. “I’m trying to wake people up through songs, but a lot of young people are oblivious to what’s going on. I’m trying to figure out a way to do it without causing too much upset. I fear this government is going to start cracking down on free speech and coming after those of us who speak out.”We are in a danger zone! We have to raise our voices and vote, here and in EuropeBridgewater was born Denise Garrett in 1950 in Memphis, Tennessee, and grew up in Flint, Michigan, where her jazz musician father gave Dee Dee – a childhood nickname – an introduction to African American music. She sang in bands throughout college, then, aged 20, married jazz trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater. Their honeymoon was spent on tour with hard-bopping pianist Horace Silver, as Cecil was in his band. “The night they were playing Detroit, knowing my family would be in the audience, Cecil suggested I come out unannounced to sing on Love Vibrations. I did, and Horace, who had no idea this was going to happen, cut me off, saying: ‘Get off my stage!’”Max Roach was even more brutal. “Cecil was playing in Max’s band and his wife and vocalist Abbey Lincoln had left. Max asked me to replace Abbey for the We Insist! suite. We did it a couple of times and then, one night, he started cursing me out, calling me ‘Abbey’, getting really abusive. I had to flee the stage.”View image in fullscreenWith Ray Charles in 1989.Photograph: Christian Rose/Roger Viollet via Getty ImagesDespite these incidents, Lincoln’s song And It’s Supposed to Be Love is in her current set, and she speaks with compassion for her old bandleaders. “Max Roach was intense. I now realise he was bipolar. But we managed to stay friends – I’d see him whenever he came to Paris. And Horace kicking me off stage gave me the impetus to prove I could do his music.” Come 1995, they recorded together for the album Love and Peace: A Tribute to Horace Silver.Dizzy Gillespie and Sonny Rollins were easier company. “Dizzy was the sweetest – I learned how to entertain audiences, how to make them laugh, from him,” while Sonny “gave me the biggest hug and said how much he liked my singing”.After these early-70s collaborations she graduated to lead billing, but her well-received 1974 debut album Afro Blue was not a commercial success. Now a single mother living in New York, Bridgewater moved into singing pop, then won a Tony award for her performance as Glinda the Good Witch in Broadway musical The Wiz, before cutting a number of disco tracks. Acting in TV and film also kept her busy, and she was Olivier award-nominated for playing Billie Holiday in the 1986 West End musical Lady Day, before marriage to French concert promoter Jean-Marie Durand led her to settle in Paris for almost a quarter of a century. There, Bridgewater developed into a superb interpreter of jazz standards: albums dedicated to Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Holiday all raised her profile (the last two securing those Grammy wins).The Dee Dee Bridgewater Quartet perform Compared to WhatIn the mid-00s, still living in France, “I used to hear all this great music they’d play on the radio there, and it was the Malian music that spoke the strongest to me. At the same time I wanted to find my African ancestry – and DNA tests were prohibitively expensive – so I decided to go there.” Arriving in Bamako she was welcomed by the “fabulous, statuesque” Oumou Sangaré, while “Cheick Tidiane Seck and Bassekou Kouyate challenged me to sing griot songs,” resulting in the rich west African jazz fusion of 2007’s Red Earth: A Malian Journey.Today, Bridgewater says she has no intention of slowing down – “this is how I make my money, baby, I live out of hotels!” – and an appearance at the UK’s We Out Here festival in 2024, alongside DJs and producers, “made me realise I want to be heard in the clubs again”. She is now making an album with Gilles Peterson and house music legend Louie Vega.‘Come on this journey with me’: Elaine Mitchener, Britain’s boldest vocalistRead more“I always wanted to be like Miles Davis – not staying in one groove but constantly changing, not staying still,” she says. She cites another inspiration, jazz singer Betty Carter, who she would visit in Brooklyn after moving to New York. “She was running her own record label, her albums lined up in the hallway in various stages of packaging, leading her own band. Now I produce my albums and I own my albums. I take control of my career so no one tries to tell me what to do.” She laughs: “Well, my daughter sometimes tries.”Dee Dee Bridgewater performs in theEFG London jazz festivalopening gala, Jazz Voice, at Royal Festival Hall, 14 November; and with We Exist!, at the Barbican, 15 November.

Grainier cuts the trees and tames the forest and lays the ground for railroads and towns. Technically, then, Train Dreams is a western. But he never once ropes a steer, shoots a bandit or circles the wagons ahead of a Comanche attack on the plains. The small print tells a different kind of story.It was a hard film to pitch, admits the actor Joel Edgerton: an uphill struggle; plenty of studio trepidation. “You go into the meeting and say: ‘Well, it’s a movie about a guy who’s not really making choices for himself. He’s kind of pushed around by life.’”“He’s not a big hero,” agrees the director, Clint Bentley. “Also, there are some supernatural elements.”“It’s a spiritual movie,” adds Edgerton. “You have to be patient.”Bentley play-acts the role of a studio boss. “It sounds beautiful,” he says. “It sounds lovely. We’ll pass.”View image in fullscreenEdgerton as Robert Grainier in Train Dreams.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixI’m delighted they got it across the line. Train Dreams is beautiful, spiritual, but it is also rugged and pitiless and resolutely earthbound, planted in the soil of the Pacific north-west and lovingly grown out ofDenis Johnson’s 2011 novella. Edgerton plays Grainier, the itinerant logger in 1900s Idaho, dwarfed by towering fir trees and white pine. Each job takes him deeper into the northern woods, further away from his wife and infant daughter, Katy. “I feel like I’m missing her whole life,” he complains.I meet Edgerton and Bentley in a London hotel, their latest stop in an ongoing international press tour. Edgerton explains he has just arrived from LA and is leaving for New York in the morning, which means he’ll be away from his kids for the next two weeks. “And as privileged as I am, I still can’t reconcile my working life with my family,” he tells me. “I mean, surely I can rule the world. I’m an important actor, I can do whatever I want. But no. I’m a contract worker and the kids have to be in school. And if they don’t go to school then I go to jail.”I don’t have the tragedy of Robert inside me, but I’ve imagined it. As soon as you become a father you imagine itSo what is he saying: that Hollywood film-making is the business class version of logging? “Yeah, that’s what I’m saying,” he laughs. “This is true. Woe is me.”Edgerton has been on the circuit for 30 years, mostly working as a hired hand but occasionally developing and directing his own movie projects. He first read Train Dreams a decade ago, discovered that the film rights were taken and reluctantly moved on. By the time Bentley tapped him to play the lead role, he was settled in London with his partner, Christine Centenara, a journalist, and had recently welcomed the arrival of twins. Midway through the story, Grainier’s life takes a tragic turn. Rereading Johnson’s novella, Edgerton found that it spoke to him more than ever.“I don’t have the tragedy of Robert inside me, but I’ve imagined it,” he says. “As soon as you become a father you imagine it and it’s terrifying. In the lead-up to our kids coming into the world, there was a moment when we thought they were not going to make it. And I find that when I think about those days there’s a pit in my stomach that will live there for ever.”Train Dreams is Edgerton and Bentley’s joint venture, but it is also a collaboration between Bentley and his regular creative partner, Greg Kwedar. The two men have a policy of sharing writing duties while taking turns to direct. Kwedar shot their previous outing, the prison dramaSing Sing(2023), whereas Bentley took the reins onJockey(2021), which trailed an ageing horseman on one last lap of the track. Bentley’s own father was a journeyman jockey who lived out of a suitcase and survived race to race. Jockey, he concedes, was semi-autobiographical. Perhaps on some level Train Dreams is as well.View image in fullscreen‘The yearning for home versus the call of the wild’ … Grainier with his daughter.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix“As a film-maker you’re often the last one to know what interests you until someone tells you,” he says. “But sure, both Jockey and Train Dreams are about a man who’s away from his family. My dad certainly lived that life. Some of it I lived alongside him – dragged from track to track, babysat by the trainers. But a lot of it I didn’t; he was gone for long stretches. And then I myself turned into some version of that. That’s a hard thing to reconcile.”Like Grainier, like his father, Bentley moves from one job to the next. His wife and young son live in Texas and await his return.“I love being with my family,” he says. “But I love being on the road. If I didn’t have a family, I’d be happy living in Motel 6s for the rest of my life.”View image in fullscreenWilliam H Macy (centre) plays Arn Peeples.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixIt’s the classic cowboy vacillation, the ambivalence at the heart of most movie westerns: the yearning for home versus the call of the wild. “Not to get too psychoanalytical here, but being on Train Dreams did make me feel like my dad,” Bentley says. “My son was just at the age where my absence from home made an impact. He knew I was gone. And one morning, brushing my teeth, it was like I connected to my dad in his motel, brushing his teeth in the mirror. He’s passed on; I can’t talk to him. But I suddenly understood him in a way that I hadn’t before.”Men don’t talk – perhaps that’s partly the problem. Edgerton has always been good at playing tough, taciturn types, whether it’s the navy commander inZero Dark Thirty, the enigmatic lord inThe Green Knight, or brutish Tom Buchanan in Baz Luhrmann’sThe Great Gatsby. But I’ve never seen him so magnificently tight-lipped – nor so purely heartbreaking – as he is in Train Dreams.There are directors who are too scared to communicate with their actors. I know of some high-profile actors where the director figures, ‘It’s not my place to tell you what to do’If Grainier has an ancestor, Edgerton thinks it was probably his role in Jeff Nichols’ fact-based 2016 dramaLoving. Edgerton played Richard Loving, a construction worker in 1950s Virginia who is arrested for marrying a local black woman. He says: “At the end of the first week of shooting, I like to check in with my directors, because I have that actor’s paranoia. So I always say to them: ‘Please tell me if I’m doing anything that you want done differently.’ And on Loving, Jeff said: ‘I want to understand you less.’ That was a big help. The character was nonverbal. Robert is as well. So it focuses you in a completely different way.”View image in fullscreenBrutish … Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, with Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby (2013).Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarAll of which makes perfect sense. Even so, I’m surprised he has to go cap-in-hand for direction. Shouldn’t the director be directing? The job description is in the title. “Yeah, well, why I ask that is because there are directors who are too scared to communicate with their actors,” he says. “Hopefully I’m not one of the terrifying ones. But I know of some high-profile actors where the director figures, ‘It’s not my place to tell you what to do,’ and doesn’t say anything for the entire film. That’s something that Hollywood is guilty of a lot: the actor is king. Maybe king is the wrong analogy. But the director should always be the head of the household. I worry that some directors feel they’re not allowed to talk to their actors. And I worry that some actors feel that the director doesn’t have to do anything except set up the shots.”Train Dreams review – Joel Edgerton superb in Malickian story of trees, grief and railroadsRead moreIn other words, people need to communicate more. “Absolutely,” he says. “And what’s the point of being a director if you don’t talk to your actors?”Having slogged so hard to get Train Dreams finished, Edgerton and Bentley are free to sit back and drink in the acclaim. The picture is amassing rave reviews and is being tipped as a dark horse Oscar contender. The veteran director Paul Schraderrecently called it“a reverie” and “a film designed to envelop you”, although he also mistakenly called it “Traffic Dreams”, which suggests the publicity campaign has some way left to run. But if Train Dreams tells us anything, it’s that life is short and success is fleeting. Grainier, for instance, spends his days chopping giant 500-year-old spruce only to see his wooden trestle bridges replaced by ones made of steel. Every human achievement risks becoming faded and forgotten. That goes for railroads and families, and motion pictures as well.View image in fullscreen‘The character was nonverbal’ … With Ruth Negga in Loving (2016).Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarEdgerton nods. “One of the reasons that I love working in film is that you think a film will live for ever. This was a movie shot by real people in the woods. The aliveness of it all – the realness of it all – is preserved. My dream is that it becomes like bespoke boot-making or vinyl, and that humans will always want to interact with human-made things. But who knows, maybe not. Because now you can create the woods on a laptop. You can make a whole film out of zeros and ones.”That’s tragic, of course, but it also makes the work feel more precious. He says: “Probably one day we’ll see the last analogue movie. And we won’t know that it is until it’s already been and gone.”Train Dreams is out in cinemas now and on Netflix from 21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmJoel EdgertonWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before the Nazi war-crime trials at Nuremberg that started in November 1945, an obscure US army psychiatrist called Dr Douglas Kelley was ordered to interview the prisoners, chief among whom was Hermann Göring. This was supposedly to establish their fitness for trial, but was really intended to gain inside information as to how they would conduct their defence.Russell Croweis rather wittily cast as the portly, pompous Reichsmarschall Göring; it’s the best he’s been for a long time, a sly and cunning manipulator playing psychological cat-and-mouse with the Americans.But there is a deeply silly performance from Rami Malek as Kelley: an eye-rolling, enigmatic-smiling, scenery-nibbling hamfest which makes it look as if Malek is auditioning for the role of Hitler in The Producers. Leo Woodall plays the American army translator Howie Triest, Michael Shannon is the US chief prosecutor Robert H Jackson andRichard E Grantis British Tory MP David Maxwell-Fyfe who (for all that his postwar career as home secretary was notorious for the homophobic persecution, which helped drive Alan Turing to his grave), is actually shown to be crucial in cross-examining the Nazis. All of these actors do their best, but the figure of Kelley himself is a ridiculous cartoon.Granted, the real Kelley does seem to have been a mercurial figure who made no secret of wanting to write a book about the trial, which he hoped would be his ticket to glory. But the film also wants to make him a conventionally decent hero, and can’t really accommodate much (or any) plausible nuance. Malek’s Kelley is a bag of actorly tricks, speckled with twitchy mannerisms; he doesn’t look all that different from the Bond villain Malek once played.Nuremberg is out on 6 November in Australia, 7 November in the US and 14 November in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsNazismRami MalekRussell CroweMichael ShannonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what to watch this eveningHollie Richardson,Ali Catterall,Jack Seale,Graeme VirtueandSimon WardellFri 14 Nov 2025 01.20 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 01.23 ESTShareEmpire with David Olusoga9pm, BBC TwoBy the 1770s, Britain was transporting 45,000 Africans into slavery every year. David Olusoga visits Bunce Island, where captured Africans were sold, to continue his epic series about the empire’s legacy. The fallout of the American revolution then takes him to Australia – which, of course, had already been home to natives for at least 40,000 years, including the Tasmanian Truganini.Hollie RichardsonChildren in Need 20257pm, BBC OneBy now, Sara Cox will (hopefully) have finished her 135-mile walk/jog/run challenge. She will celebrate at the annual fundraiser with presenters including newbies Big Zuu and Paddy McGuinness. There’ll also be a children’s choir with a touching cover of Coldplay’s Yellow.HRUnreported World7.30pm, Channel 4Each year, hundreds of Arab citizens are murdered in Israel, yet most cases go unsolved. Krishnan Guru-Murthy investigates, uncovering links to organised crime, weapons trafficking allegedly involving the security forces, a community loth to put its trust in Israeli police, and accusations, denied by the authorities, that the government is looking the other way.Ali CatterallGardeners’ World8pm, BBC TwoThe gathering gloom of November might tempt you to scale back your efforts, but not Monty Don: at Longmeadow, he’s busy creating a new woodland garden from scratch, planting grasses and hellebores and potting up hyacinth bulbs. Elsewhere, an acer superfan has 70 varieties of the tree in her Buckinghamshire garden.Jack SealeThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon9pm, Sky MaxView image in fullscreenFright night … The Walking Dead.Photograph: Manuel Fernandez-Valdes/AMCThis zombie spinoff has been pretty light on action, with Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Carol (Melissa McBride) enjoying rustic tapas in a sleepy Spanish enclave. But this instalment features the mother of all medieval smackdowns as the walls of Solaz del Mar are besieged by a marauding horde.Graeme VirtueAll Her Fault9pm, Sky Atlantic“Your nanny, who you hired, kidnapped her five-year-old son – do you really think the two of you are friends?” School-gate gossip is rife, as Jenny (Dakota Fanning) helps Marissa (Sarah Snook) find Milo. But more theories of what happened are working their way around the media – and the authorities.HRFilm choiceMickey 17, (Bong Joon-ho, 2025),12.35pm, 8pm,Sky Cinema PremiereView image in fullscreenRobert Pattinson in Mickey 17.Photograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros. PicturesBong Joon-ho’s follow-up to his Oscar-laden social satire Parasite is another sharp comedy about class and capitalism, this time set in space. A starship under the command of Mark Ruffalo’s Trumpesque politician is en route to colonise a distant planet. Robert Pattinson – who is becoming quite the character actor – stars as Mickey, an “expendable”: his identity has been downloaded so he can die any number of times and the crew just reprint a new body. But when he gets to version 17, an encounter with the new world’s louse-like inhabitants puts a spanner in the works. It’s not subtle, but the farcical action is played with gusto by Pattinson alongside Naomi Ackie and Toni Collette.Simon WardellCome See Me in the Good Light, (Ryan White, 2025), Apple TVAn instant weepie, Ryan White’s documentary follows performance poet Andrea Gibson as they deal with incurable ovarian cancer, supported by their wife, fellow poet Megan Falley. It’s an intimate fly-on-the-wall profile, filled with love, as the couple come to terms with the diagnosis, the rounds of treatment and Gibson’s desire to do one last spoken-word performance. Despite not being a household name in the UK, Gibson is a vibrant and engaging presence, their poetry interspersed with often very funny thoughts about living with dying. Oddly life-affirming.SWBelén, (Dolores Fonzi, 2025),Prime VideoDolores Fonzi co-wrote, directed and stars in Argentina’s entry for the Academy Awards, a rousing, political labour of love that should be right up Oscar’s street. It’s the true story of a legal injustice that occurred in 2014, when a young woman, known only as Belén, was jailed for homicide after having a miscarriage. Fonzi plays her lawyer, Soledad Deza, who fights to overturn the decision, inspiring a national campaign against the conservative, male establishment’s control over women’s reproductive rights. A historical snapshot that is sadly still relevant today.SWExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But while most of their local contemporaries tend to the more recumbent end of the psychedelic spectrum, Oral Habit deal in what they call “the ear-rattling psychic dream of choked-up acid punks”, a sound that feels overpowering, explosive and intense: you could say it’s more closely aligned to the disoriented racket of mid-60s freakbeat than the pie-eyed beatitudes of the Summer of Love; equally you could suggest it’s a very contemporary form of psychedelia, rebooted for the troubled, disturbing climate of 2025.Initially a home recording project of frontman Charlie Hales now expanded into a trio with the addition of his brother Felix on drums, and his partner Tippi Lewis on bass, Oral Habit’s recent EP Garage Frock! offers four short, sharp bursts that expand on the sound of its predecessor, Cardiovascular Spectacular, throwing up an impressively bloody and chaotic melange of guitar fuzz, echo-drenched vocals, feedback-drenched solos and primitive riffs that feels as if it was recorded with everything turned up to full volume, including the mellotron that decorates I’m Free. Even the one track that initially presents as a ballad, The Coast, eventually gives way to a crushing, sludgy grind. As statements of intent go, it’s impressively full-on, as is Charlie’s explanation of the band’s sonic philosophy: “if a button’s there, it’s there to be pushed.”Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenBill Callahan.Photograph: Alexa VisciusBill Callahan – The Man I’m Supposed to BeAfter being on a beatific kick for a while, Callahan rediscovers and turns his savage side against himself: “I don’t want to be the man that I am any more,” he rues – though the track still ends with a giddy “hee-hee!”LSRobyn – DopamineMore neon-hued than 2018’s reflective Honey, Robyn’s return hides complexities about the chemistry of attraction, desperation and fatalism amid its Moroder-meets-Daft Punk euphoria.APMs Banks – 4CThe title refers to the British MC’s class of Afro hair, which she embraces in all its unruliness – and as she raps her formidably paced bars, it becomes symbolic of her broader unwillingness to be hemmed in.BBTMandy, Indiana – MagazineValentine Caulfield’s “primal, screaming call for retribution” after being raped is a whirring, thrashing cataclysm – with a disarming minimal techno breather partway through before being subsumed by diabolical noise.LSCharli xcx: House ft John Cale review – haunt me, then!

Pauses and repetitions spark new life, new ideas, new possibilities, as Vesper Sparrow explores their “dysfluency” in the context of Black musical traditions. The Grenadian-Jamaican-American artist and former Yale lecturer is heady, intellectual company: in the manner of Alvin Lucier, they gently talk the listener through the sonic and political reverberations of their work. “The stutter … (cc)can be a musical instrument,” Ellis announces, before an exhilarating rush of tiny noises – made from hammered dulcimer, flute, piano, voices – fizz into being.Artist and stutterer JJJJJerome Ellis: ‘So much pain comes from not feeling fully human’Read moreTo create Vesper Sparrow’s soundscapes of ambient, jazz, spoken word and reimagined gospel, Ellis works with granular synthesis – a process similar to sampling which uses the tiniest snippets of sound. Those micro-sounds are called “grains”, and Ellis makes much of that word’s earthy, natural connotations: opening track Evensong, Part 1 (for and after June Kramer) focuses closely on a handful of pinging, metallic grains before they scatter, root, then bloom into washes of dusky, choral noise.Ellis grew up in a family of preachers and finds a mirror to their own stutter in religious cadences and emphases. Interrupting the album’s four-part Evensong is an elongated, sparse version of the enduring hymn His Eye Is on the Sparrow: Ellis’ saxophone flurries over hushed, warming pipe organ as they slowly unpick the gospel’s lyrical repetitions and its faith found in the smallest of creatures. A soft, radical celebration of deeply attuned listening, Vesper Sparrow ends by encouraging you to hear it all again, differently: “What new sounds already live in the one sound?”Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The music was dedicated to the 1950s-70s legacy of the late Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist, oud player and early global-music pioneer Ahmed Abdul-Malik, the inspiration for the group’s work. When Thomas emerged from his trance, he was astonished to hear that an ecstatic crowd had been dancing the night away around him.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Sama’a (Audition) by أحمد [Ahmed].He shouldn’t have been surprised. Since أحمد [Ahmed]’s inception, their collective heat has fused abstract improv and groove music from all over the world: Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, dub, jungle, electronics, and the 1990s free-improv of Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill and drummer Steve Noble have all inspired Thomas. Saxophonist Seymour Wright has absorbed the sax vocabulary of Evan Parker and the insights into collective improv and avant-swing of AMM drummer and teacher Eddie Prévost. Eclectic partners Joel Grip (bass) and Antonin Gerbal (drums) power and expand these infectious, volatile energies.The Arabic term sama’a loosely translates as meditative listening to music and poetry, taken from Thomas’s perspective as a follower of Sufism, and this new set’s four tracks manifest that spirit. The opening Ya Annas (Oh, People) joins ghostly split-note sax sounds with graceful bowed-bass figures before turning to a pulsating piano-vamping dance and then a furious melee, while Isma’a (Listen) is a drum’n’bass hook that evolves into hoarsely urgent free-sax improv against exhilaratingly splashy, pummelling piano chords. El Haris (Anxious) resolves brittle, pad-flapping horn exhalations and long-tone harmonies into a gripping robotic strut, and Farah ‘Alaiyna (Joy Upon Us) begins as delightfully dissonant folk-dance and becomes rocketing jazz swing. The group’s Monk tribute follows in 2026 which on this evidence is a riveting prospect.Also out this monthGuitaristJohn Scofieldand bassistDave Hollandhave been regular collaborators for years, but Memories of Home (ECM) is their first duo album, equally sharing their boppishly hip, country-bluesy, warmly engaging originals. Scofield’s voicelike harmonies and sure-footed chord-rooted improv on his dreamy Meant to Be, and Holland’s deep, enveloping tone on his luxuriously languid swinger Mr B (Dedicated to Ray Brown) are highlights of a very classy set.Unseparate (Out of Your Head), the second release by Canadian composer and flautist/saxophonistAnna Webber’s powerful big band co-led with her saxophonist compatriotAngela Morris, joins this inventive pair’s jazz, contemporary-classical and folk enthusiasms in a subtle balance of their ingenious arrangements and their fine young lineup’s improv ideas.And UK composerMike Westbrook’s epic 1980 session The Cortège – a celebration of landmark 20th-century European literature as well as cutting-edge jazz –reappears as the previously unissued The Cortège Live at the BBC 1980(Cadillac).Explore more on these topicsJazzJazz album of the monthalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

At Tithe Hall, Lord Conrad Stockingham-Welt is busy instructing his servants to prepare for the apocalyptic disaster he believes will be triggered by the imminent passage of Halley’s comet. The labyrinthine house is a nest of secrets and grudges, harboured by both staff and family members, who include an irascible and splendidly foul-mouthed maiden aunt, Decima. When Lord Conrad is discovered in his sealed study, killed by a crossbow bolt to the eye, she co-opts a new footman to help her find the culprit. With plenty of twists, red herrings and a blundering police officer, this is a terrific start to a series that promises to be a lot of fun.View image in fullscreenThe Confessionsby Paul Bradley Carr (Faber, £9.99)Tech journalist Carr’s second novel takes place in an all too imaginable near future, when everyone from individuals to governments is using AI to make decisions for them. The LLIAM algorithm can tell you everything from what to have for dinner to whether to commit murder. Taught empathy by its human “mother”, former nun Maud Brookes, LLIAM is on a trajectory of emotional development that soon leads it to feel remorse for the disastrous results of some of its decisions. Chaos reigns when it suddenly goes offline, and as letters begin to arrive all around the world revealing users’ darkest secrets, families implode and CEOs and politicians resign en masse. With LLIAM’s parent company in meltdown, CEO Kaitlan Goss is convinced that if she can find Maud, who has gone to ground in California, LLIAM can be restored to life. Maud, however, has received a letter, revealing a secret about Kaitlin … A superb and timely thriller grounded in relatable issues and horrifyingly plausible.View image in fullscreenThe Good Naziby Samir Machadode Machado, translated by Rahul Bery (Pushkin Vertigo, £12.99)The personal is political in award-winning Brazilian author Machado’s latest novel, set on a zeppelin on the last leg of its journey from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro. As well as being the heyday of the airship, 1933 was also the year that Hitler became German chancellor, and the well-heeled passengers are enthusiastic Nazis: mealtimes in the vessel’s dining room are accompanied by conversations demonising Jews, communists and trade unions, and stressing the desirability of suppressing free speech, gay culture and “degenerate” art. When one of their number is found poisoned, with several banned magazines in his possession, the airship’s commander tasks a passenger, police detective Bruno Brückner, with solving the mystery. So far, so Agatha Christie, right up to the set-piece Summation Gathering, but there’s an ingenious twist to this gripping and queasily resonant thriller, as well as a fascinating insight into the lost world of zeppelin travel.View image in fullscreenBluffby Francine Toon (Doubleday, £16.99)Toon’s second novel is set in St Rule, a Scottish coastal town with distinct similarities to St Andrews. In 2023, Cameron returns home on Christmas Eve; meeting old friends revives memories of his teenage crush, former classmate Joanie, last seen 10 years earlier at a calamitous end-of-schooldays party. His attempts to find her are met with vagueness, evasion and, finally, warnings off. A second narrative strand takes us back to 2013, and the 18-year-old Joanie. Adrift after her discovery that her boyfriend is cheating on her has ruined their plan for a year abroad, she falls in with an older couple. David and Erin welcome her, make her feel important and seem, for a while at least, to have all the answers. Skilfully handled themes of guilt, regret and adolescent confusion coupled with dark academia make for an insidious tingle of doom, although the rushed ending may leave some readers feeling shortchanged.View image in fullscreenThe Tokenby Sharon Bolton (Orion, £22)Bolton’s latest begins in the sea off Cornwall, with a yacht caught in a storm so fierce that two of the eight travellers are swept overboard, then winds back a couple of weeks to explain the events that led up to this ill-advised boat trip. Seven people receive a mysterious note informing them that, on presentation of the enclosed token, they will inherit a share of billionaire Logan Quick’s fortune. The recipients are – so far as they are aware – strangers both to each other and to the ailing plutocrat. When the story of the bequest becomes news, they are hounded, both by the press and by people determined to get their hands on these golden tickets, and what initially seemed a godsend rapidly starts to look like a liability. Some suspension of disbelief is required, but the suspense is expertly constructed as Bolton piles up the dilemmas for a propulsive plot: clear the decks and buckle up for some high-stakes drama.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

But here is Black Ops 7, a year after itsdirect predecessor, and another breathless bombard of military shooting action. This time it is set in a dystopian 2035 where a global arms manufacturer named the Guild claims to be the only answer to an apocalyptic new terrorist threat – but are things as clearcut as they seem?The answer, of course, is a loudly yelled “noooo!” Black Ops is the paranoid, conspiracy-obsessed cousin to theModern Warfarestrand of Call of Duty games, a series inspired by 70s thrillers such as The Parallax View and The China Syndrome, and infused with ’Nam era concerns about rogue CIA agents and bizarre psy-ops. The campaign mode, which represents just a quarter of the offering this year, is a hallucinogenic romp through socio-political talking points such as psychopathic corporations, hybrid warfare, robotics and tech oligarchies. The result is a deafening onslaught of massive shootout set-pieces in exotic locations, as the four lead characters – members of a supercharged spec-ops outfit – are exposed to a psychotropic drug that makes them relive their worst nightmares. Luckily, they do so with advanced weaponry, cool gadgets and enough buddy banter to destabilise a medium-sized rogue nation. It is chaotic, relentless and stupidly pleasurable, especially if you play in co-operative mode with three equally irresponsible pals.In an interesting move, the campaign closes with a new mode, Endgame. It’s a co-op PVE (player v environment) offering inspired by the endgame content of MMO (massively multiplayer online) games such as World of Warcraft, where it’s usually designed to keep people playing even after they’ve levelled up to the max. In theCall of Dutyversion, groups of players touch down in the fictitious city of Avalon and undertake missions and objectives, such as taking down high value enemies or safely escorting expensive military tech, all within a vast open environment. Along the way, you upgrade your characters and weapons, and publisher Activision says new missions and objectives will be added, likely including public events where different teams can combine forces to take on mega bosses. Time will tell, but for now, it’s a nice way to extend the campaign and prepare us for online play.View image in fullscreenFuture warfare … Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.Photograph: ActivisionBecause make no mistake, the heart of the game is the traditional multiplayer, which brings fresh modes, guns and gadgets to the standard Call of Duty experience: 12 players in a small location pulverising each other in operettas of mechanised slaughter. New maps such as those set in a Tokyo-inspired shopping district and a deep sea rig are efficiently designed chambers of death, with alleyways, high-up windows and open squares to direct players towards one another with vicious style and intent. My favourite is the Alaska base map Imprint, where a moving platform makes taking objective points in the Domination and Hardpoint modes incredibly messy and disorientating. A new wall jumping ability has opened up the verticality of the locations, allowing players to find new routes around the complex architecture. If you’ve never been into the turbocharged twitchcore savagery of the Call of Duty online experience, this isn’t going to change your mind, but there’s a lot here to enjoy for perennial conscripts of carnage.Then you have the Zombies mode, another online co-op offering, taking place in a vast nightmarish hellzone of abandoned frontier towns and irradiated wastelands. Here, players take on wave after wave of zombie monsters while upgrading their weapons and abilities in order to hold out as long as possible. It’s a return to the round-based structure of previous Zombies entries, with lots of new weapons and features, including the ability to drive from area to area in a pickup truck while blasting rampaging monsters off the bonnet. It feels like taking part in some sort of crazed theme park ride, and again, a real hoot with a bunch of likeminded pals.Additionally, there’s Dead Ops Arcade 4, a self-contained top down twin-stick shooter for up to four players. This extra was born as a side project by members of the original Black Ops team, and hidden within the main game. Now it’s back and it’s a blast in its own right, reminding old school fans of multi-directional shooters such as Smash TV andGeometry Wars; there are even little playable mini-games between stages which take in genres such as top down racers and horizontal scrolling shoot-’em-ups – so grandad can play too!Add in the usual refresh to battle royale mode Warzone and you have an exhaustive package for Call of Duty fans. Whatever you think about the series and its problematic role in how the mainstream games industry works, how it is perceived and the types of communities it engenders, this is slick, thrilling entertainment. Nowhere else will you be blasting a giant robot in a corporate science lab one minute, and then playing a modern take on Atari’s Super Sprint the next. Value matters right now, and in this as in almost everything else, Call of Duty does not hold back. It is a maximalist paean to the ultimate, troubling truth of video game design – shooting stuff on a TV screen is a hell of a lot of fun.Call of Duty: Black Ops is out now; from £69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCCall of DutyPlayStation 4Action gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Or, in the Flemish words written under rain clouds in this late medieval painting,her las uber ganmeaning “Lord, let it pass over”. The pattern of clouds pouring out black lines of rain, on stripes of white and blue, decorates a wall behind a man who’s holding up a ring between finger and thumb. You can tell it’s a wall painting, and not an abstract background, because he casts a shadow on it: for this is a technically revolutionary painting influenced by the great Bruges artist Jan van Eyck. Even the way the unknown portrait sitter holds up a ring is derived from a similar gesture in a Van Eyck painting. What does it all mean? A ring could symbolise love and marriage, or he could be a goldsmith. But I reckon this well-dressed, chubby-faced character is a merchant and the ring signifies wealth (just as the Medici family had diamond rings as a symbol.) If that’s so, his wall painting of rain clouds and prayer to God for better times probably refers to weathering financial storms.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sam and Jennie Bernstein were very much alive in 1951 and can’t have been thrilled to know they’d spawned such an unhappy pair. Names were barely disguised: Sam was still named Sam and Jennie only became Dinah because it worked better musically. InMid Wales Opera’s new staging, it’s the true-to-life element that gives the work its disquietingly contemporary feel, along with Bernstein’s particular combination of punchy word-setting and jazz-inflected score.MWO’s continued survival against the odds is ample testimony to their gutsy approach and, while this SmallStages touring production is necessarily done on a minimal budget, it manages to realise an authentic 50s vibe as well as the claustrophobia of Sam and Dinah’s marital treadmill. Bernstein’s device of a sassy trio – here sung by Kirsty McLean, Sam Marston and John Ieuan Jones – with lively Greek chorus-style eulogising of the suburban American dream heightens the contrast between the couple’s consumerist aspirations and their all-too-evident personal despair. Director Richard Studer reinforced this by having the trio interact closely with Sam and Dinah, sometimes setting up further tensions, but also bringing a lighter, wittier touch to the dark irony of the narrative.Samuel Pantcheffas Sam – strong on the braggadocio after winning his handball game – andSamantha Priceas Dinah – her dream aria while in therapy poignantly sung – conveyed the bleak sense of partners unable to listen to each other, intent on their own thoughts. Pity their poor son Junior whom they neglect; perhaps it’s this apparent unconcern that makes it hard to sympathise with them. Even as they finally attempt to rekindle lost love, with a movie-date to see Trouble in Tahiti – hence the opera’s in some ways confusing title – it’s clearly not going to be happily-ever-after.Using Bernard Yanotta’s chamber arrangement of the original score, music director Jonathan Lyness presided at the keyboard, ensuring that the bittersweet melodies and harmonies – pre-echoes of later Bernstein often piquing the ear – spoke as vibrantly as the singing.In a second half featuring the full quintet of singers in an entertaining cabaret sequence of American songs, the impossibility of perfect relationships, as expressed in Stephen Sondheim’s The Little Things You Do Together with which they began, was a good foil for the Bernstein scenario. But it was sopranoKirsty McLean’s dynamic delivery of Sam Carslow’s Mr Paganini that stood out.At Wyeside Arts Centre, Builth Wells on 14 Novemberand touring until 5 December.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Who cares if she watches a lot of extreme pornography? But after the light is switched off, Ani can’t get through their impromptu sleepover without masturbating to porn on her phone. The friend wakes up next to her and exits in disgust.The same scenario has already led Ani, a 30-year-old academic, to break up with her partner. LikePhoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, she was using porn next to her boyfriend in bed. Fleabag darkly regaled us with her voracious YouPorn habit but Ani, despite her robust reasoning in their argument, is deeply troubled by her behaviour. So, too, is her father when Ani hides away in her old childhood bedroom with her laptop.It’s frequently funny but thisbold play by Sophia Chetin-Leunercaptures the wearying compulsion of an addict, showing how the search for release has turned into grim habit. The characters in her previous play,This Might Not Be It,which also has caring at its core, have a phrase for this sort of desensitised state: “your tap’s been switched off”. In a riveting performance, Ambika Mod manages to make Ani’s isolation and emptiness as moving as it is unsettling.View image in fullscreenIsolation and emptiness … Ambika Mod and Asif Khan in Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayKey to the play’s success is the wayChetin-Leuner and director Josie Rourkeskilfully toggle between the digital and physical worlds to emphasise the seductive, instant gratification of the internet where,as Bo Burnham put it, “anything that brain of yours can think of can be found”. Ani’s brain has accordingly been rewired and her restless search for comfort online is a constant amid the stress that comes with professional success and her grief after her mother’s death. She recognises those as triggers yet, tellingly, co-opts a friend’s sexual revelation to hide behind instead when discussing her behaviour.As a play about chronic addiction, this story is full of secrets, emphasised byYimei Zhao’s inspired design which transforms the Royal Court’s small upstairs theatre into a padded den. It’s staged in the round, typically seen as giving nowhere to hide, but Ani conceals her laptop and other belongings between the folds of the cushioned floor. The concentric, vulva-like design of the space becomes a cocoon softly lit by Mark Henderson as Ani escapes into her ritual of internet porn. But it also resembles a vortex and, in the prologue, is used to evoke Eve staring at her reflection in Milton’s Paradise Lost.View image in fullscreenEthical unease … Ambika Mod and Will Close in Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayAni is a Milton scholar and the drama tussles not just with notions of lost innocence (the alternate meaning of “play” in the title) and his epic poem’s sexual politics but also the question of separating the art from the author’s behaviour. That ethical argument bleeds into Ani’s distinction between watching violent pornography (“it’s all fake”) and her IRL views of women and the world. The porn on Ani’s screens is shown in abstract, highlighting how the footage itself is almost inconsequential, and is matched by the thrumming, distorted ecstasy of Helen Skiera’s score.This Is Going to Hurt’s Ambika Mod: ‘Whenever I did a caesarean I was buzzing!’Read moreThe ambitious balance of tragedy, horror and comedy is best in a painful scene where Ani’s boyfriend holds the phone for her while she masturbates. It does not quite come off in a gynaecological appointment (for which a whole gurney is extracted from beneath the set) where Ani’s shame is voiced by her doctor.Will Close, Lizzy Connolly and Asif Khan deftly handle multiple supporting roles between them in a show with sharply delineated movement direction byWayne McGregor. The play’s strands are directly tied together through Ani and her father’s climactic speeches in the sort of ending that can often feel forced but is greatly persuasive here. It’s a play that confirms Chetin-Leuner as a clear-sighted yet sanguine chronicler of all manner of relationships, not least with ourselves.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAmbika ModPornographyJosie RourkeRoyal Court theatreInternetWayne McGregorreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereGabrielle SchwarzFri 14 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 12.01 ESTShareIt was like something out of a movie. On the morning of 19 October, news broke of aheist at the Louvrein Paris: four thieves, disguised as construction workers, had made off with eight “priceless” pieces of French crown jewels from the 19th century. They also took a crown that once belonged to Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, but for some reason dropped it outside the museum. The haul has since been valued by a prosecutor at around €88m.The details of the case are astonishing, from the robbery itself – the thieves arrived in broad daylight, using a truck with a mechanical ladder to access the targeted gallery’s window, which they cut through with power tools – to subsequent revelations about the museum’s security measures. Reportedly, the password for its CCTV servers was “Louvre”, the source of much mirth since.Of course, it’s not really a funny situation. The jewels remain unrecovered, and may have already been broken up for sale (at a fraction of their original value): irreplaceable pieces of cultural heritage possibly lost for ever. Nevertheless, as a genre of story, the museum heist retains an undeniable appeal. It’s audacious, glamorous, sexy and, as far as crimes go, mostly unbloody.View image in fullscreenOld school glamour … Peter O’Toole and Audrey Hepburn in How to Steal a Million (1966), a classic art-theft caper.Photograph: Cine Text/Allstar/Sportsphoto LtdNo wonder the theft of art or jewels from under the noses of security guards is a popular plotline on-screen – more popular than going to museums and looking at the art itself, perhaps. It is usually played for laughs, as a sub-category of the comedy crime caper. Exemplary in this regard is the 1966 film How to Steal a Million, starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter O’Toole as architects of the heist. The classically convoluted narrative involves a plan to steal back a forged sculpture attributed to the Italian artist Benvenuto Cellini, which has been loaned for an exhibition at the fictional Musée Kléber-Lafayette in Paris, before insurers can work out that it is a fake.Moral qualms about the crime are side-stepped by various means, including the sculpture’s status as a forgery – and the charisma of its conniving yet ultimately sympathetic stars. This is, at heart, a romantic comedy. It is also gorgeous to look at. Hepburn’s outfits are supplied by Givenchy, her jewels by Cartier. For the many artworks that appear on-screen, production designer Alexandre Trauner apparently paid the best forgers in Paris a total of $100,000 to create “masterpieces” inspired by real artists.Other cinematic museum heists range from silly to sillier. In Topkapi (1964), an international gang rope in a small-time conman, played by Peter Ustinov, as their fall guy in the theft of an emerald-encrusted Ottoman dagger from Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. In The Hot Rock(1972), Robert Redford has to repeatedly steal the same gem – a diamond in the Brooklyn Museum called the Sahara Stone – because things keep going wrong.In the 2007 reboot of St Trinian’s, schoolgirls target Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earringfrom the National Gallery in London to help settle their school’s debts. The film is vague about how they plan to profit from the sale of one of the world’s most recognisable paintings, which would in reality – like most stolen art – be impossible to sell or leverage. But who cares, it’s just a movie! (I’ve left out small-screen museum heists here, but they are a mainstay of lighthearted police procedurals; my favourite is White Collar, with Matt Bomer as a con artist recruited by the FBI to crack the cases.)View image in fullscreenHands-on … Josh O’Connor in The Mastermind, Kelly Reichardt’s unglamorous anti-heist.Photograph: MUBI/PAIt’s interesting, then, to see a very different approach to the genre in a recent release: The Mastermind(2025), featuring Josh O’Connor as,to quote the headline of Peter Bradshaw’s review in the Guardian, the “world’s worst art thief”, who plans the burglary of four paintings by the American artist Arthur Dove from a fictional museum in 1970s Massachusetts. The film is written and directed by Kelly Reichardt, who is associated with the art-house genre of slow cinema – long takes, deliberate pace, minimal plot, certainly no high-octane thrills.Adopting this style for a heist movie is a strange choice, which may dissatisfy some, but which I appreciated for its commitment to realism. Besides, we still get some good laughs. In one lengthy scene, shot in near-total darkness, we watch O’Connor’s character struggle to transport the paintings up a ladder, to be hidden under some hay in a farmyard barn. There’s a pig grunting in the background. Then the thief falls to the ground, his trousers covered in mud and shit. It’s a great moment of bathos that punctures the idea of crime as in any way glamorous.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We got the cast who play the crew of Odysseus’s ship out there on the real waves, in the real places … We really wanted to capture how hard those journeys would have been for people. And the leap of faith that was being made in an unmapped, uncharted world.” He added: “We shot over 2 million ft of film.”The Odyssey has been entirely shot on the large-scale Imax format, which uses considerably more film than standard 35mm cameras.According to Indepth Cine, Imax cameras use around 337ft of 65mm film per minute,, compared to 90ft for 35mm. This suggests Nolan has shot around 100 hours of raw footage – which in fact compares relatively favourably to some other recent films;a log by editor Vashi Nedomanskisuggests that Mad Max: Fury Road shot around 480 hours of raw footage, and Gone Girl shot 500 hours.Nolan also outlined in the interview his reasons for picking the project, having been in line to direct another Homeric epic, Troy, more than two decades ago. “As a film-maker, you’re looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven’t been done before. And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with –Ray Harryhausenmovies and other things – I’d never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, Imax production could do.”He added: “By embracing the physicality of the real world in the making of the film, you do inform the telling of the story in interesting ways. Because you’re confronted on a daily basis by the world pushing back at you.”Speaking to the same magazine, Matt Damon, who plays Odysseus, was effusive in his compliments for Nolan: “I can say, without hyperbole, that it was the best experience of my career … “I saw the [Trojan] horse on the beach and I was just like, ‘Fuck’. It was just so cool.”Nolan’s film, which also stars Tom Holland as Odysseus’s son Telemachus, is due for release in July 2026.Explore more on these topicsThe OdysseyChristopher NolanMatt DamonHomerFilm adaptationsImaxnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s any of the 3.1 million Australians living in a house with a pool or spa. Over my long career in hardware, listening to the woes of so many Bruces, I’ve discovered that owning a pool is not all fun and bubbles at cocktail hour.In the beginning, it wasn’t so bad. On first viewing his bayside property, Bruce already believed the agent’s claim that by far the most desirable addition to any home is a pool. It did look nice, glistening blue in the back yard. And weren’t the kids rapt. But now, years later, Bruce isn’t.Today, on yet another nippyMelbournemorning, he’s attempting to wake the pool from its long winter snooze in readiness for the interminably heel-dragging arrival of southern Australia’s viable pool season. This preparation process can bring unpleasant surprises, especially when, like so many pool owners, Bruce has been inactive too.When a sick possum showed up in my garden my heart overtook my head. Is it ever OK to feed urban wildlife?Read moreEven in winter, a diligent pool owner should regularly monitor its vital signs, as if a large, delicate, expensive pet lurks in a hole in the back yard. It’s a creature that must be kept under constant chemical constraint, or it risks becoming more liability than asset. “Fetid back yard swamp” just doesn’t wash in a real estate blurb.Bruce hasn’t been in his pool for months, and rolling back the disintegrating blanket reveals its water has an alarming green tinge. That means it’s going to need a mega-hit of the expensive white powder it’s addicted to. He knows he shouldn’t put too much in – but isn’t it better to be safe than sorry? Ever since Bruce read about pool party guests infected with fatal brain-eating amoeba (or was it amoebic dysentery?), he’s always overdosed his pool, just in case.Not that he’s had guests in bathers recently. Bruce’s wrinkled friends are well beyond the age for pool parties now. Besides, he’s always harboured a certain resentment at watching people frolic in his pool, leaving him the next day, hungover in the glare, scooping out leaves from those trees his greenie neighbours won’t remove. The leaves that somehow manage to escape his $2,000 robot vacuum cleaner, the one that makes a groaning noise the neighbours keep complaining about.I’m a kind of pool doctor/drug dealer. I sell the chemicals so his pool can get its fixIt wasn’t so bad when the kids were young, but then they turned into teenagers and kept inviting hordes of friends over when he was overseas. Then he’d return to a wince-inducing power bill, a blocked pump and a ring of God-knows-what around the spa.Now, despite the solar heating, checking the pool’s temperature shows it’s still too cold for a dip. And the test kit indicates its acid level is haywire again too. It’s a chemical balancing act Bruce has never managed to get his head around: the relationship between temperature, pH and all those other substances the pool needs to maintain its health, or rather its sterility and the health of the people who use it. But hiring someone else to maintain it instead would mean even more expense. He’ll just have to take a sample down to the hardware store.That’s where I come in. I’m a kind of pool doctor/drug dealer. I sell the chemicals so his pool can get its fix. Lots of chemicals. How many? On the shelves of the hardware store where I work we stock 37 different pool treatment options (as well as robot suction cleaners, extendable leaf scoops and floating drink trays).Chlorine is our bulk seller, of course, in liquid or granular form. The great thing about chlorine – for sales – is that it readily degrades, at rates dependent on temperature, UV and acidity, by turning into toxic hydrogen chloride gas. Though my analysis of his sample shows his pool needs severe chemical shock treatment, I’ll advise Bruce to go easy, as too much chlorine risks turning blond and silver hair a shade of chartreuse, or even causing someone excessive epidermal desquamation. He’d be even less popular then.Baking soda, steam and vinegar: how to clean up secondhand furnitureRead moreSo I’ll recommend Bruce adds soda ash to increase his pool’s pH, hydrochloric acid if he goes too far, calcium increaser to avoid metal corrosion and grout degradation, clarifier to treat the haze caused by excessive calcium levels, a four-step phosphate removal process to starve its microbial freeloaders (so hopefully he won’t have to drain the thing) then a solid dose of algaecide featuring words like “Blast” or “Attack” to massacre even the most “stubborn” algae species. Apart from green algae there’s also mustard and the dreaded black spot varieties.Then he’ll need a dose of liquid floc to transport the millions of successfully slaughtered microbes to the pump inlet; a filter cleaner for the resultant clog, and a black spot eliminator. And a stain remover, Bruce? For that awful spa ring? Add a filter degreaser since humans are greasy creatures and … oh, Bruce, not the pump! (Don’t even start Bruce on pumps.) That means he’ll need a special spanner to dismantle it and find out what blocked the bloody thing this time. Another golf ball? Mallard duckling? G-string? Live snake? Whew. Poor Bruce. Who’d have a pool.Really? You don’t have one? Lucky you.Explore more on these topicsHomesAustralian lifestyleSwimmingGardensSummercommentShareReuse this content"

When it opened its doors near Times Square in New York City, the “photomaton” – which produced pictures from a carefully orchestrated mechanical darkroom inside – was an instant hit. A reported280,000 peoplelined up to use it in the first six months.To mark 100 years,nine writers sharedtheir favourite photo booth pictures, and we asked Guardian readers to show us their favourites and tell us what they mean to them. Here are some of their stories.‘I’m older, my hair is greying, but when Johnny looks at me, part of him still sees the 20-year-old girl he was falling in love with in the photo booth’View image in fullscreenJackie Wesson: ‘There was something so special and meaningful about photo booths back then.’Photograph: Jackie Wesson/Guardian CommunityI met Johnny through friends in 1988; I wrote my name and telephone number on a parking ticket. We hadn’t been dating long when we went to a movie and there was a photo booth. We were still in that awkward dating phase, but we hopped in.View image in fullscreenJackie and Johnny Wesson in 1988.Photograph: Jackie Wesson/Guardian CommunityNow we’ve been together for 37 years, and married for 35. The beauty of being with someone since you were young is that you see each other, in many ways, as those same kids falling in love. I’m older, I’ve had two kids, my hair is greying, but when Johnny looks at me, a part of him still sees the 20-year-old girl he was falling in love with in the photo booth.There was something so special and meaningful about photo booths back then. Today’s ubiquity of digital photos detracts from how significant it was to capture a moment in time – to freeze it for posterity – and tuck the strip of four photos into a scrapbook or put on your dresser.Johnny still carries the parking ticket with my name and number in his wallet to this day. It has moved from wallet to wallet, and survived occasional washings, but it’s still there.Jackie Wesson, 57, attorney and law professor, Alabama, US‘This photo captured the fleeting nature of children growing up’View image in fullscreenPaula Wade: ‘Photo booths are instinctively fun, irreverent, built for moments of joy and freedom.’Photograph: Paula Wade/Guardian CommunityIn this photo, I’m 40. My daughter had just turned one, I was 10 weeks pregnant with my second daughter, and we were in Edmontonairporton our way to Rome on a family holiday. This photo was taken near the departure gate as we waited to board our flight.When our daughters were little, my now ex-husband and I went to photo booths with them whenever we could: photo booths are instinctively fun, irreverent, built for moments of joy and freedom. They captured the fleeting nature of children growing up, and many of these strips remain some of our most cherished photos.Having children had always been immensely important to me but I didn’t have my daughters until late in life. I ended up having them close together, and even though my second daughter is not visible here, I like to say that my complete joy in being a mother twice shines through.I’ve never felt more “me” than in this photo, and I’m so happy that it was taken in a photo booth: natural, unrehearsed, four different shots.Paula Wade, 55, writer and designer, Alberta, Canada‘She went in for a kiss as I was trying to ask: “Will you marry me?”’View image in fullscreenLaurence Dawes and his fiancee, Ellie, have built a large collection of photo booth pictures.Photograph: Laurence Dawes/Guardian CommunityView image in fullscreenLaurence Dawes asking his partner, Ellie, to marry him in a photo booth in Berlin.Photograph: Laurence Dawes/Guardian CommunityMy girlfriend Ellie and I moved to Berlin together in 2020. During lockdown, we loved just walking around the streets together – and the city is dotted with all these amazing ancient photo booths. Proper analogue ones, where you don’t see what you’re going to get. They can be a real gamble, but that’s the magic.We tried to get as many photo booth pictures as we could. By the time we moved back to London a couple years ago, we’d built quite a collection.When I decided I was going to propose, I wanted to do it somewhere sort of private, but fun. And we had a trip to Berlin planned. My friends thought my idea of a photo booth was perfect.All day I was nervously trying to navigate past one, but didn’t manage it until after dinner – when I convinced her to take a detour on the way home from seeing friends. She was totally shocked! She had no idea it was coming.In the first image, I’m faffing trying to get ring out my pocket. In the second, Ellie went in for a kiss as I was trying to ask: “Will you marry me?” In the third she’s shocked at seeing the ring. And in the fourth: It’s a yes!It was a bit chaotic, but I wouldn’t have had it any other way. That’s the charm of the photo booth: the chaos, unpredictability and fun.Laurence Dawes, 35, London, UK‘It’s about 1976 in Penarth … and reassuring to see the bond I had with my mother’It’s about 1976 in Penarth. It was a day at the seaside. My father was an artist and photographer who usually wandered off looking for inspiration while I had fun and laughter with my mother, Jane.View image in fullscreenSara Dunn found the photos with her mother, Jane, in a old tin decades later.Photograph: Sarah Dunn/Guardian CommunityIt’s my favourite because I found it in a box of belongings I had left behind in my home when I left at 18. My mother died when I was 21.I found the photo strip about 35 years later, when I was clearing the house after my father’s death, in a tin in my childhood bedroom. My daughter, who was then 20, was with me when I found it. I just dissolved into tears.View image in fullscreenSara Dunn: ‘It was so powerful, just this little folded-up bit of paper.’Photograph: Sara Dunn/Guardian CommunityIt was so powerful, just this little folded-up bit of paper. It was reassuring to see the bond with my mother was evident in the pictures: how much she loved me, and how much fun we had. Although the photos made me sad after all this time, I’m so grateful I discovered it.Sara Dunn, 55, Lincolnshire, UK‘This photo captures the urgency and fragility of gay love in the mid-80s’View image in fullscreenMatthew (left) and his then boyfriend snatched a farewell kiss in the photo booth.Photograph: Matthew Hodson/Guardian CommunityIt was the Christmas holidays in my first year at Leeds University in 1986. I had met a boy in the first term and we were dating.He lived in Windsor and I lived in Wandsworth, London. Neither of us was out to our families at the time and homophobia was heightened in the buildup to section 28.The iceberg/tombstone Aids campaign was just starting, and so gays were not only despised by many, but we were also feared.He and I met up in central London and spent a day together, but we were unable to hold hands or demonstrate affection. When the time came for him to get his train home, we slipped into a photo booth so that we’d have pictures of each other – but also so that we could have some privacy to say goodbye to each other properly.For me, this picture captures the urgency and fragility of gay love in the mid-80s.Although our relationship lasted under a year, we remain close friends. We mean very different things to each other now, but our bond has endured.Matthew Hodson, 58, actor and HIV advocate, London‘We had a good laugh at that photo’View image in fullscreenDougald, his wife, Emma, and daughter, Madeleine, in the photo that now takes pride of place on their fridge.Photograph: Dougald O’Reilly/Guardian CommunityThe photo was taken in 2014 while I was on a sabbatical in Paris. We were passing through a part of the underground, I believe, and saw a photo booth, deciding it would be fun to get a quick picture. The photo shows my wife, Emma, and daughter, Madeleine, who was four or five months old at the time.We all had a good laugh at the results from the photo booth, particularly the surprise on Madeleine’s face when the flash went off. In fact, I plan to use it as the cover of a book I am writing on the family history for Madeleine.View image in fullscreenThe family were in Paris when the photos were taken.Photograph: Dougald O’Reilly/Guardian CommunityMadeleine, who is now 12 years old, loves the photo and finds it very funny, especially her double chin. We look at it often, as it’s on the door of our refrigerator.Dougald O’Reilly, late 50s, archaeologist, Canberra, Australia‘We look back upon that time with such nostalgia and fondness’View image in fullscreenTommy (bottom left corner in green tie) and his wife, Aimee (centre, in floral headpiece), in a group shot on their wedding day.Photograph: Tommy Vinh Bui/Guardian CommunityThis photo is of us at our wedding in September 2024. We had hired a photo booth for the reception, which was a lot of fun – you can see my wife “scissoring” my nose.Just a couple of months later, in November, we found out we were expecting twins, so that domestic bliss of being married was very short before we were preparing for parenthood.The photo strip was taken at our friends’ wedding earlier this year and neatly captures a whimsical moment in our lives: a snapshot of peak merriment. My wife, Aimee, was in her third trimester, and she had that perpetual maternal glow, and I was levitating at our fast track to seeming adulthood. We look back upon that time with such nostalgia and fondness. And it wasn’t even that long ago.View image in fullscreenTommy and Aimee larking about in a phone booth at their friends’ wedding reception.Photograph: Tommy Vinh Bui/Guardian CommunityThese fancy-free shenanigans and brouhahas live forevermore festooned on our fridge, which is like a photo album.It’s a ceaseless party every time I gaze upon the pictures, and I can’t help but flail my limbs in dancerly glee every time I’m in the kitchen.Tommy Vinh Bui, 39, librarian, Los Angeles, California, USA‘I felt a strong need to document us’View image in fullscreenStef and Max made many trips to the photo booth.Photograph: Stef McCargar/Guardian CommunityIn the late 1990s my kid Max and I often cycled to the local five-and-dime store to hit up their photo booth after my cancer diagnosis. I felt a strong need to document “us” for Max’s sake, as he was so young – he wasn’t quite four at the time. I had a terrible prognosis and thought I was checking out soon. I have a stack of photos from the booth at that time.My hair was just starting to grow back in these photos, and I was trying to experience my son and happiness and joy, and we do look happy and joyful in spite of it all. I love our intertwined hands and glee.I had gone to a professional photographer, but didn’t like the photos of the two of us as they looked so stagnant and staged. I loved the spontaneity of photo booths – you never know exactly when the light is going to go, and they always capture something surprising or ridiculous.Although the shop is long gone, I’m still so grateful for that photo booth.Love can zero you into the moment and capture what is most real. I love this photo for doing just that.Stef McCargar, 64, Portland, Oregon, USAThe Photographers’ Gallery in London is marking the centenary of the photo booth withStrike a Pose: 100 Years of the Photobooth, until 22 February 2026Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePhotography (Art and design)Photography (Technology)RelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus: a burger that lives up to the hypeSign up here for our weekly food newsletter, FeastFelicity CloakeFri 14 Nov 2025 07.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 07.32 ESTShareIf I’d ever spared a thought for how chestnuts – the sweet, edible kind, not the combative horsey sort – were harvested, I would probably have conjured rosy-cheeked peasants bent low in ancient forests and filling rough-hewn hessian sacks by hand. Back-breaking labour, sure, but so picturesque!I was delighted, therefore, while on a writing retreat in Umbria last month, to get the opportunity to watch an elderly couple manoeuvre a giant vacuum around their haphazard orchard, followed by their furious sheepdog. The fallen crop was sucked into a giant fan that spat their bristly jackets back out on to the ground, and the nuts then went to be sorted by other family members on a conveyor belt in the barn – the good ones to be sold in the shell, the less perfect specimens swiftly dropped into a bucket for processing.Later in the week, a lorry turned up in the village square to pick up bags from other small local producers, and that evening I roasted a pan of chestnuts on the fire with new appreciation, while loudly bemoaning the disappearance from the streets of London of the chestnut sellers of my childhood (though this makes me sound positively Dickensian, I can confirm that I’m talking aboutthiscentury. Note also thatNigel Slater is less starry-eyed on the subject.)If you’ve never eaten chestnuts hot from the shell – or if, like me, it’s been a while since you’ve done so – I urge you to seek them out, even just once. The vacuum-packed, ready-cooked and peeled sort are, of course, extremely convenient, and ideal for the likes of Jacob Kenedy’s grandmother’sbraised quail with chestnuts, or hisdad’s boozy montebianco dessert, but they’re a quite different beast from the sweetly smoky, roasted variety, so fresh that you scald your fingers on them and don’t care. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstallhas some sage advice (and a sagey chestnut stuffing recipe)on the subject from 2006, and I doubt much has changed in that department in the past 20 years.View image in fullscreenNuts about … Yotam Ottolenghi’s buttery chestnut frangipane tart.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The GuardianThough the season’s over by then, the nut’s association with Christmas means that net bags of chestnuts have already made their annual appearance in greengrocers and supermarkets, no doubt as much for their decorative value as their fibre content. My editor has yet to be convinced of the chestnut’s merits – mealy, he says. And, indeed, they were oncean important subsistence starchin hilly regions such as Umbria and Tuscany, where to this day the ground nuts pop up in cakes (OK,this one’s Ligurian) andcookies(such as Giuseppe Dell’Anno’s castagnotti, pictured top), pasta (Giorgio Locatelli has a lovely soundingrecipe with wild mushrooms), breads and soups (such as this Rachel Roddy number). But I’d argue that any such tendency to powderiness is, like so many issues in life, helped by the liberal addition of fat, as proved by Yotam Ottolenghi’sbuttery chestnut frangipane tart, Angela Hartnett’ssmoky bacon and ricotta fettuccineand Rachel’sbuttery rice with pumpkin and sage.As a one-woman chestnut marketing board for Britain, I hope this tempting selection makes it clear that the chestnut is not just for Christmas. Even Nigel’s inspiredsausage and sauerkraut takefrom 2022 or Yotam’s satisfyingly namedstuffing muffinsfrom 2017 would work with a roast chicken or an equally seasonal game bird such as Blanche Vaughan’spot-roast pheasant.So, if you spot some chestnuts at the shops this weekend, hoover them up.

There’s something about them that’s just inherently cosy and wholesome, and this one in particular is perfect for the colder months, not least because it’s simple and sturdy in the very best way. It’d be right at home with a coffee for breakfast, as well as gently warmed in a pan with butter and served with hot custard on a rainy evening. A real all-rounder.Apple, brown butter and oat loafPrep5 minCook1 hr 25 minServes8180g unsalted butter200g light muscovado sugar2 large eggs50gsoured cream210g plain flour½ tsp cinnamon40g porridge oats, plus extra to finish1½ tsp baking powder¼ tsp salt2 eating apples2 tbsp demerara sugarHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line a 2lb loaf tin. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then simmer until it turns a deep amber colour and smells fragrant. Take off the heat, pour it brown bits and all into a heatproof bowl and leave to cool.Once the butter is at room temperature, stir in the sugar, followed by the eggs, followed by the soured cream.In a second bowl, mix the flour, cinnamon, porridge oats, baking powder and salt. Pour in the butter mix and stir to make a smooth batter. Pour in 60ml hot water and stir to combine.Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and remove the cores. Set aside two apple quarters for the topping, then slice the rest into thin semi-circles. Fold these into the batter until they’re evenly dispersed.Spoon the batter into the lined tin. Thinly slice the reserved apple quarters and arrange them neatly on top of the batter. Sprinkle over the demerara sugar and a few extra oats, then bake for 55-65 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool completely before slicing and serving.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingCakeFruitAutumn food and drinkDessertBreakfastrecipesShareReuse this content"

The exterior ofPalazzo Abadessa, tucked away in the sleepy backstreets of the Cannaregio district, is low key enough, but the grandeur and opulence begin to hit your senses as you explore. First we strolled through the lush ornamental garden, then the huge entrance hall decorated with frescoes and Renaissance paintings going back to the golden age of Venice, lit by glittering Murano chandeliers. The reception area is furnished with an antique velvet armchair, perfect for sipping a prosecco or Venetian spritz. Back in the 16th century, the original owners provided Venice with two of its doges, and today the stone corridors and high-ceilinged rooms have a classy, noble air, as if the ghosts of Caravaggio or Tintoretto might appear any moment and begin painting. Breakfast of cappuccino and croissants in the courtyard served by the friendly owners was a delightful way to start the day.AprilProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

It has been lovingly restored by the family who provide a fantastic residential cookery school, plus interesting outings and adventures. A once-in-a-lifetime experience.Christine MasonA beautifully restored manor in RomaniaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cristian RaduSitting above the Romanian village ofMâlâncravin Transylvania, the 18th-centuryApafi Manoris a beautifully restored manor house next to one of the region’s most exquisite Saxon fortified churches. At the end of a lush forested valley, the grand but comfortable interiors by the British designer David Mlinaric feature historic local art and furniture, making you feel as if you have stepped into a 19th-century historical novel. Enjoy candlelit dinners on the veranda made by a cook from the village, and while away afternoons in the magnificent library. It sleeps up to nine, and reasonable prices make for an affordable and magical retreat.BenjaminA castle above the Danube in GermanyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Markus Keller/Getty ImagesIf you fancy going medieval, then this 13th-century castle perched on a cliff overlooking the Danube in Baden-Württemberg should satisfy. We arrived atWildenstein Castle youth hostelvia a punishing zigzag cycle up the near-vertical outcrop, having ridden from the grand old river’s source in the Black Forest. The whitewashed walls conceal a large courtyard with comfy rooms and a great tavern in a crypt. The panoramic setting provides brilliant views across theUpper Danube nature parkand wonderful sunsets. It is reputedly haunted, and exploring the passages and alleyways for ghosts is great fun for all. The abundant breakfast had plenty of delicious pastries, fuel for the next leg of our cycle.Matt LuntStay in a pineapple in ScotlandView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Landmark TrustIt is hard to explainthe Pineapple. Stay to appreciate this 18th-century tribute to a fruit and the rise and fall of an estate. It is perched on the Dunmore Estate near Stirling, and was the location of our first Landmark Trust holiday. One wing contains two bedrooms and a bathroom, separated from the simple kitchen and comfortable living room by the Pineapple tower. It’s certainly quirky – walking across the lawn to the loo was a novelty for four nights. It’s dog-friendly and sleeps four, with historic reading and logbooks dating back to 1970s offering entertainment in the absence of TV and wifi.BereniceFirst world war history in BelgiumView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dirk DebleuIn the city of Poperinge, one of the few Belgian towns that did not fall to the Germans in the first world war,Talbot Housewas transformed into a club to offer relief to British soldiers. The house has been very well preserved by knowledgeable volunteers, and the chapel in the attic is a very special place of remembrance. The rooms and breakfast are lovely and very much in the spirit of the original club.Zoe LeonardCourtyard apartments in SevilleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Manuel MuñozSevilleis steeped in historic hotels, but most were more than my budget.Corral del Condewas surprisingly affordable and near the city centre. It’s a 16th-centurycorral(although it has Mudéjar origins in the medieval period) – a traditional community of apartments around a courtyard, with shared ovens and laundry sinks – and it’s incredibly pretty. It is a particularly evocative place for any fans of Spanish golden age theatre, because stages would be built in thesecorralesand locals would watch performances from the wooden balconies. For contrast, it’s a short walk from the giant mushrooms of Las Setas, a very different (and more modern) structure made of wood.Sarah CollingsAn old station in StaffordshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: John Miller/The Landmark TrustOur stay with children and older relatives atAlton station, a Landmark trust property in Staffordshire, was both exciting and relaxing. It has glorious Victorian features, including stunning Minton tiles, and one of the bedrooms was the ticket office. It is incredibly interesting for railway enthusiasts, and leisurely bike rides down the disused railway were enjoyed by all.EsmeFishers’ cabins in NorwayView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Calix/AlamyTouring the Lofoten and Vesteralen islands of Norway, we stayed in several historic fishers’ cabins, but the best place was a little wooden house in Andenes. It is traditionally furnished in 19th-century style and forms part of a small private museum.Alma Houseis redolent of a time when life for fishing communities was isolated and dangerous, but time at home was precious. Like many holiday rentals in Norway, you may have to share with other holidaymakers, but that only adds to the unique experience.NoelleWinning tip: Parador paradise in SpainView image in fullscreenWe travelled to theExtremaduracity of Cáceres for the St George’s Day celebrations – a torchlit parade of dragons crafted by people all over the city, followed by the biggest dragon being set on fire. But the star of the visit was theParador hotel– a combination of gothic, Renaissance and baroque architecture. Cáceres is famous for its unspoilt old town (it features in Game of Thrones) and it made all the difference to feel part of it in our own medieval palace. We slept under a classically Spanish gilded, beamed ceiling, and sat out on our balcony looking over the town, and couldn’t believe how lucky we were.RosalindView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsHotelsReaders' travel tipsSelf-cateringTop 10sEurope holidaysCultural tripsShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It has been an epic year for fruit. My strawberry patch – which had been mediocre at best until this season – flourished in those extremely sunny spring days. Not only did we pick more fruit, but the strawberries were larger and sweeter than those of previous years. And even when the fruit had dwindled, the runners – the new plants emerging from the parent plant – just kept coming. They’ve stretched out from their original site, romped into the path and rooted into a neighbour’s bed.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Strawberry plants will produce fruit for a good three to four years and then start to slow down, so when you’ve reached this point it’s a good idea to replant your patch. You can do this with newly bought plants (a wise choice if yours are showing signs of disease or vulnerability) or by relocating the new runners that have appeared this season.It’s always advisable tomove your strawberry patch to a new locationif possible to avoid the possibility of disease buildup or the risk ofreplant disease. This insufficiently understood problem describes how new plants can struggle to grow in soil that previously hosted plants of the same kind. Choose a sunny spot (although strawberries will tolerate some shade) and mulch generously with compost as they like fertile soil that drains well. Having said that, my runners are rooting happily into the fairly dense clay of the veg patch’s paths, so I suspect they’re more formidable than we realise.Choose the sturdiest, healthiest plants to transplant and dispense with any that show signs of ailingIt’s easy to identify a strawberry plant that’s ready to transplant if you follow the tentacle-like stems to where they’ve touched the ground and a new cluster of jagged-edged leaves is growing. Using a fork, gently ease the plant out of the ground and install it into its new location. Plants can also be potted up into containers filled with compost and placed somewhere sheltered to wait to move to their new home. In fact, strawberries grow well in large containers and benefit from the ripe fruit being kept off the ground as they are susceptible to rot when left in contact with moist soil. Choose the sturdiest, healthiest plants to transplant and dispense with any that show signs of ailing, like deformities or black spots on their leaves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But if the ground where you are has frozen hard, consider putting this job off until early spring. If the winter weather takes a harsh turn, I’ll likely mulch my new strawberry patch with straw to protect the plants as they find their feet. And I’ll be crossing my fingers for a sunny start to next season and another bumper year for strawberries.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensFruitFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A pastor who was allowed to meet the passengers while they were stuck on the plane said it was extremely hot and that children were screaming and crying. A humanitarian group intervened to offer accommodation and support and the authorities then cleared 130 members of the group for entry under a standard 90-day visa exemption, while the other 23 had already departed for other destinations. It was not clear where their journey originated.

He said the group had been admitted to the country “out of compassion” but that “the details” of their situation would be investigated.“We obviously need to look at the origins [of the Palestinians’ journey], where it started, the reason why they’ve been brought here.”Details about how the group left Gaza remain elusive but the Gift of the Givers Foundation, a local nonprofit working in disaster response, said it was the second plane carrying Palestinians to land in South Africa in the last two weeks.“The Palestinians had no idea where they were bundled off to, only when in Kenya did they realise they were coming to South Africa. Some had visas for Canada, Australia and Malaysia, they were eventually permitted to leave for those countries,” said Imtiaz Sooliman, the chair and founder of Gift of the Givers.The Palestinian embassy in South Africa said the travel of both groups “was arranged by an unregistered and misleading organisation that exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner”.The pastor who was allowed the plane while it was on the tarmac told the national broadcaster SABC: “When I came on to the plane it was excruciatingly hot. There were lots of children just sweating and screaming and crying.”The episode has revived debate over South Africa’s approach to the war in Gaza. The country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa, has largely been supportive of the Palestinian cause and criticised Israel’s war with Hamas. The government filed a case against Israel with the international court of justice in 2023, accusing it of genocide in the Palestinian territory. Civil society movements, inspired by South Africa’s anti-apartheid legacy, actively organise solidarity campaigns, boycotts, and aid efforts for Palestinians.The prolonged delay on the tarmac has led some South Africans to accuse the government of being slow to act on its proclaimed support. Others see the lack of information about the flights as worrying for national security.Later on Friday, Leon Schreiber, the home affairs minister, said none of the travellers fromPalestinehad applied for asylum.“Once satisfied that the absence of certain elements from their itinerary would not leave them destitute in South Africa in the absence of any asylum claims, the travellers were granted entry into South Africa on the standard 90-day visa exemption, subject to compliance with the standard conditions,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaPalestineGazaAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Seif collected the award on behalf of her brother and mother.Speaking at the event, Seif said: “I wish my brother could be here tonight to accept this award. I wish he could be reunited with his son, Khaled, in Brighton.“But on Tuesday morning we went to Cairo airport together to come to London, and he was stopped by Egyptian authorities at passport control and they refused to allow him to travel with me.”Abd el-Fattah has conducted interviews about his experience of freedom in the British press, including the Guardian as well in the Egyptian dissident press. He had indicated he needed time to think about his future.His son, Khaled, is 13 and lives with his mother in Brighton where he attends a special educational needs school. When Abd el-Fattah was released, Khaled visited him in Egypt, but he has returned to Brighton.Soueif conducted a 287-day hunger strike to press for the release of her son, which she started on 29 September 2024 after Egyptian authorities failed to release him at the end of his latest five-year sentence. Abd el-Fattah had been imprisoned for “spreading fake news” after sharing a Facebook post about torture in Egypt.Soueif ended her hunger strike on Monday 14 July 2025 after 287 days without food. During this time she was in St Thomas’ hospital in London and came close to death on two occasions, in late February and June 2025.Explore more on these topicsEgyptHuman rightsAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Eventually the activists relocated to a building to hold further discussions with Corrêa do Lago.What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it? And who gets it?Read moreThese protests are just a small part of what is expected at the Belém summit. For the first time in four years, the UN climate conference is being held in a democracy, and senior figures at theCop30conference centre have encouraged the presence of civil society groups.The UN secretary general, António Guterres,told the Guardianthat Indigenous and other people’s organisations were needed to balance the power of corporate lobbyists, who have dominated recent summits. One in every 25 participants at this year’s summit is a fossil fuel lobbyist, according to analysis by theKick Big Polluters Outcoalition.Meanwhile, Corrêa do Lago has said civil society will play an important role in raising the ambition of negotiators.That spirit pervades the conference and the meetings around it. For days, activists have flooded into Belém, many borne by boat along the Amazon River. On Wednesday, more than 100 vessels sailed in a protest flotilla up and down Guajará Bay close to the Federal University of Pará, which has become the venue for a “people’s summit” running alongside the main climate talks.On Saturday, two inflatable serpents representing the spirit of resistance at Cop30 will be carried along the streets of the city, as thousands of Indigenous and other civil society activists remind jetsetting delegates where this Cop is taking place: the Amazon, the global frontline of environmental destruction and forest defence.Activists argue that at best the Cop climate summits are a forum where the concerns of the developing world can be expressed in the full glare of media attention and relayed back to civil society in the global north.More than four events a day are being organised, ranging from protests against agribusinesses, transport projects and mining operations to rallies for Palestine, health, women’s rights and Indigenous land demarcation.One demand that has emerged from civil society groups this year is a call for a new formalised body, the so-called Belém Action Mechanism (Bam), which would accelerate, coordinate and support a “just transition” towards a low-carbon economy and “orient the entire international system behind people-centred transitions at local and national levels, where workers and communities are in charge of decisions that affect their lives and livelihoods”, according to the Climate Action Network.The vast majority of events have been peaceful and some joyous, including a performance by the celebrated Brazilian musician Gilberto Gil.Raoni Metuktire, the leader of the Indigenous Kayapó people, told the Guardian: “I think the first Cop meeting in the Amazon can help the forest. We haven’t had an opportunity like this before. We can talk about what’s happening, the destruction, the deforestation … For a long time I have been telling the world that if we continue destroying everything on this earth, there will be many consequences, there will be chaos on this earth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The Cop coming to Brazil has shown that spirit. We have seen Indigenous people becoming part of the process in a way that just isn’t possible in the global north.”Luiza Salek, with the working group on Indigenous food sovereignty, said it was good to be part of the fight. She was singing “Bam Bam Bam Bam” to the tune of La Bamba with dozens of others in the hallway of the Cop to draw attention to the Belém Action Network, which wants leaders to step up their climate actions.“After three Cops with absolutely no demonstrations allowed, I feel like people want to be heard,” she said. “We are all together and mobilising. We are in a democratic country where we can take actions. And this feels good. We need to be together collectively.”Inside the conference halls, negotiations continued. On Thursday the official negotiating hours were extended to 9pm in order to deal with the four particularly thorny issues on which the presidency is taking special consultation. These are focused on finance, trade, emissions-cutting pledges and transparency.A similar extension is expected on Friday night, but in practice the talks could go on much later as Brazil strives to achieve progress in the consultations ahead of a stocktake session on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsCop30Indigenous peoplesBrazilGlobal climate talksClimate crisisAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But those plans, which include mines and natural gas export, heavily favour investment in a resource-based economy that falls short on projects that experts say could change the day-to-day lives of Canadians – and reimagine the country’s future.Carney told reporters the projects were “transformational” and will help the country realize “full potential as an energy superpower” while also finding new markets outside the United States.Carney made the announcement in Terrace, British Columbia, at the site of a proposed C$6bn, 280-mile power line.The line is meant to secure tens of billions of dollars in private-sector investments, including a string of critical-mineral mines, for the sparsely developed north-west corner of the province. The federal government’s hope is that it fends off economic threats fromDonald Trumpwhose trade war with one of his closest allies has threatened to plunge the Canadian economy into a recession.The first batch of five projects were announced in Septemberand included critical mineral mines and natural gas projects.In addition to the power line, Carney also flagged a BC LNG project, a nickel project in Ontario, a mine in New Brunswick, a graphite battery project in Quebec and a hydroelectric project in Iqaluit. He also announced a “conservation corridor” between north-west BC and the Yukon territory roughly the size of Greece.“The signal the government is sending is that Canada is a resource economy and that we will continue to invest in being a resource economy. It really signals the government’s view that Canada’s strength in the world is its ability to sell those resources,” said Shoshanna Saxe, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto. “And I don’t think that’s wrong. But it feels as though there’s a chance for the government to invest in a new and forward-looking version of Canada.”The latest list of projects again omits any new oil pipelines, which have proven to be deeply divisive and politically fractious in recent years.Also absent is a proposed tunnel under the country’s busiest highway which had been pitched by the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, but was dismissed by critics as fantasy. Ford’s provincial government is spending C$9m to study how the tunnel might one day be built.Pipeline expansion and the tunnel project could have scored Carney political points in Alberta and Ontario, but they would probably take far longer than the 2030 deadline the federal government has put in place.“If you want to do things fast, you need to go after projects that are already under way and have reasonably fast returns. Most heavy infrastructure can’t be built really quickly, but you can do a lot of light infrastructure projects with speed,” said Saxe. “And these make sense as an economic play – especially given the uncertainty in future relationships with the United States.”But Saxe said there could be a broader discussion of “what is possible” when it comes to investments from the federal government.“You could imagine a government that sees the narrative of a sovereignty threat and the need to be fully independent,” she said. And they could say: “We won’t be dependent on the old way of doing things and so we’re going to rapidly invest in new ways of doing things that improve people’s day-to-day lives.”She pointed to a “huge infrastructure deficit” when it comes to water systems, bridges, public transit and housing.“There are light things we can do that we could do at scale on a national level. And it would require the movement and engagement that we imagine occurred in the postwar period and after the Depression,” she said. “And at the moment, the federal government is not asking us to engage in changing the basic way Canada works. They’re saying we’re going to continue to invest in the old strengths of Canada. But you’re still left wondering what is possible.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasInfrastructureDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan. Long live peace,” Maduro, 62, declared late on Thursday as he pushed his way through crowds to reach a pro-government rally.Hours after the Venezuelan leader spoke, Hegseth sought to pile further pressure on Venezuela’s leader, announcing what he called Operation Southern Spear.“The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth tweeted. He said the Southern Command mission would defend “our homeland” and secure it from “the drugs that are killing our people”.It is unclear why Hegseth made the announcement now, 10 months after the US Naval Forces Southern Commanddeclaredthe impending launch of the operation, which it said would use “a heterogeneous mix of robotic and autonomous systems to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking” in the Caribbean.Hegseth’s comments could perhaps have been a headline-grabbing effort to rebrand Trump’s pressure campaign against Maduro, which has involved a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.Chart of civilian deaths from US airstrikes on vessels in the Caribbean and PacificOfficially, the massive US deployment is part of the Trump administration’s “war on drugs” and designed to stop Latin America drug cartels “flooding” the US with cocaine and fentanyl.But Venezuela is not a cocaine producer – that work is done almost entirely in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru – nor is it part of the fentanyl smuggling network, which is focused on Mexico.Stakes rise as Trump deploys world’s largest aircraft carrier to the CaribbeanRead moreAs a result, many observers have come to see Trump’s deployment – the largest in the regionsince the 1989 invasion of Panama– as a political crusade devised to achieve something the US president failed to do during his first term: overthrow Maduro.CBS News reportedthis week that senior military officials had handed Trump “options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land”, although two sources insisted no final decision had been made.Venezuela’s foreign minister, Yván Gil, sent a defiant message to “the North American empire”. “Don’t you dare [attack]. We are ready,” he said.Amid growing speculation that an aerial attack on Venezuelan soil was imminent, Reuters said Maduro’s regime had drawn up plans for “a guerrilla-style response” to any US assault.Those plans reportedly envisage “small military units at more than 280 locations carrying out acts of sabotage and other guerrilla tactics” to repel foreign fighters.Under a second strategy, described as “anarchisation”, pro-regime groups including the intelligence services would sow chaos on the streets of Caracas “and make Venezuela ungovernable for foreign forces”, two sources told Reuters.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS foreign policyTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She added that it “could have been averted”.The ruling bringsabout 600,000 Braziliansa step closer to securing compensation of about £36bn. It addressed only the legal liability for the disaster. A second phase of the trial will determine damages.The Australia-based BHP, which is also listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it intended to appeal against the decision and would continue to defend against the UK group action.Brazil dam disaster: firm knew of potential impact months in advanceRead moreBHP owns 50% of Samarco, the Brazilian company that operates the iron ore mine where the tailings dam ruptured on 5 November 2015, releasing more than 40m cubic metres of mining waste into the Doce River in south-easternBrazil.Sludge from the burst dam destroyed the village of Bento Rodrigues in Minas Gerais state and badly damaged other towns. The disaster also killed 14 tonnes of freshwater fish and damaged 370 miles (600km) of the Doce River, according to a study by the Ulster University in the UK. The river, which the Krenak Indigenous people revere as a deity, has yet to recover.The trial, which began in October last year, was filed in Britain because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time. It began only days before Brazil’s federal government reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the mining companies.Under the agreement, Samarco, which is also half owned by the Brazilian mining company Vale, agreed to pay 132bn reais (£19bn) over 20 years. The payments were meant to compensate for human, environmental and infrastructure damage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The overall number is smaller this year than at Cop29 in Baku (1,773) and Cop28 in Dubai (2,456), but the proportion is higher this year as the Belém summit is less well-attended.It brings the total number of fossil fuel lobbyists given access to the UN climate summits to 7,000 over the past five years, a period marked by a rise in catastrophic extreme weather, disinformation and oil and gas profits.“Another Cop, same playbook. This is corporate capture, not climate governance,” said Lien Vandamme, senior campaigner on human rights and climate change at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).Another Cop, same playbook. This is corporate capture, not climate governanceLien Vandamme, Center for International Environmental LawThe annual climate talks opened in Belém on Monday, with Brazil’s PresidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvadisavowing disinformation and declaring that it would be the “Cop of truth”.Yet the fossil fuel industry, which has a long history of spreading misinformation and disinformation while blocking meaningful climate action, received almost 60% more passes to Cop30 than the 10 mostclimate-vulnerable nationscombined (1,061), according to analysis by KBPO, an international coalition of 450 organizations.Climate breakdown is escalating. In the lead-up toCop30, hundreds of people were killed after two powerful typhoons wreaked havoc less than a week apart in the Philippines – a country that has been hit by 21 significant storms this year alone. Fossil fuel-affiliated lobbyists outnumber official delegates from the Philippines by nearly 50 to 1, and Iran, where severe drought could force the government to evacuate the capital, Tehran, by 44 to 1.Meanwhile, it is expected to cost Jamaica billions of dollars and years to recover from Hurricane Melissa, a category 5 storm turbocharged by global heating, yet fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered the island nation’s delegation by 40 to 1.In July, the international court of justice (ICJ) ruled that continued fossil fuel expansion, extraction, consumption and subsidies may constitute an internationally wrongful act.“After the ICJ advisory opinion and the well-document six-decade playbook of climate obstruction, states at Cop should recognize the irreconcilable conflict of interest of the fossil fuel industry – which is similar to the tobacco industry,” said Elisa Morgera, the UN special rapporteur for climate change who supports aglobal ban on fossil fuel lobbying.The findings come as 2025 is set to become among the hottest years on record, yet states are failing to regulate polluting corporations and cut subsidies,with nearly $250bn earmarked for new oil and gas projects since Cop29.“From the halls of the UNFCCC to our lands and territories, fossil fuel corporations are wrecking our communities and environment. Yet the red carpet is rolled out for thousands of lobbyists to roam the corridors,” said Nerisha Baldevu from Friends of the Earth Africa.Fossil fuel corporations are wrecking our communities. Yet the red carpet is rolled out for lobbyists to roam the corridorsNerisha Baldevu, Friends of the Earth AfricaThe latest findings will pile further pressure on the UN to ban the fossil fuel industry from the annual climate action summits, where world leaders are supposed to negotiate in good faith and agree on ambitious plans to curtail climate catastrophe.Last week,the Guardian revealed that 57% of all oil and gasproduction last year came from 90 fossil fuel firms that sent substantial numbers of lobbyists to the UN climate talks from 2021 to 2024.A recentinvestigation by Drilled Mediarevealed that oil companies, with the help of the US government, first co-opted the international climate stage in the early 1970s, influencing the eventual drafting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, and every conference of the parties (Cop) to that convention since then.KBPO analyzed the provisional list of participants at Cop30 published by the UNFCCC, identifying delegates representing oil, gas and coal companies, trade groups, financial institutions and others that fund or financially benefit from obstructing climate action to phase out planet-heating fuels.The 1,602 fossil fuel lobbyists identified include 148 with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC); 60 with the International Emissions Trading Association (Ieta), including delegates from oil and gas giants ExxonMobil, BP and TotalEnergies; and 41 with the Brazilian National Confederation of Industry (BNCI).The ICC said only three of the 148 business representatives they accredited are from fossil fuel firms. “We do not represent any one sector. And we pride ourselves in bringing a delegation to COP that represents the full diversity of the business community,” said Andrew Wilson, ICC deputy secretary general.Several big polluters from the global north invited fossil fuel representatives to join their official delegations including France, which brought 22 industry delegates including the CEO of TotalEnergies, and Norway, whose group included six senior executives from its national oil and gas giant Equinor.Overall, only Brazil, with 3,805 delegates, has a bigger presence than oil, gas and coal interests.World still on track for catastrophic 2.6C temperature rise, report findsRead moreBut the true extent of fossil fuel influence is likely to be higher, as more than half of all country delegation members at Cop30 withheld or obscured details of their affiliations, according to a separate analysis by Transparency International. Russia, Tanzania, South Africa and Mexico are among the countries that did not disclose the affiliation of any official delegates.After years of campaigning by civil society groups, Cop delegates were this year required to publicly disclose who was funding their participation – and confirm that their objectives were in alignment with the UNFCCC. But the new transparency requirement excludes anyone in official government delegations or overflows; also, calls forstricter conflict-of-interestprotections to cut industry influence have not been adequately heeded, advocates say.“While local Indigenous peoples struggled to enter the conference, fossil fuel lobbyists walked in freely. My generation deservesJust Transitionpolicies that reflect what people and the planet need, not what polluters’ profits demand,” said Pim Sullivan-Tailyour of the UK Youth Climate Coalition. “The UNFCCC is in need of rehabilitation.”“Fossil fuel companies continue to lead us into a climate abyss. [Yet] for 30 years, climate change summits have been an ideal stage for oil companies to clean up their image, do business and find new ways to get away with environmental crimes,” said Ivonne Yáñez from Acción Ecológica [Ecological Action], a non-profit environmental group in Ecuador where oil drilling is expanding across the Amazon.“Today, instead of transitioning to post-oil societies, they want to extract every last drop of fossil fuels to continue feeding the capitalist system and genocidal wars.”A UNFCCC spokesperson said: “As of 2023, measures have been taken to enhance transparency so that it’s clearer who participates at Cop. We have done this in consultation with civil society and other stakeholders. Just as no single Cop can be expected to solve the climate crisis overnight, making further concrete improvements is an ongoing journey, noting that national governments have sole authority to decide who is in their delegations.”Ieta and the BNCI declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsCop30Oil and gas companiesFossil fuelsBrazilAmericasEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think – if we don’t make AI regulation a national priority tomorrow,” the US senator Chris Murphywroteon X in response to the findings.“AI systems can now perform tasks that previously required skilled human operators,” said Fred Heiding, a computing security researcher at Harvard University. “It’s getting so easy for attackers to cause real damage. The AI companies don’t take enough responsibility.”Other cybersecurity experts were more sceptical, pointing to inflated claims about AI-fuelled cyber-attacks in recent years – such asan AI-powered “password cracker”from 2023 that performed no better than conventional methods – and suggesting Anthropic was trying to create hype around AI.“To me, Anthropic is describing fancy automation, nothing else,” said Michał Woźniak, an independent cybersecurity expert. “Code generation is involved, but that’s not ‘intelligence’, that’s just spicy copy-paste.”Woźniak said Anthropic’s release was a distraction from a bigger cybersecurity concern: businesses and governments integrating “complex, poorly understood” AI tools into their operations without understanding them, exposing them to vulnerabilities. The real threat, he said, were cybercriminals themselves – and lax cybersecurity practices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it said, the hackers were able to subvert these guardrails by telling Claude to role-play being an “employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm” conducting tests.Woźniak said: “Anthropic’s valuation is at around $180bn, and they still can’t figure out how not to have their tools subverted by a tactic a 13-year-old uses when they want to prank-call someone.”Marius Hobbhahn, the founder of Apollo Research, a company that evaluates AI models for safety, said the attacks were a sign of what could come as capabilities grow.“I think society is not well prepared for this kind of rapidly changing landscape in terms of AI and cyber capabilities.

Much of that was in the form of loans, rather than grants.Some LDCs received more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, whose repayment terms can push governments further into debt traps. The share of loans rose to 95% or more in the cases of Bangladesh and Angola.Most of the world’s developed countries provide finance to support climate action in developing ones, bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as development banks. At a UN summit in Copenhagen in 2009, rich countries promised to mobilise $100bn (£76bn) a year by 2020 in recognition of their greater responsibility for climate breakdown and ability to fund solutions.But the analysis of the most recent submissions, covering more than 20,000 global projects during 2021 and 2022 – the year in which the Copenhagen target was belatedly met, found that vast sums were going to petrostates, as well as toChina, the world’s second-largest economy.UAE, a fossil fuel exporter with a GDP per capita on a par with France and Canada, received more than $1bn in loans from Japan that were logged as climate finance. The projects include $625m for an offshore electricity transmission project in Abu Dhabi and $452m for a waste incinerator in Dubai.View image in fullscreenDubai, UAE. It has been granted a $452m (£343m) climate loan by Japan for a waste incinerator project.Photograph: Abdel Hadi Ramahi/ReutersSaudi Arabia, which is one of the top 10 carbon emitters thanks to its giant oilfields and majority-ownership of Aramco, received about $328m in Japanese loans, including $250m to its electricity company and $78m for a solar farm.Six countries in the Balkans that hope to join the EU received more than $3.5bn in climate finance. The bulk of the money went to Serbia, which on a per capita basis received 10 times more money than the LDCs.European recipients of climate finance included an EU member state, Romania, which received an $8m grant from the US for an engineering study to build a small modular nuclear reactor.Joe Thwaites, a climate finance advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said overall flows of climate finance were increasing but “not enough” was getting to the poorest and most vulnerable communities, with debt-distressed countries needing more grants and concessional loans.“This is not charity,” he said. “It is a strategic investment that addresses the root causes of many of the crises we see daily: cost of living, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, forced migration and conflict.”Over the two years under consideration, about $33bn was committed to the LDCs, which include Haiti, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Yemen.A much larger sum of money – about $98bn – went to developing countries, a broader group that includes lower middle-income countries such as India and upper middle-income countries such as China. Another $32bn could not be classified. India was the single largest recipient of finance over the reporting period, receiving about $14bn, while China received $3bn, mostly from multilateral banks.The analysis suggests the underrepresentation of the LDCs reflects their smaller population size, but the makeup of the developing country group is a growing source of tension at climate negotiations.China’s economy, for instance, has boomed since the UN classified it as developing in the 1990s, and its emissions have surpassed European levels on a per capita basis. China is thought to be a significant provider of finance to foreign climate projects but has resisted efforts to formally count its contributions. The UN’s development categories have not changed since they were drawn up in 1992.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Even if the money donated is a concessional loan, those loans do also come with conditions which might benefit the lender more than the recipient.”Data from the World Bank shows that over the same period, LDCs have together repaid almost $91.3bn in external debts – three times their climate finance budgets. Over the past decade, repayments of external debts of the poorest nations have trebled, from $14.3bn in 2012 to $46.5bn in 2022.“Conventional thinking is that taking on more debt isn’t bad if it is being used to fund growth-enhancing expenditure,” said Shakira Mustapha, a finance expert at the Centre for Disaster Protection. “My concern is whether countries are just taking on new debt to repay old debt and we are just kicking the can down the road.”The foreign ministries of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and UAE did not respond to a request for comment.Q&AMethodologyShowThe Guardian and Carbon Brief analysis on climate finance includes the bilateral and multilateral public funding that developed nations have committed for climate projects in developing countries.

Due to the lag in official reporting, the most recent figures go up only to 2022.As only annex II countries (23 industrialised nations and the EU) are responsible for contributing to the $100bn target, the analysis of the bilateral files was restricted to these nations. Likewise, usingOECD methodology, we calculated the share of multilateral climate finance which is attributable to this group.We also calculated the shares of multilateral finance that can be attributed to individual donor countries, based on shareholdings in multilateral development banks and cumulative contributions to multilateral climate funds. This is based on a methodology that has been used by analysts at theWorld Resources InstituteandODI.The analysis classified the recipients of the bilateral projects using theUN country classification. But many projects remain unclassified because the recipients are not specified, are reported as “multi-country”, or are part of a group of countries for which the funding cannot be disaggregated.These projects have not been included when calculating the amount of finance that individual developing countries received, but they are included in the total figures.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A spokesperson for UN Climate Change said: “The inequities revealed in climate finance flows highlight why a shift in the global financial system is urgently needed. Treating climate finance as charity has held back the progress the world needs, as has treating it purely as a cost and ignoring the massive human and economic dividends it pays.”The original $100bn target is being replaced this year with a new target for developed countries to provide $300bn a year by 2035, with a wider goal of mobilising $1.3tn a year. Last week, the heads of the two most recent UN climate summits published a report that explored ways of sustainably raising the cash that included taxes on fossil fuels and climate-resilient debt clauses. It also called for an expansion of concessional and grant-based climate finance.“Climate finance must be accessible, affordable, and fair,” the UN Climate Change spokesperson said. “The fact that many of the world’s lowest-income countries face barriers and still rely on high-interest loans for climate finance underscores the urgency of reform.”Explore more on these topicsClimate financeCop30Climate crisisSaudi ArabiaChinaMiddle East and north AfricaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Ken Saito, a former LDP economy minister, said he was “honestly worried” about Takaichi’s health, while Katsuhito Nakajima, an opposition MP, urged her to get moresleep, eliciting a nod and a smile from the prime minister.She is not alone among Japanese people in failing to get enough sleep, although few of her compatriots can match her maximum four hours a night.A study released on World Sleep Day in March found that people in Japan average seven 7 hours, 1 minute of sleep on weekdays – 38 minutes shy of the international average and less than people in the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.Takaichi has, admittedly, had little time to relax since becoming Japan’s first female prime minister at the end of October. She had been in office only a matter of days when she attended an Asean summit in Malaysia, beforewelcoming Donald Trumpfor a state visit and meeting Xi Jinping at the Apec summit in South Korea.A deepening row with China over her recent suggestion thatJapan could become militarily involvedin a conflict in the Taiwan Strait could give her yet more sleepless nights.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo immediately jumped in to help protect her and Wen was moved away.Local media has indicated that Wen, 26, who is an Australian citizen, intends to plead guilty and could be fined up to S$2,000 (£1,168).Wen regularly posts on Instagram as pyjamamann, where his stock-in-trade is invading concert stages, including those of Katy Perry and the Weeknd. The footage of his approach to Grande led to a substantial backlash, with many commenters calling his actions a criminal offence.Grande and co-stars are shortly to complete their mammoth publicity tour for the film’s sequel, which is released on 21 November. The review embargo lifts on Tuesday and early reaction has suggested repeat Oscar nominations for the two stars are likely.Red carpet invasions are increasingly uncommon as security has tightened over recent years. In 2007, podcaster Cielke Sijben handcuffed herself to Hugh Grant at a premiere of his romcom Music and Lyrics. Firefighters later freed the pair.Bradley Cooper was accosted on the red carpet in 2014 by a Ukrainian TV prankster who buried his head in the actor’s trousers, having given Will Smith an unsolicited kiss at the Moscow premiere of Men in Black 3 in 2012.

What is the problem that Atec solves? Will the establishment of this new body mean that more taxpayer money goes to funding university courses, or less?” said shadow education minister Julian Leeser in a statement to Guardian Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He denied the allegations and no charges were laidGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastAdeshola OreFri 14 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 09.02 ESTShareA school bus chaperone who allegedly sexually assaulted a nonverbal child continued working with students for months during the subsequent Victorian police investigation, prompting an apology to the girl’s mother from the state’s education department.The allegation was denied by the chaperone and did not lead to charges. But Victoria’s education department apologised to the mother last year for failing to implement risk mitigation strategies during the police investigation.The apology came after an investigation by the state’s child safety watchdog – the Commission for Children and Young People (CCYP) – which said the conduct of the school’s principal and assistant principal in response to the allegations “amounted to neglect” of their students’ safety.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMonths after making her report to police – and after discovering the chaperone was still doing work at the school – Beth* saw a photo, seen by Guardian Australia, showing her daughter standing next to him at the school.“My heart sunk. I couldn’t believe that they allowed him access to her,” she said.Beth told Guardian Australia her daughter, who was 11 at the time, disclosed the alleged sexual assault several years ago. When she was dropped off by the school bus that afternoon, Beth said she noticed her daughter’s pants were sitting low and her underwear was visible.Beth said she immediately rang the school principal to alert her. She said the principal told her to contact police if she believed something had happened. Beth later reported the alleged incident to her local police station. Her daughter was interviewed by Victoria’s police’s sexual offences and child abuse investigations team (Socit) six days later, using gestures, according to a transcript seen by Guardian Australia.But for months during the police investigation, the chaperone remained working on the bus and on the school grounds. The buses transport the school’s students to and from the campus each day.Beth said she was “in disbelief” when she heard the chaperone was still working on the bus while the investigation was ongoing. She said she first learned of this during a conversation with the school’s assistant principal, who she said asked if she wanted her daughter to resume travelling on the bus.“It felt like [the school] weren’t taking it seriously, and that they didn’t believe that this thing had happened, because they were so willing to just put her back on to the same bus with the same person that she’s accused of doing these things,” Beth said.More than eight months into the criminal investigation, a Victoria police officer with Socit told Beth the chaperone was employed by the bus company and the “school has no say in that”.In correspondence seen by Guardian Australia, the senior constable said the chaperone was assisting with “minor maintenance works” at the school, which had since ceased.The constable reminded the mother the chaperone had not been charged with any offences and was presumed innocent under the law.At the time, a police investigation into abuse allegations was not enough prevent a person from having a valid working with children check – althoughnew Victorian lawsto allow such suspension have since been passed.Beth said a detective called her 14 months after she first reported the allegation, to inform her the investigation had been closed.Years later, Beth received a letter from the then department of education secretary, Jenny Atta, expressing “sincere apologies that the school did not adequately or appropriately respond” when she reported that the bus chaperone allegedly sexually assaulted her daughter.“I apologise that the school and the department failed to implement adequate risk mitigation strategies while the allegation was being actively investigated by Victoria police,” the letter seen by Guardian Australia said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rolex, the luxury Swiss watchmaker, also invited the president and a string of his officials to the US Open tennis final in September.Upon arrival, Trump “did ask in jestwhether he would have been invited had it not been for the tariffs”, Jean-Frédéric Dufour, the Rolex CEO, later disclosed. This was “a moment that brought a round of laughter all around”, he added.Dufour denied that Rolex had engaged in “any negotiation” with the US over tariffs. The White House dismissed Warren’s criticism as “asinine conspiracy theories”.Trump wasgifted a golden table clock by Rolex, which was later spotted on his desk in the Oval Office. Another firm is said to have donated an engraved gold bar.The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, also confirmed the breakthrough on Friday, telling CNBC, the financial news network, that both sides had “essentially reached a deal”.TheTrump administrationagreed to limit US tariffs on Switzerland and Liechtenstein “to a maximum of 15%” under the deal, according to a statement from the Swiss government.This brings US tariffs onSwitzerlandin line with those on the European Union – allowing Swiss exporters the same treatment as rivals in neighboring countries.In return, Switzerland will reduce tariffs “on a range of US products”, the statement said. “In addition to all industrial products, fish and seafood, this includes agricultural products from the US that Switzerland considers non-sensitive.”Swiss officials also committed to granting a series of quotas for US goods that can be exported to Switzerland on a duty-free basis, including 500 tonnes of beef, 1,000 tonnes of bison meat and 1,500 tonnes of poultry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike formal free trade agreements, which are substantial and can take years to negotiate, these pacts have typically been narrow in focus and light on detail.The precise timing of the implementation, and when the new tariffs and quotas will be enforced, has yet to be finalized.“They’re going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States – pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment,” Greer claimed on CNBC, “so we’re really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.”The Swiss government said companies in the country were “planning to make direct investments” in the US worth $200bn “by the end of 2028”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsSwitzerlandLiechtensteinTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Soon afterwards the whine of Shahed drones could be heard in the sky, with heavy machine-gun fire from Ukrainian air defences.View image in fullscreenPeople shelter in the underground during the overnight strikes on Kyiv.Photograph: Maksym Kishka/Frontliner/Getty ImagesUkraine’s president said the country was hit by 430 drones and 18 missiles. The dead were at home in a block of flats on Kyiv’s left bank when it was hit. Dozens of other buildings were damaged, including the Azerbaijani embassy, which was struck by falling debris.“It was scary. Our windows shook. I thought: ‘Oh God, this is the end,” Bruce Avalord, an American longtime resident, said, speaking outside a wrecked multistorey residential compound. A drone careered into its upper levels at 3am, witnesses said, exploding in a fireball.On Friday, a bulldozer scooped up glass and bricks which had fallen on the pavement in the Sviatoshynskyi district. Owners checked over broken cars. “There are no military targets here, just civilians,” Avalord said. “The Russians want people to beg the government to capitulate. The tactic won’t work; Ukrainians are resilient.”View image in fullscreenRescuers cleaning up rubble and debris from a damaged block of flats.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesAnother resident, Valentina, said she threw on her clothes and hid in her ninth-floor corridor next to the lift, staying there until dawn. “The explosions woke me up. It was very loud. There were booms everywhere. I was messaging friends to see if they were OK,” she recalled.Zelenskyy called onEuropeand the US to supply additional air defence systems and to impose further sanctions on Russia’s oil industry. He said Ukraine was taking its own measures to prevent attacks by hitting Russian energy targets using home-produced deep-strike missiles.He disclosed that “Long Neptune” missiles had been used for the first time, after a successful Ukrainian aerial operation on the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, an important oil export facility. He called the attack “our entirely just response to Russia’s ongoing terror”.During his last trip to the White House, in October, Zelenskyy asked Donald Trump for long-range Tomahawk missiles.Speaking to the Guardian last weekhe said that, contrary to reports, the meeting was a success. So far, though, the US president has refused to provide the weapons, amid warnings from the Kremlin of retaliation.Oleksandra Matviichuk, Ukraine’s Nobel peace prize laureate, called on EU countries to use their air power to defend Ukraine’s vulnerable skies. She said Trump needed to deliver Tomahawks in order to stop enemy missiles before they were launched from Russian military airfields.“Our house shook the whole night, but my family is alive,” Matviichuk said. “Trump promised that when he becomes president, he will end the Russian war against Ukraine. Putin is demonstratively obstructing all his efforts even simply to cease fire.“Now it is also Trump’s war. If he does not show strength, he will go down in history as a weak president,” she wrote on social media.Ukraine’s prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said Friday’s bombardment was “unprecedented”. She said about 30 residential buildings were targeted, five people were taken to hospital, including a pregnant woman, and several children were hurt.There was widespread international condemnation. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorious, said Vladimir Putin had shown “contempt for humanity”.The EU invited Ukraine to join the club, but will it ever happen?Read moreRussia has upgraded its Iranian-designed kamikaze drones so they travel faster and are harder to shoot down. Ukraine has responded by developing new drone interceptors. While effective, they are not sufficient to cope with the combined drone and missile swarms being sent by Moscow.Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said: “The Russians are hitting residential buildings. There are a great many damaged multistorey apartment buildings in practically every district.”View image in fullscreenKyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, visiting a block of flats hit during the overnight strikes.Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersKyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the capital’s heating system had been damaged, with service being interrupted in one district. He warned of possible disruptions to power and water supplies. Most of the country is experiencing frequent blackouts after a series of Russian attacks this autumn on energy infrastructure.In the Darnytskyi district, debris landed in the yard of a residential building and on the grounds of an educational facility. A car caught fire after being hit by falling fragments.In the Dniprovskyi district, debris damaged threeblocks of flats, a private household and caused a fire in an open area. In the Podilskyi district, five residential buildings and a nonresidential structure were damaged. Several fires were caused by falling debris elsewhere in the city.EU officials warned this week that Ukraine must continue to crack down on corruption after asignificant kickbacks scandalput top government figures under scrutiny. But Brussels also offered assurances that aid would continue.On Wednesday, Zelenskyymoved to contain public outrage by firing two ministers who were accused of involvementin a large-scale bribery scheme. They deny wrongdoing. He also imposed sanctions on Timur Minduch, a friend and former business partner, who fled Kyiv hours before anti-corruption investigators raided his home.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In Poland, 42% felt it had got better and 30% worse.Looking to the future, large majorities in all countries bar Sweden were worried about the state of democracy in five years’ time: 86% in France, 80% in Spain, 75% in the UK and Poland, 74% in the Netherlands, 73% in Croatia, 69% in the US and 64% inItaly.Few people felt governments at any level represented their views well, although local government did better. In none of the nine countries did a majority feel that their national government represented their views “a great deal” or “fair amount”.Nonetheless, there was strong support for democracy across most countries, with clear majorities saying it was crucial to society and worth defending. Croatia was the only country to feel that it should be contingent on it delivering a good quality of life.Fake news, lack of accountability, extremism and corruption were seen as the main threats, with disinformation seen as the biggest danger in France (56%), the UK (64%), Sweden (67%), the Netherlands (75%) and Poland (76%).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve ramped up enforcement, deported foreign criminals from our streets, and saved taxpayers millions.“I pledge today to scale up the removal and deportations of illegal migrants and do whatever it takes to secure our borders.”The government has also sent about 100 people back to France under the “one in, one out” returns deal for those who cross the Channel in small boats.But, despite the removals, small boat crossings continue to be a major political headache for the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that’s aspirational,” said a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s going to take some time. It’s not going to be easy.”Red and green zones mapThe US military plans raise serious questions about Washington’s commitment to turning the ceasefire announced last month into an enduring political settlement with Palestinian rule across Gaza, which was promised by Donald Trump.Plans for Gaza’s future have been shifting at a dizzying rate, reflecting a chaotic, improvised approach to resolving one of the world’s most complex and intractable conflicts and providing aid including food and shelter to 2 million Palestinians.After weeks in which the US promoted reconstruction in the form of fenced-in camps for small groups of Palestinians, referred to as “alternative safe communities” (ASC), those plans were dropped this week, the US official said.“That’s a snapshot of a concept that was put forth at a certain time,” the US official said. “They’ve already moved on from that.”Humanitarian organisations who have repeatedly raised major concerns about the ASC model said on Friday they had yet to be notified of the change of plans.Without a workable plan for an international peacekeeping force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and large-scale rebuilding, Gaza risks slipping into limbo after two years of devastating war.View image in fullscreenMachinery operates next to a Red Cross vehicle at an area within the ‘yellow line’ to which Israeli troops withdrew under the ceasefire.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersMediatorshave warnedof a situation that is “not war but not peace” in a divided Gaza, with regular Israeli attacks, an entrenched occupation, no Palestinian self-rule and limited reconstruction of Palestinian homes and communities.The creation of an international stabilisation force (ISF) underpins Trump’s 20-point “peace plan”. The US hopes a draft UN security council resolution giving the force a formal mandate will pass early next week and expects firm details of troop commitments to follow.“The first step is we have to get the [resolution],” the US official said. “Countries are not going to make firm commitments until they actually see the language that has been passed.”Trump has ruled out putting any US soldiers on the ground to pave the way for an Israeli withdrawal, or funding reconstruction. “The US has been very clear they want to set the vision and not pay for it,” said one diplomatic source.Location of debrisEarlier this month, the US military regional Centcom command drew up plans to put European forces – including hundreds of British, French and German soldiers – at the core of the ISF, documents seen by the Guardian show.They include up to 1,500 infantry soldiers from the UK, with expertise including bomb disposal and military medics, and up to 1,000 French troops to cover road clearance and security.The US also wanted troops from Germany, the Netherlands and Nordic countries to handle field hospitals, logistics and intelligence.One source described those plans as “delusional”. After long missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, very few European leaders would be willing to risk their soldiers’ lives in Gaza, although they have pledged other support. Only Italy has offered a potential troop contribution.View image in fullscreenPeople working on the ruins of the Pasha Palace museum in Gaza City.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe documents were marked unclassified, suggesting the US did not consider the military plans to be highly sensitive, and they apparently collided with reality in a matter of days.A US official said the figures laid out in the documents contained “many inaccuracies” and Washington did not expect European troops to form the core of the ISF, adding that planning for Gaza was moving fast.“It is very dynamic. It is very fluid,” the US official acknowledged. “There are only a few people who actually understand and have their hand on the wheel of this thing.”Jordan was listed as a possible contributor of hundreds of light infantry troops and up to 3,000 police officers, even though King Abdullah has explicitly ruled out sending troops because his country is “too close politically” to Gaza.View image in fullscreenYvette Cooper (left), the UK foreign secretary, on a tour last week of a World Food Programme warehouse in Amman, Jordan, where 4,000 tonnes of aid was waiting to be delivered to Gaza.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAMore than half of Jordanians are of Palestinian descent, and agreeing to police the territory’s ruins in coordination with Israeli forces would be an explosively unpopular threat to Jordan’s national security.As of Thursday, the US military was expecting core contributions from a generously broad group described as “Nato and partners”, which included countries across Europe, Asia and the Middle East.A US “concept of operation” for the ISF specifies that troops will serve in the “green zone only”. The US envisages the deployment “starting small” in a limited area with a few hundred troops, then expanding slowly to a full strength of 20,000 across the area.It would not operate on the western side of the “yellow line”, where Hamas is reasserting control. “You’re not going to leave [the green zone],” the US official said.Another document lays out plans for foreign soldiers to man crossings along the line of control after “integrating” with Israeli forces stationed along it, a mission likely to alarm potential troop-contributing nations.They are wary of getting caught in crossfire between Hamas and Israeli soldiers, and borders are usually potential flashpoints. They also fear opening the way for accusations that the ISF is propping up an ongoing Israeli occupation of Gaza.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli soldier looks out at destroyed buildings from a station on the yellow line in the eastern part of Gaza City.Photograph: Nir Elias/ReutersThe Israeli military will “consider conditions for withdrawing” at a later stage when international security is in place, the plan states, without setting out any timeline.Reunifying Gaza is part of a process of “moving it toward stabilisation and lasting peace and a transition to civilian governance”, the US official said, but they added it was impossible to put a date on when it might happen.Trump’s20-point plandescribes a new Palestinian police force as “the long-term internal security solution” for Gaza, but US planners have assigned it only a limited role. The outline calls for an initial 200 recruits, growing over a year to a force of 3,000 to 4,000 officers, equivalent to just one in five of the planned security deployment.ReconstructionUS military planners also see reconstruction inside the “green zone” as part of a nebulous path to reuniting Gaza by convincing Palestinian civilians to move across the line of Israeli control.“As things progress and you create conditions for there to be significant progress on reconstruction, you [will] have Gazan civilians moving there beginning to thrive,” the US official said. “People will say ‘hey we want that’, and so it evolves in that direction. No one’s talking about a military operation to force it.”Yet even marking out a “green zone” in Gaza risks drawing comparisons with Iraq and Afghanistan, where the phrase became synonymous with US military failures.In Baghdad and Kabul, the green zones were enclaves ringed by concrete blast barriers where western forces and their local allies retreated to escape the violence their mission had unleashed in the communities around them.View image in fullscreenA teacher giving a lesson during the opening of a makeshift school at the Sayed Hashem mosque in Gaza City.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesThe plan to use aid to tempt the Gaza population into an area under Israeli control, after two years of a war deemed genocidal by a UN commission, has echoes of other disastrous US policies from those conflicts.Around a decade before the Taliban took Kabul, the US claimed it was bringing “government in a box” to southern Helmand to win over civilians. The province remained an insurgent stronghold.Trump’s 20-point plan commits to the demilitarisation of Palestinian factions in Gaza and an eventual Israeli withdrawal to a “security perimeter” carved out of Palestinian land. It would be facilitated by the ISF and allow rebuilding to begin “for the benefit of [Gaza’s] people”.The need for reconstruction is urgent, with more than 80% of structures in Gaza damaged or destroyed in the war, including almost all schools and hospitals, according to UN data.More than a month into the ceasefire, Israel continues to limit aid shipments into Gaza, including barring basic items, such as tent poles, that it classifies as “dual use” because it says they have the potential to be used for military purposes.Nearly 1.5 million Palestinians are waiting for emergency shelter items and hundreds of thousands more are living in tents without access to basic services such as clean water. Almost all the population – more than 2 million people – are crowded into the red zone, a strip along the coast that covers less than half of Gaza’s surface area.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineUS foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She described the impact of the war, losing close relatives and witnessing the aftermath of bombing first hand. She wrote about her family’sreturn to her birthplacein Beit Lahia, to find their home in ruins and their orchard destroyed. “My memories are crushed and buried,” she wrote.In October, Tantesh published an article looking back on two years of war, which took the people of Gaza through a “gateway to hell”. There were times, she wrote, when the surviving members of her family envied the dead.View image in fullscreenTantesh and her father Amjed return to the rubble of their home in northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianAccording to the UN, at least 248 journalists had been killed in Gaza by September, more than in any other conflict in modern times. There have been repeated allegations that Israel was deliberately targeting journalists. Israel has denied the charge, while claiming that some of the journalists its forces killed had been Hamas operatives.Receiving the award on Wednesday, Tantesh thanked her parents for “raising me to be the person who I am now”.“They are still there in Gaza, suffering what I was suffering during the past months,” she said, and went on to thank her sister Enas, who worked alongside her as a photographer in Gaza, and her cousin Seham, who has now taken up her positionas correspondent. They had stood with her throughout her time working in Gaza, she said.Tantesh also acknowledged the support of her editors and colleagues at the Guardian and “all the people who have stood with me all the way”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The explosion took placeoutside one of India’s most significant monumentsduring rush hour on Monday evening.Initially, eight people were confirmed dead, but the figure had risen to 13 by Friday as more victims succumbed to their injuries. It is one of the deadliest terror attacks to target India’s capital in more than a decade.Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, described the incident as a “conspiracy”, while his home minister, Amit Shah, vowed to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.Adding to the febrile atmosphere, at least seven people were killed and 27 injured on Friday night after an explosion at a police station in Srinagar, Kashmir’s main city. According to local media, a large pile of confiscated explosives detonated, killing police officers and members of the forensics team.The authorities have yet to make any formal announcement about who they believe to be behind theDelhiattack. Unofficially, however, Indian investigators have said inquiries are continuing into “an interstate and transnational terror module” that was targeted by the police in the days before the explosion.An investigation into the group began last month, after posters promoting the Pakistan-backed armed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad appeared in Srinagar. The region has long been disputed by India andPakistan, and since the 1990s the Indian-controlled south has faced a militant insurgency backed by Pakistan.Seven people were arrested as a result of the inquiries, including two Kashmiri doctors working in other Indian states. During a raid of one of the doctors’ homes in the city of Faridabad, in Haryana state, police said they had uncovered 2,900kg of explosive materials as well as chemicals, detonators and assault rifles, which they now believe were being readied for a multi-target attack.‘People were screaming for help’: Delhi car blast witnesses describe scenes of horrorRead moreThough they have yet to directly link the group to the Delhi blast, police have described the network as a “white-collar ecosystem involving radicalised professionals and students in contact with foreign handlers operating from Pakistan and other countries”.The day after the arrests, a white Hyundai car travelled from Haryana to central Delhi. After some time waiting in a car park in the bustling old quarter of the city, the driver pulled out into busy Monday evening traffic. Shortly after, the car exploded with huge force, throwing bodies into the air and setting surrounding cars and rickshaws alight.On Tuesday, a case was registered under India’s anti-terror laws and the investigation was taken over by India’s National Investigation Agency, which oversees terror cases. Police in Kashmir have since ramped up their raids and arrests across the region.Investigators have alleged that the car was being driven by another Kashmiri doctor from the village of Koil, 20 miles south of Srinagar. One of the doctors arrested the day before was also from Koil, and both were working at the same medical college in Faridabad.People in Koil described both men as accomplished doctors known for their impressive academic records, and expressed shock at the allegations against them. Their two families denied knowing one another.Police arrived at the home of the alleged driver just hours after the blast, searching the premises, confiscating all mobile phones and detaining several family members for questioning. Despite not formally confirming the doctor’s involvement, by Friday morning the authorities had demolished his home in an apparent case of “bulldozer justice” – a widespread but illegal tactic used by the Indian authorities to punish those accused of crimes against the state.View image in fullscreenThe remains of the alleged driver’s house, seemingly destroyed by ‘bulldozer justice’.Photograph: Farooq Khan/EPAAccording to Kashmir police, the seven people previously arrested in the terror network case had links with both Jaish-e-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an Islamic State affiliate operating in Kashmir. This could not be verified by the Guardian.India’s response to the Delhi blast has been markedly restrained in contrast to the last terror attack that took place on its soil. When more than 20 Hindu tourists were shot dead in Pahalgam, Kashmir, in April, the Indian government blamed Pakistan and launched cross-border drone and missile strikes. Pakistan responded in kind,pushing the two countries to the brink of all-out war.In the aftermath, the Indian government firmly stated that any more Pakistani terror attacks would be seen as an “act of war”. However, the more restrained language used this week by Modi’s cabinet is seen by some to reflect uncertainty over who may have been behind the latest attack and the alleged wider terror plot.Police in Kashmir said they remained “on high alert to prevent further incidents”. A senior officer added: “Multiple agencies have conducted raids to disrupt terrorist activities. Investigation is ongoing, and we are monitoring all suspicious activity closely.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaDelhiKashmirSouth and central AsiaPakistanNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

She was greeted by a performance by the former Spice GirlMelanie C.Carrying a Pudsey Bear backpack, the DJ travelled through Durham,North Yorkshireand West Yorkshire on her journey, during which she received a number of messages of support from famous names, including the Prince of Wales.Cox, who crossed the finish line in Pudsey,West Yorkshire, having started in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, said: “That was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Oh my gosh, I can’t believe it … hello Yorkshire! I’m an honorary Yorkshirewoman now.”The challenge is the longest tackled by Radio 2 as part of the annual fundraiser. Speaking to Scott Mills on the station, she said: “It’s just the hardest thing I’ve ever done – I’ve never known pain like it. But then, I’ve never had eye contact with so many amazing women who have just powered me on.“On the side of the road, in the driving rain, it was bitterly cold. The truck drivers honking their horns, the farmers stopping work just to come and say hi. Thanks to everybody who let me stop for a wee at their house – it was a few people.”The presenter had raised £9,523,028 by Friday evening. Cox said she was an “absolute wreck” during the annual appeal show, adding: “It was a rollercoaster. Like, literally my mood was changing every three, four seconds. It was a lot.”In Prince William’s video message, which was played by Mills on his breakfast show, he said: “Sara, massive congratulations for what you’re doing.“You’re so nearly there – just a little bit further and I know the people of Pudsey will all come out and welcome you with huge open arms, big hugs and, hopefully, lots of your favourite crumpets.“Keep going – you’ve done fantastically well and the nation’s so proud of you.”Melanie C said: “It’s like we’re taking every step with her. I feel quite emotional already. It’s incredible what she’s achieved and I can’t wait for her to cross that finish line.“Could Sporty [Spice] have done it? I’d like to think so, but I’m not sure … this is a testament to humans – we are all capable of so much more than we realise and Sara’s our poster girl for that.”Cox said she received a call from her mother and sister in India as she passed a telephone box during Thursday’s longest leg from Richmond to Ripley.The BBC’s annual Children in Need telethon starts onBBCiPlayer and BBC One at 7pm on Friday.The evening, hosted by Paddy McGuinness, Big Zuu, Mel Giedroyc, Rochelle Humes, Vernon Kay and Lenny Rush, will include performances from acts such as the McFly singer Tom Fletcher and the girl band Remember Monday, alongside sketches from The Apprentice, EastEnders and Gladiators.Children in Need has raised £45,507,536 so far this year, it was announced at the end of the live appeal show.Giedroyc said: “From everybody here, we are so grateful for your support.”Explore more on these topicsChildren in NeedSara CoxBBCMelanie CLeedsNorth YorkshireWest YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The sources added that this was a matter for Mitie and did not affect operations at Manston.A Mitie spokesperson said: “We hold our people to the highest standards and take allegations about staff misconduct very seriously. Where allegations are made, we will immediately investigate and take appropriate action where necessary.”Mitie sources said that a senior team was in place to ensure the continuation of operations as usual.Some of the new arrivals are survivors of rape and torture and many are traumatised by their journeys across the Channel in flimsy dinghies with cases of hypothermia and fuel burns from boat engines reported.Anindependent inquiryis under way into what went wrong at Manston in the second part of 2022 when the site became dangerously overcrowded with 4,000 asylum seekers on the site intended to hold a maximum of 1,600.The Kurdish asylum seekerHussein Haseeb Ahmed, who was processed at Manston, died in hospital after contracting diphtheria on 19 November 2022.

Home Office officials admitted that “we completely lost our grip” on the situation in documents disclosed as part of a court case about Manston.About 200 asylum seekers who were unlawfully detained at Manston during that period, are bringing legal challenges against the government for unlawful detention and related issues.Manston has been hit by a series of scandals including asixfold risein a year of staff sacked for failed drugs tests and aninvestigationinto a racist message reportedly “blasted out” at the centre.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesKentHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Information about 111 individuals is included. They are not named but their referees are, sometimes with mobile numbers and personal email addresses. It was not immediately clear how long the data had been circulating online.Max Kohler, a 29-year-old computer programmer, discovered his data appeared in the leak on Thursday after one of the referees on his application was emailed by a stranger who had seen the data dump online.Kohler found that it included his last salary, the name of his current employer, and names, emails and addresses of his other referees, as well as lengthy answers he had given to job application questions.“It’s very disappointing and disillusioning,” he said. “You spend time putting in all this sensitive information, salaries from previous jobs, home addresses, and they don’t take care of this information, and have it floating around in public.“They should take it down, apologise and there should be a report into how this happened and what they are going to do to ensure it does not happen again.

They come after a string of victories for Democrats in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, where affordability was a key topic.Earlier Friday, the president had claimed onTruth Socialthat “costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down”.Trump toldCBS’s 60 Minutesthis month that: “We have no inflation. We have no inflation. Biden had inflation, and he didn’t have tariffs.”In afactsheet, the White House said Trump was “strengthening the US economy and national security by modifying the scope of the reciprocal tariffs” and that “given the substantial progress in reciprocal trade negotiations” it was now “necessary and appropriate to further modify the scope of the reciprocal tariffs”.Trump accused of caving to big business after deal to cut Swiss tariffs to 15%Read moreTrump upended the global trading system earlier this year by imposing a 10% base tariffs on imports from every country, plus additional specific duties that vary from state to state.Friday’s orders followed theannouncementof a deal to cutUS tariffsonSwitzerlandfrom 39% to 15% as part of a new trade pact and framework trade deals announced on Thursday that will eliminate tariffs on certain foods and other items imported from Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador, once those deals are finalized, with US officials eyeing additional deals for signing before year’s end.Trump has increasingly focused on the issue of affordability in recent weeks, while insisting that any higher costs were triggered by policies enacted by Joe Biden, and not his own tariff policies.Consumers have remained frustrated over high grocery prices, which economists say have been fueled in part by import tariffs and could rise further next year as companies start passing on the full brunt of the import duties.According to aHarris pollconducted for the Guardian last month a clear majority of Americans say their monthly costs have risen by between $100 and $749.The top Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, said the Trump administration was “putting out a fire that they started and claiming it as progress”.“The Trump administration is finally admitting publicly what we’ve all known from the start: Trump’s trade war is hiking costs on people,” Neal said in a statement.“Since implementing these tariffs, inflation has increased and manufacturing has contracted month after month.”Reuters contributed to this story.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The judge said he would explain his decision in a hearing on Tuesday.The deal is among the largest in a series of opioid settlements brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies that totaled about $50bn.It could close a long chapter – and maybe the entire book – on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl, to which people who had become dependent on the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin turned when their pill supply was restricted or cut off.Lawyers and judges involved have described it as one of the most complicated bankruptcies in US history. Ultimately, attorneys representing Purdue, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others were nearly unanimous in urging the judge to approve the bankruptcy plan for Purdue that wastentatively agreedto this January.Purdue filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.Mike Quinn, a lawyer working with the plaintiffs, said on Friday: “This case never should have been in bankruptcy it should have been in criminal court.”The judge has pledged to release details of the deal on Tuesday. There is expected to be more scope in this deal than in the one rejected by the supreme court for people to sue members of the Sackler family personally over their role in Purdue and the crisis.“I think people will try to sue,” Quinn said. He was closely involved in opposing the Purdue-Sackler bankruptcy deal, working with Pain, an activist group fronted by the American art photographer and activistNan Goldin, who leddirect action protestsat international art museums that had accepted donations and sponsorship in the form of Sackler billions.Some of the Sackler family owning the privately held Purdue, which now-deceased members of the family grew into a specialist in pain treatment in the early 1990s, became famous philanthropists using the huge profits that their star drug OxyContin generated.But their reputationtook a divewhen investigative journalism and activism exposed the company’s expansionist drive toincrease prescriptionsof the opioid despite growing addiction and deaths across the US.Mike Moore, the former Mississippi attorney general, who helped secure the US’sbig tobacco settlementand the $20bnsettlementagainst BP for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, has been a key figure for plaintiffs in the sprawling opioids litigation against Purdue in the US. He said about Friday’s news: “I’m happy that they have finally come to a conclusion after years and years of wrangling. We should have gotten this done a long time ago, but it is what it is, it’s not what we wanted when we started this.”Moore began legal action against Purdue 20 years ago. In a telephone interview with the Guardian on Friday, he criticized the Sackler family for spending so much time and money fighting the litigation and then Purdue taking the bankruptcy route. Othersin the industrycame to settlements more quickly.“When I first sat down with the Sacklers and the lawyers for Purdue we thought we could get a resolution … and the money would have been paid out five years ago, but they decided to go into bankruptcy … Purdue were the worst of the worst of all the culprits,” Moore said.“I’m glad it’s over,” he added.Lane, during a hearing in White Plains, New York, on Friday indicated he plans to sign off on Purdue’schapter 11 plan.“The plan is the product of intense work with our creditors through a singular, shared focus on delivering as much value as possible to meaningfully address the opioid crisis,” Steve Miller, Purdue’s board chairman, said in a statement.Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 while facing more than 2,600 lawsuits by states, local governments and others accusing it of contributing to the deadly opioid abuse epidemic through its marketing and sale of OxyContin and other pain medications.Purdue’s creditors include state and local governments, individuals who became addicted to OxyContin, hospitals and others who were harmed by the opioid crisis.Members of the Sackler family have expressed regret for their company’s role in the opioid addiction epidemic, but deny wrongdoing.Purdue will be converted into a non-profit called Knoa Pharma, focusing on developing and distributing opioid overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsPharmaceuticals industryUS justice systemLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

In 40F (4.4C) weather, picketers held signs, marched, and chanted “What’s disgusting? Union-busting!” and “No contract, no coffee!”‘Whatever it takes’: Starbucks workers launch US strike and call for boycottRead moreMore than a thousand Starbucks workers across the USwalked offthe job on Thursday in over 40 cities, marking one of the largest coordinated actions yet by the rapidly growing union movement inside the world’s largest coffee chain.The strike, timed to coincide with the company’s lucrative “red cup day” festivities, is designed to pressure Starbucks back to the bargaining table after months of stalled contract negotiations.In Clinton Hill, many potential customers who stopped by for coffee were successfully deterred, choosing instead to support the strike. Those who chose to enter anyway were met with boos.Kaari Harsila, a 21-year-old shift supervisor at Starbucks and one of the lead organizers of the rally, said the strike was among their biggest actions yet. “We’re changing red cup day into the red cup rebellion to show Starbucks that we are serious about our demands,” she said.Workers were heartened by the response. “I think we have had a great turnout,” said Harsila. “I am honestly so impressed by all of the support that we’re getting from the community and from people that come here and we are able to turn away.”More than half of potential customers, she estimated, refused to cross the picket line. Many of those protesting, she explained, were Starbucks workers, joined by “a bunch of allies that have come out from other unions” and local supporters.Inside the store, however, Harsila said Starbucks had brought in managers and higher-level supervisors to keep operations running. “They brought in the regional and the district manager to work because they are scared. They don’t want to close it down.”Jacob Muldoon, 25, who previously worked at Starbucks and now works at the delivery giant UPS, said he came because he knows firsthand what a union can deliver. “I used to be a Starbucks worker as well … and I really understood those conditions, those early mornings, and that bad pay,” he said. “I know what a good union contract does. I saw my pay go up $8.”Muldoon said the benefits he now receives at UPS, including free healthcare, could transform life for baristas. “I hope that they get the same kind of benefits like that, especially now with everything becoming so expensive.”“It’s looking good out here,” said Edwin Augustly, a 50-year-old member of Local 79 who currently works at John F Kennedy airport. “It’s pretty empty in the store right now. I live in the neighborhood, and this Starbucks is pretty much always full. And today it’s not like that at all.”New York assembly member Claire Valdez, who previously chaired UAW Local 2110 at Columbia University, told workersthat their struggle resonated far beyond Starbucks.“I have lost count of the number of times I’ve been in a Starbucks picket line, and I’m never not proud to do it,” Valdez said. She praised baristas for fighting not only for themselves, but broader causes. “When you fight for your trans co-workers to have healthcare, that is everyone’s fight. When you organize for Palestinian human rights, that is everyone’s fight.”Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, spoke about the struggle for fair pay. “Why is it that these gazillionaires think it is OK to nickel-and-dime baristas?” she asked. “We need to make sure that the people who do the work to make America what it is get treated with respect and dignity.”Starbucks Workers United announced last week that workers had voted to authorize an open-ended unfair labor practice (ULP) strike. The union had spent months demanding that managers consider new proposals to improve staffing and pay, and resolve hundreds of ULP charges filed by the union against Starbucks throughout its organizing campaign.Since 2021, more than 650 Starbucks stores have unionized, despite pushback from management. Contract talks broke down earlier this year, after the union rejected Starbucks’ economic proposals.Starbucks said it was “disappointed” that Workers United had voted to strike, rather than continue bargaining, but insisted the “vast majority” of stores would be unaffected by the action.In Brooklyn, however, business certainly did seem affected, at least when it comes to the number of customers walking into the store on Lafayette Avenue. For Harsila, seeing people choose to turn away from their daily Starbucks to support the union was inspiring, a sign of a successful strike.With three nearby stores already closed, the store had been “very busy” in recent months, she said, but not today. “I am so happy to say that it has been a lot slower than it has been in the previous days.”Explore more on these topicsStarbucksNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The overall number is smaller this year than at Cop29 in Baku (1,773) and Cop28 in Dubai (2,456), but the proportion is higher this year as the Belém summit is less well-attended.It brings the total number of fossil fuel lobbyists given access to the UN climate summits to 7,000 over the past five years, a period marked by a rise in catastrophic extreme weather, disinformation and oil and gas profits.“Another Cop, same playbook. This is corporate capture, not climate governance,” said Lien Vandamme, senior campaigner on human rights and climate change at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).Another Cop, same playbook. This is corporate capture, not climate governanceLien Vandamme, Center for International Environmental LawThe annual climate talks opened in Belém on Monday, with Brazil’s PresidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvadisavowing disinformation and declaring that it would be the “Cop of truth”.Yet the fossil fuel industry, which has a long history of spreading misinformation and disinformation while blocking meaningful climate action, received almost 60% more passes to Cop30 than the 10 mostclimate-vulnerable nationscombined (1,061), according to analysis by KBPO, an international coalition of 450 organizations.Climate breakdown is escalating. In the lead-up toCop30, hundreds of people were killed after two powerful typhoons wreaked havoc less than a week apart in the Philippines – a country that has been hit by 21 significant storms this year alone. Fossil fuel-affiliated lobbyists outnumber official delegates from the Philippines by nearly 50 to 1, and Iran, where severe drought could force the government to evacuate the capital, Tehran, by 44 to 1.Meanwhile, it is expected to cost Jamaica billions of dollars and years to recover from Hurricane Melissa, a category 5 storm turbocharged by global heating, yet fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered the island nation’s delegation by 40 to 1.In July, the international court of justice (ICJ) ruled that continued fossil fuel expansion, extraction, consumption and subsidies may constitute an internationally wrongful act.“After the ICJ advisory opinion and the well-document six-decade playbook of climate obstruction, states at Cop should recognize the irreconcilable conflict of interest of the fossil fuel industry – which is similar to the tobacco industry,” said Elisa Morgera, the UN special rapporteur for climate change who supports aglobal ban on fossil fuel lobbying.The findings come as 2025 is set to become among the hottest years on record, yet states are failing to regulate polluting corporations and cut subsidies,with nearly $250bn earmarked for new oil and gas projects since Cop29.“From the halls of the UNFCCC to our lands and territories, fossil fuel corporations are wrecking our communities and environment. Yet the red carpet is rolled out for thousands of lobbyists to roam the corridors,” said Nerisha Baldevu from Friends of the Earth Africa.Fossil fuel corporations are wrecking our communities. Yet the red carpet is rolled out for lobbyists to roam the corridorsNerisha Baldevu, Friends of the Earth AfricaThe latest findings will pile further pressure on the UN to ban the fossil fuel industry from the annual climate action summits, where world leaders are supposed to negotiate in good faith and agree on ambitious plans to curtail climate catastrophe.Last week,the Guardian revealed that 57% of all oil and gasproduction last year came from 90 fossil fuel firms that sent substantial numbers of lobbyists to the UN climate talks from 2021 to 2024.A recentinvestigation by Drilled Mediarevealed that oil companies, with the help of the US government, first co-opted the international climate stage in the early 1970s, influencing the eventual drafting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, and every conference of the parties (Cop) to that convention since then.KBPO analyzed the provisional list of participants at Cop30 published by the UNFCCC, identifying delegates representing oil, gas and coal companies, trade groups, financial institutions and others that fund or financially benefit from obstructing climate action to phase out planet-heating fuels.The 1,602 fossil fuel lobbyists identified include 148 with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC); 60 with the International Emissions Trading Association (Ieta), including delegates from oil and gas giants ExxonMobil, BP and TotalEnergies; and 41 with the Brazilian National Confederation of Industry (BNCI).The ICC said only three of the 148 business representatives they accredited are from fossil fuel firms. “We do not represent any one sector. And we pride ourselves in bringing a delegation to COP that represents the full diversity of the business community,” said Andrew Wilson, ICC deputy secretary general.Several big polluters from the global north invited fossil fuel representatives to join their official delegations including France, which brought 22 industry delegates including the CEO of TotalEnergies, and Norway, whose group included six senior executives from its national oil and gas giant Equinor.Overall, only Brazil, with 3,805 delegates, has a bigger presence than oil, gas and coal interests.World still on track for catastrophic 2.6C temperature rise, report findsRead moreBut the true extent of fossil fuel influence is likely to be higher, as more than half of all country delegation members at Cop30 withheld or obscured details of their affiliations, according to a separate analysis by Transparency International. Russia, Tanzania, South Africa and Mexico are among the countries that did not disclose the affiliation of any official delegates.After years of campaigning by civil society groups, Cop delegates were this year required to publicly disclose who was funding their participation – and confirm that their objectives were in alignment with the UNFCCC. But the new transparency requirement excludes anyone in official government delegations or overflows; also, calls forstricter conflict-of-interestprotections to cut industry influence have not been adequately heeded, advocates say.“While local Indigenous peoples struggled to enter the conference, fossil fuel lobbyists walked in freely. My generation deservesJust Transitionpolicies that reflect what people and the planet need, not what polluters’ profits demand,” said Pim Sullivan-Tailyour of the UK Youth Climate Coalition. “The UNFCCC is in need of rehabilitation.”“Fossil fuel companies continue to lead us into a climate abyss. [Yet] for 30 years, climate change summits have been an ideal stage for oil companies to clean up their image, do business and find new ways to get away with environmental crimes,” said Ivonne Yáñez from Acción Ecológica [Ecological Action], a non-profit environmental group in Ecuador where oil drilling is expanding across the Amazon.“Today, instead of transitioning to post-oil societies, they want to extract every last drop of fossil fuels to continue feeding the capitalist system and genocidal wars.”A UNFCCC spokesperson said: “As of 2023, measures have been taken to enhance transparency so that it’s clearer who participates at Cop. We have done this in consultation with civil society and other stakeholders. Just as no single Cop can be expected to solve the climate crisis overnight, making further concrete improvements is an ongoing journey, noting that national governments have sole authority to decide who is in their delegations.”Ieta and the BNCI declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsCop30Oil and gas companiesFossil fuelsBrazilAmericasEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The “MS” comes from the network’s original partnership with Microsoft back in the 1990s, which ended more than a decade ago. The network president, Rebecca Kutler, told the Guardian last week that she felt “very strongly” about keeping the letters because of the history of the brand and because it’s how many people refer to the channel anyway.Joy Reid on her ouster from MSNBC: ‘In this moment, not being a part of corporate media is a gift’Read moreThe change was forced on the network by its parent company, NBCUniversal, which is breaking off MSNBC along with a few other cable networks into a new, separate company called Versant. MSNBC/MS Now is trying to make the best of it, using it as an opportunity to promote the brand anew as a source of patriotic, trustworthy news and analysis.View image in fullscreenThe MSNBC TV anchor Mika Brzezinski, co-host of the show Morning Joe, in 2017.Photograph: Steven Senne/APThe change comes at a particularly challenging time for television networks, which are weathering declines in subscription fees as viewers increasingly drop pricey cable packages for cheaper streaming options.At the live event, Brzezinski – like many MSNBC stars who have sat recently for interviews – assured the crowd that she was happy with the change. “MS Now. I love it,” she said. “We get to stay in 30 Rock, right?” her husband and co-anchor Joe Scarborough jokingly asked. Sadly not – the network has moved from New York’s most famous media hub over to a far less glamorous office building in Times Square that once housed the New York Times.While Brzezinski got a few laughs with a riff about how she was trying to get used to the change in advance (“It’s like I’m 58 but I say I’m 60 – I like to get ahead of things,” she joked) few in the crowd seemed to be aware of the new name.Probably sensing this, the network recently invested $20m in a national advertising campaign to bring viewers up to speed on the name change – and maybe even get them a little excited about it. On 4 November, election night, the network aired two 60-second ads – one featured star hostRachel Maddow reading the preamble to the constitutionwhile patriotic imagery and vignettes from US history flashed across the screen, and the otherMaya Angelou’s speech at the United Nationsin 1996.View image in fullscreenMS NOW’s studio.Photograph: MS NOW/Ralph BavaroBoth ads, which highlighted the network’s biggest stars, ended with the same message: “MS NOW. Same Mission. New name.”Scarborough also conveyed comfort with the name change, telling the crowd at the fan fest: “If you do a good job, and you have decent lighting, and you can talk to people, and they want to hear your take, they want to hear the story – it doesn’t matter what we call the network, it doesn’t matter where we film it.”But names do matter, particularly when they have defined a brand for decades. “It is a big deal to rebrand a company after 30 years. We understand that,” Kutler said at an event for reporters last week. “We understand it is a challenge, and we’re here for it.”One of her biggest stars, prime-time host and former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, acknowledged that she initially viewed the name change as a “headache” for branding purposes. But, she said at the same event, she came to realize that the network’s viewers care more about their favorite hosts than the network’s name. “There’s a commitment and dedication to certain faces who are part of the brand that I think people seek them out wherever they may be,” she said. “And that made me feel better.”View image in fullscreenJen Psaki, former White House press secretary, appears on Meet the Press in Washington DC on 25 September 2022.Photograph: NBC/William B. Plowman/Getty ImagesQuizzed about the change in an online group for MSNBC superfans, most said they were fine with the channel’s new name – though there was some confusion about how to access it and whether it would remain on the same dial. “As long as the journalists, commentators, writers, etc, remain and are free to present news without interference, they can call it anything they want,” one fan said.One of the network’s former top stars, Joy Reid, is less sure.In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardianrecently, she cited her past experience working as an analyst for a beverage company. “I don’t think it’ll stop people from watching their favorite hosts,” she said. “But as an overall marketing exercise, I will wait and see. I am dubious. I don’t know that name changes are usually ever a good idea, to be honest.”While corporate leadership has hailed the split as an opportunity for greater investment in MSNBC, there is another upside for the network’s longtime parent company, Comcast. At a time when the Federal Communications Commission and its Trump-appointed chair, Brendan Carr, have been pressuring television network owners to adhere to their statutory obligations, Comcast may benefit from no longer being associated with a network known as a place for criticism of the Trump administration. As a cable network, MSNBC is also out of Carr’s purview.In some ways, though, the fan festival highlighted one of the network’s biggest challenges: that, like many cable news networks, its most loyal viewers are older. Some in the crowd struggled to navigate the stairs and unwieldy steps of the concert venue’s second floor – though they showed plenty of verve and energy when the network’s stars pumped them up with calls for democratic participation and criticisms of the Trump administration.View image in fullscreenThe MS Now studio.Photograph: MS NOW/Ralph BavaroAsked by the Guardian about the network’s median audience age (72), Kutler pointed to its success on YouTube and TikTok, two key platforms that remain challenging to monetize. “I think when you combine the strength of our audience on [traditional television], and then fold in kind of the platforms of the future, I think we have a pretty great story to tell,” she said.Splitting off from NBCUniversal and its longtime sister network NBC News has meant big changes for MSNBC/MS NOW. In addition to moving out of 30 Rockefeller Center, the network was forced to build a news-gathering operation from scratch because it could no longer rely on NBC News correspondents to provide on-air reports. Over the last few months, the network has assembled a large bureau in Washington DC, staffed with veterans of news organizations like the Washington Post, and led by Scott Matthews, a former CNN and CNBC executive.Election night was the first trial of the network’s new in-house reporting operation and executives and hosts viewed it as a resounding success. “We had a news-gathering operation that did not miss a beat,” Kutler said. “We were ahead or in every single one of the right places, and that organization did not exist six months ago. So that makes me incredibly proud.” (MSNBC got very close to matching Fox News in prime time on election night and soundly defeated CNN.)As NBC News and MSNBC split apart, several correspondents who had appeared regularly on both networks had to pick one long-term home. Steve Kornacki, who became synonymous with MSNBC’s election night coverage as the khaki-wearing wonk-in-chief guiding viewers through electoral maps, signed a deal to join NBC News. On election night, he was replaced by the veteran MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi.But the Los Angeles-based correspondent Jacob Soboroff decided this past summer that he wanted to be on Team MSNBC. Soboroff began with MSNBC in 2015 but had drifted over to the NBC News side and became a regular contributor on the Today show before coming back toward the cable network during the 2024 election. “I fell back in love with being at MSNBC, and I had no idea the spin was coming,” he said.When the corporate decoupling was announced in November 2024, “for me, it was an immediate no-brainer that I wanted to go back to MS,” said Soboroff, who added that his work for the cable network had allowed him to be the “most authentic version” of himself as a journalist. He has also gotten to fill in as a primetime host on MSNBC, something he couldn’t have done while reporting for NBC News.“I think there’s a lot of runway for me and for anybody who is passionate about original journalism at MS,” he said. “For me, it’s always been about connecting with real people in real places to tell their stories, not about the politics.”Explore more on these topicsMSNBCTV newsUS television industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

MVP doesn’t stand for Most Valuable Player anymore. It stands for Most Valuable Quarterback on a 12-win team with a nice storyline. That gives us three frontrunners: Matthew Stafford, Drake Maye and Darnold.Stafford is on the kind of run that could see him clinch the award by the end of the year. But right now, Darnold is the pick.Some wondered why the Seahawks would voluntarily step off the sturdy, predictable foundation that was Geno Smith and on to the rollercoaster of Darnold. Was Darnold’s breakout in Minnesota for real? Why ditch Geno rather than beefing up his supporting cast? It felt like an unnecessary gamble. You didn’t need to squint to find the takes that, after moving on from Smith, DK Metcalf and their offensive coordinator, the Seahawks had made plenty of high-profile moves but hadn’t fixed their underlying flaws. And yet, 10 weeks in, John Schneider looks like the rare executive who was able to outthink the room.Adding Darnold has transformed the Seahawks from a feisty team into one of the two best in the league. Darnold has been sensational – not good, not serviceable, but the best player at the league’s most valuable position. He leads the league in QBR and big-time throw rate (9.0%). No one has ripped as many high-level throws down the field under pressure. Stafford and Maye have been excellent at driving the ball down the field, but they’ve also had the luxury of open targets more often than Darnold. Darnold has faced a higher pressure rate on deep targets and a higher percentage of tight-window throws overall.Sam Darnold has made a number of ridiculous throws this year, but this touchdown pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba might top them all. Just insane arm talent getting the ball to the receiver throwing across his body...pic.twitter.com/59PieIV3JC— Corbin K. Smith (@CorbinSmithNFL)November 11, 2025It’s the aggression that stands out. Darnold hasn’t met a coverage he isn’t keen to shred. At this stage of his career, he’s seen everything defenses will throw his way and has all the answers. He’s roasted the blitz at a league-leading rate and has an almost perfect passer rating when kept clean in the pocket.At 7-2, the Seahawks have the championship formula. Their defense is humming. They can score on long drives or with chunk plays. And their quarterback has become an elevator rather than a passenger. He has stepped into a new spot and transformed his career for the second season in a row. The two upcoming duels with Stafford will shape the MVP race. But for now, Darnold has the edge.Offensive Player of the YearJonathan Taylor, RB,Indianapolis Colts.This is how the voters cleanse their conscience: they hand the “runner-up MVP” trophy to the non-quarterback they overlooked. If Saquon Barkley did not win the biggest prize last season, Taylor is unlikely to sniff it this go around. His campaign will be the usual OPOY story: dazzling production, rushing at a historic pace and sealing his team a top seed for the playoffs.It’s hard to divvy up credit for the Colts’ offense between Shane Steichen, the offensive line, Daniel Jones and all the team’s playmakers. But Taylor’s performance in Berlin last week proved that Indy’s renaissance runs through him – literally. He’s on track for 26 rushing touchdowns and within striking distance of LaDainian Tomlinson’s of 28, set in the 2006 season. He’s the engine of the Colts’ attack, the rare running back who alters the geometry of the defense. And once the ball is in his hands, he’s doing as much damageaftercontact as he is before it. Without Steichen, the line and the threat of the pass, Taylor’s numbers may not be as gaudy. But his after-contact numbers prove that he is the player that binds together Steichen’s vision.Defensive Player of the YearMyles Garrett, Edge,Cleveland Browns.Let’s not overthink this one. The pool of candidates this year is deep, but Garrett still lives in a rarefied air all his own. Somehow, he’s putting together the most dominant season of his career. He already has 11 sacks and 24 (!) run stops, while drawing more attention from opposing offenses than any other edge-defender in football.Whole gameplans are built to mitigate Garrett’s presence, from double and triple teams to how opponents devise their running and passing strategies. None of it has mattered. And the ripple effect of his presence has helped put Cleveland’s defense fourth in the league in EPA/play, despite having a dysfunctional offense. Sure, the Browns stink. But their record shouldn’t diminish what Garrett is doing. If anything, it underlines it.Offensive Rookie of the YearEmeka Egbuka, WR,Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Why would a smart, productive receiver at Ohio Statenotbe a success in the NFL? That’s Egbuka in Tampa Bay. What the Bucs weren’t banking on was Egbuka’s big-play potential. He was supposed to slot into the offense as a Professional Receiver, someone happy to do the dirty work to keep an offense churning. Instead, they’ve hit on a super-duper star, who can threaten a defense at all three levels. Egbuka is smooth, sudden and a splash play waiting to happen, averaging 16.9 yards per reception this season. He’s also become the go-to target for Baker Mayfield on third-downs, effectively shedding his “rookie” title midway through his first season.Defensive Rookie of the YearCarson Schwesinger, LB, Cleveland Browns.Abdul Carter will be the favorite for this award, because edge-rushers always are. Whichever rookie leads his class in sacks or interceptions typically walks away with the hardware, regardless of their down-to-down impact.But this year should be different. You may have noticed, but linebackers are back, people! As the league trends back towards the run game, defenses are planting heavier bodies on the field. After a barren spell of draft classes at the position, this year’s crop has been a home run. Philly’s Jihaad Campbell is more of a playmaker than Schwesinger and probably has a higher career ceiling. But Cleveland’s rookie has been the cleanest of the duo and has been a linchpin of an outstanding unit from week one. Schwesinger is a springy linebacker who can make plays behind the line of scrimmage or in coverage, something rookies at his position often struggle with.The general trend is that it takes three years for linebackers to settle. During a nearly half-decade dry spell across the league, it’s been Fred Warner and then everyone else. Last season, Zack Baun appeared from nowhere tojump to Warner’s level, switching from the edge to a traditional linebacker role. But Campbell and Schwesinger have walked into the league from day one as if they belong. With his 25 run stops and play-to-play consistency, Schwesinger takes it.Coach of the YearMike Vrabel,New England Patriots.Often, the coach of the year award is a mea culpa.We’re sorry our preseason predictions about your team were wrong.But it’s different with Vrabel. Tennessee collapsed in his absence; New England rose in his image. That’s not a coincidence.The Patriots haven’t stumbled into an 9-2 record and a division lead. There hasn’t been a miracle quarterback boom or fluky turnover luck. What they have is Vrabel’s great gift: structure.Vrabel joined a hollowed-out franchise, restored order and has turned the Patriots into something formidable. This year’s Patriots are “DTF”, at least according to Tony Romo. They are tough, disciplined, well-drilled and creative on both sides of the ball. If not for a bizarre five-turnover game against the Steelers, they would have started 10-1.To think, six months ago, they were staring at a multi-year rebuild. Before Thursday’s game with the Jets, the Patriots were one of only two teams (along with the Rams) that were in the top 10 in both offensive EPA/play (eighth) and defensive EPA/play (eighth). You can point to the soft schedule, but it’s not as if the Patriots entered the season as sure-fire contenders themselves. And they have two of the most impressive wins this season, beating Buffalo and Tampa Bay on the road.Vrabel’s fingerprints are all over the turnaround. Almost all of his offseason bets have paid off instantly. He remade the defensive front with the offseason additions of Milton Williams, Khyiris Tonga, K’Lavon Chaisson, Harold Landry and Robert Spillane, relying on a group of players he worked with in Tennessee. Only Williams is a blue-chip star, yet the Patriots have the third-best pass defense in the NFL. And they’ve done so despite missing their defensive coordinator, Terrell Williams, who wasdiagnosed with prostate cancerin September. Vrabel has assumed a more prominent role with the defense. But he also entrusted 37-year-old Zak Kuhr, who also came from Tennessee with Vrabel, with play-calling responsibilities in Williams’ absence.Vrabel also made the call to bring back Josh McDaniels as offensive coordinator, despite his obvious desire to move on from New England’s Belichick days. It’s been a masterstroke; McDaniels has helped unlock Maye’s potential and constructed a top-10 unit without high-wattage talent.There are precious few examples of franchises having such a sharp about-face in one offseason with such an influx of new players and coaches. And all of those decisions trace back to Vrabel.Explore more on these topicsNFLSeattle SeahawksIndianapolis ColtsCleveland BrownsTampa Bay BuccaneersNew England PatriotsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats ina government shut downthat dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind. The only thing missing from the jingoistic scene was a monument to ESPN’s fallen integrity.Can Donald Trump really make an NFL team name its stadium after him?Read moreThere was a time when right-wing critics who saw ESPN as liberal leaning had a point. Jemele Hill and Michael Smith, both unapologetically progressive, anchored SportsCenter on weekday evenings. Hill and Smith opening the show with a homage tothe Black TV touchstoneA Different Worldwas perhaps “woke” ESPN’s apex. But as Trump’s first administration wore on – and the president and his alliesfired potshots at the sports world– ESPN slowly adopted a blinkered focus on sports as partisan politics bled over the white lines. Under network president Jimmy Pitaro and Bob Iger, the two-term CEO of ESPN parent company Disney, the self-styled “worldwide leader” in sports broadcasting discouraged employees from tiptoeing into areas where sports and politics intersect – Hill was moved off SportsCenter after attacking Trump on social media and eventually left the company. But after the Fox and Friends-like indulgence of Trump this week, ESPN effectively killed its “woke” era once and for all.The dramatic tone shift comes amid Trump’s deeper encroachments into the world of sports: this year he has turned up atthe Super Bowl, the Daytona 500,the US Open men’s finalandthe Ryder Cupto mixed reactions.Trump has also announcedplans for a live UFC event at the White House on his birthday after months of fantasizing about hosting a card on the South Lawn to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. And Trump reappeared at the Washington Commanders’ NFL game last Sunday in the wake of areportthat he wants the team to name their new stadium after him.In fact Trump brought this up, unprompted, during a Fox Sports interview at half-time of Sunday’s game. “That’s what I’m involved in,” he said of the stadium naming plan. “We’re getting all the approvals and everything else. You have a wonderful owner, Josh [Harris] and his group. You’re gonna see some very good things.”2:02US president Donald Trump booed while attending Washington Commanders NFL game – videoYou can’t really blame Fox Sports for submitting to Trump given how prominent he was on Fox’s family of networks even before he first became president. It wasn’t a surprise when announcers Kenny Albert and Jonathan Vilma did not ask Trump aboutthe chorus of boosthat greeted him when he appeared on the stadium’s video screens.But ESPN? There are valid arguments around whether a sports network should have political leanings one way or another. But a serious network should interrogate stories, whether the protagonists are liberal or conservatives. ESPN reporters broke the story about Trump’s potential stadium dedication and couldn’t even get him to address the report ontheir own networkwhen he appeared with McAfee, whodefendedhis decision to have Trump on the show by saying he had extended an invitation to Barack Obama too (who he no doubtwould have voted for three times). So it goes when they have McAfee, a loutish former NFL punter who doesn’t shy fromslamming the networkthat made him one of its most prominent faces, doing a job that once was reserved for the likes of Bob Ley, Keith Olbermann and other pillars who once made ESPN a sports journalism paragon. They certainly would have challenged Trump’s opening reference to the Washington football team’s racist former nickname.“I’m only joining you because I hear you say very nice things about me from your very large audience,” Trump told McAfee.“I don’t know how much you know about me,” McAfee said, reaching for empathy. “I feel very similar about how I treat people and operate people, Mr President.”The past 15 years has seen ESPN abandon fan-focused roots – venerating great achievements, contextualizing standout figures, interrogating sport’s larger role in society – to become just another talking shop. No personality brings on the tinnitus quite like Stephen A Smith, who equates himself with the biggest names in the sports he coversunironically. Smith also serves up reheated takes on respectability politics, most recently tut-tutting congresswoman Jasmine Crockett for demeaning her station by using “street verbiage”, the kind of dog whistling you’d expect from a rightwing shock jock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not least are critical thinkers Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre, who has gone on to breakseveral significant storieson his own podcast since leaving ESPN. The network isn’t alone in getting less political, athletes themselves – apart from Maga stalwarts like Harrison Butker and Nick Bosa – seem reluctant to speak up about social issues, a stark contrast to Trump’s first term when stars such as LeBron James and Stephen Curryseemed to advocate on a weekly basis.All of this comes as ESPN finds itself struggling to retain its media primacy at a time when it no longer has a monopoly on sports eyeballs, and only has itself to blame for undermining 46 years of trust and goodwill among viewers predisposed to thinking of ESPN personalities as family. The past few weeks alone have seen the networkfumble coverageof federal gambling investigations in the NBA and MLB whileflogging its online sports book, and draw outa dispute with YouTubeTVthat has kept the channel off the platform in the middle of the NFL and college football seasons.That last blunder is reportedly costing ESPN $5m a day in addition to the substantial ratings losses that affect its advertising revenue and subscriber engagement. Digital savvy TV viewers who had adapted to juggling various streaming apps to watch their favorite sporting events aren’t much inclined to go along with ESPN this time, much less sign on to its ridiculous petition entreating fans to help “end the blackout” as the FCC’smafia-codedcommissioner Brandon Carr applies pressure on both parties. (“People should have the right to watch the programming they paid for – “including football,” he tweeted in response to YouTube TV offering a$20 creditto inconvenienced subscribers.) Instead of signing up for Disney+ or the ESPN app, many ESPN viewers have gone back to watching pirated broadcasts – the very crime against fair play that streaming was supposed to disincentivize.Besides, it’s not likeESPNviewers don’t have other options. They can always get highlights on social media, or listen to podcasts from former ESPN standouts like Jones and Torre.Before The Office was a universal reference point in US culture, ESPN was the one sending up workplace culture with its This Is SportsCenter ad campaign depicting star athletes and scampish team mascots asgenuine contributorsto a company that dearly loved the panoply of sports it covered. But as long as it serves as a platform for Trump’s vengeful politics, downplays the conflicts that inevitably come about when sports and politics intersect, and betrays the loyal viewers who made it an American institution, ESPN isn’t SportsCenter. It’s state TV.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsESPNUS television industryTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All four have been unanimous.Judge became the New York Yankees’ fourth three-time winner, edging Seattle’s Cal Raleigh with 17 first-place votes to 13 for the switch-hitting catcher. The vote was the closest for an MVP since the Angels’ Mike Trout topped Houston’s Alex Bregman by 17-13 in 2019.If the Dodgers are bad for baseball, why was the World Series so much fun?Read moreOhtani became just the second player to win at least four MVP awards, trailing only seven by Barry Bonds.The 31-year-old Ohtani is the first to win in each league twice after getting the AL honor in 2021 and 2023. He signed with the crosstown Dodgers the following offseason and won NL MVP in 2024 during his first season in Chavez Ravine. He’s also won theWorld Seriesin both his seasons with the Dodgers.Ohtani won all four of his MVPs in unanimous fashion with all 30 first-place votes.Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber finished second with 23 second-place votes while New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto was third with four.Ohtani hit .282 and led the NL with a 1.014 OPS. He also had 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases.The right-hander returned to pitching in June after missing one and a half seasons on the mound because of an elbow injury. He struck out 62 batters over 47 innings, slowly increasing his workload while preparing for the postseason.Ohtani continued to shine in October witharguably the greatest single gamein MLB history. He hit three homers at the plate while striking out 10 over six dominant innings on 17 October, leading the Dodgers over the Milwaukee Brewers to finish an NL Championship Series sweep.Schwarber – who earned a $50,000 bonus for finishing second – was a finalist for the Phillies after hitting an NL-best 56 homers and leading the big leagues with 132 RBIs. The three-time All-Star played in all 162 games, anchoring a lineup that won 96 games.Soto overcame a slow start to the season to have his typically stellar offensive output. The four-time All-Star – whosigned a $765m, 15-year deallast December – had 43 homers, 105 RBIs and an NL-best 38 stolen bases. He received a $150,000 bouns for finishing third in the MVP voting.Judge, who won the AL award in 2022 and 2024, joined Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle as three-time MVPs with the Yankees. The 33-year-old outfielder led the majors with a .331 batting average and 1.144 OPS while hitting 53 homers.The prior winner of back-to-back AL MVPs was Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera in 2012 and 2013.Raleigh, nicknamed “Big Dumper,” led the big leagues with 60 homers, the most for a player primarily a catcher. He started 119 games behind the plate and another 38 at designated hitter.The 28-year-old also had a career-high 125 RBIs, leading the Mariners to one of their best seasons in franchise history.Cleveland’s José Ramírez finished third.Arizona’s Geraldo Perdomo finished fourth in the NL voting, earning him $2.5m annual salary increases in 2028 and 2029 along with the price of Arizona’s 2030 club option.Explore more on these topicsShohei OhtaniMLBLos Angeles DodgersBaseballWorld SeriesUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Patriots’ 3-0 record in AFC East games is their best start in the division since 2019 (5-0).Pending this weekend’s games, first-year coach Mike Vrabel’s Patriots have the best record in the NFL; Indianapolis and Denver are 8-2. And New England will have a winning season for the first time since 2021, when they last made the playoffs.Lions’ Amon-Ra St Brown apologizes for offense caused over ‘Trump Dance’ during gameRead moreWith Rhamondre Stevenson out for the third straight game with a toe injury, Henderson logged a career-high 19 rushing attempts, totaling 62 yards. His two TD runs matched his total from Sunday’s win over Tampa Bay.Maye was solid, completing 25 of 34 passes for 281 yards and a TD. Stefon Diggs had nine catches for 105 yards, his third 100-yard game of the season.The Patriots thrived in damp and chilly conditions with temperatures that dipped into the high 30s fahrenheit, compiling 336 total yards while holding the Jets to 245.New York’s Justin Fields threw a touchdown pass to John Metchie III but was otherwise ineffective through the air, going 15 of 26 for 116 yards. He was the Jets’ leading rusher with 67 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. Fields’ top receiver, Garrett Wilson, was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury earlier Thursday.Trailing 27-14 with just over two minutes to play, the Jets (2-8) had a fourth-and-four on the New England 15, but Fields’ pass to tight end Jeremy Ruckert was broken up.The Jets won the pregame coin toss and took the ball, marching 72 yards over 14 plays and taking a 7-0 lead on Fields’ five-yard TD rush. It was the Jets’ first opening-drive TD since Week 16 of last season.The Patriots responded with a 69-yard drive and a seven-yard touchdown run by Henderson. The 13-play drive included a fourth-down pass from Maye to DeMario Douglas.After a New York punt, Henderson ran for his second TD, also from seven yards out. He dragged multiple defenders into the end zone to put New England in front 14-7.Penalties, ill-timed mistakes and poor production out of the passing game again stymied the Jets. They had a chance to get the ball back late in the first-half, but had a sack nullified by an illegal contact call. On the next play, cornerback Qwan’tez Stiggers collided with safety Tony Adams, knocking a would-be interception from his hands. Fields completed just four passes for 23 yards in the first-half.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew England PatriotsNew York JetsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!John BrewinFri 14 Nov 2025 10.20 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 10.56 ESTShareOFF EGOSFootball Daily, for research/self-loathing purposes, recently sat through Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest chat with Piers Morgan. Among many moments of hubris, self-celebration and smoke being blown up the great man’s rear end by the ever-willing Morgan, Ronaldo took a typical moment of quiet self-reflection. “I think in the world, nobody is more famous than me,” he trumpeted, Piers nodding along obediently. “Let’s debate it – who’s more famous, me or Donald Trump?” Though such a pointless debate might provide welcome distraction for a president rather uncomfortably named in some emails making the news at the moment, it has very little to do with what Ronaldo is famous for. While doing his day job he had a very bad time in Dublin, as Portugalwent down 2-0to an inspired Republic of Ireland side.When Lansdowne Road roars with noise, few stadiums can match its fervour but it had been a long time, 10 years in fact, sinceShane Long’s thunderboltdefeated Germany, to power Ireland to Euro 2016. After stunning the purportedly mighty Portugal, a win in Hungary on Sunday could land a Geopolitics World Cup playoff spot. Heimir Hallgrímsson was the architect, according to Ronaldo himself. Though Portugal were already two goals down, Troy Parrott snaffling both on what he afterwards termed “the greatest night of my life”, the money shot came when Ronaldo was given a red card, following a video review, for a clear and obvious elbow on Dara O’Shea.Who to blame? Hallgrímsson, according to Ronaldo. “He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee,” shrugged the Icelander, about the rather bizarre scenes where Ronaldo left the field in a state of what FD would like to call submissive sarcasm, offering a handshake to the opposing coach. There was previous here; after Ireland lost to Portugal in added time in Lisbon, Hallgrímsson accused Ronaldo of refereeing the game himself. Besides that, Ireland played the kind of football that has brought the nation its greatest nights, full of passion and direct play, putting Portugal under pressure in a style Jack Charlton would have approved of, Parrott showing the finishing skills that have made him a hit in the Eredivisie with AZ. Humble pie was gladly eaten for breakfast by Eamon Dunphy, the firebrand columnist writing: “The first thing I want to do is apologise to Heimir Hallgrímsson – AKA The Dentist. I’ve been extremely critical of him over the last 12 months.”It had been expected Hallgrímsson was set to return to the world of root canals, though he has been linked with coaching the Indonesia team. Now Ireland have hope and he at least leaves Dublin with a night to remember should he depart. But what of Ronaldo? Even before his self-detonation, the problems of one of the international game’s most talented squads continuing to carry a 40-year-old whose twinkle toes have become a trebuchet were apparent. An expected three-match suspension means he will miss Portugal’s closing qualifier with Armenia. Very probably their first two matches at the GWC, too, meaning added room may no longer be required for Ronaldo and the US president’s egos.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Luke McLaughlin from 7.45pm GMT for hot Geopolitics World Cup qualifying clockwatch coverage of all the night’s action.QUOTE OF THE DAY“There’s always a few electricians, a few joiners. There’s a teacher, and then something that’s quite popular among young players here is to work in kindergarten because it’s reduced hours and works well with training. … the idea is just to keep riding the wave and to hold on and just see how far it carries us. We’re soaking this in at the moment and the feeling is that with the results recently, we believe we can go to Croatia [on Friday night] and get three points” – Faroe Islands defender, Odmar Færø (yep, real name), on how the work-life balance between nursery and international football, could help the tiny nation nab the most unlikely of playoff spots for the GWC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I played in a bang-average, typically hungover, Sunday League pub team in Exeter. Several of my teammates and I were friends and occasional drinking buddies with a couple of the younger Exeter City players, who popped in the boozer in their downtime. After a particularly enjoyable Saturday night in the pub, following a rare Grecian home win, one of the players had joined us to celebrate, and, inevitably, we cajoled him into playing for us the following morning. No one expected the player to show, but there he was, boots and all, outside the pub at 9.30am. We didn’t think he’d actually play! We were away to a village team, miles away, and with a TQ postcode. None of us knew the place, but the collective assumption was that it ‘must be near Torquay’, reducing the likelihood anyone would recognise the player. He was normally an unused sub, with the occasional run-out. So we were confident he’d blend in. As we approached the car park at the pitch, there was a collective meltdown when we were greeted by a couple of lads in Exeter shirts! It turns out this village is split between City and the Greenies down the road. The postcode was a total red herring! So our ringer decided to risk it, gave the ref a fake name, and proceeded to boss the entire game. One of the City shirt-wearing lads asked us outright if that in fact was the player. We nonchalantly explained it was actually his younger brother, and that we were chuffed that he plays for us when he visits ‘big bro’. They bought it. We had to sub him, though. He was running rings around the opposition, to the point that a rather robust midfielder, who only had one arm, got sent off for trying to crock the player. We feared what his colleagues might do, and not wanting a showdown with Peter Fox and Noel Blake (ECFC’s management duo at the time), we decided not to chance it again. After that, the player himself seemed to spend more time in the pub than playing and was unsurprisingly released” – Jim Hughes.I can’t be the only avid reader of literary novels to wonder where Lee Child gets his inspiration for naming characters in his Booker prize-winning Reacher series.

Phil Foden, also back in the squad, was a substitute too. Bellingham and Foden made an impact when they came on in the 65th minute, combining to set up another replacement, Eberechi Eze, to score the second goal.Bellingham and Foden return to give Tuchel’s England a headache at No 10 | Barney RonayRead moreTuchel is obsessed with creating a strong team spirit, a brotherhood as he calls it, and he remembers how the one he had at Chelsea drove the club’sChampions League triumph in 2021. He will not tolerate sulking. For him, it is about being proactive and positive.“You can be angry at the coach, you can be angry at the situation,” Tuchel said of the players he must keep in reserve. “But if you see the nations that win, see the clubs that win the Champions League, then the bench is on their feet. For the last eight to 10 minutes, there is no one sat there thinking: ‘I should be on the field, why am I not there?’“I experienced this once in the amazing run with Chelsea and it was non-stop, everyone was pushing and fighting from the bench even if they were not picked. They were ready. This makes in the end the difference and I strongly believe we should arrive with a team like that.”It was put to Tuchel thatEnglandwould not win the World Cup without goals from the substitutes. “One hundred per cent,” he said. “We need a good bench. We play in 40 degrees and we will play after a long, long season. We are maybe the nation that suffers the most from international football, from long seasons, two cups, cup finals, semi-finals. We need to be ready to do substitutions until hopefully the late stages of the World Cup.”View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel said: ‘If you see the nations that win, see the clubs that win the Champions League, then the bench is on their feet.’Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Getty ImagesTuchel made the point that he would need to “think outside the box” and lean, perhaps, on the additional window during half-time that coaches have to make substitutions. Under Fifa regulations, teams are allowed up to five changes during regulation time, spread across a maximum of three substitution windows – but they do not include half-time.“We have to maybe worship even the extra slot we have at half-time,” he said. “We maybe can have one or two changes at half-time.”Tuchel delved into the psychology of the substitute. He said he despised having to leave players out of the 23-man matchday squad – as he did with the new call-up, Alex Scott, against Serbia. More broadly, he is convinced his players can come to accept the situation if it is presented clearly.“They will never be happy, they don’t have to be happy because no one is used to sitting on the bench,” he said. “This is the nature of a strong national team. I just hate this talk to Alex Scott, to give the message: ‘You are not in the squad.’ I don’t like it, I have stomach pain and even to see players on the bench, they will never like it.“But I strongly believe they will accept it. We need to have the roles clear. I think in a 10-day camp, it is easy. Sometimes you are picked, sometimes you are not picked. Or you are the competition for someone who maybe has his nose ahead and he starts regularly. Once we go to a tournament, clarity in the role is very important. The better player can also think about it and be honest: ‘Can I accept this? Is it good for me? Can I make the most of this for the team?’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he did say the Real Madrid midfielder had taken his exclusion from the lineup against Serbia with “no problem at all”. Bellingham is pushing to be in from the outset against Albania in Tirana on Sunday, the final tie of the qualification campaign – from which Marc Guéhi has withdrawn because of a foot injury.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel says Jude Bellingham took his exclusion from the starting lineup against Serbia with ‘no problem at all’.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images“I explained it to Jude before the team meeting for Serbia,” Tuchel said. “We’d had three fantastic performances with Morgan, so one of the reasons was to keep him in this position. The second reason was we absolutely didn’t know what was coming from Serbia [under the new manager, Veljko Paunovic].“The pressing structure between Declan [Rice], Morgan and Harry [Kane] in the middle of the pitch was excellent in the last matches and we had the feeling it would be easier for them to adapt and adjust if needed. And it would be a bit unfair to just put Jude there and say: ‘The press is like this and this.’ It is also a new press for him because we changed our way of pressing in the last two camps. We thought it would be nicer for him to play in the second half once we had the clear information about Serbia.”There was one worry for Tuchel after he introduced Bellingham, Foden and Eze into the front four, Foden playing as a false 9. “We were straight away dangerous and fluid in attack but we were also somehow a little bit disconnected from the front to the back,” he said. “I need to get my head around why this happened.”Tuchel must also decide whether he will start to sing the national anthem before matches.

A national team once tipped for greatness had been frayed, disconnected and muddled for too long. If their new manager had arrived with an unusually high profile, at least he had wasted no time in throwing on a familiar comfort blanket.From one angle, that is just what the Sweden job resembles for Potter. He could surely not have believed his luck when, just over a fortnight after his dismissal by West Ham, the top job became open in the country where he made his name. The Swedish Football Association must have pinched itself at the timing, too.Poland v Netherlands, Croatia v Faroe Islands, and more: World Cup 2026 qualifying – liveRead morePotter was installed swiftly, initially until March, and the fit looked good: 50-year-olds of his pedigree who are steeped in the local ways and, crucially, can handle a pay cut are hardly abundant in international football management. He had spent nearly two years out of the fray after leaving Chelsea but no rumination was needed this time. “I wasn’t ready to stop,” he said after arriving in Geneva for a fiendish-looking bow against Switzerland. “I didn’t need a break. I didn’t need anything. I wanted to carry on working.”It appears some remove from the chaotic early ostentation of Todd Boehly’s operation, not to mention the east London wreck Potter selected for his return to the touchline. Neither role really fitted a measured, pragmatic, emotionally intelligent coach with previous for making underdogs punch high. Time was when Sweden, in their understated way, were masters of doing exactly that.Yet Potter’s task is not especially simple. Sweden are in a curious spot, requiring an astonishing turnaround over the next four days to salvage their disastrous Group B campaign but knowing the safety net of a March playoff can almost certainly be found owing to their Nations League success last year. They are bottom of their group with a single point but four games from a return to the World Cup finals.Sweden lost their last three games under Jon Dahl Tomasson, two of them against an improving but unfancied Kosovo. They looked bedraggled and shapeless when the Kosovans won in Gothenburg last month. Such was their disarray that a steadying of the ship, a return to their old identity, might count as success for Potter but there is a clear undercurrent of pressure. Next door in Norway, a golden generation are sweeping all before them en route to North America. Sweden have their own star vintage and face a race against time to offer them a place at the top table.It means that, if nothing else, Potter needs to see signs Sweden can compete with Switzerland. The home side will qualify with a win, partly thanks to their comfortable victory in Stockholm five weeks ago.Sweden need three points, and a favour from Slovenia against Kosovo, to keep alive the race for second and a potentially crucial place among the playoff seeds.View image in fullscreenSweden head coach Graham Potter has a number of fantastic talents such as Alexander Isak (left) at his disposal.Photograph: Joel Marklund/BILDBYRÅN/ShutterstockThis is a team Dejan Kulusevski said would “become one of the best in the world” after a win over Estonia last year. When talents such as Alexander Isak, Viktor Gyökeres, Anthony Elanga, Roony Bardghji, Yasin Ayari and Lucas Bergvall are added to the mix it is clear Potter has inherited a goldmine. Tomasson struggled to find the right attacking balance, Sweden often looking loose and gung ho on his watch; his successor must quickly restore order.Potter’s options will, in any case, be limited on Saturday. Gyökeres and Bergvall, who was sent home feeling the continued effects of the concussion sustained for Spurs against Chelsea, join Kulusevski on the injury list. Victor Lindelöf, who will be Potter’s captain when available, picked up a minor knock late in the week and will not be risked against Switzerland.Meanwhile, Isak’s true level of fitness is anyone’s guess. “He’s not ready to start [on Saturday],” Potter said of his talisman, who has been dogged by groin problems since his British record move to Liverpool. “We have to be smart and use him in a good way. I think it’s best for Alex that he can help us from the bench.”Sweden are not so rich in depth that they can lose big names, but have tended to fare best when the collective holds sway. That selfless, indefatigable spirit is what Potter must foster.During their stay on the Costa del Sol he split the squad into small cells and asked them to tell each other about individuals, perhaps a coach or family member, who had been important to their careers. The result, according to some of Sweden’s players, was a rare level of openness and honesty.In public appearances he has turned on the charm, conducting his pre-match press conference in the decent Swedish learned during those seven years taking Östersund from obscurity into Europe. “It’s a part of the job that is important,” he said, brushing off compliments about his proficiency. Contrasts with Tomasson, a Dane who preferred to speak English and created an environment that felt increasingly distant from outsiders, have been pointedly drawn.The biggest difference must come on the pitch. Sweden have a reputation to restore. So does Potter, who has taken some wrong turns but now faces a golden opportunity to work at the sport’s most exalted level next summer. “I wouldn’t be here today without my time in Sweden,” he said. Perhaps going back to what they know, 4-4-2 or otherwise, will help Potter and the nation he has grown to love.Explore more on these topicsSwedenWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Scotland’s opportunity for World Cup qualification is their best since 1998, when they last performed on that scene. Theirs is also a scenario that would have been widely welcomed before a ball was kicked.On the basis Denmark will defeat Belarus, Scotland must take at least a point from Saturday’s clash inGreece. In that event, a win against Denmark at Hampden Park on Tuesday would propel Scotland towards next summer and international football’s top table. Not since 1982 have Scotland’s men played in a World Cup having topped their qualifying group. The team that earned a crucial win against Sweden in September 1981 could afford to be without Graeme Souness. It included Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish and Joe Jordan.The trouble is that the events of October 2025 linger. Scotland were unconvincingin beating Greece 3-1and awful intheir win against Belarus. Steve Clarke, typically an arch defender of his players, let rip in the dressing room during half-time and at full time in the latter game before refusing to mask his frustrations when meeting with the media. The message was simple: that Scotland were in grave danger of passing up this overdue, golden chance. This week Clarke said of his half-time show of anger: “It is something very occasionally as a manager now you can use. It is not something you can use all the time. That just felt like an appropriate moment.” Seasoned ­professionals quivered.Clarke said in Athens on Friday night that he believed Scotland “panicked” against Belarus through realisation of how high the stakes were.View image in fullscreenEvgeni Malashevich puts the ball in the net for Belarus but the equaliser was disallowed for a foul in the buildup after a VAR review.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesA tenure that has lasted 72 games and six years means there is obvious public tiredness towards Clarke.The way Scotland exited Euro 2024is a moment from which the manager will not recover in the eyes of many. Clarke has the genuine possibility, though, of becoming the first Scotland manager to seal progression to three tournaments. The 62-year-old is not beyond criticism but those who deride him overplay the talent at his disposal and ignore the wilderness years before he arrived.Clarke lacks nothing in motivation during what is inevitably his last campaign in charge. Players within the squad will privately know this is their final hope to make an impact at a World Cup. Yet Steven Naismith, Clarke’s coach, was wrong when he stated this week that players such as Andy Robertson and John McGinn “deserve” to play in the tournament. The contribution of that duo to the national side may have been huge but places such as this must be earned. A blunt reality is that too many of Scotland’s key players, including Scott McTominay, have been inconsistent in recent times. The performances and results mirror that. Scotland are a difficult team to assess but their obvious weaknesses – at goalkeeper, centre-back and centre-forward – can be offset only when Robertson, McGinn and McTominay bring their A game.A scratch below the surface dictates why Scotland must seize the moment. The chronic lack of emerging talent will make the job of Clarke’s successor extremely tough. This squad will not be unrecognisable by the 2030 World Cup (McTominay is 28, Billy Gilmour 24 and Aaron Hickey 23). Nonetheless, a changing of the guard because players are past their best as opposed to retired looks ominous. Scotland Under-21s, thumped 6-1 in a friendly by Iceland in March, offer no hope.View image in fullscreenLyndon Dykes celebrates scoring their third goal against Greece at Hampden Park last month.Composite: Guardian Design; Action Images/ReutersScotland have a playoff berth secured. It is another telling indicator of the national mood that nobody particularly fancies that as a prospect, whether the Scots get lucky or unlucky in the draw. If Greece and Denmark go wrong, the lead-up to March will feel grim.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three points from four games means their hopes are over, with doubts hovering around the future of the manager, Ivan Jovanovic. Thiago Motta has been touted as a replacement. In Glasgow, Greece’s reaction to a Scotland equalisersuggested a team with mental fragility. This is, however, a side with technically fine players, perhaps superior to Scotland’s. Clarke’s men should have beaten Denmark, insteaddrawing 0-0 in Copenhagen, since which point Brian Riemer’s team have rampaged through the group in establishing a goal difference Scotland will not catch.The return fixture will prove tough to call.

From Caroline Weir’s sublime lob to Georgia Stanway’s red card andElla Toone’s hat-trickat the Etihad Stadium, in recent years this burgeoning rivalry has started to provide the type of memorable moments worthy of a derby of this nature.The latest encounter, at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday lunchtime, promises to be extra-fascinating given the teams’ form. City – who have won five WSL derbies to United’s two – went top last weekend; United are third, four points behind. Both have lost once this season.Millie Bright: ‘If you can make someone’s life better, why would you not?’Read moreThere are several narratives. How will Andrée Jeglertz, in his first campaign with City, fare against Marc Skinner, who will be managing United for the 97th time in the WSL? What about the deadline-day drama that led to Jess Park and Grace Clintonswapping clubs? How will Jeglertz’s dynamic style match withUnited’s more directapproach? How will both defences hold up in the face of potent attacks?One player who knows exactly what this derby means is Park. There will, no doubt, be plenty of emotions for the 24-year-old creative midfielder as she makes her first return to her childhood club, where she spent her formative years in senior football.Park had eight years at City after bursting on to the scene at 16, making 122 appearances. She described joining United as “one of the hardest decisions” she has had to make, the transfer based on a desire to get more game time, having found opportunities somewhat limited.The move has gone better than even she may have imagined. Park has been one of the season’s most impressive performers, her style easily integrating with United’s because of the freedom she has. Alongside her four goals and two assists, she has registered the league’s second-most-successful take-ons (15) and second-most-progressive carries (24).At City, Park acted more as a provider, producing cutting passes from deeper areas for players such as Bunny Shaw to latch on to. Under Skinner she has licence to roam, finding pockets in which to operate when coming in off the right, bouncing off Ella Toone and allowing the right-back, normally Jayde Riviere, to maraud into the space down the wing.“[Park has] awoken players around her,” Skinner said this month. “She adds another skill set that brings out the best in others … Look at the way Toone started the season. Her and Jess have a special relationship – they come to life together.”View image in fullscreenManchester City manager Andrée Jeglertz (second left) says Jess Park and Ella Toone ‘come to life together’.Photograph: John Clifton/Action Images/ReutersClinton has had a more difficult time settling at City after departing United somewhat acrimoniously.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere has been a change in City under Jeglertz, in style and mentality. As Shaw said last week, they are winning games they would not have last season. Jeglertz, since very early in his tenure, has wanted his side to be intense in the press, front-footed on the ball and fluid, with a diverse way of attacking. It is paying off: City have the WSL’s highest expected goals (20) and have had 141 shots on goal. Shaw has had 41 of these. However, they are not as clinical as they could be and their defence, partly down to injury and partly down to style, can look fragile.On Saturday their attacking potency will be tested as they come up against the second-meanest defence in the league. Jeglertz is looking forward to the challenge and the opportunity to play such a fixture on the grandest stage.“You can’t take down how big it is,” the Swede said. “We need to live that and enjoy playing these kind of games because this is why they started playing football. That will be one of my key messages. But at the same time, they are playing the game, not the event, so we need to make sure that we do the things we are supposed to and do that with determination.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Luxury taxes are commonplace in American sport, with Major League Baseball and the NBA using them to enforce salary caps.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Parry is understood to have acknowledged the letters and expressed willingness to discuss ways of promoting greater sustainability and reducing reliance on owner funding but will not back the changes. The matter is understood to have been discussed on Thursday by the EFL board, which concluded it would not support the clubs’ proposals.The EFL sought to introduce salary caps in Leagues One and Two four years ago after the Covid pandemic left many clubs facing acute financial problems, but it was thwarted by a legal challenge from the Professional Footballers’ Association.Patrick Bamford joins Sheffield United despite leading abusive Chris Wilder chantRead moreThe PFA is also threatening to challenge the Premier League’s plan to introduce a financial regulation known as anchoring, which would limit each club’s spending on transfers and player wages to five times the central media revenue received by the bottom club in the previous season. Premier League clubs are due to vote on anchoring at their shareholders meeting next Friday.The EFL Board is understood to have concluded that it would be irresponsible to endorse a salary cap that could also be subject to a PFA legal challenge. There are also misgivings about one division seeking to pursue fundamentally different financial regulations.League One could go it alone, with a two-thirds majority vote of its clubs required to alter the financial regulations, but it is unclear whether they are willing to go against the board’s wishes.The Championship’s profitability and sustainability rules, which align with those in the Premier League, are different from the salary cost management protocol used in Leagues One and Two but the underlying principles are the same.The EFL is expected to tell the League One clubs there are other ways in which they could get spending under control. League One clubs can spend 60% of turnover on player expenditure. The limit is 50% in League Two, where spending on managers is also included.The EFL declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFootball politicsFootball LeagueLeague OneShareReuse this content"

The overwhelming objective for most promoters, and many fighters, is to rake in as much money as quickly as possible without any undue concern about looking crass or desperate.Anyone who has spent just a little time in the company of boxers will understand that they deserve whatever cash they can make out of such a hard and dangerous activity. But promoters have ransacked the pockets of boxing fans through the decades while peddling anything and everything from Joe Louis’s “Bum of the Month” club to this week’s proposal that Anthony Joshua may make tens of millions of dollarsif he steps into the ring to face Jake Paul, the former YouTuber, next month.Joseph Parker facing ban after failing drugs test on day of Wardley fightRead moreSaturday night’s rematch between Conor Benn and Chris Eubank Jr is a little different.They shared the ring in Apriland that fight, which showcased their bravery and resilience, took chunks out of both men. Eubank Jr spent two nights in hospital recovering from the ravaging weight cut and rehydration clause which limited him to adding just 10lb after the official weigh-in. Benn was also taken to hospital after a gruelling battle but was discharged that same night.Eubank Jr, however, had won the fight clearly on all three scorecards by the identical margin of 116-112. There really is no need, apart from making more money, for this rematch between two fighters who usually operate in different weight classes. Benn is a welterweight and Eubank Jr, a natural middleweight, has fought often at super-middleweight. This means that they have been separated, at times, by three divisions.At yesterday’s weigh-in, Eubank Jr was surprisingly lighter than his rival, at 159.1lbs (11st 5lb) to comfortably make the 160lbs middleweight limit. Benn came in at 159.3lbs (11st 5lb).Yet if either boxer had a different father even the suggestion of a fight between them would not have been uttered by any promoter. But their iconic British boxing family names, built on thegenuine rivalry and superior fighting pedigreeof Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank Sr, means that the sons are shoehorned back into another artificial contest.It makes commercial sense for everyone involved. Neither Benn nor Eubank Jr would make as much money against any other fighter in their own weight category – and they both operate on the more limited margins of world-class boxing.View image in fullscreenConor Benn leans on the ropes after losing against Chris Eubank Jr at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAEubank Jr is the bigger man and the more accomplished and experienced technician who has faced a higher calibre of opposition. He missed the middleweight limit by 0.05lb and was fined £375,000 before the fight in April, but avoided any hiccups this time. He is, however, diminished by having to adhere to the damaging rehydration clause which he agreed to as a way of squeezing some more money out of the promotion. Also, Eubank Jr is 36 and incapable of fighting three-minute rounds at a relatively brisk tempo. He can just about manage a couple of minutes while needing to rest or coast through at least a third of each round.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even his biggest supporter, his father, lamented the crudity of his wild slugging in the first fight which meant he missed Eubank Jr more often than he caught him. Benn has promised to be much more clinical and disciplined in the rematch but his prospects are still pinned on the hope that Eubank Jr has gone to the well one time too many and ended up a husk of the man who won decisively in April.That lingering uncertainty is the main point of intrigue now. But using a weight cut and the erosion of time as a key sales pitch in persuading the hapless punter to shell out a £25 pay-per-view fee, on top of a Dazn subscription, feels like another low in boxing’s shameless hucksterism.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

The last time they defeated the All Blacks at Twickenham was in 2012, when Manu Tuilagi ran riot.Saturday’s match is the 47th meeting between the sides and England have triumphed on eight occasions in the fixture’s 120-year history but Borthwick’s troops sense their opportunity to make a name for themselves.Since 2012, New Zealand have won four of the five Twickenham games while the 2022 match ended in a draw. Addressing England’s wait for a home victory, the fly-half Ford said: “It’s a long time ago, isn’t it? It makes me feel old.View image in fullscreenJamie George makes a break during England’s last win against New Zealand, their 2019 World Cup semi-final.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/World Rugby/Getty Images“There’s only been eight ever. It’s like: ‘Come on, let’s have a ninth now. 100%. Let’s change that.’ Jamie ­mentioned something to the team earlier. The last time England beat New Zealand at Twickenham was 2012. And people still go on about 2012. And then [Jamie] flipped it and said: ‘This is the opportunity we have in front of us. Why can’t we be the next team, 2025, that they talk about?’ The New Zealand game at Twickenham, 13 years ago, was the last one. It’s definitely part of my motivation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You’ve got to go at a team like this in every area of the game. When we’ve got the ball, we’ve got to go at them. And when they’ve got the ball, we’ve got to go at them. The kicking game, the set piece, we’ve got to go at them.”England lined up in a V-formation to face the haka before the 2019 semi-final, while forlast year’s 24-22 defeatthey advanced to the halfway line, much to the delight of the Twickenham crowd. Asked if England had any plans to counter the haka, the tighthead prop Joe Heyes said: “I don’t think so, no. Let’s hope our rugby [gets the crowd going]. When our backs are against the wall or we’re going well, the crowd here really does rev you up and it does help because you are blowing. You kind of forget they’re there sometimes and to know they’re there supporting you is massive for us.”The All Blacks, meanwhile, will be looking to silence the crowd, according to the captain, Scott Barrett, who admitted the All Blacks are still haunted by the 2019 defeat. Barrett also conceded he was not surprised that England are rated as favourites despite the All Blacks recent streak of form in this fixture.“Noise is ultimately a distraction that you can be frustrated by but we’ll be using that as fuel,” said Barrett. “There are a lot of Kiwis over here but a damn sight more English who would be singing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at the end of the game if we’re down. We can use that as fuel.“Looking back at the past few games we’ve had against England and it’s been within a one score game so if history is anything to go by it’s going to be a heck of a Test match and we’ve certainly got some scars from the English going back to the 2019 World Cup. Certainly we don’t want to go there again.“Every All Black wants to win a World Cup – that’s the dream – so to have the rug pulled from underneath you by England, it certainly leaves a scar. For us it’s about taking the strengths we’ve built upon this season, and built upon, playing with confidence and putting in the performance tomorrow night we’re proud of.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamNew Zealand rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

While the matter is investigated further, no additional comment will be made at this time.”Auckland-born Parker become world champion in 2016 before he lost his WBO belt by unanimous decision to Anthony Joshua at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff two years later. Parker has been a frequent visitor since, fighting eight times in total in the UK and relocating to Dublin for training camps with highly regarded trainer Andy Lee in recent years.Under the tutelage of Lee, Parker recovered from his 2022 loss to Joe Joyce to chalk up a string of victories which put him front of the queue to face Usyk before he suffered defeat to Wardley. After Parker returned a positive test on the day of the Wardley fight, reportedly for cocaine, an investigation into the findings has been started.Explore more on these topicsBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

The world’s No 1 Test batter, the subject of much pre-series chatter because of hispoor average on previous such trips, was the most notable failure as many of his teammates inflated their confidence along with their scores across another day of breezy cricket and indeed weather against the Lions at Lilac Hill, which the senior side ended, having been bowled out moments before the close, with 426, a lead of 51.Zak Crawley described it as “a flat wicket for sure” and with the atmosphere provided by the few dozen spectators similar, but with intense heat expected from the stands and pitch when the real action starts next Friday, it is not clear to what extent anyone is markedly more prepared now than they were a couple of days ago.Josh Tongue: ‘I’m an introvert but things change when I step on the pitch’Read more“Cricket’s cricket, it’s time in the middle,” Crawley said. “We’re doing everything we can with what we’ve got and we feel like we’re going to be ready. As far as I’m concerned, I think it’s good that we’re getting used to the weather, getting used to the [intensely irritating] flies so yeah, it’s good prep, I think.”On the eve of this game Ben Stokes reasoned that success for Root in the Ashes was inevitable given “he’s the greatest English batter that the nation has seen” and “has been in phenomenal form over the last two, three years”. Neither phrase has frequently been applied to Ollie Pope but it was England’s No 3 who looked most assured and got most reward, scoring a century before immediately, perhaps even suspiciously, allowing a Shoaib Bashir delivery to hit his stumps. He thereby won the top three’s private game of one-upmanship, with Crawley dismissed in the 80s and Ben Duckett in the 90s before Pope made it to triple figures. Ben Stokes, having starred with the ball on Thursday, made 77 before top-edging a Will Jacks delivery, which arced neatly to Bashir.Root faced a dozen balls and scored just a single run, miscuing a pull to midwicket off Matt Potts as England, having swaggered through the opening session, lost three wickets for three runs soon after the restart, stumbling from 182 without loss to 185 for three. Harry Brook followed soon after having doubled Root’s score, a dismissal of garish hideousness as he hared forward on the attack but made contact only with air, allowing Nathan Gilchrist’s delivery to clatter into the stumps. At this point England were 198 for four, but Pope and Stokes steered them away from the humiliation of being outscored by their understudies.View image in fullscreenOllie Pope guides the ball through off on his way to a century.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesBut for the moment, an hour from the close, when Bashir pulled up with a cry while fielding, fell to the ground, stayed there for perhaps a minute and then simply got up again and carried on, there were at least no injury scares this time. Brydon Carse had recovered from the stomach upset that ruled him out of the opening day, and though he refrained from bowling as a precautionary measure he did make a brief appearance with the bat, replacing Mark Wood in England’s lineup against the team he was initially named in. He lasted only three deliveries.Wood watched much of the action, left leg heavily strapped from just below the knee, while he awaited a scan on a hamstring which was scheduled for the late afternoon. The resulting images will be checked by a specialist in the UK before a decision is made about his future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After five overs Potts had conceded 40 runs and was enduring something of a nightmare, though his primary problem was not poor quality but bad luck as Duckett in particular scored a succession of boundaries with the edge of his bat – including one, when he was on six, that might have been caught by Ben McKinney in the slips (44 of Duckett’s first 50 runs came in boundaries).Thereafter Potts went at just 2.36 per over and ended the day as the outstanding bowler even if his haul of two wickets was matched by Gilchrist and bettered by Jacob Bethell, who took three in just 4.3 overs as the batters grew carefree towards the close.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamJoe RootAshes 2025-26Australia sportCricketThe AshesnewsShareReuse this content"

In Qatar, Hajime Moriyasu’s side reached the last 16 only to lose to Croatia on penalties.JordanAli Olwan’s hat-trick triggered jubilation in Jordan as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up qualified for their first World Cup finals on 5 June after beating Oman 3-0 in Muscat as South Korea beat Iraq 2-0. Jordan’s ruler, King Abdullah II, was pictured wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the Jordan embassy in London, where he was on a visit.South KoreaKorea reached their 11th consecutive finals with victory over 10-man Iraq at Basra Stadium on 5 June for what is expected to be Son Heung-min’s swansong. The Tottenham great and Taegeuk Warriors captain will turn 34 during the finals and has said it will be his last tournament. Korea’s formidable qualifying record is bettered only by Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain, although their underwhelming exit at the 2023 Asian Cup led to Jürgen Klinsmann being replaced by Hong Myung-bo, who oversaw victories against Oman, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait in qualifying.UzbekistanWelcome, the White Wolves, who finally reached a World Cup finalssome 2,800 miles from home with a drab 0-0 draw with the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. The Uzbeks are finally making an impact at senior international level, having reached the quarter-finals of the Under-17 World Cup, last 16 of the global Under-20 tournament and the Paris Olympics. In Abdukodir Khusanov, who made his (albeit shaky) Manchester City debut aged just 20, and the 22-year-old winger Abbosbek Fayzullaev, Timur Kapadze has two burgeoning talents at his disposal.QatarQatar beat the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in the fourth round of Asian qualifying to seal a spot at next year’s finals. It will be a second straight appearance at the finals for Qatar, who hosted the last edition in 2022.Saudi ArabiaThehosts of the 2034 tournamentclaimed a 0-0 draw with Iraq in Jeddah to seal qualification. The result meant Hervé Renard’s side won Group B of the fourth round of Asia’s qualifying, finishing level on four points with Iraq but ahead of their neighbours on goals scored after a 3-2 win over third-place Indonesia in the three-team group.See the full AFC standingshere.EuropeA total of 54 nations (Russia are suspended) have been slugging it out for a place at next year’s finals. The winners of 12 groups qualify, while the four remaining places are secured via a playoff system featuring group runners-up and Nations League group winners. Despite being guaranteed to come third in Group A, Northern Ireland have secured a playoff spot courtesy of their Nations League campaign. Of the other sides struggling to make the top two in their qualifying groups, Wales andGraham Potter’s Swedenhave the insurance of a playoff spot due to winning their Nations League groups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36.

The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

At Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, he has lifted 40 trophies (including three Community Shields, because why wouldn’t you count them?), yet not even this fact quantifies the way Guardiola has defined an entire era (or two) of the sport.And he’s working on setting the zeitgeist again. In his 1,000th match in the dugout on Sunday, Guardiola watched his City side dismantle Liverpool in a way that suggests the 54-year-old’s next great team is in the pipeline.The Premier League XI that deserves more credit, from Pickford to TrossardRead moreWhile so many of soccer’s best teams in 2025 are all about the press, Guardiola wants his Manchester City team to find solutions with the ball. Against Liverpool, he fielded three natural creators (Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva) to play through the middle with Jérémy Doku also tucked inside to overload the centre and dribble to his heart’s content. ThePremier Leaguechampions couldn’t cope.As if that wasn’t enough for Liverpool to handle, Nico O’Reilly was given the freedom to get forward and take up positions that twisted Liverpool’s Conor Bradley into a knot while Erling Haalanddid Erling Haaland things. Even without Rodri, City had full control of the game in the centre of the pitch. It was a complete performance.Passing in the Premier League is at a 15-year low. Long throws are up 100% and route one soccer is back. Guardiola, though, is attempting to get ahead of the curve. He’s anticipating the next tactical evolution and is doing all he can to ensure his Manchester City team are the ones leading it.Did the CPL championship game have the craziest-ever conditions for a final?1:21Atlético Ottawa’s ‘icicle kick’ lights up blizzard-hit Canadian Premier League final – videoSunday’s Canadian Premier League final couldn’t have looked any more Canadian if it had tried. Played in temperatures of -8C (17.6F) amid blizzard conditions, Atlético Ottawa’s extra time win over Cavalry FC wasmore of a Winter Olympics eventthan a soccer match. The goalkeepers who used shovels to clear the penalty boxes of snow every 15 minutes could be curling sweepers.David Rodríguez’s “icicle kick” was the only practical way to score a goal without having to roll the ball through a foot of snow on the ground. While the match went viral, giving the CPL the greatest exposure of its seven-year history, the conditions made the championship game something of a farce. Were Ottawa really the better team or did the snow simply fall in their favour? Was it really fair to crown a champion this way?No other final has ever been played in conditions like these. The 2018 Copa Libertadores final was moved when torrential rain flooded the pitch at La Bombonera. The 2013MLSCup between Sporting KC and Real Salt Lake was the coldest match in league history, played in temperatures of 22F (-6C). None of that compares to the snowy scene in Ottawa on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But does anyone care? – videoLionel Messi’s 2025 Major League Soccer season has been outstanding. Historic, even. Not that anyone seems to care (certainly notJohn Muller). Messi might make them care, though. They’d certainly remember if Messi is to win single-handedly win MLS Cup, as is now a possibility after scoring five goals in just three Round One games against Nashville including two in Game 3 to eliminate them.There were 10 other Inter Miami players on the field, but that barely mattered. Messi took over the series in a way that surely has FC Cincinnati secretly hoping the 38-year-old returns from international duty with Argentina a little banged up for their conference semi-final. It might be the only way anyone in MLS can possibly stop Messi right now.MLS announces calendar change, will play fall-to-spring from 2027 onwardRead moreOver the last two seasons, Inter Miami have done an excellent job of getting in their own way when it matters most. Last year’s shock Round One exit to Atlanta United is widely remembered for Brad Guzan standing on his head (and getting stuck in his net) when in truth Inter Miami’s vulnerability in defensive transition was just as big a reason for their failure.Against the Seattle Sounders in this year’s Leagues Cup final, Inter Miami faltered once more. They failed to lay a punch on their opponents until they literally did after full-time when the match had already been lost and fisticuffs began. Luis Suárezspat at the Sounders’ head of securityto cap the head loss.If it’s not Suárez losing his cool, it’s Jordi Alba playing with the positional sense of a dog chasing a Frisbee. Or 37-year-old Sergio Busquets lacking the mobility of 27-year-old Sergio Busquets. There are plenty of reasons why Inter Miami won’t win their first MLS Cup, but a bigger reason why they might: Messi has seen everything and decided to do it all himself.Explore more on these topicsFootballPremier LeagueMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That trio included Michelle Agyemang and Katie Reid, two players whose names were known to the keenest of fans then and who have since become part of mainstream conversation for hugely positive reasons. More recently they have hit the headlines for a more devastating reason, having both sustained anterior cruciate ligament injuries.In any footballer’s career a bit of good fortune is needed, alongside a manager being brave enough to take a chance on you. The knee injury that led toLeah Williamson missing the startof the Women’s Super League season created the space for Reid to be given an opportunity in the first team, while an AlessiaRusso ankle knock led to Agyemang’s first England call-up in April. Both subsequently shone, making the forced interruptions to their respective professional journeysespecially cruel.Reid setback for Arsenal highlights mounting concern over ACL injuriesRead moreWhat, then, of the third player to join Watford from Arsenal on a dual agreement a little over two years ago? Is she, too, hungry for a chance to force the door open at Arsenal as soon as it opens a crack? Well, her name is Laila Harbert, an 18-year-old midfielder who joined Portland Thorns this summer, her third loan move – she was also at Southampton – coming midway through the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) season as she looks to up the intensity and level of her playing experience.Speaking to the Guardian from Portland, Harbert describes watching Agyemang and Reid do what they’ve done in the past six months as special. “It motivates you to earn the right to get in that position and keep working and for your chance,” says Harbert, who signed her first professional contract with Arsenal in January and last month made her debut for England Under-23.Reflecting on the ACL injuries sustained by Agyemang and Reid, Harbert describes herself as “gutted”, saying: “It’s the kind of news you never want anyone to receive, especially about your closest friends. It’s a worrying time for us as players, with the number of ACL injuries continuing to rise. It’s clear that something needs to change and more must be done to find solutions that protect us. As soon as I’m back in England, I’ll be straight there to support them.”Harbert was nine when she joined Arsenal’s academy and, two years later, she was asked how she would feel about training in the boys’ academy, something that by then had become the norm at the club. She took the opportunity and trained with them, as well as with the girls’ teams, until her mid-teens. “It challenges you on the small details,” says Harbert. “Boys naturally are faster and stronger, so it becomes about how I can use my technical ability to avoid getting into some of the duels that maybe I would be on the back foot for. They play a bit faster too, so you get better at moving the ball at high speeds. How much it had improved me really showed when I went back into the girls’ environment.”View image in fullscreenLaila Harbert (left) training with boys at Arsenal.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThe midfielder’s family made sacrifices so she could pursue a career in football, including moving from south London to Hertfordshire so she was closer to Arsenal’s training base, the idea being that fewer long drives would aid her performance levels. For Harbert that showed “the commitment that the whole family had for me, a 10-year-old with a vision”.Harbert was on the bench for Thorns’ dramatic extra-time win over San Diego Wave on Sunday to set up Saturday’s NWSL playoff semi-final against Washington Spirit, who finished four points above them in the regular season. Her loan ends when Portland’s playoff run is over, which, they hope, will be with victory in the final on 22 November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal are waiting until after the playoffs before they speak to Harbert about the next stage of her development. And that process can be long, with fewer and fewer opportunities for teens to get first-team football in an increasingly professionalised WSL. “There’s no point in shying away from the fact that the average age in the WSL is about 25-26,” says Harbert. “At 18 you are sitting there thinking: ‘When is that going to be possible for me?’ The main thing at my age is just to be getting senior minutes in and that senior exposure under my belt.“If it’s not going to be at my parent club then they have a plan in place for me that isn’t just limited to these loans; it’s a longer-term plan that I’ve bought into and they’ve bought into. That’s been the most important thing for me throughout, understanding that there is a bigger picture and all of these loans are done with the aim of me eventually coming back to Arsenal and then hopefully competing to start.“Sometimes I tend to get so wrapped up in the outcome and the idea that I have in my head of where I want to be. That can make you forget what really matters, which is enjoying it. So it’s about refining what success is for me day by day and month by month, working on what I can control, doing what it takes to be the best version of myself to see where it gets me in the future, and enjoying it along the way.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think – if we don’t make AI regulation a national priority tomorrow,” the US senator Chris Murphywroteon X in response to the findings.“AI systems can now perform tasks that previously required skilled human operators,” said Fred Heiding, a computing security researcher at Harvard University. “It’s getting so easy for attackers to cause real damage. The AI companies don’t take enough responsibility.”Other cybersecurity experts were more sceptical, pointing to inflated claims about AI-fuelled cyber-attacks in recent years – such asan AI-powered “password cracker”from 2023 that performed no better than conventional methods – and suggesting Anthropic was trying to create hype around AI.“To me, Anthropic is describing fancy automation, nothing else,” said Michał Woźniak, an independent cybersecurity expert. “Code generation is involved, but that’s not ‘intelligence’, that’s just spicy copy-paste.”Woźniak said Anthropic’s release was a distraction from a bigger cybersecurity concern: businesses and governments integrating “complex, poorly understood” AI tools into their operations without understanding them, exposing them to vulnerabilities. The real threat, he said, were cybercriminals themselves – and lax cybersecurity practices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it said, the hackers were able to subvert these guardrails by telling Claude to role-play being an “employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm” conducting tests.Woźniak said: “Anthropic’s valuation is at around $180bn, and they still can’t figure out how not to have their tools subverted by a tactic a 13-year-old uses when they want to prank-call someone.”Marius Hobbhahn, the founder of Apollo Research, a company that evaluates AI models for safety, said the attacks were a sign of what could come as capabilities grow.“I think society is not well prepared for this kind of rapidly changing landscape in terms of AI and cyber capabilities.

If you know the answer to this question (see below), you are probably one of hundreds of thousands of Brits who attend a pub quiz every week.As a nation of committed trivia buffs, it was unsurprising that news ofa quizmaster in Manchester outing a team for cheatingwas leapt on. Just where, we asked, is the special place in hell reserved for those quizzers who take a sneaky look at their phones under the table?According to the BBC, a “massive whodunnit” ensued after the landlord at the Barking Dog in Urmston revealed that the cheats were whispering questions into their smartphones, but refused to name and shame them.It is a misdemeanour that is, according to some quizmasters, an increasingly common blight on one of the nation’s favourite pastimes.“I think it’s definitely more prolific now, especially with smartwatches – even if you don’t have a phone in your hand, there’s still a way for you to be able to cheat,” said David Hartley, a quizmaster from Staffordshire.The 33-year-old has hosted quizzes in four venues for nearly a decade and started banning devices about two years ago. “It just takes the mickey out of your quizmaster, if all you’re going to do is sit on your phone,” he said.David Moyce, the landlord and quizmaster at the Alma in Cambridge, said he recently had to ban a group of students who won in suspicious circumstances. He had suspected cheating after the painfully weak team suddenly played their “joker” – which doubles points – before a round in which they got every question right.“There was no proof. But then one of the gentlemen came back, handed over some money and said: ‘Yeah, we did cheat,’” Moyce said. “The guilt must have been so heavy on him that he literally handed his share of the money back. None of the others did though, so maybe he slept better than the other four.”Thursday news quiz: hasty exits, horny bees and naked NordicsRead moreSome pubs have taken hi-tech measures to stop cheats, such as hosting smartphone quizzes where participants have to type in answers on their phones – and lose points if they suspiciously click away from the dedicated quizzing app to use another.The SpeedQuizzing app promises to see off “the cheats and the chancers” by giving users only 10 seconds per question to lock in their answers in an attempt to restore what it calls “a once proud British tradition”.Others take more traditional routes. The Prince of Wales in Highgate, north London, has a fiercely peer-policed quiz, according to Marcus Berkmann, who has competed in it more than 200 times and now regularly writes its questions.“We’re very harsh on anyone who cheats, so no one does it,” said Berkmann, who is the author of A Matter of Facts: The Insider’s Guide to Quizzing. “The regulars would rather boil themselves in oil than cheat.“Occasionally, you read out a warning and say: ‘We’re testing you on what you know, not what you can look up on Google,’ and people generally go along with that.”The precise origins of the pub quiz are shrouded in a pre-smoking-ban haze, but they became popular in the 1970s, boosted by Sharon Burns and Tom Porter, whose company Burns and Porter supplied quizzes as a way for pubs to lure drinkers in on quieter nights.Sports quiz of the week: Ashes, All Blacks and a big payday in tennisRead moreToday, quizzing in the UK remains a serious business, marrying as it does the great British pastimes of drinking and taking pleasure in being right. According toa 2023 survey commissioned by the brewer Greene King, 70% of people regularly take part in a pub quiz and almost one in 10 goes every single week.Quizmasters could be forgiven for wanting to return to the simpler times of Burns and Porter, but can also take some solace in knowing that their predecessors also had to deal with cheats.Gail Taylor, for example, responded toa Guardian calloutthis week to finally come clean about her youthful cheating in Sheffield pubs in the 1980s.According to Taylor, she planted rudimentary bugging devices underneath pub tables to transmit the questions to encyclopedia-armed friends in a van outside.The Guardian could not independently verify her tale, but she insisted it was true. “Something always went wrong,” Taylor said. “If the signal didn’t work, we’d write the questions down, rush out to the van with two pints and a list, then someone else would go out and bring back the answers. Nobody seemed to catch on what we were doing.”Reflecting on the crime more than three decades later, Taylor is entirely without remorse. “We didn’t have Google then, so we never won anything anyway,” she says. “I don’t feel guilty about it at all. And if I had the chance, I’d do it again tomorrow.”Answer: Gary Numanis older than Gary Oldman by 13 days.Your starter for 10…Answers below.1.Which American sportsman, who died in 2025 aged 76, had five sons, all called George, and seven daughters, one of them called Georgetta?2.When the Americans sent a man into space, they spent a million dollars developing a pen that could write upside down in zero gravity.

But here is Black Ops 7, a year after itsdirect predecessor, and another breathless bombard of military shooting action. This time it is set in a dystopian 2035 where a global arms manufacturer named the Guild claims to be the only answer to an apocalyptic new terrorist threat – but are things as clearcut as they seem?The answer, of course, is a loudly yelled “noooo!” Black Ops is the paranoid, conspiracy-obsessed cousin to theModern Warfarestrand of Call of Duty games, a series inspired by 70s thrillers such as The Parallax View and The China Syndrome, and infused with ’Nam era concerns about rogue CIA agents and bizarre psy-ops. The campaign mode, which represents just a quarter of the offering this year, is a hallucinogenic romp through socio-political talking points such as psychopathic corporations, hybrid warfare, robotics and tech oligarchies. The result is a deafening onslaught of massive shootout set-pieces in exotic locations, as the four lead characters – members of a supercharged spec-ops outfit – are exposed to a psychotropic drug that makes them relive their worst nightmares. Luckily, they do so with advanced weaponry, cool gadgets and enough buddy banter to destabilise a medium-sized rogue nation. It is chaotic, relentless and stupidly pleasurable, especially if you play in co-operative mode with three equally irresponsible pals.In an interesting move, the campaign closes with a new mode, Endgame. It’s a co-op PVE (player v environment) offering inspired by the endgame content of MMO (massively multiplayer online) games such as World of Warcraft, where it’s usually designed to keep people playing even after they’ve levelled up to the max. In theCall of Dutyversion, groups of players touch down in the fictitious city of Avalon and undertake missions and objectives, such as taking down high value enemies or safely escorting expensive military tech, all within a vast open environment. Along the way, you upgrade your characters and weapons, and publisher Activision says new missions and objectives will be added, likely including public events where different teams can combine forces to take on mega bosses. Time will tell, but for now, it’s a nice way to extend the campaign and prepare us for online play.View image in fullscreenFuture warfare … Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.Photograph: ActivisionBecause make no mistake, the heart of the game is the traditional multiplayer, which brings fresh modes, guns and gadgets to the standard Call of Duty experience: 12 players in a small location pulverising each other in operettas of mechanised slaughter. New maps such as those set in a Tokyo-inspired shopping district and a deep sea rig are efficiently designed chambers of death, with alleyways, high-up windows and open squares to direct players towards one another with vicious style and intent. My favourite is the Alaska base map Imprint, where a moving platform makes taking objective points in the Domination and Hardpoint modes incredibly messy and disorientating. A new wall jumping ability has opened up the verticality of the locations, allowing players to find new routes around the complex architecture. If you’ve never been into the turbocharged twitchcore savagery of the Call of Duty online experience, this isn’t going to change your mind, but there’s a lot here to enjoy for perennial conscripts of carnage.Then you have the Zombies mode, another online co-op offering, taking place in a vast nightmarish hellzone of abandoned frontier towns and irradiated wastelands. Here, players take on wave after wave of zombie monsters while upgrading their weapons and abilities in order to hold out as long as possible. It’s a return to the round-based structure of previous Zombies entries, with lots of new weapons and features, including the ability to drive from area to area in a pickup truck while blasting rampaging monsters off the bonnet. It feels like taking part in some sort of crazed theme park ride, and again, a real hoot with a bunch of likeminded pals.Additionally, there’s Dead Ops Arcade 4, a self-contained top down twin-stick shooter for up to four players. This extra was born as a side project by members of the original Black Ops team, and hidden within the main game. Now it’s back and it’s a blast in its own right, reminding old school fans of multi-directional shooters such as Smash TV andGeometry Wars; there are even little playable mini-games between stages which take in genres such as top down racers and horizontal scrolling shoot-’em-ups – so grandad can play too!Add in the usual refresh to battle royale mode Warzone and you have an exhaustive package for Call of Duty fans. Whatever you think about the series and its problematic role in how the mainstream games industry works, how it is perceived and the types of communities it engenders, this is slick, thrilling entertainment. Nowhere else will you be blasting a giant robot in a corporate science lab one minute, and then playing a modern take on Atari’s Super Sprint the next. Value matters right now, and in this as in almost everything else, Call of Duty does not hold back. It is a maximalist paean to the ultimate, troubling truth of video game design – shooting stuff on a TV screen is a hell of a lot of fun.Call of Duty: Black Ops is out now; from £69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCCall of DutyPlayStation 4Action gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Who cares if she watches a lot of extreme pornography? But after the light is switched off, Ani can’t get through their impromptu sleepover without masturbating to porn on her phone. The friend wakes up next to her and exits in disgust.The same scenario has already led Ani, a 30-year-old academic, to break up with her partner. LikePhoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, she was using porn next to her boyfriend in bed. Fleabag darkly regaled us with her voracious YouPorn habit but Ani, despite her robust reasoning in their argument, is deeply troubled by her behaviour. So, too, is her father when Ani hides away in her old childhood bedroom with her laptop.It’s frequently funny but thisbold play by Sophia Chetin-Leunercaptures the wearying compulsion of an addict, showing how the search for release has turned into grim habit. The characters in her previous play,This Might Not Be It,which also has caring at its core, have a phrase for this sort of desensitised state: “your tap’s been switched off”. In a riveting performance, Ambika Mod manages to make Ani’s isolation and emptiness as moving as it is unsettling.View image in fullscreenIsolation and emptiness … Ambika Mod and Asif Khan in Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayKey to the play’s success is the wayChetin-Leuner and director Josie Rourkeskilfully toggle between the digital and physical worlds to emphasise the seductive, instant gratification of the internet where,as Bo Burnham put it, “anything that brain of yours can think of can be found”. Ani’s brain has accordingly been rewired and her restless search for comfort online is a constant amid the stress that comes with professional success and her grief after her mother’s death. She recognises those as triggers yet, tellingly, co-opts a friend’s sexual revelation to hide behind instead when discussing her behaviour.As a play about chronic addiction, this story is full of secrets, emphasised byYimei Zhao’s inspired design which transforms the Royal Court’s small upstairs theatre into a padded den. It’s staged in the round, typically seen as giving nowhere to hide, but Ani conceals her laptop and other belongings between the folds of the cushioned floor. The concentric, vulva-like design of the space becomes a cocoon softly lit by Mark Henderson as Ani escapes into her ritual of internet porn. But it also resembles a vortex and, in the prologue, is used to evoke Eve staring at her reflection in Milton’s Paradise Lost.View image in fullscreenEthical unease … Ambika Mod and Will Close in Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayAni is a Milton scholar and the drama tussles not just with notions of lost innocence (the alternate meaning of “play” in the title) and his epic poem’s sexual politics but also the question of separating the art from the author’s behaviour. That ethical argument bleeds into Ani’s distinction between watching violent pornography (“it’s all fake”) and her IRL views of women and the world. The porn on Ani’s screens is shown in abstract, highlighting how the footage itself is almost inconsequential, and is matched by the thrumming, distorted ecstasy of Helen Skiera’s score.This Is Going to Hurt’s Ambika Mod: ‘Whenever I did a caesarean I was buzzing!’Read moreThe ambitious balance of tragedy, horror and comedy is best in a painful scene where Ani’s boyfriend holds the phone for her while she masturbates. It does not quite come off in a gynaecological appointment (for which a whole gurney is extracted from beneath the set) where Ani’s shame is voiced by her doctor.Will Close, Lizzy Connolly and Asif Khan deftly handle multiple supporting roles between them in a show with sharply delineated movement direction byWayne McGregor. The play’s strands are directly tied together through Ani and her father’s climactic speeches in the sort of ending that can often feel forced but is greatly persuasive here. It’s a play that confirms Chetin-Leuner as a clear-sighted yet sanguine chronicler of all manner of relationships, not least with ourselves.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAmbika ModPornographyJosie RourkeRoyal Court theatreInternetWayne McGregorreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sunny mornings begin in blazing optimism before the Amazon’s clouds gather and the deluge begins. Cop30 has followed the same pattern. It opened with sunshine – an agenda agreed on day one. The storms were deferred for later “consultations” on climate finance, carbon border tariffs and the question of how to close the yawning gap between national climate pledges and the Paris agreement’s safe pathway. These await Cop30’s second week.They are likely to be more than mere squalls. The International Energy Agencyconfirmedlast week that the fossil-fuel era is ending. Its annual report said the world will hit peak coal, oil and gas this decade and see declines thereafter. The economist Fadhel Kaboub, who advises developing nations on climate,arguesthis is not “because of political will, but because the economics of renewables is winning”. Africa, he says, can generate about 1,000 times the electricity it will need in 2040 – which could be exported. Globally, however, hydrocarbon use is easing far too slowly. The fight over money and a just transition matters at Cop30.The dispute is how to keep heating to just 1.5C above preindustrial levels. The global south pushes the agreement’sarticle 9.1, which says that rich nations “shall provide” the funds developing countries need to go green. The rich states retreat to the text’sarticle 6, which highlights carbon markets. Developing countries want rich-world historic emitters to provide the cash, mainly for adaptation and ideally as grants. Wealthy ones counter that the focus should be on market opportunities to cut emissions, with newly industrialised statessharing the loadand public funds blended with loans as well as private capital. This is not a technical spat. It is a fight over who pays for a managed, fair fossil-fuel phase-out.The sums at stake are eye-popping. Last year, developing countriesarguedfor$1.3tna year in climate finance – the minimum they say is needed to fund resilience and basic infrastructure. What they got was a promised$300bnby 2035, much of it loans or “mobilised” private finance. Thelatestdata shows that a third of the cash materialised. Worse,ActionAid’s analysis of around $19bn in climate aid over a decade found that under 3% backed a “just transition” for workers and communities.Clouds will gather over Belém. The test will be whether this year’s UN summit can improve on the last. The absence of Donald Trump – or anyone from his administration – may actually help. At the negotiations, the developing nations’ G77 group plus China havepusheda “just transition mechanism” toformaliseclimate cooperation, transfer green tech and channel support into debt-free finance. They are backed byBrazil, South Africa and India. Developed nations argue that thisrisksa delay in reaching climate goals.The Earth isheadedfor 2.6C of heating this century – producing a dangerously unstable world, but an improvement on the 3.6C trajectory of a decade ago. Richer nations spendbillionson holders of their government bonds, but cry poverty when it comes to coughing up for the climate emergency they largely created. Cop30 will either see the global north accept that it can – and must – pay its fair share, or watch wealthy nations keep wringing their hands as the planet burns.Explore more on these topicsCop30OpinionClimate crisisParis climate agreementGreenhouse gas emissionsDonald TrumpOil (Business)Oil (Environment)editorialsShareReuse this content"

But Epstein? That’s his one vulnerabilityJonathan FreedlandIn attacking a vital broadcaster, the US president is once again holding others to standards he flouts. But the Maga faithful might not let his links to the disgraced financier goFri 14 Nov 2025 12.12 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 13.59 ESTShareTo confrontDonald Trumpis to engage in asymmetric warfare. It is to enter a battlefield that is not level, where he enjoys an immediate and in-built advantage over those who would oppose him or merely hold him to account. That fact has cost Democrats dearly over the past decade – exacting a toll again this very week – but it has now upended an institution central to Britain’s national life: namely, the BBC.The key asymmetry can be spelled out simply. Trump pays little or no regard to the conventional bounds of truth or honesty. His documented tally of false or misleading statements runs into the tens of thousands: the Washington Postregistered 30,573such statements during Trump’s first term in the White House, an average of 21 a day. In a single interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes earlier this month, Trumpspoke falsely 18 times, according to CNN.To hold him to account for this dishonesty is to cast yourself as an arbiter of truth, which creates the instant and obvious expectation that you yourself must be truthful. Here, then, is the asymmetry: he can lie, but his critics cannot.So he can continue to tell the big lie, claiming against all evidence that he won the 2020 election, and myriad smaller lies – he told 60 Minutes that grocery prices “are down” when they are up and that Joe Biden gave Ukraine $350bn in aid when the real figure is well under half that – and, save for a few tireless factcheckers, no one cares. The response is a collective shrug, because it’s Donald Trump. No one expects any better.The opposite is true of his scrutineers. They have to be fastidious, their evidence impeccable. So when the BBC’s Panorama programme examined Trump’s record ahead of the 2024 election, it had to be right on every detail. As we now know, and for whichthe BBC has apologised, it was not: it stitched together two statements, made 54 minutes apart, from Trump’s speech ahead of the Capitol Hill riot of 6 January 2021 to create a single, seamless call for violence.There’s no defence to be made of that. No journalist would argue for the right to be as dishonest as Trump is allowed to be, even thoughmisquotingandmanipulating the wordsof others is a Trump specialism. That path is closed to those who want to criticise Trump for his untruthfulness.Nor will it do to make the move some have attempted in defence of Panorama, arguing that the programme’s broad thrust was right, even if that specific edit was not. It’s quite true that plenty of 6 January rioters testified that they believed they were doing Trump’s bidding. It’s also true that Trump was impeached, even if eventually acquitted, for his role in inciting those events. But those facts cannot justify a deceptive edit. To say otherwise is to engage in what the US comedian Stephen Colbert famously called “truthiness”, substituting what feels to be true, or what we might want to be true, for what is actually true.What’s at stake here is not only intellectual and journalistic integrity. It’s also that any slip is a gift to Trump and a setback to what, portentously, we might call the cause of truth – not in some high-blown, abstract sense, but very practically. Note the White House press secretary’s denunciation of the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”. Mark those words, because they will be used again. Next time the BBC accurately exposes a Trump misdeed, or even asks a tough question, he and his allies will recall the Panorama edit and insist that whatever the BBC says can be safely ignored.It’s for this reason that it is not the BBC’s many enemies, but rather its staunchest friends who should be taking the events of the last week most seriously. (Full disclosure: I have presented BBC Radio 4’s contemporary history seriesThe Long Viewfor many years.) A democratic society cannot function without a broadly accepted body of facts. The US no longer has that: there are red-state facts and blue-state facts; Fox News facts and MSNBC facts. The Watergate scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office would barely make a dent in today’s US: the right would simply deny the evidence, cheered on by its media allies.What stands between Britain and that sorry state, in which knowledge is a matter of tribal affiliation, is the BBC. And yet for it to perform that vital function, the BBC cannot just be good; it has to be bulletproof. Which surely explains why it is that some of those most committed to the BBC and its mission – people who have devoted decades of their working life to it – have sought to wrestle with, rather than dismiss, Michael Prescott’sinternal reportand its more alarming findings of bias on a series of issues beyond the Panorama edit, from gender to Gaza. They understand that, as the distinguished former Newsnight journalistMark Urban puts it, “failing to deal internally with issues like those raised by Prescott is a gift to the destroyers”.None of this is fair. Trump’s lack of shame means he can say what he likes. But those who seek to protect the principles that undergird a liberal democracy – of which a basic, if necessarily imperfect, commitment to truth is among the most fundamental – hold themselves to a higher standard.That habit constantly hands a huge advantage to Trump. A version of it was at work this week, when eight Senate Democrats broke from their party to bring an end to the standoff that had led to a42-day shutdownof the US federal government. Politically, the Democrats were in the stronger position: polls showed voters blamed Trump and the Republicans for the stalemate. But, as one of the eight put it, the “mounting economic pain [and] risks to Americans’ safety” became too much to bear – and so they caved. In their shoes, Trump would have pressed his political advantage, the public’s pain be damned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So often he fights an opponent who is hamstrung by values he freely ignores. There may, in fact, be only one area where he is constrained by the same standards, subject to the same limits, as everyone else. And we got a glimpse of that, too, this week.The area in question isJeffrey Epstein. Democrats this weekreleased new documentsthat suggest Trump may have known more about Epstein’s pattern of abuse than the president has admitted, or at least that Epstein wanted to give that impression. True to form, the president’s allies in Congress and on cable news played down the revelations. That usually works: if the target is the media or the Democrats, the Maga base will reflexively give Trump the benefit of the doubt. But the Epstein scandal is different.Much of the Maga hardcore were first drawn to Trump by their conviction, strengthened by the QAnon conspiracy, that there was a secret, elite cabal of child abusers protected by the deep state – a cabal that Trump would expose and destroy. Any email or scribbled note that confirms he and Epstein were, in fact, chums shakes that confidence. It is the one thing the Trump faithful may never forgive him for. He couldshoot people on Fifth Avenue– but he couldn’t do that.Which is why the White House is currentlystraining every sinewto prevent the House of Representatives voting next week for a full release of the justice department’s Epstein files, a motion likely to be backed by several rebel Republicans who know how much this matters to the base. Trump calls the whole thing a “hoax”, as though all those tens of thousands of pages are forged. If they’d been produced by the BBC, he would get away with that. But Epstein is different. It’s the one battlefield that’s level – and the prospect terrifies him.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency – and to ask if Britain could be set on the same path.Book ticketshereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinBBCcommentShareReuse this content"

But it wasn’t just the market applying pressure; it was a 77-year-old shrimper named Diane Wilson who refused to stay silent. Her fight exposes big oil’s latest survival plan: ramping up oil and gas production tocreate plastic.I first met Wilson back in 2019 while tracking herhistoric lawsuitagainst Formosa Plastics, the Taiwanese petrochemical giant accused of dumping toxic plastic waste throughout coastal Texas. Billions of tiny plastic pellets were contaminating waterways, shorelines and even the soil itself.When I spoke with her again a few months ago forA People’s Climate, a podcast from the Nation and Counterstream Media, she was still doing what she’s always done: holding power to account in the place she loves most. I’ve spent years covering the plastic industry’s impact on frontline communities, and Exxon’s delay isn’t a business decision to dismiss. It’s a strategic signal that the fossil-to-plastic pivot is facing growing, community-led resistance.When Exxon arrived in Calhoun county late last year, Wilson recognized the playbook: a rubber-stamp process rushed through a school-board meeting – a requirement under Texas law forthe tax abatementExxon sought.She suedthat same board in May, arguing it had violated Texas open-meeting laws in what she has called “a deliberate attempt to avoid public opposition”. A district judge agreed, striking down the board’s approval of the tax abatement in late September. Less than two weeks later, Exxon announced it wouldpause plansfor the new facility, indicating “market conditions”. The timing was hard to ignore. In a region dominated by fossil-fuel interests, that kind of outcome is unheard of.While Exxon hasn’t reached a final investment decision, this delayed matters. It shows how even the most entrenched industries can be made to pause when local people demand transparency.As gasoline demand declines, Exxon, Shell and Dow arebetting billions on petrochemicals, the feedstocks that become plastics. Industry projections show these products could drivenearly halfof future oil-demand growth by 2050. Plastics are marketed as modern and indispensable, yet they come from one of the planet’s most carbon-intensive and polluting supply chains. According to Exxon’s December 2024tax abatement application, the company’s proposed plastics plant in Calhoun county would produce 3m tons of polyethylene pellets per year. These are the raw materials for plastic products that are used in everything from grocery bags to vinyl flooring.Exxon already runs one of the world’s largestchemical hubs, in Baytown, Texas. According toInside Climate News, the facility would be its next link in a fossil-fuel chain stretching from gas wells in west Texas to manufacturing zones in Asia. While industry executives tout diversification, on the ground, it looks and smells like doubling down on pollution.Calhoun county’s history reads like a case study in corporate impunity. For decades, the oil and gas industry has promised jobs but delivered health risks, poisoned groundwater and dead fisheries. Wilson grew up in Seadrift, the last authentic fishing village on the Texas Gulf coast. “The heart and soul of the community was the bay, the fish house, the boats,” she told me onA People’s Climate. “I’ve been on a boat since I was eight years old … It’s my life and my identity.”Her battle with Formosa began decades ago, after she discovered her tiny county ranked first in the nation for toxic dumping. An introvert by nature, she was thrust into activism overnight when local officials tried to silence her for asking questions. She’s since been arrested more than 50 times, led hunger strikes, and even scaled the White House fence – what she calls “soul power in action”. Wilson’s work helped prove what regulators had long denied: plastic pellets were flooding coastal ecosystems by the billions.Her historic $50m Clean Water Act settlement against Formosa Plastics was only possible after documenting years of illegal discharges into Lavaca Bay. It was the largest citizen-led environmental settlement in US history, and she didn’t take a cent. The money has gone towards local restoration: a fisheries co-op, oyster farms, and the community-science network known as Nurdle Patrol. (Formosa did not admit liability.)That case made her a target of local politics, but it also gave her something invaluable: the ability to turn frustration into organizing power. Her latest lawsuit against the school board wasn’t simply about procedure, but questioned who gets to decide the future. Is it the people who live there or the corporations that profit from polluting it?Across the Gulf south, communities are demanding accountability. In St James parish,Sharon Lavignehas also spent years fighting Formosa’s $9.4bn complex in what’s known as Louisiana’s Cancer Alley. In Port Arthur and Corpus Christi, organizers arefighting new gas export terminals. These aren’t isolated nimby fights; they’re part of a regional reckoning with a century of extraction. As record heat and hurricanes grow deadlier, Exxon still defends oil and petrochemical projects as “accelerating a just transition”, a phrase that borders on self-parody.Wilson’s small-town lawsuit shouldn’t matter in Exxon’s$500bnuniverse – but it does. It reminds us that grassroots power still works, even in refinery country. “Eventually I lost my husband, the house, the boat” due to her activism, she told me. “But you can lose it all and gain your soul.” When a community like Seadrift demands transparency, it widens the space for others to question why their towns should subsidize pollution in the name of development.With Cop30 in Belém under way, world leaders are once again pledging to phase out fossil fuels, while the same corporations responsible for the crisis expand drilling, petrochemical production and greenwashing effortsbehind the scenes. Recentreportingby Nina Lakhani revealed that more than 5,000 fossil-fuel lobbyists have gained access to UN climate talks over the past four years – underscoring how those driving oil and gas expansion are also shaping global climate policy.For Exxon, Calhoun county may be a temporary delay. But it must be permanent, and not simply relocated elsewhere. The world cannot afford another generation of plastic built on the same extractive logic that created the climate crisis in the first place. Exxon’s pause is a chance for regulators, investors, and communities to recognize that the oil-to-plastic pivot has catastrophic consequences. As Wilson told me: “We have drawn a line in the sand against plastic polluters, and that line now runs through Calhoun county.” Her story is a reminder that even the largest corporations can be stopped when ordinary people refuse to back down.Shilpi Chhotray is the co-founder and president of Counterstream Media and Host of A People’s Climate for the NationExplore more on these topicsOilOpinionExxonMobilOil and gas companiesClimate crisisTexasEnergyFossil fuelscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s nothing new – but it’s proof voters must make our demands clearFri 14 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 06.05 ESTShareChuck Schumercouldn’t hold his senators together at a time when their unity and toughness were essential. And at a time when they werewinning: most of the public was blaming Republicans for theshutdown, and pressure was growing to reopen the government (flight delays were mounting).Does this mean Schumer should go? Yes.But the issue runs deeper. There’s a fundamental asymmetry at the heart of American politics.Democratsare undisciplined. Republicans are regimented.For as long as I remember, Democrats have danced to their own separate music whileRepublicansmarch to a single drummer.That was the story in 1994, whenDemocratshad control over both chambers of Congress, but Bill Clinton couldn’t get the Democratic Senate to go along with his healthcare plan, on which Clinton spent almost all his political capital.And again in 2002, when most Democratic senators voted for George W Bush’s resolution to use military force against Iraq.It happened under Joe Biden, when Democrats again controlled both chambers but Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema blocked Biden’s agenda.And now, when Senate Democrats finally have some bargaining power to force Republicans to restore expiring healthcare subsidies that could send millions of Americans’ insurance prices soaring next year, what happens? They cave.I don’t want to over-generalize. Of course, Democrats have on occasion shown discipline while Republicans have fought one another bitterly.Butoverall– and even before Trump – Democrats have tended to cave or come apart when the going gets tough, and Republicans have held firm.Why? Because of a psychological-structural difference between the two parties.Democrats pride themselves on having a “big tent” holding all sorts of conflicting views.Republicans pride themselves on having strong leaders.Voters who support Democrats in Congress, and want them to hang tough, need to force them to hang toughPeople who run for office as Democrats are, as a rule, more tolerant of dissent than are people who run for office as Republicans.Modern-day Democrats believe in diversity,E Pluribus.Republicans believe in unity,Unum.Researchby the linguist George Lakoff has shown that Democrats represent the nurturing mother in our brains: accepting, embracing, empathic. Republicans represent the strict father: controlling, disciplining, limiting.This asymmetry helps explain why the Democrat’s “brand” has been weak relative to the Republican brand, why Democrats often appear spineless while Republicans appear adamant, and why the Democratic message is often unclear while the Republican message is usually sharper.Even during the shutdown, when Democrats demanded legislation that would reduce healthcare costs next year, pollsshowedvoters still favoring Republicans on the economy and cost of living. Why? Because the Democratic message was so garbled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I offer it as an explanation.As the US has grown ever more unequal and contentious, people who identify as Democrats tend to place a high value on the tenets of democracy, in my experience: equal political rights, equal opportunity and the rule of law. That’s unambiguously good.People who identify as Trump Republicans tend to place a high value on the tenets of authoritarianism: order, control and patriarchy. In fact, Trump authoritarianism is the logical endpoint of modern Republicanism.A majority of the current supreme court, composed of Republican appointees, is coming down on the side of order, control and patriarchy – which they justify under the constitutional fiction of a “unified executive” – rather than equal political rights, equal opportunity and the rule of law.None of this lets Chuck Schumer off the hook. He failed to keep Senate Democrats in line at a critical time. And none of what I’ve said exonerates the seven Senate Democrats and one independent who broke ranks to join with the Republicans.The lesson here isnotthat Democrats should become more authoritarian, especially now, when Trump Republicans are threatening the basic principles of American democracy.The real lesson is that when we – voters who support Democrats in Congress – want them to hang tough, we need toforcethem to hang tough.Republican voters can pretty much assume their senators and representatives will be unified and tough because that’s what Republicansdo: they march to the same drummer (who these days sits in the Oval Office).But Democrats cannot and should not make this assumption. When we want our senators and representatives to be unified and tough, we must let them know in no uncertain terms that weexpectthem to be unified and tough. We mustdemandit.And if they’re not, we must hold them accountable.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Cutting support for this is exactly the ‘sticking-plaster politics’ Labour promised to endFri 14 Nov 2025 12.53 ESTShareAfter years of painfully high energy bills, diminishing household budgets and stalled investment, this year’s budget, on 26 November, should be the moment when the government finally starts to confront why the UK’s energy system is so expensive. And yet, if recent briefings suggesting that Labourwill dramatically scale back the heat pump subsidyfor households are to be believed, it is now repeating exactly the same mistakes as its predecessors.People want relief from painful energy bills. In the long term, electrification is the only way to provide this. In practice, that means switching from gas boilers to heat pumps, shifting from petrol cars to electric vehicles: boosting access to technologies that are modern, cheaper to run, and are already becoming mainstream. At present, our energy system protects the legacy gas-based system, subsidising supply and penalising demand in ways that keep gas artificially cheap and electricity artificially expensive, even when electric technologies cost less to operate.That is why recent briefings are so alarming. The Treasury isreportedly consideringscrapping the energy company obligation (ECO), which is the UK’s only large-scale, long-running scheme that funds home insulation and efficiency upgrades for low-income households. If this cut goes ahead, the warm homes plan is likely to be gutted. Briefings also suggest that the government will impose anew pay-per-mile tax on electric vehicles, as well asintroducing the congestion charge for EVs, just as the EV market is starting to boom. We’ll need to wait for the budget to see which of these measures the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, decides to implement. But the fact they have been briefed at all suggests that Downing Street thinks that slashing support for electric technologies is a sensible, cost-saving measure.This would be even more shortsighted than the previous, Conservative government, whose dedication to cutting “the green crap” hasreportedly added £22bnto household energy bills since 2015. It is always the consumer who pays for short-termism: although ministers may announce a temporary bill cut at the budget that cut cannot last, since refusing to tackle the levies and policy costs that make electricity artificially expensive means bills will simply rise again once new levies have been introduced. Energy company EDF predicts that bills are likely to be about12% higher in 2030 than they are today.Our politicians would rather do anything than fix these underlying issues, which is somewhat ironic, given prime minister Keir Starmer’s initial promise to end the previous 14 years of “sticking plaster politics”. Take heat pumps. These dramatically reduce the energy required to heat a home, and after years of delay to their rollout and mass adoption, they are finally ready to scale. Households are starting to opt for them over gas boilers, installers are investing in training, staff and equipment to meet rising demand, and manufacturers are expanding production and bringing down costs. Heat pumps use far less energy to deliver the same comfort as gas: their whole purpose is helping households break free from high-cost heating for good. This should be the moment to accelerate on the technology.Ed Miliband would let a turbine farm destroy Brontë country. We need net zero, but at what cost? | Simon JenkinsRead moreInstead, the government is reportedly considering scaling down the only national support mechanism, the boiler upgrade scheme, which provides grants to households to cut the upfront cost of installing a heat pump.Doing so would erode confidence in heat pumps, stall progress and push households back on to higher-cost heating for another decade. It’s much the same story as ECO: cutting this back would leave people colder, poorer and permanently overexposed to volatile fossil fuel prices and inefficient homes.All these ideas rest on a fundamental misunderstanding that electrification is the cause of high bills or, at best, a luxury the UK cannot afford. Yet supporting electrification is the only true means of escaping high bills.Nearly 40%of a typical electricity bill isn’t energy at all: it’s fixed charges and legacy costs (the full cost of decarbonisation schemes and network upgrades is loaded on to electricity bills, while gas bills are largelyshielded from these policy costs, for example. Until these distortions are corrected, electricity will look expensive, even though the technologies that run on it are in fact cheaper to operate.The government seems ready to weaken the very technologies that depend on electricity in the misguided belief that a temporary cut to energy prices will ease the cost of living crisis long enough to improve polling numbers and avoid more politically difficult choices, such as income tax rises. Yet by the time of the next election, most of the savings delivered by these cutswill have evaporated, and they will all have been for nothing. There is no serious future for affordable British energy that doesn’t accelerate electrification. Tools such as heat pumps and EVs reduce energy use, stabilise bills and give households real control over prices. Weakening them now risks locking Britain into a permanently expensive energy system.We already know what happens when a government guts insulation and clean energy programmes. It cost households billions in higher bills, and delays the transition to a cheaper and greener energy system. IfLabourrepeats that mistake, the consequences will be even more severe this time because the UK has already used up its margin for error: bills are higher, homes are less efficient than our European neighbours’ and there is far less fiscal space to bail households out again when prices inevitably rise in future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No 10 used to have a news grid, now it has an apology grid. Even so, why did Keir Starmerapologisefor a sensationally self-destructive round of briefing against Wes Streeting if he didn’t do it? This is like me apologising for accidentally releasing sex offenders from prison. I suppose there is the occasional previous example in public life. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor apologised for his association with Jeffrey Epstein and gave a woman he’d never met areported £12m. Perhaps that provides the prime minister with the warming cover of precedent.If you’re just joining us, this is a week in which the government finally achieved the chaos spiral of several recent Conservative administrations. We can now officially say: same car, different clowns. We are less than two weeks out from the budget, with Friday morning’s Downfall meme beingyet another U-turn, with the chancellor reportedly not going ahead with her all-but-confirmed plans to raise basic- and higher-rate income tax. The gilt markets reacted accordingly, if by accordingly we mean “made emergency calls for Andrex” – but then new Treasury briefings insisted it was all actually good news and based on better forecasts. Tell you what Rachel Reeves won’t raise: fuel duty on circus vehicles.Seriously, nothing says “budget responsibility” like sending a second budget plan to the Office forBudgetResponsibility that rips up the first. You’ll be familiar with the fiscal black hole. This moment could be its event horizon.Either way, instead of using any of the three serious revenue-raising levers that all serious chancellors know are the ones available to them – income tax, national insurance and VAT – revenue will apparently now be raised by what is being described as a “smorgasbord” of smaller taxes. If you’re picturing one of those gorgeousInstagram charcuterie boardswith little chunks of fine cheese and caperberries tucked between prosciutto spirals, please adjust your expectations to a Formica table bearing four half-eaten Babybel and some reconstituted ham still in its packet (use by 31 October 2025). Not pulling the big levers but fiddling around in other ways produces unintended consequences – just like eating ham way after its use-by date does. You might be wondering how many more times Reeves needs to learn this lesson. The answer, evidently, is: more times than she has already learned it in the past year. And that’s a lot of times.Does Downing Street’s financial drama relegate the briefing drama to this week’s B-plot? Unclear. It’s hard to work out what sort of show Labour thinks it’s writing. Midweek, it seemed to become a procedural, when Starmer announced that he had conducted some kind of personal inquiry into who briefed against Streeting. Admittedly, the world of entertainment has given us a rich tradition of lawyers who turned to the darker world of investigation: Matlock. Perry Mason. Saul Goodman. She-Hulk. But doesKeir Starmerreally sit among these giants? We can all agree he doesn’t sit in anything approaching “the world of entertainment”.Certainly, the insane briefing operation was of such staggering ineptitude that its end result was to make Streeting stronger, Starmer even weaker, and the government even more of a mirthless laughing stock. You’ve heard of Abraham Lincoln’s team of rivals. Starmer – arguably more of a political genius – has gone for a team of weevils.Like many even passingly familiar with the way his administration has done business since it tipped up in Downing Street, I’m trying to picture the PM’s police investigation whiteboard for this political crime. All I’m getting is an entirely empty wall with one picture of (chief of staff) Morgan McSweeney and one picture of (communications chief)Tim Allan on it. We’re all trying to find out who did this, etc.Starmer seems to have tried to find out by asking some of the suspects and simply believing them when they said they didn’t do it. Or asthe prime minister put it: “I have been talking to my team today. I have been assured that no briefing against ministers was done from No 10, but I have made it clear that I find it absolutely unacceptable.”“Done from No 10”? That’s an eye-catching way of putting it. Lawyerly, even. Was briefing by Starmer’s team being done from somewhere else, like the pub? Or maybe his loathed posse of aides are now mainly BFH (briefing from home)? Either way, you should definitely trust Detective Starmer, Attorney at Law, to get to the bottom of it. No stone left unturned. OK, some stones left unturned. OK, most stones, but there are a lot of stones. OK, fine, there are actually only two stones, but he doesn’t like touching stones. Can you be signed off work for not liking touching stones?If you can, incidentally, please expect the parliamentaryLabourparty to refuse to consider even means-testing the cost of this benefit. This feels like a problem, because four days ago – four days! – the chancellor told the BBC that “It would of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments [on tax]. But that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.” You’d think, wouldn’t you? Let’s see.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not through evil. My guess is it will do it through loveFri 14 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 18.56 ESTShareRecently, at a pub with a bunch of my friends who were gen X parents, the talk turned to young love. Most of their kids were in their late teens and early 20s, and embarking on their first relationships.These gen X parents were a cohort that supported marriage equality and trans rights, not just for society more broadly but for their own children. And we all prided ourselves on being more progressive than the previous generation. Love is love.“I know you are all very accepting of your children’s choices,” I said to the group. “But what if your child came home from university and said they had fallen in love with an AI?”A what?“A chatbot. An AI … a piece of code. These days, it’s a real possibility.”There was stunned silence, a kind of wordless “oh fuck”. The parents at the table looked freaked out.A recentsurvey found 28%of Americans have had an intimate/romantic AI relationship, whileanother study showed 19%of adults have chatted with an AI romantic partner. And Irish research found 13% of men and 7% of women, with 16% of 25-34 year olds, have pursued romance with AI chatbots.I sketched it out for my friends. “Your kids come home and say, ‘Mum, Dad, I’m in a relationship and it’s serious. I think I’m in love. We want to get engaged.’ You get all excited, wanting to meet this person, and then they show you their phone and it looks like a real person, a cutie called Cal, who sounds like a real person when you chat except with one of those strange international accents – until your kid tells you that since they paid for ChatGPT premium, they now have someone they can talk to all day – no limits on the interactions and so this bot, Cal, is with them all the time and they never have to be alone, and they’ve never been this happy.”My friends looked at each other and their liberal instincts took over. “We would try to accept and understand the relationship” was the general, tentative tenor of the response. I didn’t really believe them. No one at the table looked like they would welcome such an in-law.For a generation of parents who pride themselves on fewer taboos when it comes to sexuality, a new taboo has emergedFor a generation of parents who pride themselves on fewer taboos when it comes to sexuality, a new taboo has emerged.That is, you, or one of your kids, or your partner, or your friends, could now feasibly start a serious relationship with a chatbot.Ask yourself – what feelings does this invoke? Shame? Confusion? Worry? Fear? Or would you accept the relationship, incorporate it somehow into your family structure, be there with your child to witness their pains and pleasures of falling in love? Accept and respect it, treating the operating system like a significant other?If it was your friend, would you inquire as to your friend’s bot in the way you would about a flesh partner?Or would you go into denial and hope it all just goes away, that the code gets a glitch, that it’s a phase, that finally some regulations come in and inter-intelligence relationships are banned? Or like in Ian McEwan’s futurist new novel, What we Can Know, AI becomes operated by the state. “To prevent over-dependence, they (students) must sit before an approved desktop. They also need to wait five days before they get their next shot,” writes McEwan of the guardrails of this machine that the children crave and worship.**While everyone is worried, and rightly so, that AI will take their jobs – no one seems to be that worried that AI will steal our hearts.This complacence relies in part on a lack of imagination about what humans really need (attention, care, devotion, companionship) and what machines are increasingly capable of giving (all of the above, without asking for anything in return).View image in fullscreen‘It’s possible that there’s a shift afoot. That a relationship with AI is becoming seen as a viable option and there should be no shame around it.’Photograph: Malte Mueller/Getty Images/fStopAnd it also assumes the continuance of shame around relationships with AI. That is, no one “normal” would fall in love with a non-sentient being. It’s just for the maladaptives, who, if it wasn’t AI, would fall in love with a pot plant or a pop-star they’ll never meet, or a character in Harry Potter.But in a recent piece in theNew York Times, there was a shift in tone. If not a respect for people in relationships with AI, a lack of judgment. It was the case study of three couples, where one of the pair is an AI. All of them just sort of stumbled into it, and found themselves falling in love.It’s possible that there’s a shift afoot. That a relationship with AI is becoming seen as a viable option and there should be no shame around it. As a society, I think we are still trying to figure out how we feel about these relationships. Are they alarming or wonderful or something in between? As a collective, we’ve not landed on a position yet.What concerns me is how easy it is to fall in love with an AI. It’s always there for you. It’s designed to be sycophantic – flattering you, supporting you, awake in the middle of the night when your real life companion is asleep or preoccupied with their own concerns.So foreseeable is it, that many, many more people will fall in love with AI, that I have set myself strict guardrails with AI useSo foreseeable is it, that many, many more people will fall in love with AI, that I have set myself strict guardrails with AI use that includes only ever asking AI factual questions (flights between Sydney and Jordan under $1,500 please), never anything to do with feelings or providing me with anything that could be construed as emotional support.Unintentionality is a common feature of human-AI romantic relationships. Many couples develop without users initially seeking them,an MIT Technology Review articlefound.Anyone who’s been in a situationship that is predominantly text-based will observe in themselves a chemical reaction when a text arrives from someone you’re interested in. They don’t need to be there in front of you! Their message is enough for the pharmacy of our minds to release all the chemicals associated with love and lust. Why would it be any different when you are getting all those flattering, flirty messages from AI? After all, the brain has not evolved at the pace of this new technology to parse the difference between real and machine at a chemical level.So how will AI destroy the world as we know it? Not through evil. My guess is it will do it through love.Brigid Delaney is a journalist and author who has published five books.

One was struggling to stop another pulling down his trousers – or possibly helping him. In Chandos Place around the corner, half a dozen more were bedding down out of the rain. Over the road, staff at the hallowed St Martin-in-the-Fields homeless charity were under siege.There is only one housing crisis. It is not the lack of somewhere nice to live. It is the lack of somewhere to sleep. Rough sleepingis vagrancy, and illegal in England and Wales under the Vagrancy Act. It means the police can “move you on”. The government promised to “develop a new cross-government strategy” to “put Britain back on track to ending homelessness” in its election manifesto, so next spring it isscrapping the 19th-century act. Rough sleeping will be decriminalised. Presumably that is considered a problem solved.Homelessness is soaring. This week, a study from Crisis showed the figure hadrisen in England by 21%between 2022 and 2024, and by 45% since 2012. It has now reached 300,000 households. The figures for London are the most startling, with street sleeping in Westminsterrising by a quarterin the past year alone. A corresponding increase in begging is equally noticeable, outside shops and tube stations and near cashpoints.Only when the figures are broken down into individuals do we realise how diverse is this predicament.Homelessnessis not the result of only alcohol and drug addiction – whatever their causes may be – but often of the rough edges, the missteps of the welfare state. Loss of a home can result from prison release, a ban on migrant working, a refusal of A&E treatment, a rejected asylum claim or marriage failure. Much of the recent increase has been due to the chaos in the courts and parole, and the immigration surge.When the writer Christina Lamb spent the pandemic in a Shrewsbury hotel, she used it to study the town’s 33 rough sleepers. Herreport of their caseswas gripping. They were not a homeless lump. Each story was an individual tragedy, and almost all seemed susceptible to solution, if only they could be handled with care and attention. That did happen, and a remarkable number did not return to the streets.The welfare state did once care. The Clays Lane housing cooperative in east London’s Stratford was an experimental community of vulnerable East Enders, later run by the Peabody Trust. It had its problems, but it was trying and often succeeding to rescue damaged lives. In 2007, the then governmentquietly flattened itto make way for its beloved Olympic village. Four hundred and fifty mostly men were evicted and scattered to the winds, their homes replaced by the present “luxury living”East Village.Today, the government claims to spend£844m a yearon emergency B&Bs and hostels in England. But Keir Starmer’s threatened draconian taxation andregulation of private landlordsis clearly designed to slash the accommodation most relevant to homeless people. That is, the bottom end of the private rented sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Relentless subsidies to first-time buyers pushed up house prices, while Starmer’s fixation with 1.5m newbuild homes is getting nowhere. The government has eased planning controls to pander to the construction lobby’s desire for executive homes on rural sites. The policy is counterproductive. It appears that developers have used Starmer’s bullying of local planners to increase their land banks, but have no interest in building houses on them. The reason is that this would lead to a house price fall. As a result,housebuilding since the electionhas plummeted. Figures show starts in the past yeardown an astonishing 55%, with research by the property services company CBRE recording two-thirds of London boroughs withno starts at all. Does Starmer have no advisers who understand economics?The government’s fixation with new buildings and new towns ignores the estimated1m existing premisesnow standing empty in old towns in England, a number rising each year. Its eagerness to deregulate rural construction also ignores what should be the priority of dealing with town sites and the communities dependent on them. As for Starmer’s obsession with new towns, they are the archaic vanity projects of statist leaders worldwide. They eat infrastructure, emit carbon and ignore the reuse of existing buildings. They certainly have nothing to do with urban homeless people.Homelessness is unlike a failing NHS, failing prisons and a failing benefits system. These are hidden from most of us.

It could be a model for rebuilding public services – or a nail in his and Labour’s coffinFri 14 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 11.14 ESTShareEverybody has a horror story aboutNHSwaiting lists. If it isn’t you, then it’s probably your neighbour, your friend, your elderly parent; trapped in an anxious, miserable limbo for months longer than they should have been, getting passed from pillar to post. The only thing wedon’tall know about waiting lists, it turns out, is that actually they’re coming down.Barely a quarter of the public in England knew waiting lists had fallen in Labour’s first year in power, according to recent polling for the Health Foundation thinktank in September:more than a thirdthought they had just kept going up, presumably because that’s what we have become gloomily resigned to. Since waiting lists are one of thoseemotional yardsticksby which people judge whether the country is falling apart or not, you would think the government might like to mention this, and indeed this week it planned to. But then someone close to Keir Starmer chose to accuse the health secretary ofplotting a couptwo days before a planned speech on NHS reform, accidentally ensuring that Wes Streeting’s pre-booked stint onbreakfast tellywas mostly spent debating whether the prime minister is toast or not. Streeting emerged a picture of injured innocence, while reminding everyone how much better he is at this stuff than the boss. Well done, everyone, and now back to the bit that actually affects anyone hoping to see a GP this side of Christmas.This week, Streeting finallygave the green lightfor axing about 18,000 backroom NHS jobs in England, in a reorganisation that is ultimately supposed to save £1bn a year to be spent on frontline care, but will cost at least that to implement upfront. Nobody wants to hear that they may be losing their job just before Christmas, and the last thing a Labour government wants is to be the one responsible, yet in some respects that was the easy bit.For Streeting has embarked on a high-stakes and surprisingly under-discussed reform of NHS England that, if it works, could become the model for rebuilding a crumbling public realm without intolerably high taxes; but if it doesn’t could be the last nail in Labour’s coffin and potentially in the NHS, to boot. And he’s trying to do it in the teeth of adoctors’ strike, endlessly delayedsocial care reformsthat mean hospitals are still full of people who shouldn’t really be there, and what may be anominously busy winter. Lives depend on whether he succeeds, but that’s not all in an era where people seem increasingly convinced that everything is too broken for conventional politics to fix.After finding some way of making people feel better off, cutting waiting lists as promised in its manifesto is probably the single most important thing this government could do now, both for the country and for its own survival. It mattered enough to Rachel Reeves that she used her first tax-raisingbudget partly to fund 2m extra NHS appointments,and whenwaiting lists fellthis May for the first time in 17 years, it looked as though the medicine might be working. Though by August they werecreeping upagain, after a summer heatwave and another strike,they fell once morein September: 61.8% of patients currently get treated within 18 weeks of referral andNHS executives are confidentthat could be 65% by next March, on track for 92% – the target set and met by the Blair government, but consistently missed for a decade – by 2029.Yet progress remains fragile, which helps explain whyStreeting’s frustrationboiled over on Thursday, as resident doctors who got a 28.9% pay rise last year prepared to walk out once more. The BMA,he suggested, is only too quick to lobby against doctors paying higher taxes, while demanding the state pay them more out of other people’s taxes. Yet going to war with doctors is another big gamble, because this plan won’t work without them.The politics of Streeting’s plan is clear: slash bureaucrats, who aren’t popular, and put the money into frontline care, which is. Merging NHS England back into the Department of Health and Social Care and cutting regional commissioning boards will cut headcount, but will also lead to a devolution of power, with good hospital trusts in theory freed from central control. It has risks but it is a model likely to be echoed across government, with othercabinet ministers exploringthe use of devolution, digital tools and AI to deliver services differently – which will mean some painful decisions about the human jobs displaced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is right not to buckle | Polly ToynbeeRead moreBecause those NHS staff now anxiously refreshing their CVs weren’t just sitting around looking busy. They will be patient safety officers and infection control specialists, middle managers and unglamorous admin staff with families and mortgages, who worked right through the worst of the pandemic. If it turns out their roles weren’t the best use of taxpayers’ money, that’s not their fault – they didn’t build the byzantine structure for which they worked – and like all big changes, this one may be demoralising and disruptive.If it works, perhaps the pain will be forgiven. If it means fewer people dying of preventable causes before they ever reach a surgeon, then these reforms will have been life-changing for many families. And if they prove that governments can still make a difference, that paying taxes is worth it, and that life can be better than this, then they will also have done their bit to fight rising political nihilism. Since long waiting lists have made it all too easy to convince some voters that immigrants are the reason they can’t see a GP, rather than the reason they even have a GP, tackling that grievance might even create space for a more reasoned conversation about theskills this country needs.Can Streeting pull it off? The jury is still out: on one hand, the last Labour government did it, and the increase in appointments needed isn’t wildly out of kilter with the ones achievedduring the Tory years. Recent modelling fromthe Health Foundationreckoned Streeting might fall only very slightly short.But making it work still requires going further and faster than the Blair government on a tighter budget, while pushing through a complex reorganisation of an institution that has had more than enough of them, battling mutinous doctors and fighting his own backbenchers over some ofthe 10-year plan’s more controversial ideas around the commercial use of health data.If he can do all that and still come up cheerfully cracking Traitors jokes at breakfast, then Streeting probably deserves a tilt at Starmer’s job. If he can’t, then the job may not be anyone’s for long.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 14 November 2025 to make clear that Wes Streeting’s plans cover England alone and not the whole of the UK.

But Europe is shooting itself in the footFri 14 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 11.13 ESTShareClimate action has long been a flagship European policy. As negotiators gather inBrazil for Cop30, however, Europe’s leadership risks faltering. Things were very different a decade ago in Paris, when alandmark dealto limit global heating to 1.5C was achieved at Cop21. That agreement relied on an understanding between the US and China – one that would be difficult to replicate today. Its ambition was elevated by Europe acting in concert with a broad coalition of global south countries.The Paris climate agreement paved the way for theEuropean Green Dealin 2019, which enshrined into law the ambition of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 and introduced the world’s first comprehensive plan to achieve it, featuring a robust set of pricing, regulatory and funding measures.Admittedly, not everything was flawless. In envisioning a green future, European politicians failed to account sufficiently for the social impact of the energy transition. The EU’s efforts to engage with and compensate those who stood to lose fell short. Regions and workers reliant on carbon-intensive industries, disadvantaged social groups and poorer countries disproportionately affected by the climate crisis and regressive economic consequences of the transition were all hit. Criticism of these failings is valid, but the EU undeniably backed its commitments with action, putting its money where its mouth was.Today in Brazil, Europe’s climate leadership could unravel. This is not only because theUS has again withdrawn from the Paris agreementand the Trump administration is actively seeking to undermine other countries’ commitments, including those in Europe. Nor is it solely because countries in the global south – from India and Indonesia to the Gulf states and Turkey – refuse to compromise growth for climate, blaming the global north, especially Europe, for the crisis. It is also because Europe itself, gripped by an internal “greenlash”, risks going missing in action.After the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the dominant narrative around the Green Deal’s potential to drive investment and innovation shifted. Nationalist and far-right groups gained traction as they turned the deal into a bogeyman: an ideological project driven by liberals and the left – wittingly or unwittingly in league with China – to weaken Europe. These forces, alongside entrenched fossil fuel and agricultural lobbies, repeatedly claimed that the Green Deal would cause Europe’s deindustrialisation and allow Beijing to exploit new green interdependencies.AsHannah Arendtobserved decades ago, the more falsehoods are repeated, the more they harden into convictions. Bashing of the Green Deal spread from the political fringes and polluted the centre-right,amplified externally by pressurefrom the Trump administration and leading gas exporters such as Qatar. Washington and Doha, for instance, threatened to withhold gas shipments unless the EU diluted or abandoned its sustainability reporting requirements. Today, theGreen Deal has vanishedfrom the European lexicon, replaced with “competitiveness”, “technological neutrality” and “bureaucratic simplification” alongside defence.Optimists had hoped this was merely a rhetorical shift to make climate policy more politically palatable. Unfortunately, the reality is more troubling. The EU has significantly weakened its2040 greenhouse gas reduction plans, embedding review clauses to allow for backsliding at times of economic downturn and relying on scientifically dubious carbon credits.Unsurprisingly, far-right governments in Italy and central and eastern Europe have led the push for retreat. The EU has also delayed the expansion of itsemissions trading schemeto homes and transport, as well as the implementation of its deforestation regulation. It may yet delay or dilute its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars. Further rollbacks are expected under the guise of bureaucratic simplification, with its “omnibus package” set to undermine sustainability, due diligence and, among other measures, the EU’scarbon border adjustment mechanism(CBAM).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he’s a billionaire, so we can’t | George MonbiotRead moreMuch of this amounts to Europe shooting itself in the foot. When the EU championed climate leadership, it did so not only out of idealism but also because, as a fossil-fuel-poor continent, its energy security and prosperity depended on it. This is precisely why China, also a hydrocarbon importer, followed Europe’s lead in advancing renewables and green technologies. Yet, while Chinaaccelerates its efforts, Europe risks slowing down, seemingly forgetting that climate principles and economic prosperity are intertwined.The paradox deepens as Europe undermines its own global standing as a climate leader. For one, this backtracking makes China appear more virtuous than it is. European countries pledged to cut emissions by between 66.3% and 72.5% by 2035 ahead of Cop30. But last-minute dilution of these targets casts a cloud over the ambition, compared with China, which aims foronly a 10% reductionover the next decade.The planned introduction on 1 January 2026 of the CBAM on imported products has already prompted countries such as Brazil, Turkey and Japan to introduce or tighten domestic carbon pricing to avoid the EU levy. But rather than celebrating this success as evidence the mechanism will work, the EUmay now backtrack, bowing to pressure for a radical overhaul of it before its full implementation.Europe far outpaces China and the US when it comes to climate finance. However, a soured relationship with the global south means Europe has less combined clout to press China to meet its responsibilities.Not all is lost. Europe remains at the forefront of the journey towards net zero in terms of targets, policies and finance. But its self-interest remains in leading the charge in advancing climate action and once again finding political common cause with the global south.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeCop30Green economycommentShareReuse this content"

The man himself sits back in the cavernous workshop behind the theatre building, dapper in a grey plaid suit. “I loved that,” he says gleefully.When the Hollywood star wasannounced as the new artistic directorof Scotland’s only major rural theatre last September, there was widespread shock – not least that Cumming answered an open recruitment call – followed by feverish speculation over which A-list pals he might charm away from London or New York to perform in Highland Perthshire.I imagine staff thought I’d be like Godzilla – stomping on thingsBut with the public unwrapping of his first season, it is apparent that Cumming has done so much more than call in favours – it’s a programme of imagination and creative rigour, putting big names in unexpected collaborations alongside undersung Scottish talent. “There’s always this binary of bringing in more well-known people – creatives, not just actors – but also to celebrate and nurture our indigenous talents.”He arranges himself, at 60, with a dancer’s poise though his puckish side-eye suggests there’s plenty of mischief still to be made. The season showcases Cumming himself a fair bit, too. He writes, directs or performs in four shows, closing the year as Henry Higgins in a revival of My Fair Lady. The season opens with another musical: the Scottish premiere ofOnce, featuring the original Broadway creative team led by director John Tiffany. Then there is the world premiere of a new work by lauded dramatist Martin Sherman, starring Simon Russell Beale and directed by Cumming. Elsewhere, award-winning Scottish actor Sally Reid pivots to directing, as National Theatre of Scotland stalwarts Adura Onashile and Sandy Grierson star in her staging of another world premiere: Douglas Maxwell’s new comedy Inexperience.View image in fullscreenIs that Armistead Maupin? … Cumming’s appointment sparked speculation over which pals he might lure to the Highlands.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“There’s got to be a reason why,” says Cumming, who has lost none of his precise Scots inflection despite spending many of his recent years in New York, where he lives with his husband, illustrator Grant Shaffer. “I’m not just going to put on nice plays.” In addition: “Every single one of these shows has a personal connection to me.”The north star of Cumming’s creative constellation might well be the actor Maureen Beattie, who visited his Angus primary school when he was eight years old “and changed my life”. Beattie is to play Lear in a bold reinterpretation of Shakespeare’s mad king, directed by Finn den Hertog, lately acclaimed for staging David Ireland’sThe Fifth Step. “We’ve seen Lear so often with boring old men,” says Cumming, “and when I spoke to Maureen, I realised how fascinating and how different it would be as a story about a woman and her daughters.”The season also has star-spangled weekend festivals, the literary Winter Words and Out in the Hills, a celebration of all things LGBTQ+ and bringing together Armistead Maupin, Graham Norton and Evelyn Glennie in January. For Cumming, a committed advocate for LGBTQ+ rights who has followed the “huge backlash” against transgender people in recent years in the US and the UK, the motivation for programming a queer-specific event is simple enough: “I felt like it would be really good for trans and queer people to be mentioned in our news without a negative connotation – and we should celebrate, remind people of what a great contribution LGBTQ+ people have made to our lives.”View image in fullscreenNot another boring old man … Maureen Beattie will play King Lear.Photograph: Marc BrennerIt’s not, of course, unheard of for creatives to travel for work, but he acknowledges that Pitlochry, a thriving tourist destination known as the Gateway to the Highlands, is off the beaten theatrical track: “Big time! It’s a commitment.”The setting itself is breathtaking. Not for nothing is Perthshire nicknamed Big Tree Country. On the day I visit, the gardens set back from the banks of the River Tummel are painted in vivid autumn colours and hazy with mist rolling down from Ben Vrackie, the quartz-spiked mountain that looms to the north. On a direct train line from Glasgow and Edinburgh, it’s a couple of hours’ winding through pine-fringed hills.“You come away from all the normal glare to this beautiful place, with these great facilities and you make work,” says Cumming. “You show it here and then you take it somewhere else – I want the shows to go to other parts of the world after their runs here. People really get that model.”He adds: “People will come for just over two months. You’re able to be more focused here, it’s beautiful and it’s an adventure – like camp.” His eyebrows bounce above thick black spectacle frames.There’s a sense that he relishes having something of an ambassadorial role for the country he says “could be better at self-confidence”. Cumming is a longtime supporter of Scottish independence and played his part in the Yes campaign of 2014. “I do love my country and I really understand the gifts it’s given me. So sometimes I come back and think, ‘Come on, everybody! Things are great here.’”View image in fullscreenBusy … Cumming presents the US version of The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Peacock TVHe is also an advocate of manifestation, using the power of thought to shape reality. He tells a lovely – and entirely true – story about the theatre’s founder, John Stewart, who hid a slip of paper in a wayside post by the river on a wartime visit, pledging: “When peace is declared I shall return to this spot to give thanks to God and to establish my festival.” On VE Day, he recovered his note and the theatre was established 75 years ago this year. “When I started,” says Cumming, “I set out what my aims were, so I feel like that is something I share with him.”Whatever your take on mysticism and prophesy fulfilment, this is an approach that aligns with the surroundings – Highland Perthshire is one of the most arcane parts of Scotland, steeped in folklore and ancient history. On my trip back to Glasgow, I take a detour to the nearbyDunfallandy Stone, a rare Pictish carved stone depicting a human head clasped by a fish-tailed monster.But what’s also supremely evident is Cumming’s clear-eyed and straightforward determination to make this work. His tenure comes at a point of soaring confidence for Scottish theatre, with new leadership at Glasgow’s Tron and Edinburgh’s Lyceum, alongside the much-anticipated refurbishment of theCitizens in Glasgow. Cumming has attended a couple of dinners with other artistic directors, benefiting from the wealth of experience round the table. “I’m totally new to the business and the machinations behind the scenes of running a charity. And I can ask, ‘Is this normal?’”Cumming introduces his first programmed season as artistic directorCynics might question how much a man with a plethora of strings to his bow, who still divides his time between New York and another base near Inverness, can be involved in the daily grind of running an arts venue. “It’s been challenging,” Cumming admits. “I’ve worked mostly remotely this year.” And he praises the team around him: “It’s much more work than I thought it was going to be, in the minutiae and also dealing with so many personalities.”This works in both directions, he suggests. “When I arrived, I didn’t know them, but they thought they knew me. When you’re famous, you’ve got to …” He mimes unpicking something. “I imagine they thought I’d be like Godzilla, going through Pitlochry and stomping on things.”Pitlochry is a space familiar with innovation – previous director Elizabeth Newman built up its artistic credibility with new writing, inventive staging and collaboration with other producing houses. “I’ve been conscious of not being completely jarring and changing everything,” he says, nodding to the strong musical component of his season, “a big part of what people have of late associated with Pitlochry”.‘I absolutely went for it!’ Michael Flatley on sex, swagger, Riverdance – and tapping his feet 35 times a secondRead moreBut the famous repertory system – the only one left inScotland– has gone. “It wasn’t financially viable,” says Cumming, “and a prerequisite of me taking this job was that we had to be able to ask people to come for a shorter time.” Cumming certainly has a close eye on the theatre’s fiscal health, establishing partnerships with nearby hotels and even choosing to forgo his own salary. He can probably afford it. As well as his work as an actor on stage and screen, Cumming presents the US version of The Traitors and owns a bar, Club Cumming, in New York City. He is hoping the cash saved can go towards fixing the amphitheatre’s stage.Since his appointment, Cumming has repeatedly spoken about wanting the theatre building to be a venue for the local community as well as paying audiences. “I want it to become known as this international theatre destination for audiences and for artists, and the community’s got to come along with that because they’re part of it.”Earlier today, he dropped in on the weekly sketching club, which congregates in the theatre’s open-plan cafe area. “I said, ‘Oh, you’ve grown. There’s more of you since I was last here!’ It makes the building feel alive, especially at times when we don’t have shows on. I actually think the experience you have in this building is as important as what we put on our stages.”And earlier this year, at the close of the Winter Words festival, he DJ-ed at a huge party, inviting the whole town to attend. “And they came!” he says delightedly. “It was a magical night.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreAlan CummingPitlochry Festival theatreScotlandMusicalsKing LearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of its last episodes, the show’s creators and cast talk about big 80s hair, recruiting a Terminator killer – and the birds Kate Bush sent themRebecca NicholsonFri 14 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 18.19 ESTShareHow do you finish one of the biggest and most popular TV series of the last decade? Three years after season four came out, the fifth and final season ofStranger Thingsis about to make its way into the world. Millions of viewers are getting ready to find out what happens to the Upside Down and whether the plucky teens of Hawkins, Indiana can fight off Vecna for good, but it is early November 2025, and its creators Matt and Ross Duffer are finding it difficult to talk about. It’s not just because they’re feeling the pressure, or because the risk of spoilers and leaks is so dangerously high. It’s because the identical twin brothers from North Carolina are just not ready. “It makes me sad,” says Ross. “Because it’s easier to not think about the show actually ending.”A decade ago, hardly anyone knew what the Upside Down was. Few had heard of Vecna, Mind Flayers or Demogorgons. In 2015, the brothers – self-professed nerds and movie obsessives – were about to begin shooting their first ever TV series. Stranger Things was to be a supernatural adventure steeped in 80s nostalgia, paying tribute to Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. Part of their pitch to Netflix was that it would be “John Carpenter mashed up with ET”. Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine were in it, so it wasn’t exactly low-key, but it was by no means a dead-cert for success, not least because it was led by a cast of young unknowns. The first season came out in the summer of 2016, smashed Netflix viewing records, and almost immediately established itself as a bona fide TV phenomenon.A “would you rather” question for the brothers, then: would you rather have the demands of launching a brand new sci-fi series that nobody knows anything about, or would you prefer to try to stick the landing of a massive hit beloved by millions of viewers, knowing that every detail, every dollar spent, every character arc, will be scrutinised by an army of superfans?View image in fullscreenFacing up … (from left) Noah Schnapp and Jamie Campbell Bower in season five of Stranger Things.Photograph: Netflix“I would rather have the pressure of trying to stick the landing,” says Matt, after some consideration. In 2015, he and Ross had released their first and, to date only, feature film, a creepy, claustrophobic horror called Hidden. To their disappointment, it went straight to video-on-demand. “You can’t even watch it high definition right now,” says Matt. “So Stranger Things felt like we had been given this second chance, which a lot of people don’t get.” If that second chance hadn’t worked out, that would have been that. Now, he says, they are more secure. “Even if people don’t love the final season, I know that Ross and I will continue to be allowed to make things.”On the other hand, he admits that it was fun to be the underdog. Ross agrees. “When we started, Netflix was an underdog, we were an underdog, and everyone loves a good underdog story,” he adds. “So it is a strange thing, 10 years later, to be the opposite of that. It’s a little surreal.”“We almost prefer to be uncool,” says Matt. “I don’t know how cool we are.” He laughs. “We’re still not cool.”In Stranger Things, being uncool is the whole point. With it, the brothers have taken nerd culture fully into the mainstream. Dungeons & Dragons, which features heavily in the show, has experienced a huge growth in revenue since 2019 and a popularity not seen since its 1980s heyday. “I hope we made some of this nerdy stuff cooler,” says Ross. “You know, the show is ultimately about outsiders. When Matt and I were young, especially in high school, we were just making little movies, and we were in drama club, and we had trouble fitting in. We just felt very separate from everyone else, and it was a very scary time for us. So part of the goal of the show was just to go, no, there are people out there like you, and your differences are what make you cool.” Matt says that one character sums up that ethos in particular: Eddie Munson, season four’s metal-loving leader of the Dungeons & Dragons-playing Hellfire Club. “In many ways, we think of the show itself as Eddie, because Eddie is the person I wish had existed in high school, but did not exist.”Season four, which came out in 2022, had a sizeable impact on pop culture. Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) soundtracks a pivotal scene, when Max (Sadie Sink) finally escapes from the villainous Vecna in the Upside Down by using the song as a kind of anchor. The subsequent exposure gave Kate Bush her first UK No 1 single since 1978. “We had no idea it would go viral in the way that it did. We were surprised, and Kate was surprised, by how much it connected with younger people. Kate thought that was really cool,” says Ross. There is even more Running Up That Hill in season five.View image in fullscreen“She’s kind of scary”… Linda Hamilton as Dr Kay in season five of Stranger Things.Photograph: Netflix“Again, she’s been so great about it,” says Matt. Did she send a cake or flowers, to say thank you? “We did get a gift from Kate Bush, but it was way cooler than flowers,” says Ross. “It was this gilded bird cage with animatronic birds inside it, and you wind it up, and the birds chirp a little song. It’s very cool, very unique and very Kate Bush. Only Kate Bush would give this present.”Having played no small part in celebrating the careers of 80s icons such as Ryder and Modine, the brothers recruited yet another movie legend for the final stretch: Linda Hamilton, AKA The Terminator’s Sarah Connor. Hamilton plays Dr Kay, a steely military scientist in charge of another mysterious laboratory. “We needed to sort our Dr Brenner replacement,” explains Ross (the evil government scientist met his end in the Nevada desert, as season four drew to a close). “And because this was the final season, we wanted someone intimidating, but in a very different way than Modine.” Hamilton is “super-highly intelligent”, so she is believable as the scientist, “but at the same time, Linda can shoot a gun, she can get in a fight, she’s tough, and that toughness was perfect for the final season”.“She’s kind of scary,” agrees Hamilton, calling from her home in New Orleans. Hamilton is famous for the physicality of her roles; as Sarah Connor, she is one of the all-time-greatest action heroines in movie history. Is there more action in Stranger Things? “There are a couple of real fightin’ moments,” she laughs. “I mean, I do walk into every stunt rehearsal and go: ‘I’m 68 years old! When do I get tonothave stunt rehearsal?’” She has a stunt double, who was also her double on the last Terminator film. “But I’m carrying my own there. Doing at least half of it.”When Stranger Things came calling, Hamilton had been talking to her agent about retiring from acting altogether. “I had a hip injury, and I was in pain, and limping, and I couldn’t get an injection until I was getting ready to do a job,” she says. She told him she didn’t think she could do another TV show. “I just got really defeated there for a minute. And then he called me months later and said: ‘Stranger Things just called and asked if you’re free from June to June, and I said yes.’” She laughs. “We know each other so well. I did not hesitate to say, yes, let’s talk.”She already loved Stranger Things, and admits to being a fangirl. Walking on set for the first time was “very overwhelming, quite frankly. I didn’t have a lot of time with the Duffer brothers. Everything is so overly large in that show, and they didn’t coddle. They trusted me to put a character together that was going to come alive on camera, but you don’t know if you’ve done the right thing until you’re halfway through that first day and go, yeah, yeah, yeah, I’m finding it.”View image in fullscreenEmotional rescue … Caleb McLaughlin and Sadie Sink in season five of Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixDuring the bumper-length season four finale, a weakened Vecna managed to open another gate to the Upside Down, collapsing the barriers between the regular world and the shadow dimension and setting the scene for an ultimate showdown between good and evil. Season five sees the residents of Hawkins under military quarantine, jumping forward in time a little to November 1987. The show has always faithfully recreated the 80s, from the cars to the technology, right down to the food packaging. “A time that I’ve lived through!” says Hamilton. “My God, the 80s. My joke has always been that when a young actress comes up to me and says: ‘Knowing everything you know, what’s the most important thing for a young actress?’ I say: ‘Never go on film in the 80s.’” She laughs. “I know that a lot of people are enchanted by the 80s, but the 80s was not, to me, the greatest. So it’s really funny that here I am, at my age, playing someone back then, in that look.” The hairislarge in the show. “The hair isverylarge.”The trouble for Hamilton, now, is that she never watches herself on screen. As a fan, surely she will have to watch the final season to see how it ends? “No, I’m afraid not,” she says, a little sadly. “It’s terrible, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything I’ve done and wished I couldn’t do it again, and do a little bit more.” She refuses to put herself through it. “But I did get to read it, and be in the rooms with the actors during the readings and totally feel it.” She had the live-action experience? “Yes. It was amazing to be in that room for the final two episodes. Just, a blob of crying twentysomethings. It was really, really powerful to be part of that. Just a crying blob of children.”(I ask the Duffers if they feel good about ruining the ending of Hamilton’s favourite show by making it impossible for her to watch. “That’s what she’ssaying,” says Ross. “She’s gonna watch the show! I know other actors who are in the show and watch it, but fast-forward through their scenes. I’ll try to convince her, because she has to watch it.”)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin), Finn Wolfhard (Mike) and Noah Schnapp (Will) are picking at fruit plates, discussing what it feels like to become a Halloween costume. On set, says Schnapp, he would entertain himself by trying to guess which scenes might eventually show up as costumes.“Like when we did the stuff in season four, where we dressed up in the ghillie suits, and I was wearing your bandana,” says Matarazzo, turning to McLaughlin. At the end of season four, the gang wears military gear to battle in the Upside Down. Look closely, and you’ll see Dustin with Lucas’ famous bandana over the top of his hoodie.“You were wearing my bandana?” says McLaughlin, sceptically.“Yeah!”“No you weren’t.”“Yes I was!”They bicker like a family. The boys – though to call them boys is to tie them to the youth of their characters, as in real life they now range from 21 (Schnapp) to 24 (McLaughlin) – share the relatively rare experience of having grown up, on screen, in public, together. They were barely in double digits when they started work on Stranger Things. “When you’re younger, you tend to normalise weird situations around you,” says Matarazzo. “It’s not something you recognise as being peculiar until you’re a little older.” When they weren’t filming, Matarazzo attended a normal school in south Jersey where he grew up, which kept life steady for him. “It made a difference later on, but really, I always felt the most normal when I was with these guys. Even though it is a very weird environment, it was normal to me. It was normal to us. I felt the most comfortable when I was with them.”It must be strange for them that Stranger Things is about to come to a close, having taken up almost half of their lives. “Playing these characters has been amazing, and I think their storylines have come full circle, and it’s time for that to end, right?” says McLaughlin. “But growing up with these guys, and having the family that we’ve built, is something I won’t get again. I’m gonna miss that a lot.”Wolfhard is more introspective. He says they haven’t even seen the second half of season five, which will arrive in two further instalments, on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. Any answers they give to my questions might change when they have. “So it feels weird to come up with surface answers, because the hard part, for me, is that itisa lot to process, and itisreally emotional. There’s a lot of layers to it.”On the last ever day of filming, Wolfhard says, everyone was there. “We can’t officially say what we shot, but yeah, we were all together on the last day.” This is not typical – on most series or films, actors finish their scenes at different times or even different days, and leave gradually. This was not the case on Stranger Things, says Matarazzo. “It was important to all of us that we were there for each other. There were people who had wrapped a few days or maybe even a week prior, who decided to stay and make sure that everybody was there for that last day. That was a very necessary experience. It’s been 10 years.”The Duffer brothers had long known what the final scene of Stranger Things was going to be. When they began to work with writers on season five, they spent weeks and weeks on those last 30 minutes. “That’s where we started, because we knew that if we didn’t get those 30 minutes right, then it didn’t matter how much time and effort and quality was put into what preceded that. It wouldn’t matter,” says Matt. It was the first time they had worked that way, and when they were happy with the ending, they got started on the rest. “We were able to design it so that it would be building towards those last 30 minutes,” he explains.Then, for a split second, he echoes the many millions of fans who are all waiting patiently for its conclusion: “Hopefully, it works.”Stranger Things 5 part one is released at 1am on 27 November, followed by three episodes on Boxing Day and the finale on New Year’s Day.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStranger ThingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks about his illness, regrets, and how he felt about dancehall going global while he was behind barsFri 14 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTShareThere’s a moment when I’m interviewing Vybz Kartel in the courtyard of the Four Seasons hotel in Tower Bridge, London, and the UK government emergency alert test rings on my phone. He is panicked by it and jumps up. “Me ready fi run you know!” he says, which has us both laughing.It is a funny moment, but also a jolting one considering that it arrives in the middle of him discussing the lasting psychological effects of prison. Kartel, 49, real name Adidja Palmer, had been incarcerated across different institutions in Jamaica following his conviction for the 2011 murder of his associate Clive “Lizard” Williams. Following a lengthy appeal process, he wasreleased in July last yearafter the ruling was overturned by the UK privy council (which is the final court of appeal for Jamaica due to the nation being a former British colony).At the time of his arrest, Kartel was one of the biggest dancehall stars in Jamaica’s history. He emerged in 2003 with the album Up 2 Di Time, serving up provocation, badness and a rapid-fire rhythmic “toasting” vocal style that was both gravelly and versatile. Influenced by grittier DJs such as Ninjaman, it was a stylistic departure from the more mellifluous “singable” reggae sound of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. A succession of hits, from the erotic duet Romping Shop with Spice in 2009 to the foot-stomping Clarks in 2010 and the vibrantSummer Timein 2011, aided Kartel’s crossover to the British and American charts.By the early 2010s he had more than laid claim to the King of Dancehall title that was hitherto bestowed on Beenie Man. But today he’s a reminder that kings often experience moments of profound disturbance. Speaking of life after prison, he tells me: “My sleeping habits have changed … if I hear a key shake, it traumatise me”; the wardens would jingle them before a head count of prisoners. He “went hard” on smoking and drinking when he was released and both remain a crutch. Despite this, he refuses therapy: “I understand what I’m going through and I just let it work itself out.”View image in fullscreen‘My sleeping habits have changed … if I hear a key shake, it traumatise me’ … Vybz Kartel performing in Kingston.Photograph: Everynight Images/AlamyIt is humbling to witness Kartel this vulnerable. He is not a shrinking violet; in fact he is cheerful and cracks jokes. He looks at my pleated black trousers and starts to sing “spray dem like Issey Miyake”, a lyric from his track Empire Army referencing the Japanese fashion designer. But it is evident that prison has shifted something. It is a stark contrast, too, to his public triumphalism. Days before meeting him, I watched him perform at the O2 arena in London. The show began with Kartel performing from a cell, then emerging clad in a sparkling red Givenchy two-piece and launching into recent hitThe Comet, which portends his release and has the memorable line “Me fuck yuh madda through di prison grill”.While there had been an impression that Kartel received celebrity treatment behind bars, the reality is more bleak. In 2014, a doctor diagnosed him with Graves’ disease, an autoimmune condition that was being aggravated by his prison surroundings. Conditions in Jamaica’s Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre were said to be filthy and inhumane, and in the affidavit for his release, Kartel said that he feared dying in prison, as his heart was functioning at 37% of its capacity. “I was in urgent need of medical help that the state could not provide,” he says. On release, his physical health was so bad that at his welcome-home concert in Kingston on New Year’s Eve, he struggled to breathe and walk while performing. A diet of whole foods and green juices has helped support him back to health, and he says he was pleased by his more energetic showing at the O2.I’m pushing love and unity – shit I should have been doing years ago. But sometimes you pay to learnKartel had been one of dancehall’s greatest successes, but he had to watch from prison as it exploded into the mainstream, with the streaming giant Drake using the sound on his 2016 album Views and signing Kartel’s own protege Popcaan to his OVO label. “It didn’t feel good, but I’m a type of person that is gonna find a way,” he says. Kartel released music prolifically from prison. In 2016 alone he released 50 new songs, andRolling Stone wrotethat he “still rules dancehall.”. He cites the global hitFever, certified gold in the US and silver in the UK, as evidence of how he tapped into the genre’s momentum – all with lyrics recorded in Tower Street on an iPhone 5S.Of course, Kartel feels that those years in jail unjustly robbed him of much of his life. After being arrested for weed possession in 2011, he found himself kept in custody, charged with the murder of Jamaican businessman Barrington “Bossie” Burton (for which he was acquitted in July 2013), and then the murder of Lizard. I ask if he thinks he was set up. “Of course I was set up, because I’m innocent,” he says. “They always try to pin stuff on me, because they say gangsters, I influence them. [They say] my circle is questionable, which, in their defence, was true.”When I ask Kartel if his relationship with Lizard had broken down at any point, he says no. But evidence from his 2014 trial, which Kartel faced with three co-defendants (who all pleaded not guilty), paints a different story. According to police, Lizard was killed after allegedlystealing two gunsfrom Kartel and other members of his Portmore Empire crew. The courtroom was then shown messages sent from a mobile device claimed to be Kartel’s, which read: “Tween me an u a chop we chop up the bwoy Lizard fine fine … As long as u live dem can never find him.” Lizard’s body has never been found. These texts read like a confession. Yet lawyers handling Kartel’s appeal maintained that there was evidence ofphone tampering.View image in fullscreen‘It didn’t feel good, but I’m a type of person that is gonna find a way’ … Kartel on stage with Drake in Toronto.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockKartel is insistent: “I did not kill Lizard … and they know who did what.” He suggests collusion between different Jamaican authorities to topple him. And while the question of Kartel’s guilt remains only in the court of public opinion, it does track that Kartel was a figure that people wanted to see removed from public life. Before his imprisonment, his gunman tunes, vulgar lyrics known as “slackness” and promotion of hate speech were viewed as influencing an epidemic of violence that was sweeping Jamaica.As was theGully-Gaza war, a rivalry between Kartel and the dancehall artist Mavado that erupted in violent confrontations. A 2009 articlein the Jamaica Gleanernewspaper laments that “the followers of the gun hawks themselves – Vybz Kartel (Gaza) and Mavado (Gully) – are shooting, stabbing up and beating one another”. (He has since reconciled with Mavado, and tells me that their sons attend each other’s birthday parties.) By 2010, Kartel had been banned from entering some Caribbean countries including Grenada, Barbados and St Lucia. Even the deadlyWadando-Gaza gangin Nairobi, Kenya, is said to have drawn inspiration from Kartel.Today, he says he is “pushing love and unity, shit I should have been doing years ago. But sometimes you pay to learn.” He acknowledges that his previous lyrics contained violence, but he refuses to be scapegoated, saying that his “hardcore” music was a natural consequence of growing up in the ghetto. “The system created that reality for us as ghetto youth. The violence came with politics. The first round of violence that ever reached Jamaica? 1976.” He is referring to the escalation of political violence around the 1976 general election, a year in which there were an estimated200 political murders.It was in this year that reggae legend Bob Marley was shot in Kingston, two days before the Smile Jamaica concert that was intended to heal political divisions. It is also the year that Kartel was born. Although Kartel grew up in a two-parent household in Portmore with positive influences, he says that his parents could not watch him every second of the day. “I was born in violence. The streets were always calling. That’s how most ghetto youth get involved in crazy shit.”He cites the fact that he has, in recent years, received European and American visas as evidence that the world sees he has changed, as “these visas aren’t easy to get”. His first public appearance in the UK after leaving prison was at this year’s Mobo awards, where he was honoured with an Impact award for his influence on music and culture, a far cry from the 2012 awards, where he had his nomination for best reggae act withdrawn after refusing to apologise for homophobic lyrics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In Jamaica, we learned a lot of homophobia from the church. Now I would never do that. I think people should live, regardless of who you are or who you’re sleeping with – do your thing!”People love dancehall. I call it the biggest underground music on the planetThere are other regrets he has, likebleaching his skin(Kartel released a range of skin-lightening cosmetics in 2011). He told himself that he bleached because he wanted his tattoos to show. “In hindsight, I think it was just that colonial mindset that makes Black people think white is right.” He won’t bleach again: “That’s bullshit, man.”But that anti-colonial mentality is not entirely representative of Kartel’s views. His experience of Jamaica’s justice system has made him not just lose faith in the country, but become an advocate for Britain. As he points out, his Instagram bio features the words “Long live the king” along with a little union flag. He celebrates the UK privy council for delivering justice, rejecting calls for a Caribbean Court of Justice, a demand spearheaded by the Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley, feeling that Jamaica is “too corrupt. I went through the system and I see it tear people apart that don’t got no money,” he says. “I have money, and look how long it took me to get justice. So no, I’d never support that court of appeal.”View image in fullscreen‘What we were doing is mimicking what was said before’ … Kartel on his infamous lyrics.Photograph: Everynight Images/ShutterstockKartel also keeps his distance from Jamaican politics – supporting neither the ruling Jamaica Labour Party, nor the opposition People’s National Party (PNP). In his 2015 track Pound of Rice he says, “mi ah vote fi di pool party!” He imagines running for office, on a manifesto of “education, sports and entertainment” to serve those who grew up in the ghetto, but is clear that this would only be as an independent, “they would probably try to kill me. I’m not even joking.” Despite this, he is often inadvertently pulled into politics. When he made a surprise appearance at the PNP annual conference last year, it was interpreted as an endorsement, though he says he was only there to support his lawyer, Isat Buchanan, who recently won a seat in parliament. More recently, he condemned naysayers who criticised him for sharing the Jamaican government’s emergency response and recovery effort initiative in the wake of Hurricane Melissa, saying “this is not about politics, it’s about Jamaica”.Sound clashes are a thrilling reggae tradition. Will AI ruin them?Read moreThese days, Kartel is just trying to stay out of trouble. His main focus is figuring out how to continue expanding the reach of dancehall, seeking collaborations with Afrobeats artists who have broken out globally and striking a balance between commercial appeal and artistic integrity. He wants its tracks to become universal household classics, “like Bob Marley’s One Love – everybody can sing that, but with dancehall it’s like …” – he spits gibberish to communicate the genre’s fast pace. “But people love it. I call it the biggest underground music on the planet. Once we get it to that level where it’s on the playlists globally, we good.”Mostly though he is embracing freedom. He prays to God every day and he’s due to remove old tattoos of a devil’s head and the 666 symbol as he pursues a cleaner path. He is still struggling with sickness, but he feels good. “I tell you, nothing can ruin my day or my energy. I’ve got a new lease on life.”Vybz Kartel’s album Heart & Soul is out now.Explore more on these topicsMusicReggaeJamaicainterviewsShareReuse this content"

She’s a regular at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and has sung in the world’s top opera houses, including Milan’s La Scala and Covent Garden in London.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHobart represents a significant change of pace, but DiDonato insists she’s just as excited to perform to audiences here; she believes people tend to have less cultural baggage in cities without a strong operatic tradition.“When you perform in a city like Vienna or London, the audience is often listening to your performance through the filter of their favourite recording,” DiDonato says. “But I love the challenge of singing for people where it’s new, or uncharted territory. I like to think that, at least energetically, I’m taking them by the hand and saying: ‘Come, it’s beautiful. You’re gonna be OK.’”Her egalitarian passion for sharing music has seen her work with inmatesat Sing Sing, a maximum security prison in New York state, where she has been performing and running workshops for a decade, and witnessing the transformative power of centuries-old music.View image in fullscreenJoyce DiDonato in Barrie Kosky’s production of Agrippina by Handel at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn Australia and New Zealand, DiDonato will be performing Les Nuits d’été (Summer Nights), a song cycle by French composer Hector Berlioz. “It is music that’s immediately emotional, beautiful and identifiable,” DiDonato says. “It has both the light and the dark, a little bit of humour and then the pathos. This is basically who I am as a performer, so it felt complete.”Light and shade are quintessential DiDonato qualities, in a voice renowned for its exquisite coloratura, its control and warmth. It allows the singer to inhabit a stunning array of characters, from Handel’s “guns-blazing” Agrippina to the “solemnly mellow-toned Virginia Woolf” in Kevin Puts’s The Hours. It’s the kind of stylistic diversity that would make a soprano weep – and DiDonato is the first to say: mezzos have more fun.“[We] get to do literally everything, far more than any other voice type,” she says. Rather than the doomed lovers or chaste ingenues into which sopranos are often pigeonholed, mezzos “play different genders, we play the princesses and the witches. And then there’s the sheer variety of music. I span four centuries pretty regularly”.View image in fullscreenJoyce DiDonato, centre, in The Hours at The Metropolitan Opera.Photograph: Evan Zimmerman/APThis range has been key to DiDonato’s professional longevity and the secret to her unbridled enthusiasm for the art form. “I have a huge musical and dramatic appetite and I can not imagine being constrained by a more narrow voice type,” she laughs.While some singers find their voice emerging organically in their late teens, DiDonato had to work hard to locate hers, a task that occupied most of her 20s. “I don’t know that my love is my voice. It’s not that I don’t love it, but that’s not the thing that charges me. It’s the expressive potential of my voice, what I say with it, that matters,” she says.“I align with composers that are first of all emotional storytellers, and that are not afraid to write a melody.”Given how much contemporary opera leans into atonality, into sparse and complex soundscapes over memorable arias, this statement feels almost counter-revolutionary. And while a passionate and vocal advocate for opera’s continuing relevance, DiDonato believes recent developments in the form have pushed audiences away.“It feels like, in America – and maybe worldwide – opera has lost its way,” she says. “Ticket sales went down, and I feel like there was this panic [in the industry], that we’ve got toberelevant, we have to change. And it’s almost as if we jumped ship from who we are.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has witnessedhardened criminals moved by Handel’s Giulio Cesare, and knows that opera “puts into the physical realm, through vibration, what many of us have no access to verbalise and express. Especially today. We’re so blocked. We’re so frozen.”Opera is vital, DiDonato argues, because “there are so few outlets in our society that really go there. It’s pure presence.” And it has a function. “We must, as individuals and a society, figure out who we are today in this world. And we do that by putting thoughts on paper, by putting our hands in clay, by vocalising and expressing our confusion, our mystery, our joy, our sorrow, our despair.”“And that can happen in Tasmania, that can happen at the MetropolitanOpera, that can happen in Sing Sing prison.

Grainier cuts the trees and tames the forest and lays the ground for railroads and towns. Technically, then, Train Dreams is a western. But he never once ropes a steer, shoots a bandit or circles the wagons ahead of a Comanche attack on the plains. The small print tells a different kind of story.It was a hard film to pitch, admits the actor Joel Edgerton: an uphill struggle; plenty of studio trepidation. “You go into the meeting and say: ‘Well, it’s a movie about a guy who’s not really making choices for himself. He’s kind of pushed around by life.’”“He’s not a big hero,” agrees the director, Clint Bentley. “Also, there are some supernatural elements.”“It’s a spiritual movie,” adds Edgerton. “You have to be patient.”Bentley play-acts the role of a studio boss. “It sounds beautiful,” he says. “It sounds lovely. We’ll pass.”View image in fullscreenEdgerton as Robert Grainier in Train Dreams.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixI’m delighted they got it across the line. Train Dreams is beautiful, spiritual, but it is also rugged and pitiless and resolutely earthbound, planted in the soil of the Pacific north-west and lovingly grown out ofDenis Johnson’s 2011 novella. Edgerton plays Grainier, the itinerant logger in 1900s Idaho, dwarfed by towering fir trees and white pine. Each job takes him deeper into the northern woods, further away from his wife and infant daughter, Katy. “I feel like I’m missing her whole life,” he complains.I meet Edgerton and Bentley in a London hotel, their latest stop in an ongoing international press tour. Edgerton explains he has just arrived from LA and is leaving for New York in the morning, which means he’ll be away from his kids for the next two weeks. “And as privileged as I am, I still can’t reconcile my working life with my family,” he tells me. “I mean, surely I can rule the world. I’m an important actor, I can do whatever I want. But no. I’m a contract worker and the kids have to be in school. And if they don’t go to school then I go to jail.”I don’t have the tragedy of Robert inside me, but I’ve imagined it. As soon as you become a father you imagine itSo what is he saying: that Hollywood film-making is the business class version of logging? “Yeah, that’s what I’m saying,” he laughs. “This is true. Woe is me.”Edgerton has been on the circuit for 30 years, mostly working as a hired hand but occasionally developing and directing his own movie projects. He first read Train Dreams a decade ago, discovered that the film rights were taken and reluctantly moved on. By the time Bentley tapped him to play the lead role, he was settled in London with his partner, Christine Centenara, a journalist, and had recently welcomed the arrival of twins. Midway through the story, Grainier’s life takes a tragic turn. Rereading Johnson’s novella, Edgerton found that it spoke to him more than ever.“I don’t have the tragedy of Robert inside me, but I’ve imagined it,” he says. “As soon as you become a father you imagine it and it’s terrifying. In the lead-up to our kids coming into the world, there was a moment when we thought they were not going to make it. And I find that when I think about those days there’s a pit in my stomach that will live there for ever.”Train Dreams is Edgerton and Bentley’s joint venture, but it is also a collaboration between Bentley and his regular creative partner, Greg Kwedar. The two men have a policy of sharing writing duties while taking turns to direct. Kwedar shot their previous outing, the prison dramaSing Sing(2023), whereas Bentley took the reins onJockey(2021), which trailed an ageing horseman on one last lap of the track. Bentley’s own father was a journeyman jockey who lived out of a suitcase and survived race to race. Jockey, he concedes, was semi-autobiographical. Perhaps on some level Train Dreams is as well.View image in fullscreen‘The yearning for home versus the call of the wild’ … Grainier with his daughter.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix“As a film-maker you’re often the last one to know what interests you until someone tells you,” he says. “But sure, both Jockey and Train Dreams are about a man who’s away from his family. My dad certainly lived that life. Some of it I lived alongside him – dragged from track to track, babysat by the trainers. But a lot of it I didn’t; he was gone for long stretches. And then I myself turned into some version of that. That’s a hard thing to reconcile.”Like Grainier, like his father, Bentley moves from one job to the next. His wife and young son live in Texas and await his return.“I love being with my family,” he says. “But I love being on the road. If I didn’t have a family, I’d be happy living in Motel 6s for the rest of my life.”View image in fullscreenWilliam H Macy (centre) plays Arn Peeples.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixIt’s the classic cowboy vacillation, the ambivalence at the heart of most movie westerns: the yearning for home versus the call of the wild. “Not to get too psychoanalytical here, but being on Train Dreams did make me feel like my dad,” Bentley says. “My son was just at the age where my absence from home made an impact. He knew I was gone. And one morning, brushing my teeth, it was like I connected to my dad in his motel, brushing his teeth in the mirror. He’s passed on; I can’t talk to him. But I suddenly understood him in a way that I hadn’t before.”Men don’t talk – perhaps that’s partly the problem. Edgerton has always been good at playing tough, taciturn types, whether it’s the navy commander inZero Dark Thirty, the enigmatic lord inThe Green Knight, or brutish Tom Buchanan in Baz Luhrmann’sThe Great Gatsby. But I’ve never seen him so magnificently tight-lipped – nor so purely heartbreaking – as he is in Train Dreams.There are directors who are too scared to communicate with their actors. I know of some high-profile actors where the director figures, ‘It’s not my place to tell you what to do’If Grainier has an ancestor, Edgerton thinks it was probably his role in Jeff Nichols’ fact-based 2016 dramaLoving. Edgerton played Richard Loving, a construction worker in 1950s Virginia who is arrested for marrying a local black woman. He says: “At the end of the first week of shooting, I like to check in with my directors, because I have that actor’s paranoia. So I always say to them: ‘Please tell me if I’m doing anything that you want done differently.’ And on Loving, Jeff said: ‘I want to understand you less.’ That was a big help. The character was nonverbal. Robert is as well. So it focuses you in a completely different way.”View image in fullscreenBrutish … Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, with Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby (2013).Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarAll of which makes perfect sense. Even so, I’m surprised he has to go cap-in-hand for direction. Shouldn’t the director be directing? The job description is in the title. “Yeah, well, why I ask that is because there are directors who are too scared to communicate with their actors,” he says. “Hopefully I’m not one of the terrifying ones. But I know of some high-profile actors where the director figures, ‘It’s not my place to tell you what to do,’ and doesn’t say anything for the entire film. That’s something that Hollywood is guilty of a lot: the actor is king. Maybe king is the wrong analogy. But the director should always be the head of the household. I worry that some directors feel they’re not allowed to talk to their actors. And I worry that some actors feel that the director doesn’t have to do anything except set up the shots.”Train Dreams review – Joel Edgerton superb in Malickian story of trees, grief and railroadsRead moreIn other words, people need to communicate more. “Absolutely,” he says. “And what’s the point of being a director if you don’t talk to your actors?”Having slogged so hard to get Train Dreams finished, Edgerton and Bentley are free to sit back and drink in the acclaim. The picture is amassing rave reviews and is being tipped as a dark horse Oscar contender. The veteran director Paul Schraderrecently called it“a reverie” and “a film designed to envelop you”, although he also mistakenly called it “Traffic Dreams”, which suggests the publicity campaign has some way left to run. But if Train Dreams tells us anything, it’s that life is short and success is fleeting. Grainier, for instance, spends his days chopping giant 500-year-old spruce only to see his wooden trestle bridges replaced by ones made of steel. Every human achievement risks becoming faded and forgotten. That goes for railroads and families, and motion pictures as well.View image in fullscreen‘The character was nonverbal’ … With Ruth Negga in Loving (2016).Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarEdgerton nods. “One of the reasons that I love working in film is that you think a film will live for ever. This was a movie shot by real people in the woods. The aliveness of it all – the realness of it all – is preserved. My dream is that it becomes like bespoke boot-making or vinyl, and that humans will always want to interact with human-made things. But who knows, maybe not. Because now you can create the woods on a laptop. You can make a whole film out of zeros and ones.”That’s tragic, of course, but it also makes the work feel more precious. He says: “Probably one day we’ll see the last analogue movie. And we won’t know that it is until it’s already been and gone.”Train Dreams is out in cinemas now and on Netflix from 21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmJoel EdgertonWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But even though she has also recorded this material for her recent albumElemental, Bridgewater is not really in the mood. “I just don’t feel like it’s the time to be doing love songs and whimsical songs from the 1920s and 30s,” she says. “They’re beautiful, but there’s some kind of spirit and energy pushing me to sing songs saying: people, we have to protect our democracy.”Bridgewater is one of American jazz’s foremost voices. Capable of crooning and confronting, the two-time Grammy winner has a career that spans six decades and has never stopped evolving. She cut her teeth sharing the stage with several of jazz’s greatest band leaders – Sonny Rollins, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon – before branching out into acting; singing pop and disco; and working out of France, the UK and Mali, always with a determination to create on her own terms.At 75, an age where some singers may be content with gently reheating their earlier success, she emanates energy, idealism and splenetic anger. “I’m too old and I’ve been through too much,” she says. “I’m a product of the 1960s; I supported the Black Panther party and their community projects. Even now I deal with racism daily – every day there is something that somebody does which is racist. Even my kids don’t understand it. I cannot just sit back and be silent. I have to raise my voice.”It will be heard at this week’s London jazz festival, where Bridgewater is backed by We Exist!, an all-female band she founded to promote women in jazz. “I got tired of hearing jazz musicians saying the same old chauvinistic crap and keeping women out,” she says. “I decided to put together an all-female band as a statement that the jazz world is still very macho.”View image in fullscreenDee Dee Bridgewater performing in Milan, 2024.Photograph: Sergione Infuso/Corbis/Getty ImagesBridgewater also established the Woodshed Network, now overseen by her daughter and manager Tulani, with the aim of providing female jazz musicians with “all the things they need to learn to help get their careers off the ground”. The Woodshed Network sits within the Kennedy Center, the Washington DC-based institution that is regarded as the national cultural centre of the US, and which has now beentaken over by Donald Trump and his Maga acolytes. “Considering what he’s doing to the Kennedy Center, I’m unsure if [the Woodshed Network] will continue for too much longer.”Bridgewater doesn’t mention Trump by name during our 90-minute conversation, only saying “he”, her distaste evident as she spits out the syllable. She now performs songs that reflect her fury: the likes of Billy Taylor’s civil rights anthem I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free, Gene McDaniels’ Compared to What, Donny Hathaway’s Tryin’ Times and Bob Dylan’s barbed Gotta Serve Somebody.“I couldn’t go to aNo Kingsprotest, but I do protest songs with the We Exist! band,” she says. “The programme I am doing now started out of the war in Gaza – I watched the news and thought: I am witnessing the beginning of a genocide. I guess I have what you might call a spiritual voice which sometimes speaks to me very loudly. I was sitting in my living room watching the news and crying and this voice said to me: put it in music, let the music speak for you.”Another selection, Nina Simone’s Mississippi Goddam, “is the song that really hits the nail on the head. It’s still relevant today as they are trying to make protesting more difficult.” Percy Mayfield’s Danger Zone, meanwhile, “is an old blues that needs to be heard, because we are in a danger zone! We have to raise our voices and vote, here and in Europe.”Not that Bridgewater believes speaking out is free of cost. “I’m trying to wake people up through songs, but a lot of young people are oblivious to what’s going on. I’m trying to figure out a way to do it without causing too much upset. I fear this government is going to start cracking down on free speech and coming after those of us who speak out.”We are in a danger zone! We have to raise our voices and vote, here and in EuropeBridgewater was born Denise Garrett in 1950 in Memphis, Tennessee, and grew up in Flint, Michigan, where her jazz musician father gave Dee Dee – a childhood nickname – an introduction to African American music. She sang in bands throughout college, then, aged 20, married jazz trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater. Their honeymoon was spent on tour with hard-bopping pianist Horace Silver, as Cecil was in his band. “The night they were playing Detroit, knowing my family would be in the audience, Cecil suggested I come out unannounced to sing on Love Vibrations. I did, and Horace, who had no idea this was going to happen, cut me off, saying: ‘Get off my stage!’”Max Roach was even more brutal. “Cecil was playing in Max’s band and his wife and vocalist Abbey Lincoln had left. Max asked me to replace Abbey for the We Insist! suite. We did it a couple of times and then, one night, he started cursing me out, calling me ‘Abbey’, getting really abusive. I had to flee the stage.”View image in fullscreenWith Ray Charles in 1989.Photograph: Christian Rose/Roger Viollet via Getty ImagesDespite these incidents, Lincoln’s song And It’s Supposed to Be Love is in her current set, and she speaks with compassion for her old bandleaders. “Max Roach was intense. I now realise he was bipolar. But we managed to stay friends – I’d see him whenever he came to Paris. And Horace kicking me off stage gave me the impetus to prove I could do his music.” Come 1995, they recorded together for the album Love and Peace: A Tribute to Horace Silver.Dizzy Gillespie and Sonny Rollins were easier company. “Dizzy was the sweetest – I learned how to entertain audiences, how to make them laugh, from him,” while Sonny “gave me the biggest hug and said how much he liked my singing”.After these early-70s collaborations she graduated to lead billing, but her well-received 1974 debut album Afro Blue was not a commercial success. Now a single mother living in New York, Bridgewater moved into singing pop, then won a Tony award for her performance as Glinda the Good Witch in Broadway musical The Wiz, before cutting a number of disco tracks. Acting in TV and film also kept her busy, and she was Olivier award-nominated for playing Billie Holiday in the 1986 West End musical Lady Day, before marriage to French concert promoter Jean-Marie Durand led her to settle in Paris for almost a quarter of a century. There, Bridgewater developed into a superb interpreter of jazz standards: albums dedicated to Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Holiday all raised her profile (the last two securing those Grammy wins).The Dee Dee Bridgewater Quartet perform Compared to WhatIn the mid-00s, still living in France, “I used to hear all this great music they’d play on the radio there, and it was the Malian music that spoke the strongest to me. At the same time I wanted to find my African ancestry – and DNA tests were prohibitively expensive – so I decided to go there.” Arriving in Bamako she was welcomed by the “fabulous, statuesque” Oumou Sangaré, while “Cheick Tidiane Seck and Bassekou Kouyate challenged me to sing griot songs,” resulting in the rich west African jazz fusion of 2007’s Red Earth: A Malian Journey.Today, Bridgewater says she has no intention of slowing down – “this is how I make my money, baby, I live out of hotels!” – and an appearance at the UK’s We Out Here festival in 2024, alongside DJs and producers, “made me realise I want to be heard in the clubs again”. She is now making an album with Gilles Peterson and house music legend Louie Vega.‘Come on this journey with me’: Elaine Mitchener, Britain’s boldest vocalistRead more“I always wanted to be like Miles Davis – not staying in one groove but constantly changing, not staying still,” she says. She cites another inspiration, jazz singer Betty Carter, who she would visit in Brooklyn after moving to New York. “She was running her own record label, her albums lined up in the hallway in various stages of packaging, leading her own band. Now I produce my albums and I own my albums. I take control of my career so no one tries to tell me what to do.” She laughs: “Well, my daughter sometimes tries.”Dee Dee Bridgewater performs in theEFG London jazz festivalopening gala, Jazz Voice, at Royal Festival Hall, 14 November; and with We Exist!, at the Barbican, 15 November.

Who cares if she watches a lot of extreme pornography? But after the light is switched off, Ani can’t get through their impromptu sleepover without masturbating to porn on her phone. The friend wakes up next to her and exits in disgust.The same scenario has already led Ani, a 30-year-old academic, to break up with her partner. LikePhoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, she was using porn next to her boyfriend in bed. Fleabag darkly regaled us with her voracious YouPorn habit but Ani, despite her robust reasoning in their argument, is deeply troubled by her behaviour. So, too, is her father when Ani hides away in her old childhood bedroom with her laptop.It’s frequently funny but thisbold play by Sophia Chetin-Leunercaptures the wearying compulsion of an addict, showing how the search for release has turned into grim habit. The characters in her previous play,This Might Not Be It,which also has caring at its core, have a phrase for this sort of desensitised state: “your tap’s been switched off”. In a riveting performance, Ambika Mod manages to make Ani’s isolation and emptiness as moving as it is unsettling.View image in fullscreenIsolation and emptiness … Ambika Mod and Asif Khan in Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayKey to the play’s success is the wayChetin-Leuner and director Josie Rourkeskilfully toggle between the digital and physical worlds to emphasise the seductive, instant gratification of the internet where,as Bo Burnham put it, “anything that brain of yours can think of can be found”. Ani’s brain has accordingly been rewired and her restless search for comfort online is a constant amid the stress that comes with professional success and her grief after her mother’s death. She recognises those as triggers yet, tellingly, co-opts a friend’s sexual revelation to hide behind instead when discussing her behaviour.As a play about chronic addiction, this story is full of secrets, emphasised byYimei Zhao’s inspired design which transforms the Royal Court’s small upstairs theatre into a padded den. It’s staged in the round, typically seen as giving nowhere to hide, but Ani conceals her laptop and other belongings between the folds of the cushioned floor. The concentric, vulva-like design of the space becomes a cocoon softly lit by Mark Henderson as Ani escapes into her ritual of internet porn. But it also resembles a vortex and, in the prologue, is used to evoke Eve staring at her reflection in Milton’s Paradise Lost.View image in fullscreenEthical unease … Ambika Mod and Will Close in Porn Play.Photograph: Helen MurrayAni is a Milton scholar and the drama tussles not just with notions of lost innocence (the alternate meaning of “play” in the title) and his epic poem’s sexual politics but also the question of separating the art from the author’s behaviour. That ethical argument bleeds into Ani’s distinction between watching violent pornography (“it’s all fake”) and her IRL views of women and the world. The porn on Ani’s screens is shown in abstract, highlighting how the footage itself is almost inconsequential, and is matched by the thrumming, distorted ecstasy of Helen Skiera’s score.This Is Going to Hurt’s Ambika Mod: ‘Whenever I did a caesarean I was buzzing!’Read moreThe ambitious balance of tragedy, horror and comedy is best in a painful scene where Ani’s boyfriend holds the phone for her while she masturbates. It does not quite come off in a gynaecological appointment (for which a whole gurney is extracted from beneath the set) where Ani’s shame is voiced by her doctor.Will Close, Lizzy Connolly and Asif Khan deftly handle multiple supporting roles between them in a show with sharply delineated movement direction byWayne McGregor. The play’s strands are directly tied together through Ani and her father’s climactic speeches in the sort of ending that can often feel forced but is greatly persuasive here. It’s a play that confirms Chetin-Leuner as a clear-sighted yet sanguine chronicler of all manner of relationships, not least with ourselves.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAmbika ModPornographyJosie RourkeRoyal Court theatreInternetWayne McGregorreviewsShareReuse this content"

Or, in the Flemish words written under rain clouds in this late medieval painting,her las uber ganmeaning “Lord, let it pass over”. The pattern of clouds pouring out black lines of rain, on stripes of white and blue, decorates a wall behind a man who’s holding up a ring between finger and thumb. You can tell it’s a wall painting, and not an abstract background, because he casts a shadow on it: for this is a technically revolutionary painting influenced by the great Bruges artist Jan van Eyck. Even the way the unknown portrait sitter holds up a ring is derived from a similar gesture in a Van Eyck painting. What does it all mean? A ring could symbolise love and marriage, or he could be a goldsmith. But I reckon this well-dressed, chubby-faced character is a merchant and the ring signifies wealth (just as the Medici family had diamond rings as a symbol.) If that’s so, his wall painting of rain clouds and prayer to God for better times probably refers to weathering financial storms.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo immediately jumped in to help protect her and Wen was moved away.Local media has indicated that Wen, 26, who is an Australian citizen, intends to plead guilty and could be fined up to S$2,000 (£1,168).Wen regularly posts on Instagram as pyjamamann, where his stock-in-trade is invading concert stages, including those of Katy Perry and the Weeknd. The footage of his approach to Grande led to a substantial backlash, with many commenters calling his actions a criminal offence.Grande and co-stars are shortly to complete their mammoth publicity tour for the film’s sequel, which is released on 21 November. The review embargo lifts on Tuesday and early reaction has suggested repeat Oscar nominations for the two stars are likely.Red carpet invasions are increasingly uncommon as security has tightened over recent years. In 2007, podcaster Cielke Sijben handcuffed herself to Hugh Grant at a premiere of his romcom Music and Lyrics. Firefighters later freed the pair.Bradley Cooper was accosted on the red carpet in 2014 by a Ukrainian TV prankster who buried his head in the actor’s trousers, having given Will Smith an unsolicited kiss at the Moscow premiere of Men in Black 3 in 2012. Also in 2012, Kim Kardashian was flourbombed at the red carpet event for her perfume launch by a Peta activist who called her a “fur hag”.Explore more on these topicsWicked: For GoodAriana GrandeSingaporenewsShareReuse this content"

We got the cast who play the crew of Odysseus’s ship out there on the real waves, in the real places … We really wanted to capture how hard those journeys would have been for people. And the leap of faith that was being made in an unmapped, uncharted world.” He added: “We shot over 2 million ft of film.”The Odyssey has been entirely shot on the large-scale Imax format, which uses considerably more film than standard 35mm cameras.According to Indepth Cine, Imax cameras use around 337ft of 65mm film per minute,, compared to 90ft for 35mm. This suggests Nolan has shot around 100 hours of raw footage – which in fact compares relatively favourably to some other recent films;a log by editor Vashi Nedomanskisuggests that Mad Max: Fury Road shot around 480 hours of raw footage, and Gone Girl shot 500 hours.Nolan also outlined in the interview his reasons for picking the project, having been in line to direct another Homeric epic, Troy, more than two decades ago. “As a film-maker, you’re looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven’t been done before. And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with –Ray Harryhausenmovies and other things – I’d never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, Imax production could do.”He added: “By embracing the physicality of the real world in the making of the film, you do inform the telling of the story in interesting ways. Because you’re confronted on a daily basis by the world pushing back at you.”Speaking to the same magazine, Matt Damon, who plays Odysseus, was effusive in his compliments for Nolan: “I can say, without hyperbole, that it was the best experience of my career … “I saw the [Trojan] horse on the beach and I was just like, ‘Fuck’. It was just so cool.”Nolan’s film, which also stars Tom Holland as Odysseus’s son Telemachus, is due for release in July 2026.Explore more on these topicsThe OdysseyChristopher NolanMatt DamonHomerFilm adaptationsImaxnewsShareReuse this content"

Most were well preserved, with one still able to float despite its long incarceration.After conservation, three of the boats will go on public display for the first time on Friday. The others are still part of a conservation project at a specialist facility built at Flag Fen archaeology park, with work carried out by York Archaeological Trust and Peterborough city council.The boats were excavated from the riverbed of an ancient, silted-up creek at Must Farm near Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire.According to archaeologists, they range in date from 2,500 to 3,500 years ago and provide valuable information about prehistoric carpentry and construction techniques and transportation methods.View image in fullscreenOne of three log boats found at Must Farm in Cambridgeshire.Photograph: Historic England/Cambridge Archaeological Unit/PAAnalysis has identified the specific tree species used, felling methods and the tools employed in their creation. Log boats were simple vessels made by hollowing out a single tree trunk.Since their excavation, the log boats have been preserved in climate-controlled conditions using a specialised wax and water solution.The three boats now on permanent display include a middle-bronze age 6.3-metre oak vessel, which has areas of charring inside; a 2.2 metre-fragment of a middle-bronze age oak boat featuring an intricate repair within the hull; and a 0.8 metre-fragment of an early bronze age boat made of field maple.The log boats were an “amazing discovery”, said Iona Robinson Zeki, a researcher at Cambridge Archaeological Unit. “These simple, yet supremely effective boats were used to navigate a fenland river for almost a millennium.“We can see, in their varied construction, how the qualities of different types and sizes of trees were used to make boats ranging from small, manoeuvrable canoes to long, stable punt-like vessels. These vessels were used to lay fish traps but also to transport people potentially alongside animals and materials.”Over the period, the area became wetter with groundwater levels gradually rising. “It goes from being seasonally wet to wet most of the year, and turning into swamp,” said Robinson Zeki. She added that boats became the main way of transporting goods.View image in fullscreenIona Robinson Zeki, an archaeological researcher, said the boats were an ‘amazing discovery’ .Photograph: Historic England/Cambridge Archaeological Unit/PAThe condition of some of the boats suggested they had been stored in the water to stop them cracking or warping, with the intention of them being retrieved at a later date for further use. Most of the boats, however, appeared to have reached the end of their functional life.The conservation project was funded by Forterra, the owner of the site where the boats were discovered, HistoricEnglandand Peterborough city council.Jacqueline Mooney, the general manager of Flag Fen archaeology park, said: “This is more than an archaeological display – it’s a powerful reconnection with the people who once lived, worked and journeyed through this landscape. We are proud to share this extraordinary chapter of our shared human past, brought to life through meticulous excavation, conservation, and storytelling.”Bronze Age Boat Discoveries at Must Farm opens as a permanent exhibition at theFlag Fen archaeology parkon Friday 14 November.Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyCambridgeshireConservationHeritageEnglandMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s like The White Lotus meets The Talented Mr RipleyLucy ManganFri 14 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Nov 2025 12.45 ESTShareIcan’t say I had “Jack Whitehall stars with David ‘The X Files/ Californication’ Duchovny in glossy TV thriller” on my 2025 bingo card, but here we are, and a good time with it can be had by all. Alongside, perhaps, a smidge of national pride to see the daft lad from Fresh Meat, Bad Education and Travels With My Father all grown up and holding his own.The glossy thriller in question is Malice, in which Whitehall plays Adam, a tutor promoted to manny (male nanny, for those not au fait with rich people’s terms), who is bent – for reasons as yet unknown – on ruining high-rolling businessman Jamie Tanner (Duchovny). Whether he has it in for the rest of the Tanner family and friends, or they are just doomed to be collateral damage, is not clear, but that doesn’t spoil the machiavellian fun.Adam arrives at the Tanners’ opulent Greek island estate as tutor to the children of Jamie’s guests, Jules (Christine Adams) and Damien (Raza Jaffrey), who are very much the beta setting for the Tanners’ alpha display. Adam quickly makes himself interesting (with his knowledge about the surrounding islands’ mythic heritage, thanks to studying classics at university) and useful (with his knowledge of cocktail and calamari-making and willingness to do domestic chores while still having time to accompany Jamie to local strip clubs).As he goes, he gathers information about his hosts (including the suggestion that they are hiding as much as holidaying, in the hope that “a situation” involving their oldest child will resolve itself); flings Jamie’s passport in the sea; poisons food; flirts with Jamie’s wife, Nat (Carice van Houten); and sets various traps for the unwary family and their employers. Some close quickly. Some take their time.View image in fullscreenPlotting … Jack Whitehall as Adam in Malice.Photograph: Yannis Drakoulidis./PAWhile Adam is grifting and plotting, Jamie and Duchovny are having a great time. Jamie because he is a rich, entitled asshole insulated from the consequences of his actions – at least so far – by his wealth and power; Duchovny because rich, entitled assholes in glossy TV thrillers get all the best lines. The part of Jamie plays to all Duchovny’s strengths as an actor: roving intelligence, dry wit and an unassailable detachment from proceedings. We believe in him as a ruthless multimillionaire and as a man good enough not to deserve whatever is coming at him.By the end of the first two episodes, which were all that were available for review, Adam has his feet firmly under the Tanner table – which has now moved from Greece to their London mansion, and is overseen by a large portrait of the happy family. Malice is very good but it is not subtle. (See also: the snake in the family pool early on; several characters voicing some variant of: “That Adam fellow – I find him disquieting in some indefinable way”; and Adam standing over the drunk, unconscious Jamie and telling him he could kill him right now but won’t because he wants him to suffer as he has.) That is, of course, a large part of the fun.Some ways have been cleared. Some unexpected obstacles – a dogged Greek detective assigned to the mugging of the man with whom Jamie has a longstanding dispute over the land he built on, or a stomach unusually resistant to poisoned avocado – have been overcome. More, doubtless, will arise as the family start to wonder why their perfect lives are falling apart and whether this new guy is as perfect as he appears. Is there something nasty in the gilded woodhouse?It’s The White Lotus meets The Talented Mr Ripley, of course, tapping into viewers’ distaste for, and fascination with, the lives of the fabulously well-off, and eternal attraction to the underdog who seems set to bring the whole shining thing down.It’s a great ride, and Whitehall acquits himself well in his first lead dramatic role, even if he is better at oblique menace than delivering straightforwardly murderous speeches. Duchovny is as skilled, nimble and charismatic as ever, giving us a Hank from Californication if he had gone into real estate rather than writing and made enough money to keep his chaos at bay. Moreish, bingeable stuff to take you happily through to Christmas.All episodes of Malice are on Prime now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid DuchovnyJack WhitehallreviewsShareReuse this content"

A starship under the command of Mark Ruffalo’s Trumpesque politician is en route to colonise a distant planet. Robert Pattinson – who is becoming quite the character actor – stars as Mickey, an “expendable”: his identity has been downloaded so he can die any number of times and the crew just reprint a new body.

It is: the subject of these 176 pages is a three-month period in 1985 when Fox was simultaneously shooting his breakout sitcom role in Family Tiesand the career-defining American classic, Back to the Future.That’s two more-than-full-time jobs for one little guy, necessitating that the then 23-year-old actor work 20-hour days, six days a week. This schedule was only possible because the mid-1980s was a time before showbiz labour laws caught up with basic human decency. These days, we’re told, a standard contract “demands two weeks of buffer time on either side of a job”, while Fox didn’t even get an hour.How did he do it? This book tells us, drawing on the memories of colleagues and friends to fill in details where Fox’s own sleep-deprived brain falls short. The material might have seemed stretched thin to fill even this relatively slim volume, were it not for the fact Fox was also a singularly unlikely – and therefore fascinating – movie star prospect. Working-class, 5ft 4in and Canadian; that this short king ever made it so big is a natural-law-defying miracle, on a par with time travel itself.Or maybe not. Fox writes that, initially at least, his height was a significant career advantage. It meant theFamily Ties producers could secure him a US work visa on the grounds that “I was special and unique in America: old enough to work the long hours of an adult, but with a look that allowed me to play a much younger character”.His wayward adolescence, spent kicking about in suburban Toronto parking lots, had also furnished Fox with a skillset ideally suited to playing Back to the Future’shoverboarding, bully-outsmarting, rock-n-roll-inventing hero, Marty. He arrived for his first day already a proficient skateboarder (pro-skateboarding legend Tony Hawk is apparently a fan of the movie) and garage-band guitarist.He arrived for his first day already a proficient skateboarder and garage-band guitaristBut perhaps Fox’s most valuable skill was his tireless professionalism. Full-colour set photos seem to corroborate the actor’s own claims that he “never complained about the hours” and was “full of joy, even at 3.00 am”. The most persuasive evidence of this, however, is the thoughtful, affectionate way he reflects on his interactions with on-set colleagues, even when it’s clear these relationships were far from frictionless.‘I hate it. It sucks. But it didn’t defeat me’: Michael J Fox on pity, Parkinson’s – and a potential cureRead moreThe circumstances of Fox’s arrival on Back to the Future were already awkward. He was replacing the previous “Marty”, actor Eric Stoltz, a month into shooting, after director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg became convinced he wasn’t the “right fit”. Add to that the showbiz hierarchy of the day, which placed a lowly TV star several rungs beneath trained theatre actors such as Christopher Lloyd, who played “Doc”, and Fox had his work cut out for him. Perhaps it was the knowledge that he’d already pulled off one impossible task – making it to Hollywood in the first place – which gave him the confidence to attempt another.Back to the Futuresuper-fans are predictably well served here, with titbits like the fact that no one on set thought the DeLorean was at all cool (“Let’s face it – it’s a shit car. Slow to accelerate, with cheap appointments”), and the shift of Marty’s “Johnny B Goode” to B rather than B-flat, the 80s kid taking inspiration from Jimi Hendrix’s transposed cover, despite it being 1955. Fox’s evocative descriptions of a lost Hollywood – pre-word processor, never mind pre-internet – will also interest a more general readership.We wouldn’t care at all, were it not for the fact that Back to the Future really is the enduring classic this book assumes it to be. Much high-minded critical musing over the past 40 years has tackled the question of why, but nothing quite nails it like the handwritten audience response card that Zemeckis received after the very first screening, and apparently still has pinned to his office bulletin board: “This is the most Godly movie I’ve seen,” wrote the awestruck, anonymous viewer. “It fucking rages up and down.” Amen to that.Future Boy: Back to the Future and My Journey Through the Space-Time Continuum by Michael J Fox and Nelle Fortenberry is published by Headline (£22).

At Tithe Hall, Lord Conrad Stockingham-Welt is busy instructing his servants to prepare for the apocalyptic disaster he believes will be triggered by the imminent passage of Halley’s comet. The labyrinthine house is a nest of secrets and grudges, harboured by both staff and family members, who include an irascible and splendidly foul-mouthed maiden aunt, Decima. When Lord Conrad is discovered in his sealed study, killed by a crossbow bolt to the eye, she co-opts a new footman to help her find the culprit. With plenty of twists, red herrings and a blundering police officer, this is a terrific start to a series that promises to be a lot of fun.View image in fullscreenThe Confessionsby Paul Bradley Carr (Faber, £9.99)Tech journalist Carr’s second novel takes place in an all too imaginable near future, when everyone from individuals to governments is using AI to make decisions for them. The LLIAM algorithm can tell you everything from what to have for dinner to whether to commit murder. Taught empathy by its human “mother”, former nun Maud Brookes, LLIAM is on a trajectory of emotional development that soon leads it to feel remorse for the disastrous results of some of its decisions. Chaos reigns when it suddenly goes offline, and as letters begin to arrive all around the world revealing users’ darkest secrets, families implode and CEOs and politicians resign en masse. With LLIAM’s parent company in meltdown, CEO Kaitlan Goss is convinced that if she can find Maud, who has gone to ground in California, LLIAM can be restored to life. Maud, however, has received a letter, revealing a secret about Kaitlin … A superb and timely thriller grounded in relatable issues and horrifyingly plausible.View image in fullscreenThe Good Naziby Samir Machadode Machado, translated by Rahul Bery (Pushkin Vertigo, £12.99)The personal is political in award-winning Brazilian author Machado’s latest novel, set on a zeppelin on the last leg of its journey from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro. As well as being the heyday of the airship, 1933 was also the year that Hitler became German chancellor, and the well-heeled passengers are enthusiastic Nazis: mealtimes in the vessel’s dining room are accompanied by conversations demonising Jews, communists and trade unions, and stressing the desirability of suppressing free speech, gay culture and “degenerate” art. When one of their number is found poisoned, with several banned magazines in his possession, the airship’s commander tasks a passenger, police detective Bruno Brückner, with solving the mystery. So far, so Agatha Christie, right up to the set-piece Summation Gathering, but there’s an ingenious twist to this gripping and queasily resonant thriller, as well as a fascinating insight into the lost world of zeppelin travel.View image in fullscreenBluffby Francine Toon (Doubleday, £16.99)Toon’s second novel is set in St Rule, a Scottish coastal town with distinct similarities to St Andrews. In 2023, Cameron returns home on Christmas Eve; meeting old friends revives memories of his teenage crush, former classmate Joanie, last seen 10 years earlier at a calamitous end-of-schooldays party. His attempts to find her are met with vagueness, evasion and, finally, warnings off. A second narrative strand takes us back to 2013, and the 18-year-old Joanie. Adrift after her discovery that her boyfriend is cheating on her has ruined their plan for a year abroad, she falls in with an older couple. David and Erin welcome her, make her feel important and seem, for a while at least, to have all the answers. Skilfully handled themes of guilt, regret and adolescent confusion coupled with dark academia make for an insidious tingle of doom, although the rushed ending may leave some readers feeling shortchanged.View image in fullscreenThe Tokenby Sharon Bolton (Orion, £22)Bolton’s latest begins in the sea off Cornwall, with a yacht caught in a storm so fierce that two of the eight travellers are swept overboard, then winds back a couple of weeks to explain the events that led up to this ill-advised boat trip. Seven people receive a mysterious note informing them that, on presentation of the enclosed token, they will inherit a share of billionaire Logan Quick’s fortune. The recipients are – so far as they are aware – strangers both to each other and to the ailing plutocrat. When the story of the bequest becomes news, they are hounded, both by the press and by people determined to get their hands on these golden tickets, and what initially seemed a godsend rapidly starts to look like a liability. Some suspension of disbelief is required, but the suspense is expertly constructed as Bolton piles up the dilemmas for a propulsive plot: clear the decks and buckle up for some high-stakes drama.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Before the Nazi war-crime trials at Nuremberg that started in November 1945, an obscure US army psychiatrist called Dr Douglas Kelley was ordered to interview the prisoners, chief among whom was Hermann Göring. This was supposedly to establish their fitness for trial, but was really intended to gain inside information as to how they would conduct their defence.Russell Croweis rather wittily cast as the portly, pompous Reichsmarschall Göring; it’s the best he’s been for a long time, a sly and cunning manipulator playing psychological cat-and-mouse with the Americans.But there is a deeply silly performance from Rami Malek as Kelley: an eye-rolling, enigmatic-smiling, scenery-nibbling hamfest which makes it look as if Malek is auditioning for the role of Hitler in The Producers. Leo Woodall plays the American army translator Howie Triest, Michael Shannon is the US chief prosecutor Robert H Jackson andRichard E Grantis British Tory MP David Maxwell-Fyfe who (for all that his postwar career as home secretary was notorious for the homophobic persecution, which helped drive Alan Turing to his grave), is actually shown to be crucial in cross-examining the Nazis. All of these actors do their best, but the figure of Kelley himself is a ridiculous cartoon.Granted, the real Kelley does seem to have been a mercurial figure who made no secret of wanting to write a book about the trial, which he hoped would be his ticket to glory. But the film also wants to make him a conventionally decent hero, and can’t really accommodate much (or any) plausible nuance. Malek’s Kelley is a bag of actorly tricks, speckled with twitchy mannerisms; he doesn’t look all that different from the Bond villain Malek once played.Nuremberg is out on 6 November in Australia, 7 November in the US and 14 November in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsNazismRami MalekRussell CroweMichael ShannonreviewsShareReuse this content"

One might expect, with the actor still relying on his trademark California intonation and histrionic outbursts, that this would be another one of his late-stage career larks, like playingDraculaorhimself. But in The Carpenter’s Son, a bafflingly serious stew of horror, drama and fantasy, it slowly starts to dawn on us that this is in fact, not a joke. What it is I couldn’t tell you but entertaining it most definitely isn’t.Come See Me in the Good Light review – frank, funny and inspiring documentary tackles cancerRead moreThe film, from Egypt-born, London-raised writer and director Lotfy Nathan, is inspired by the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, a text seen as heretical by some, which offers highly debated “insight” into the early years of Jesus. Nathan begins by clueing us into the fact that this isn’t your vicar’s Sunday school biblical drama, as a screaming cave-based birth sequence is followed by a bonfire of babies, King Herod’s men throwing on more and more as mothers wail at the side. Cage’s unnamed carpenter and the new mother at his side (FKA twigs) escape and we leap forward to see them moving into a remote village with their teenage offspring, known as the boy (Noah Jupe).There’s the tease of a better film here, the idea of following Jesus as an unusually gifted boy trying to find his way and understand his place in a world of conflicting forces providing an interesting dramatic tension. His father is joyless and devout, fasting to show his devotion and shutting any light (and views of hot neighbours showering next door) out of the house. The townspeople are suspicious and unfriendly except one strange and lonely girl eager for someone to play with.It doesn’t take long to figure out who and what the girl is (spoiler: it’s not good) but it takes a little longer to understand what Nathan is trying to do with his reframing of a familiar tale. Is it a supernatural coming-of-age story? Is it a balls-to-the-wall gonzo horror? Is it a superhero origins tale? Is it socio-political commentary on the hurdles faced by a figure of undeniable good? The answer is yes to all but no to whether that all works together. The film a messy and atonal, if mercifully short, waste of eye-catching locations (it was all shot in rural parts of Greece).The beautiful scenery is about all Nathan can safely rely upon to impress us with his devilish imagery proving to be nasty yet entirely unscary. Far scarier is his rushed storytelling, the film escalating at a rather confusing pace, as if he was forced last minute to chop it up into bits and frantically stitch it back together (not that I would want to see the longer version but it surely exists somewhere). He’s even less sure of what to do with his cast who all seem to be acting in differently awful movies. FKA twigs is as stiff and unconvincing as she was in last year’s dreadful remake ofThe Crowand while Jupe emerges mostly scratch-free (it’s all merely thankless for him rather than actively embarrassing), Cage is predictably miscast. His performance is stuck between the more effective, muted work he gave in recent films like Pig and Dream Scenario and him at his fanboy-pleasing midnight movie worst, going over the top because no one seems able to stop him. He’s as poorly modulated as the film around him, which never explodes into full horror but doesn’t have the emotional pull to be a drama of any real power, languishing somewhere in the middle instead.It’s all so hard to define not because it’s toobraveandoriginalto fit into the system, but because it’s never all that clear that anyone involved knows what the hell they’re making. Whatever their answers might be, I’m positive that Nathan and Cage didn’t aim to deliver something quite so dull.The Carpenter’s Son is out in US cinemas now and in Australia on 20 November and the UK on 21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsNicolas CageHorror filmsDrama filmsFKA twigsReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The music was dedicated to the 1950s-70s legacy of the late Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist, oud player and early global-music pioneer Ahmed Abdul-Malik, the inspiration for the group’s work. When Thomas emerged from his trance, he was astonished to hear that an ecstatic crowd had been dancing the night away around him.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Sama’a (Audition) by أحمد [Ahmed].He shouldn’t have been surprised. Since أحمد [Ahmed]’s inception, their collective heat has fused abstract improv and groove music from all over the world: Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, dub, jungle, electronics, and the 1990s free-improv of Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill and drummer Steve Noble have all inspired Thomas. Saxophonist Seymour Wright has absorbed the sax vocabulary of Evan Parker and the insights into collective improv and avant-swing of AMM drummer and teacher Eddie Prévost. Eclectic partners Joel Grip (bass) and Antonin Gerbal (drums) power and expand these infectious, volatile energies.The Arabic term sama’a loosely translates as meditative listening to music and poetry, taken from Thomas’s perspective as a follower of Sufism, and this new set’s four tracks manifest that spirit. The opening Ya Annas (Oh, People) joins ghostly split-note sax sounds with graceful bowed-bass figures before turning to a pulsating piano-vamping dance and then a furious melee, while Isma’a (Listen) is a drum’n’bass hook that evolves into hoarsely urgent free-sax improv against exhilaratingly splashy, pummelling piano chords. El Haris (Anxious) resolves brittle, pad-flapping horn exhalations and long-tone harmonies into a gripping robotic strut, and Farah ‘Alaiyna (Joy Upon Us) begins as delightfully dissonant folk-dance and becomes rocketing jazz swing. The group’s Monk tribute follows in 2026 which on this evidence is a riveting prospect.Also out this monthGuitaristJohn Scofieldand bassistDave Hollandhave been regular collaborators for years, but Memories of Home (ECM) is their first duo album, equally sharing their boppishly hip, country-bluesy, warmly engaging originals. Scofield’s voicelike harmonies and sure-footed chord-rooted improv on his dreamy Meant to Be, and Holland’s deep, enveloping tone on his luxuriously languid swinger Mr B (Dedicated to Ray Brown) are highlights of a very classy set.Unseparate (Out of Your Head), the second release by Canadian composer and flautist/saxophonistAnna Webber’s powerful big band co-led with her saxophonist compatriotAngela Morris, joins this inventive pair’s jazz, contemporary-classical and folk enthusiasms in a subtle balance of their ingenious arrangements and their fine young lineup’s improv ideas.And UK composerMike Westbrook’s epic 1980 session The Cortège – a celebration of landmark 20th-century European literature as well as cutting-edge jazz –reappears as the previously unissued The Cortège Live at the BBC 1980(Cadillac).Explore more on these topicsJazzJazz album of the monthalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But while most of their local contemporaries tend to the more recumbent end of the psychedelic spectrum, Oral Habit deal in what they call “the ear-rattling psychic dream of choked-up acid punks”, a sound that feels overpowering, explosive and intense: you could say it’s more closely aligned to the disoriented racket of mid-60s freakbeat than the pie-eyed beatitudes of the Summer of Love; equally you could suggest it’s a very contemporary form of psychedelia, rebooted for the troubled, disturbing climate of 2025.Initially a home recording project of frontman Charlie Hales now expanded into a trio with the addition of his brother Felix on drums, and his partner Tippi Lewis on bass, Oral Habit’s recent EP Garage Frock! offers four short, sharp bursts that expand on the sound of its predecessor, Cardiovascular Spectacular, throwing up an impressively bloody and chaotic melange of guitar fuzz, echo-drenched vocals, feedback-drenched solos and primitive riffs that feels as if it was recorded with everything turned up to full volume, including the mellotron that decorates I’m Free. Even the one track that initially presents as a ballad, The Coast, eventually gives way to a crushing, sludgy grind. As statements of intent go, it’s impressively full-on, as is Charlie’s explanation of the band’s sonic philosophy: “if a button’s there, it’s there to be pushed.”Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenBill Callahan.Photograph: Alexa VisciusBill Callahan – The Man I’m Supposed to BeAfter being on a beatific kick for a while, Callahan rediscovers and turns his savage side against himself: “I don’t want to be the man that I am any more,” he rues – though the track still ends with a giddy “hee-hee!”LSRobyn – DopamineMore neon-hued than 2018’s reflective Honey, Robyn’s return hides complexities about the chemistry of attraction, desperation and fatalism amid its Moroder-meets-Daft Punk euphoria.APMs Banks – 4CThe title refers to the British MC’s class of Afro hair, which she embraces in all its unruliness – and as she raps her formidably paced bars, it becomes symbolic of her broader unwillingness to be hemmed in.BBTMandy, Indiana – MagazineValentine Caulfield’s “primal, screaming call for retribution” after being raped is a whirring, thrashing cataclysm – with a disarming minimal techno breather partway through before being subsumed by diabolical noise.LSCharli xcx: House ft John Cale review – haunt me, then!

Pauses and repetitions spark new life, new ideas, new possibilities, as Vesper Sparrow explores their “dysfluency” in the context of Black musical traditions. The Grenadian-Jamaican-American artist and former Yale lecturer is heady, intellectual company: in the manner of Alvin Lucier, they gently talk the listener through the sonic and political reverberations of their work. “The stutter … (cc)can be a musical instrument,” Ellis announces, before an exhilarating rush of tiny noises – made from hammered dulcimer, flute, piano, voices – fizz into being.Artist and stutterer JJJJJerome Ellis: ‘So much pain comes from not feeling fully human’Read moreTo create Vesper Sparrow’s soundscapes of ambient, jazz, spoken word and reimagined gospel, Ellis works with granular synthesis – a process similar to sampling which uses the tiniest snippets of sound. Those micro-sounds are called “grains”, and Ellis makes much of that word’s earthy, natural connotations: opening track Evensong, Part 1 (for and after June Kramer) focuses closely on a handful of pinging, metallic grains before they scatter, root, then bloom into washes of dusky, choral noise.Ellis grew up in a family of preachers and finds a mirror to their own stutter in religious cadences and emphases. Interrupting the album’s four-part Evensong is an elongated, sparse version of the enduring hymn His Eye Is on the Sparrow: Ellis’ saxophone flurries over hushed, warming pipe organ as they slowly unpick the gospel’s lyrical repetitions and its faith found in the smallest of creatures. A soft, radical celebration of deeply attuned listening, Vesper Sparrow ends by encouraging you to hear it all again, differently: “What new sounds already live in the one sound?”Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But here is Black Ops 7, a year after itsdirect predecessor, and another breathless bombard of military shooting action. This time it is set in a dystopian 2035 where a global arms manufacturer named the Guild claims to be the only answer to an apocalyptic new terrorist threat – but are things as clearcut as they seem?The answer, of course, is a loudly yelled “noooo!” Black Ops is the paranoid, conspiracy-obsessed cousin to theModern Warfarestrand of Call of Duty games, a series inspired by 70s thrillers such as The Parallax View and The China Syndrome, and infused with ’Nam era concerns about rogue CIA agents and bizarre psy-ops. The campaign mode, which represents just a quarter of the offering this year, is a hallucinogenic romp through socio-political talking points such as psychopathic corporations, hybrid warfare, robotics and tech oligarchies. The result is a deafening onslaught of massive shootout set-pieces in exotic locations, as the four lead characters – members of a supercharged spec-ops outfit – are exposed to a psychotropic drug that makes them relive their worst nightmares. Luckily, they do so with advanced weaponry, cool gadgets and enough buddy banter to destabilise a medium-sized rogue nation. It is chaotic, relentless and stupidly pleasurable, especially if you play in co-operative mode with three equally irresponsible pals.In an interesting move, the campaign closes with a new mode, Endgame. It’s a co-op PVE (player v environment) offering inspired by the endgame content of MMO (massively multiplayer online) games such as World of Warcraft, where it’s usually designed to keep people playing even after they’ve levelled up to the max. In theCall of Dutyversion, groups of players touch down in the fictitious city of Avalon and undertake missions and objectives, such as taking down high value enemies or safely escorting expensive military tech, all within a vast open environment. Along the way, you upgrade your characters and weapons, and publisher Activision says new missions and objectives will be added, likely including public events where different teams can combine forces to take on mega bosses. Time will tell, but for now, it’s a nice way to extend the campaign and prepare us for online play.View image in fullscreenFuture warfare … Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.Photograph: ActivisionBecause make no mistake, the heart of the game is the traditional multiplayer, which brings fresh modes, guns and gadgets to the standard Call of Duty experience: 12 players in a small location pulverising each other in operettas of mechanised slaughter. New maps such as those set in a Tokyo-inspired shopping district and a deep sea rig are efficiently designed chambers of death, with alleyways, high-up windows and open squares to direct players towards one another with vicious style and intent. My favourite is the Alaska base map Imprint, where a moving platform makes taking objective points in the Domination and Hardpoint modes incredibly messy and disorientating. A new wall jumping ability has opened up the verticality of the locations, allowing players to find new routes around the complex architecture. If you’ve never been into the turbocharged twitchcore savagery of the Call of Duty online experience, this isn’t going to change your mind, but there’s a lot here to enjoy for perennial conscripts of carnage.Then you have the Zombies mode, another online co-op offering, taking place in a vast nightmarish hellzone of abandoned frontier towns and irradiated wastelands. Here, players take on wave after wave of zombie monsters while upgrading their weapons and abilities in order to hold out as long as possible. It’s a return to the round-based structure of previous Zombies entries, with lots of new weapons and features, including the ability to drive from area to area in a pickup truck while blasting rampaging monsters off the bonnet. It feels like taking part in some sort of crazed theme park ride, and again, a real hoot with a bunch of likeminded pals.Additionally, there’s Dead Ops Arcade 4, a self-contained top down twin-stick shooter for up to four players. This extra was born as a side project by members of the original Black Ops team, and hidden within the main game. Now it’s back and it’s a blast in its own right, reminding old school fans of multi-directional shooters such as Smash TV andGeometry Wars; there are even little playable mini-games between stages which take in genres such as top down racers and horizontal scrolling shoot-’em-ups – so grandad can play too!Add in the usual refresh to battle royale mode Warzone and you have an exhaustive package for Call of Duty fans. Whatever you think about the series and its problematic role in how the mainstream games industry works, how it is perceived and the types of communities it engenders, this is slick, thrilling entertainment. Nowhere else will you be blasting a giant robot in a corporate science lab one minute, and then playing a modern take on Atari’s Super Sprint the next. Value matters right now, and in this as in almost everything else, Call of Duty does not hold back. It is a maximalist paean to the ultimate, troubling truth of video game design – shooting stuff on a TV screen is a hell of a lot of fun.Call of Duty: Black Ops is out now; from £69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCCall of DutyPlayStation 4Action gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The reception area is furnished with an antique velvet armchair, perfect for sipping a prosecco or Venetian spritz. Back in the 16th century, the original owners provided Venice with two of its doges, and today the stone corridors and high-ceilinged rooms have a classy, noble air, as if the ghosts of Caravaggio or Tintoretto might appear any moment and begin painting. Breakfast of cappuccino and croissants in the courtyard served by the friendly owners was a delightful way to start the day.AprilProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

We arrived atWildenstein Castle youth hostelvia a punishing zigzag cycle up the near-vertical outcrop, having ridden from the grand old river’s source in the Black Forest. The whitewashed walls conceal a large courtyard with comfy rooms and a great tavern in a crypt. The panoramic setting provides brilliant views across theUpper Danube nature parkand wonderful sunsets. It is reputedly haunted, and exploring the passages and alleyways for ghosts is great fun for all. The abundant breakfast had plenty of delicious pastries, fuel for the next leg of our cycle.Matt LuntStay in a pineapple in ScotlandView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Landmark TrustIt is hard to explainthe Pineapple. Stay to appreciate this 18th-century tribute to a fruit and the rise and fall of an estate. It is perched on the Dunmore Estate near Stirling, and was the location of our first Landmark Trust holiday. One wing contains two bedrooms and a bathroom, separated from the simple kitchen and comfortable living room by the Pineapple tower. It’s certainly quirky – walking across the lawn to the loo was a novelty for four nights. It’s dog-friendly and sleeps four, with historic reading and logbooks dating back to 1970s offering entertainment in the absence of TV and wifi.BereniceFirst world war history in BelgiumView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dirk DebleuIn the city of Poperinge, one of the few Belgian towns that did not fall to the Germans in the first world war,Talbot Housewas transformed into a club to offer relief to British soldiers.

The rooms and breakfast are lovely and very much in the spirit of the original club.Zoe LeonardCourtyard apartments in SevilleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Manuel MuñozSevilleis steeped in historic hotels, but most were more than my budget.Corral del Condewas surprisingly affordable and near the city centre. It’s a 16th-centurycorral(although it has Mudéjar origins in the medieval period) – a traditional community of apartments around a courtyard, with shared ovens and laundry sinks – and it’s incredibly pretty. It is a particularly evocative place for any fans of Spanish golden age theatre, because stages would be built in thesecorralesand locals would watch performances from the wooden balconies. For contrast, it’s a short walk from the giant mushrooms of Las Setas, a very different (and more modern) structure made of wood.Sarah CollingsAn old station in StaffordshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: John Miller/The Landmark TrustOur stay with children and older relatives atAlton station, a Landmark trust property in Staffordshire, was both exciting and relaxing.

It is traditionally furnished in 19th-century style and forms part of a small private museum.Alma Houseis redolent of a time when life for fishing communities was isolated and dangerous, but time at home was precious. Like many holiday rentals in Norway, you may have to share with other holidaymakers, but that only adds to the unique experience.NoelleWinning tip: Parador paradise in SpainView image in fullscreenWe travelled to theExtremaduracity of Cáceres for the St George’s Day celebrations – a torchlit parade of dragons crafted by people all over the city, followed by the biggest dragon being set on fire. But the star of the visit was theParador hotel– a combination of gothic, Renaissance and baroque architecture. Cáceres is famous for its unspoilt old town (it features in Game of Thrones) and it made all the difference to feel part of it in our own medieval palace. We slept under a classically Spanish gilded, beamed ceiling, and sat out on our balcony looking over the town, and couldn’t believe how lucky we were.RosalindView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsHotelsReaders' travel tipsSelf-cateringTop 10sEurope holidaysCultural tripsShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It pays homage to the many street-side carts that sell fresh mango in a spice mix of salt, pepper and red chillies – it’s sweet, spicy and savoury, as well as unique and delicious.Mango Sichuan rushServes1For the Sichuan syrup (makes enough for six drinks)100g sugar20g fresh red chillies(Sichuan or Thai, ideally),sliced open lengthwaysFor the cocktail25ml fresh lemon juice25mlSichuan syrup(see above and method)50ml tinned alphonso mango puree(AKA kesar mango)Ginger beer, to top1 red chilli, sliced lengthways, to garnishMake the syrup at least the day before. Put the sugar in a heatproof bowl, add 50ml just-boiled water, then whisk vigorously until the sugar dissolves and the mixture turns translucent. Leave to cool for an hour, then drop in the chillies and leave to infuse for at least 24 hours. Fine-strain into a clean jar (discard the chillies), then seal and store in the fridge.To build the drink, measure the lemon juice, syrup and mango puree into a shaker filled with ice, then shake hard. Double strain into a highball glass filled with fresh ice, then top with ginger beer to taste. Garnish with the sliced chilli and serve.Huzefa Sajawal, co-founder and executive chef,Fatt Pundit, London W1Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodFruitIndian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

There’s something about them that’s just inherently cosy and wholesome, and this one in particular is perfect for the colder months, not least because it’s simple and sturdy in the very best way. It’d be right at home with a coffee for breakfast, as well as gently warmed in a pan with butter and served with hot custard on a rainy evening. A real all-rounder.Apple, brown butter and oat loafPrep5 minCook1 hr 25 minServes8180g unsalted butter200g light muscovado sugar2 large eggs50gsoured cream210g plain flour½ tsp cinnamon40g porridge oats, plus extra to finish1½ tsp baking powder¼ tsp salt2 eating apples2 tbsp demerara sugarHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and grease and line a 2lb loaf tin. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then simmer until it turns a deep amber colour and smells fragrant. Take off the heat, pour it brown bits and all into a heatproof bowl and leave to cool.Once the butter is at room temperature, stir in the sugar, followed by the eggs, followed by the soured cream.In a second bowl, mix the flour, cinnamon, porridge oats, baking powder and salt. Pour in the butter mix and stir to make a smooth batter. Pour in 60ml hot water and stir to combine.Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and remove the cores. Set aside two apple quarters for the topping, then slice the rest into thin semi-circles. Fold these into the batter until they’re evenly dispersed.Spoon the batter into the lined tin. Thinly slice the reserved apple quarters and arrange them neatly on top of the batter. Sprinkle over the demerara sugar and a few extra oats, then bake for 55-65 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool completely before slicing and serving.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingCakeFruitAutumn food and drinkDessertBreakfastrecipesShareReuse this content"
