But they will still tighten eligibility criteria for the benefit under big changes to be set out by the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, on Tuesday.The Resolution Foundation thinktank warned that cutting Pip by £5bn in 2029-30 by raising the qualifying threshold for support could mean about 620,000 people lose £675 a month on average. It said 70% of these cuts would be concentrated on those families in the poorest half of the income distribution.The sweep of the cuts has greatly alarmed disability rights campaigners as well as Labour MPs, who have been lobbying No 10 this week to change course. But plans tofreeze increases in Pip payments are now unlikely– a measure that would have required a parliamentary vote.Cabinet ministers are among those who have raised doubts about the scale of the cuts and private fears about how No 10 has handled the messaging.There is also widespread concern among MPs about reported plans to cut – or potentially freeze – the top rate of benefits for disabled people who are unable to work, though that may be mitigated by a rise in universal credit for those seeking or in work.Ministers are motivated to equalise the incomes of people seeking work with people unable work, aiming to address what it perceives as an incentive to be permanently signed-off sick, which can result in an income twice as high as those of jobseekers.But MPs who spoke to the Guardian said it appeared “perverse” to target those who were not in work, likely to include the most severely disabled and vulnerable in society within its scope.The bulk of the expected £5bn to £6bn in cuts will come from making it tougher to qualify for Pip – a key disability benefit not linked to work – which is likely to deny payments to many with conditions such as autism.Despite the widespread backlash, scope for further change is now unlikely. The green paper outlining the measures will be released on Tuesday and the Treasury has now submitted its final “major measures” to the Office for Budget Responsibility – including the welfare reforms – to allow the budget watchdog to score the measures in its report before the government’s spring statement at the end of March.The Resolution Foundation said it predicted the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was now on course for a budget deficit of about £4.4bn due to weaker growth, interest rates and lower tax revenues, having previously estimated £9.9bn in headroom in 2029-30.The thinktank’s research director, James Smith, said the jobs market was in “recession territory”, which would hinder the government’s hopes of getting more disabled people into work or taking on more hours.“Crucially, she should avoid turning the spring statement into a ‘sticking plaster’ budget, with long-term thinking on welfare reform undermined by the quest for short-term savings that could cause real harm,” Smith said.Kendall is to set out a plan with a number of mitigations that she hopes will assuage the fears of disabled claimants andLabourMPs. The work and pensions secretary will promise a “right to try” guarantee for those currently on benefits to take on work but return to previous benefits if the job does not work out, without having to go through a gruelling reassessment process.She will also retain £1bn of the planned savings to reinvest in back-to-work schemes, which Kendall has promised will be locally tailored and include an overhaul of jobcentre help and support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another said they had been contacted by constituents in despair at what might be coming. “We all get the case for reform, but we can also see that some of these cuts don’t actually seem to be targeted at the areas most in need of reform.”A number of MPs have stressed to Downing Street this week that they can under no circumstances back the changes in a parliamentary vote, with some Labour constituencies having up to one in five people receiving Pip.Senior Labour figures who have raised alarm at the plans have pointed the finger at the chancellor, claiming she was boxed in by fiscal rules meaning she could not raise taxes to combat the worsening economic climate.Treasury sources denied that Reeves was the one pushing the welfare department to go further and that the main shape of the changes has been sketched out over the past year, since before Labour came to power.Kendall will outline plans for the changes on Tuesday, but it will be Reeves who will lay out the extent of the planned savings and mitigations in the spring statement on 26 March.Speaking on Sunday, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the changes would ensure the welfare state was “a springboard back to work and lots of people get written off if they can’t contribute when they can and should and want to”.But he refused to be drawn on the details of the changes, saying those who were concerned should wait to see the specifics. “You’ve seen the briefing, you’ve seen the speculation. I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityBenefitsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Thai authorities then discovered Clarke was missing.Capt Natthaphon Sinpoonphon, the deputy director of the Thai Maritime Enforcement Command Centre of Surat Thani, said the boat was between five and six nautical miles away from the island when a fire started in the engine room and “spread through the boat rapidly”.He said: “Preliminary reports indicate that the engine room, captain’s cabin and rear restroom were damaged. The exact cause of the fire remains under investigation.”It is understood rescue teams were initially unable to get close to the boat because of the flames, as there were fears of further explosions from fuel onboard the vessel.Sinpoonphon said: “The search is continuing for one missing tourist, a female, Alexandra Clarke, from the United Kingdom.“The conditions at sea are dangerous with the wind and currents. All boats in the area have been notified. Search and rescue teams were immediately mobilised.”A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British woman who is missing in Thailand and are in contact with local authorities.”Avideo shared on social mediashowed the boat engulfed in flames.The Davy Jones Locker was reportedly transporting tourists from Koh Tao, a small island that forms part of the Chumphon Archipelago, to a nearby diving site at South-west Pinnacle.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Over 155 were injured, many critically.The premises had previously served as a carpet warehouse in Kočani, a town about 60 miles (97km) east of the capital, Skopje. Press reports described it as an “improvised nightclub”.Map showing location of Kočani in North MacedoniaThe prime minister, Hristijan Mickoski, said the loss of so many young lives was “irreparable”. “All competent forces will do whatever is necessary to address the consequences and determine the causes of this tragedy,” he promised earlier on Sunday.The fire, thought to have been triggered by the use of special-effects pyrotechnic devices, erupted at about 2.35am local time (1.35am GMT). Some of those taken to medical facilities were as young as 14. Pictures showed the club’s corrugated iron roof burnt through and collapsed in places, its interior wooden beams exposed and blackened.Marija Taseva, 22, told Reuters: “When the fire broke out, everyone started screaming and shouting: ‘Get out, get out.’” As she tried to escape, Taseva fell to the ground and people trod on her, injuring her face. In the crush, she lost contact with her sister, who did not make it out. “My sister died,” Taseva said, breaking into tears.“It’s hard to believe how this happened,” the country’s president, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, told distraught parents gathered outside a hospital in the capital. “We must give these young people courage to continue.” Dressed in black and fighting tears, she said authorities were ready to do everything to help all those affected.View image in fullscreenPolice officers at the site of the blaze in Kočani.Photograph: Visar Kryeziu/APMedical officials said many people had suffered severe burns and carbon monoxide poisoning and that plans were under way to transport the critically wounded to specialised hospitals acrossEurope. Dr Kristina Serafimova, the head of Kočani general hospital, told reporters that at least 10 were on respirators and fighting for their lives. It was the biggest loss of life in the country of 1.8 million people since the early 1990s.The rightwing nationalist-led government, which was returned to power last year, moved quickly to detain suspects.Initial reports suggested about 1,500 clubgoers were crammed into the discotheque to watch the popular hip-hop band DNK – a number far exceeding the venue’s capacity. The club had only one exit and a lack of fire extinguishers, according to local media outlets.One young person who was attending the concert told local media: “The fire started around 2.30am. The sparklers that were on stage ignited the styrofoam on the ceiling. I heard an explosion and the roof collapsed. We all rushed to get out – we all ran towards one door that was for both entry and exit.”View image in fullscreenPeople in Kočani light candles on Sunday night in memory of the victims.Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/ReutersVisiting the site early on Sunday, Toshkovski said the blaze was probably caused by pyrotechnic devices “used for lighting effects at the concert”. As they were set off, “the sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke”, he told reporters.The government said it would immediately step up inspections of nightclubs and similar venues to ensure they complied with international safety regulations. “The most important thing is to find out all the facts and evidence necessary for the follow-up measures,” Toshkovski said. “We must remain calm while taking all these steps so that something like this doesn’t happen again.”Images on social media showed chaotic scenes as the fire broke out and the band’s singer urged the audience to vacate the premises as quickly as possible. Serafimova attributed the deaths to the panic-stricken crush that ensued, as well as smoke inhalation and burns. Among the injured were musicians in the eight-member band, DNK’s manager said.Branko Gerovski, a veteran journalist in Skopje, said: “In a country as small as ours, and with the death toll likely to rise, the impact has been huge. We haven’t seen anything like this since the devastating air crashes in Macedonia in 1993. Everyone feels very emotional. They can relate to this because everyone’s kids go to nightclubs.”Neighbouring countries including Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria and Albania were quick to offer assistance. Senior European Union officials also expressed their condolences, while the Vatican said Pope Francis sent prayers to the victims and survivors of the fire.Explore more on these topicsNorth MacedoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He declined to confirm when asked whether Putin’s demands included the surrender of Ukrainian forces in Kursk; international recognition of Ukrainian territory seized by Russia as Russian; limits on Ukraine’s ability to mobilize; a halt to western military aid; and a ban on foreign peacekeepers.Putin said on Thursday that he supported a truce but outlined numerous details that need to be negotiated before the deal can be completed. The Russian president said he was open to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US but offered vague terms for his support, raising questions about what the Kremlin wants.The big question on Ukraine: is Trump ready to push Putin into peace? | Shaun WalkerRead moreWitkoff declined to describe Russian terms. He said US envoys “had narrowed the differences” between Ukraine and Russian negotiators, and he would meet Trump on Sunday to discuss “how to narrow the differences even further”.The discussions, Witkoff added, included Ukraine, Russia and European stakeholder countries including France, Britain, Norway and Finland, as well as other elements “that would be encompassed in a ceasefire”.Trump, he said, was being updated about the discussions as they happened. “He is involved with every important decision here and I expect that there will be a call between the [US and Russian] presidents this week.”Witkoff also said the US was continuing to engage and have conversations with Ukraine, and “advising them on everything we’re thinking about”.Ukraine agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire at talks last week in Saudi Arabia, and since his disastrous meeting in the White House a fortnight ago, Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has been trying hard to portray Kyiv as amenable to Trump’s plans, while suggesting Putin is merely playing for time and not serious about negotiating a deal.Zelenskyy has agreed to put discussions of territorial questions and of possible security guarantees on hold until after a ceasefire takes effect and more detailed discussions are held. Previously, he had insisted that a ceasefire would only make sense if western partners would provide Ukraine with some kind of security guarantee.Trump has made it clear that no US guarantees are on the table, while the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, has been attempting to rally a coalition of other western allies to put together a possible peacekeeping contingent that could be deployed to Ukraine after a deal. However, it is not clear that such a mission could function without US backing, and Russian officials have repeatedly ruled out accepting any deal involving western boots on the ground in Ukraine.On Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched more than 1,000 drones and 1,300 guided air bombs on Ukrainian territory over the past week. “This is not what someone who wants a quick end to the war does, so we have to jointly pressure Russia to force it to stop its aggression,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. Ukraine also launched a fresh wave of drone attacks against Russian territory over the weekend.Witkoff said teams of US negotiators would meet with both Russian and Ukrainian officials this week. “As the president said, he really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, and I believe that’s the case,” he said.There have been concerns that the settlement being pushed for by theTrump administrationwould look a lot like an outright Russian victory, at the expense of Ukraine and its allies in Europe.Trump and Putin last week set off further alarm bells in Kyiv by exchanging friendly words, as the new US administration cosies up to Moscow while attackingUkrainewith threatening language and the withdrawal of some military support.Separately, Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told ABC’s This Week that back-and-forth diplomacy was ongoing. Waltz said there would be “some type of territory for future security guarantees, the future status of Ukraine”, and he called permanent Nato membership for Ukraine “incredibly unlikely”.Waltz asked if it was plausible to believe that “we are going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?”He said: “We can talk about what’s right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that’s what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

According to the charity, the Home Office’s effort to clear the asylum backlog, by hiring new caseworkers and shortening initial interviews, has resulted in a rise in errors and omissions.Enver Solomon, the Refugee Council’s chief executive, said more needed to be done to ensure correct first-time decision-making, so a new backlog was not created in a different part of the system.“Resolving asylum cases well will help reduce costs and the number of people trapped in limbo, stuck in hotels unable to work or move on with their lives. The use of hotels in communities across the country has become a damaging symbol of government failure and a flashpoint for community tensions. There needs to be a clear plan to stopping the use of hotels by the end of this year,” he said.The Guardian view on Labour and asylum: in retreat from decency | EditorialRead moreAt the end of 2024, there were 38,079 people being accommodated in hotels by theHome Office, official figures show. The Refugee Council estimates that if those numbers were to remain the same throughout 2025, the annual cost could reach nearly £1.5bn.Asylum decision-makers have blamed rules introduced by Rishi Sunak for an increase in asylum appeals.In a rush to fulfil a pledge to clear 90,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023, the former prime minister introduced rules to shorten the training period for staff and gave them a two-hour limit for interviews.More claims are also being refused since the introduction by the previous Conservative government of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which increased the standard of proof for refugee status.Ashortage of immigration lawyersis adding to lengthy delays to the outcome of asylum appeals. This has led to many cases being adjourned or individuals deciding to represent themselves, which typically makes a hearing six times longer than one with legal representation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stop killing of Yemeni people,” he said in a post on X early on Sunday.Washington has already increased sanctions pressure on Iran whiletrying to bring it to the negotiating tableover its nuclear programme.

The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea. They could continue for weeks, one Pentagon official said.The Houthis are seen as key actors in the “axis of resistance”, a loose regional coalition of militant groups built up by Iran over recent years to project force and put pressure on Israel.The group is considered the only member of the coalition not to have been significantly weakened by Israel during the war in Gaza since October 2023 and the short conflict in Lebanon last year. Both Hamas and Hezbollah, once the most powerful member, have suffered significant losses.The Houthis’ political bureau described the attacks as a “war crime”. “Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation,” it said in a statement.Residents in Sana’a said the strikes hit a neighbourhood known to host several members of the Houthi leadership.“The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children,” said one resident, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia.A crane and bulldozer were used to remove debris at one site in the city and people used their bare hands to pick through the rubble. At a hospital, medics treated the injured, including children, and the bodies of several casualties were placed in a yard, wrapped in plastic sheets, Reuters footage showed.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “utmost restraint and a cessation of all military activities” in Yemen. A new escalation could “fuel cycles of retaliation that may further destabilise Yemen and the region, and pose grave risks to the already dire humanitarian situation in the country”, his spokesperson said in a statement.The previous administration in Washington, under Joe Biden, had sought to degrade the Houthis’ ability to attack vessels off Yemen’s coast but had limited US actions.On Tuesday, the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the Bab al-Mandab strait and the Gulf of Aden, ending a period of relative calm starting in January with the Gaza ceasefire.A Pentagon spokesperson said the Houthis had attacked US warships 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023.Reuters andAgence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUS foreign policyDonald TrumpIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I know gay society very, very well, and I think we’re in the greatest danger I have ever seen.”Since his inauguration, Trump has ended policies giving LGBTQ+ Americans protection from discrimination. He has alsorestricted access to gender-affirming healthcare, said the USwould only recognise two sexes, andbarred transgender peoplefrom enlisting in the military.Davies also used his keynote speech at the awards ceremony, which rewards the efforts made to improve the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the UK, to criticise Trump, and the president’s allyElon Musk.“I think times are darkening beyond all measure and beyond anything I have seen in my lifetime,” he told the audience, which included the singers Louise Redknapp and Katy B, and the Traitors contestants Leanne Quigley and Minah Shannon.Davies said he had turned 18 and left home in 1981, adding: “And that is exactly the year that rumours and whispers of a strange new virus came along, which came to haunt our community and to test us in so many ways.”“The joyous thing about this is that we fought back,” he said. The community “militarised, campaigned, marched and demanded the medicine”.He added: “We demanded the science. We demanded the access.”When he wrote the TV seriesQueer As Folkin the late 1990s, he said, it was part of a movement, with writers “fomenting ideas” and putting gay and lesbian characters on screen.Had he been asked to imagine then what life for LGBTQ+ people would be like in 2025, “I want to say it’s going to be all rainbows,” he said, “skipping down the street hand-in-hand, equality, equality, equality.”But the peril the gay community now faced, he said, was even greater than that in the 1980s.“The threat from America, it’s like something at The Lord of the Rings. It’s like an evil rising in the west, and it is evil,” Davies said.“We’ve had bad prime ministers and we’ve had bad presidents before. What we’ve never had is a billionaire tech baronopenly hating his trans daughter,” he added.Musk, the de facto head of the “department of government efficiency”, bought the social networking site Twitter, which he renamedX. A study by the University of California, Berkeley found hate speech on the platform rose by 50% in the months after it was bought by the billionaire.“We have never had this in the history of the world,” Davies said. “It is terrifying because he and the people like him are in control of the facts, they’re in control of information, they’re in control of what people think, and that is what we’re now facing.”But Davies said the gay community would do “what we always do in times of peril, we gather at night”, and would once again come together, and fight against this latest wave of hostility and oppression.“What we will do in Elon Musk’s world, that we’re heading towards, is what artists have always done,” he told the Guardian, “which is to meet in cellars, and plot, and sing, and compose, and paint, and make speeches, and march.”“If we have to be those rebels in basements yet again,” he added, “which is when art thrives, then that’s what we’ll become.”Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsRussell T DaviesEqual marriageGenderTransgenderTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Plans for the new ride were announced in January, prompting fans to travel to the Staffordshire park, eager to be among the first to ride the attraction.View image in fullscreenThe Toxicator ride in action.Photograph: Alton TowersSome queued for more than an hour for the Toxicator, which promises “a fearsome battleground of otherworldly aliens, suspicious scientific experiments and military might”.The ride takes thrillseekers past themed props, including barrels of “toxic waste”. Black and yellow branding outside the attraction warns of an “overhead splash hazard”.It stands higher than 78ft tall and can carry upwards of 500 riders an hour. It is the only “top spin” ride in the world that is elevated above ground level, meaning spectators can watch from below.The rollercoaster king: the man behind the UK’s fastest thrill-rideRead moreMembers of the public posted about the incident on social media platform X, with one writing: “Alton Towers just had a toxic event when their new toxicator ride started spraying raw sewage on to people in the queue.”“Bit too literal on the ‘toxic substance,” another said, while a third wrote the Toxicator was “giving off something extra toxic”.Some said they had seen a brown liquid at the entrance of the ride, sharing pictures and videos on social media showing a grid flooded with murky water.“I know it’s called Toxicator but come on,” one person wrote, sharing a picture of the brown liquid. “The drains have burst and there’s [poo emoji] everywhere.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all he had never even visited the spot, 150 miles away, where the litter addressed to him had apparently been discovered.“I had to check on my phone to see where Welwyn Hatfield is,” said the 82-year-old retired tool maker.The letter from the private litter enforcers stated that if Morton paid the fine within 10 days, it would be reduced to £350. “But the letter was dated December 6th and I only received it on January 6th,” he said. “I only have my pension. I can’t afford that.”Morton emailed a complaint to District Enforcement on 16 January but is still waiting for a response. “It’s cowardly of them not to reply, and unfair, especially when dealing with elderly people who are vulnerable and get worried about such things,” he said.Morton’s is not the only case of apparently unfair fines given for fly-tipping in Welwyn Hatfield. Recently, MP Andrew Lewin held a meeting for 25 local residents, all of whom had tales of their own to relate.The Guardian has spoken to residents issued fines, including a hospice worker issued with two £500 fines for fly-tipping at her daughter’s property.“My daughter had been sectioned after a severe mental health breakdown and was back on day release to get her home ready,” said her mother.“The envelope contained things I’d bought when she was in hospital and given to her. She bought the envelope home and placed it on top of her own bin, which was full.”When the resident complained, the fine was replaced with a warning that if any other litter was found bearing her address in the next 12 months, the original fine would be reinstated – along with the new one.“I’m petrified and furious to have this hanging over me, especially when I did nothing wrong in the first place,” she said.Another mother was issued a fine after her daughter, who lives in supported housing, put an envelope addressed to her mother in her bin.“The envelope was addressed to me because it was a Christmas present that I’d ordered for my daughter, and she’d taken home,” she said. “She put it in her private bin – but the photo sent to us by District Enforcement showed the envelope had somehow jumped out of her bin, walked round the corner and lain down on the floor of a nearby communal bin area.“When I complained, I was emailed an order to attend an interview – held under caution – in three days’ time. If I didn’t attend the meeting, they would take me to court and my non-attendance would be judged against me,” she said.When the resident replied, saying she couldn’t take time off work at such short notice, an automated response said to not expect a response for 10 days. “A week after the meeting I would be penalised for not attending,” she said.“This was in late January and I’m still waiting for a reply. I’ve no idea if the case has been dropped or if this is something I’ve still got to fight”.Other cases include a father, raising his young children alone after the loss of his wife, who was fined and threatened with a criminal record afteran envelope blew out of his bin, and a woman issued with a fine after an envelope was photographed by enforcement officers on her private driveway.Lewin said the council should apologise to residents issued fines that are “awful, disproportionate and unjustified”, often leaving them in “a state of shock”.“I have written to the council more than 30 times on behalf of constituents whom I believe have been wrongly served disproportionate and unjustified fines,” said Lewin.“As has been reported in the Guardian, some of the individual stories are awful and I am calling for the council’s policy to be urgently reviewed,” he said. “I urge the council to apologise to residents for mistakes and ensure this policy is fixed for the future.”The councillor Tony Kingsbury, leader of the opposition at Welwyn Hatfield, has raised concerns several times in council meetings.“Several businesses have been threatened with fines for minor, technical issues related to waste disposal, without warning or time to correct the situation, despite their efforts to act responsibly and in an environmentally-friendly manner,” he said.“Given that District Enforcement is paid based on the fines they issue, with the council also receiving a portion of the revenue, there appears to be an incentive to pursue minor infractions rather than focus on serious environmental offenders, causing significant distress to the community,” he added.The councillor Sandreni Bonfante, executive member for environment at Welwyn Hatfield, said: “I understand that it can be upsetting to receive a fixed-penalty notice (FPN) and, earlier in the year, my cabinet colleagues and I met with District Enforcement to make sure their processes are appropriate and fair. We will continue to review their performance throughout the trial period.”A District Enforcement spokesperson said: “Measures are in place to ensure a thorough review of disputed penalties. A small number of FPNs reviewed have either been rescinded or reissued for lesser offences. We would like to apologise to those individuals for any upset caused.”Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentHertfordshireDerbyshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For me, having my job is more than just earning my wages at the end of the month. It’s my purpose. It’s my sanity, my identity. I add value to society, to the workforce. But you cut my benefit and I can’t do that any more.”View image in fullscreenSteph Hughes: ‘My job is more than just earning my wages.’Photograph: SuppliedThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the welfare cuts are about reforming a system that “discourages people from working” and said his party “believes in the dignity of work”.But many Pip claimants said any cut to the benefit would have the opposite effect, and could force disabled people out of work.The benefit is worth up to £184.30 a week depending on the assessed level of disability, and helps cover the extra living costs for people with a long-term physical or mental health condition.There are suggestions that under proposed changes, only the most severely ­disabled would be entitled to it.Polling by the disability charity Sense found almost two-thirds of disabled people with complex needs who receive Pip would not be able to cope financially without it.Steven Morris, 41, who is deafblind, uses Pip to pay for taxis so he can get out of the house and work in his role as campaigns officer at Sense, as well as paying for physical and mental therapy.View image in fullscreenSteven Morris: I’m being made as a disabled person to feel like a burden.Photograph: Sense“I think it’s no exaggeration to say that it would be life-changing if I didn’t have Pip,” he said. “It would really impact my ability to pay for the therapies that keep me physically and mentally healthy, which in turn would impact my ability to remain in work. And that is obviously at odds with the government’s messaging.”Morris said the language used by government ministers since the welfare cut plans were leaked last week has been hurtful. “I think it’s been an incredibly difficult time,” he said. “I remember austerity. But for me personally, the messaging here feels harsher. Regardless of what actually gets announced, it’s the way that it’s being spun – I’m being made as a disabled person to feel like a burden.”Hughes, who is supported by the charity Scope and works as an appropriate adult helping vulnerable people in times of crisis, also said she was shocked at the way the issue had been handled by the government.“I’ve been aLaboursupporter my whole life,” she said. “But right now, I feel as if they are deserting me. If I can’t trust the Labour government that I have defended and supported since the day I was able to put a tick in a box, what more is there?”“Labour promised to end austerity, but what we are seeing is clearly [that] an end to austerity doesn’t include disabled people,” said Sophia Kleanthous, 32, a disabled rights campaigner who claims Pip to help with transport and basic living costs.View image in fullscreenSophia Kleanthous: Reducing Pip is not going to be the incentive they think it’s going to be.Photograph: Philip Panting PhotographyShe has a chronic illness, mental health conditions and uses a walking stick to get around, but has struggled to get her Pip applications accepted. “It’s already quite a punitive process,” she said. “I was seen as not having any mobility issues at all, and I get the lowest rate.”She highlighted that data from the IFS found that in 2019-20, more than half of people receiving a disability benefit were in the most materially deprived fifth of the population.“Reducing Pip is not going to be the incentive they think it’s going to be to get people into work,” Kleanthous said. “What it’s actually going to do is push people more into poverty, rely more on the NHS, and put even more strain on public services that are already at breaking point.”Ajay Yadav, a 47-year-old IT worker in London, uses his Pip to lease an accessible car, and to pay for extra bills such as charging his wheelchairs and ventilators. He has spinal muscular atrophy, and without Pip he would be “stuck at home”, he said.View image in fullscreenAjay Yadav: This is not going to get people into work, it’s going to isolate them even more.Photograph: Supplied“For many of us, being disabled is hard enough but not being able to get out and socialise or pay bills or live the way you want it, it’s really difficult,” he said.“When you start taking away finances from disabled people, what you’re doing is you are institutionalising them, leaving them trapped in their homes.“It feels like nothing really has changed over the decades. The government still don’t really have a true understanding of what disabled people need. This is not going to get people into work, it’s going to isolate them even more.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her screen credits includeAugust: Osage County,Law & Order: Criminal Intent,Ally McBeal,I, TonyaandBoardwalk Empire. In 2021, she won an Emmy for her role as Lori inMare Of Easttown. She recently played Samantha “Sinatra” Redmond in Disney+ political thrillerParadiseand is now starring as nightclub owner Kate Galloway in BBC One’s period dramaDope Girls. Nicholson recently moved to the UK with her husband, British actor Jonathan Cake, and their two children.YourDope Girlscharacter is loosely based on real-life roaring 20snightclub ownerKate “Ma” Meyrick. What drew you to the role?The story is such a fascinating look at that period. Normally when we see the post-first world war years on screen, the men are returning home, the women are ecstatic and life moves forward. It wasn’t quite as straightforward as that. Women had taken control in the men’s absence. Now they had to readjust or rebel. And I loved playing a gang boss. Who wouldn’t?Did you have your own clubbing days?I sure did. I moved to New York City in 1990 when I was 18. From age 18 to 24, I will admit there were some clubs. New York in the 90s was amazing. I have such fond memories of that time, especially because I got through it! Going out dancing still appeals but now I might have to find one of these daytime raves I keep hearing about.People thought I was related to Jack Nicholson when I was younger. I used to say that if I was, you would have heard about me a long time agoThere’s a scene inDope Girlswhere you’re stuck in a box with a rat. How did shooting that go?Surprising. The idea of rats disgusts me but I met the one we were using beforehand. Her name was Sniffs and she was adorable. She didn’t feel like a rat to me, she felt like sweet little Sniffs. She scampered up and down me. I have a great pic of her standing up on her hind legs on my back. Maybe I should add “rats” to the special skills section of my résumé.We’remidwaythrough the series on BBC One. What we can look forward to?Kate gets even naughtier. She’s eventually nicknamed the Queen of Soho, which is cool. I should go to modern-day Soho and announce myself. Just show up outside the velvet rope and demand to be let in.View image in fullscreenNicholson as Kate Galloway in Dope Girls.Photograph: Kevin Baker/BBCWhat’s it like doing sex scenes nowadays, compared with earlier in your career?Easier. Intimacy coordinators make everything clear and comfortable. A lot of times when you’re watching sex scenes, it feels like people are acting it. It’s fun to bring it alive and make it feel real, rather than an idea of what’s pretty and sexy. I was also relieved that for both my sexy scenes inDope Girls, I didn’t have to actually kiss anyone. I’m not being precious or prudish, I’m just not into that. It feels more intimate somehow.Dope Girlswas your first job since moving to the UK. How are you finding it here?We were previously in California, which was a wonderful place to bring up young children, but the threat of fire was becoming more regular. We were evacuating annually. We’ve moved to the Hampshire countryside. I cook on an Aga. People ride horses past our window. The daffodils are beautiful but your weather is so intense. You Brits talk about it all the time because it would weigh you down if you didn’t.Are you relieved to be out of America since the change in government?There is a sense of relief. We’re not having to deal with the daily oppression of the news and what the current administration are doing. It’s suffocating when you’re there. You can’t look away. During the first Trump presidency, people who didn’t vote for him functioned in a state of shock and trauma for the whole four years. It’s worse now. I feel sad for the country. All that division.View image in fullscreenNicholson, left, as Lori with Kate Winslet as Mare in Mare of Easttown.Photograph: HBOParadiseportrays an impending environmental catastrophe and your character is a powerful tech billionaire with influence over the US president. Was that accidentally timely?I’m sure that’s part of the show’s success. It’s really entertaining and grabbing in its own right, but the state of the world adds a little extra frisson. It resonates with people in a different way right now.DidKate Winsletreally have to talk you into taking the part of her best friend inMare of Easttown?I read the first few episodes and said, “Nah, the priest did it”. But Kate assured me that the last episode would be amazing. I trusted her and she was right. At times I wondered if I was the killer, which annoyed me no end.

The right mattress can markedly improve sleep quality, but switching between them so regularly seemed to feed my insomnia. Then I met the Otty Original Hybrid and I was blissfully dead to the world.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Original Hybrid is the flagship “bed-in-a-box” mattress from UK company OttySleep. It combines thousands of pocket springs with multiple layers of memory foam – some soft, some thumpingly firm – to offer robust ergonomic support without sacrificing comfort. At less than £680 for a double, it’s among the cheapest bed-in-a-box hybrids (meaning a combination of memory foam and springs) you can buy, and after testing several I’m confident that it’s the best buy.The Otty is one of only two mattresses that Itested– along with the more expensiveSimba Hybrid Pro– that resulted in an excellent sleep from night one. After weeks of marvellous kip, a mattress-scoring family session and rigorous lab-style tests later, it replaced the Simba as the mattress I was most reluctant to give up. Here, I explain why.View at OttyHow I testedView image in fullscreenDumbbell weights helped me measure any sinkage of the mattress.Photograph: Jane HoskynI slept on a double Otty Original Hybrid for several weeks, alongside my husband, on our robust slatted wooden bed base. As with all the mattresses I tested, I tracked the Otty’s impact on our sleep quality and other factors, such as body aches, night sweats and disturbances from tossing and turning. I also ran tests to measure factors including sinkage and heat retention, and I enlisted the help of my locally based family to assess its firmness, comfort and value for money.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreen‘At the firmer end of medium firm.’Photograph: Jane HoskynView at OttyThe Original Hybrid is one of Otty’s slate of nine mattresses, all but two of which are hybrids. As with all hybrid mattresses, it combines pocket springs with various densities of foam to strike a balance of support (mainly from springs) and cushioning (mainly from foam). Topping off these layers is a soft cover that you can unzip and machine wash.Prices for the Original Hybrid start at £499.99 for a single and rise to £874.99 for an emperor size (200 x 200cm), with a double costing £674.99 (a double Simba Hybrid Pro is £1,149, although it is on offer for £942.18). Indeed, none of Otty’s mattresses is wildly expensive. The cheapestAura Hybridcosts £474.99 for a double, while the priciest hybrid double is thePure+ Hybrid 4000(£874.99).The Otty was delivered vacuum-shrunk and encased in metres of sturdy plastic to stop it from expandingAt 25cm deep and with six layers, there’s less of the Otty than the 28cm eight-layer Simba Hybrid Pro. Its 2,000 spring count lands midway between the Simba (which has nearly 5,000) and the budget Ikea Valevåg (fewer than 300), although the Otty’s springs are particularly tall at 16cm.The Otty also includes a couple of layers of high-density foam to enhance the support from the springs. Its largest foam layer is a dense base for support and durability, and there’s another robust layer just above the springs to limit bounce and improve motion isolation. Other memory foam layers include a heat-regulating layer below the washable cover, which I found gave the mattress a lovely breathable feel.I’m obsessed with finding the perfect pillow. These six favourites prove there’s one for every sleeperRead moreOtty describes the Original Hybrid as “medium firm”, but that term is a movable feast so I used a set of weights to find out where it really ranked. During my first month of testing, it sank a maximum of 25mm under 7.5kg of weight – closer to the firmest mattress I’ve tested (theOrigin Hybrid Pro, which sank 18mm) than the softest (theEve Wunderflip Hybrid, 40mm). According to that, and the impressions of my family, the Hybrid Pro is at the firmer end of medium firm. All memory foam softens over time, however, so you should rotate the mattress from head to toe once a month to avoid indentations where you sleep. You’re not supposed to flip the mattress.As with all bed-in-a-box mattress companies and their lack of showrooms, you can’t try the Original Hybrid before you buy it. But if it doesn’t hit the spot for you, you have 100 nights to sleep on it (using sheets to protect it) before deciding whether to keep it for good. During that time, Otty will collect it for free and give you a full refund. I tried this service five years ago with an Otty I’d bought, and it worked as promised, no questions asked.You also get a 10-year guarantee that covers manufacturing defects but excludes damage you may have caused by “standing on or jumping on the mattress”. How Otty would know you’d done this, I’m not sure. It makes me wonder about the solidity and durability of a mattress if you’re banned from standing on it, but this is a common warranty condition for hybrids.SpecificationsType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 8/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first 12 months, then every three monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPUR- and Europur-approved for environmental standardsDeliveryView image in fullscreenOtty charges £10 for delivery to a room of your choice.Photograph: Jane HoskynAs with all the mattresses I’ve tested for the Filter, the Otty was packaged and delivered in bed-in-a-box fashion. That means it’s vacuum-shrunk by machines in the factory, encased in metres of sturdy plastic to keep it from expanding, and then delivered to your home in a big cardboard box.Delivery of all my test mattresses was a near-identical experience. The Otty, like most, was handled by third-party couriers (ArrowXL in this case; only the Ikea Valevåg was delivered by a manufacturer-branded team) and took less than a week. I had to be at home, but I was kept fully in the loop by text alerts from Otty the day before and of delivery, with a pleasingly tight two-hour window and a link to track the driver on a map.Ottycharges £10to deliver your mattress to a room of your choice, but I plumped for having it left in the hallway. I then needed my husband’s help to remove the frankly insane amount of packaging (standard for bed-in-a-box mattresses, sadly). Otty does make it easier than most, though, with a special plastic-slicing tool that helps avoid nicking the mattress.I wouldn’t sleep on the expanding Original Hybrid after a few hours as Otty says is possible – it just won’t be comfortable – but ours had fully expanded after about a day and a half. This was faster than the more sumptuous Simba and slower than the cheaper pocket-sprung Ikea Valevåg, which suggests that a higher memory foam content requires a longer expansion time.What we loveView image in fullscreenEven the cat was a fan of the Original Hybrid.Photograph: Jane HoskynSleep doesn’t always come easily to me – I’ve been known to need two baths and several bowls of soup to help me nod off – but the Otty worked like a sleeping pill in mattress form. The sleep tracker on my smartwatch also revealed that I woke up briefly in the night (microarousals) less often than usual. I put this down to the Otty’s outstanding balance of ergonomic support, cushioning and breathability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

They rated it as less firm than I did, putting it at 8/10 – near the middle of the pool for mattress firmness. For overall comfort, however, they ranked it the best, with an average score of 8.3/10.“Can we have this one?” asked my sister, noting that the Otty is surprisingly light and manoeuvrable for such a robust mattress, and would be relatively easy to transport across town to her house. Having designated myself lead tester, I had to put my foot down. The Otty was ours, at least until testing was over and it was collected for charity.My husband, Alan, and I slept on it for two months and both found its supportiveness to be a relief after some more challengingly soft and inconsistent sleeping surfaces. It’s not too firm for comfort, though. As a petite side sleeper, I need a bit of cushioning to accommodate my shoulders and hips, and I get lower back pain on very firm mattresses – but this didn’t happen with the Otty.View image in fullscreenThe mattress’s foam layers absorb movement beautifully.Photograph: Jane HoskynIts motion isolation is also excellent. Sharing my bouncy old sprung mattress with a fidgety sleeper was less fun than it sounds because the springs seemed to amplify his (and my) tossing and turning. The Otty doesn’t completely lack bounce, especially on my bed’s slatted base, but its foam layers absorb movement beautifully to help me sleep in peace.A big downside of memory foam is that it can trap heat, but I don’t find this to be true for the Original Hybrid – at least not any more. A previous iteration of the Otty Hybrid, which I tried in 2019, felt … clingy. There was no breathing space between the fabric and my skin. Today’s Otty Original Hybrid rectifies this with a cosy-but-cooling feel. Asked for their impressions of its breathability, my family awarded 8.3/10: less airy than the pocket-sprung Ikea Valevåg, but more than the Simba.I’ve yet to try it out in summer, but my lab tests suggested that the Otty works well to stop you from overheating at night.Using a heat pad, a thermometer and my husband’s bottom, I discovered that the Otty cooled down faster than rivals that contain more foam, including the Simba and the Eve Wunderflip Hybrid.Another gold star for the Otty was its snug fit for my fitted sheets. At 25cm deep, it’s not a thin mattress, but it’s slim enough for a secure fit. As a fan of a perfectly flat cotton sleep surface, I regard this as an absolute must. The 28cm-deep Simba is a tighter squeeze, and the 31cm Origin Hybrid Pro is so big you can’t use standard-depth fitted sheets.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreenEdge and corner support could be much improved.Photograph: Jane HoskynThere’s little I don’t love about the Otty. The only other mattress that felt as instantly comfortable, the Simba Hybrid Pro, costs much more and didn’t seem to retain its consistent supportiveness as well as the Otty over the months of testing.Otty’s foam is made in line with EU legislation to minimise any health and environmental impactSome people will find the Otty too firm for comfort, though. My 84-year-old dad was alone in our testing panel to find the Otty too hard on his joints – a sensation I experienced with the firmer Origin Hybrid Pro. Memory foam softens over the months, however, and I noticed a slight sinkage in the sleeping surface over my two months of testing. The sinkage was less pronounced than with the Simba, and it didn’t stop me from sleeping and waking in comfort.The Otty betrays its relative cheapness in a few ways. Edge and corner support could be much improved. “Do the springs even go right to the edge?” asked Alan, alarmed by the way the mattress flattened beneath him when he sat on the side.Its relatively nimble weight also gives the Otty a less extravagant feel than the Simba, Eve or Origin, and may point to more limited durability. Two months is long enough for me to test its impact on my sleep but it’s too short to judge its stamina, and I suspect that its less sophisticated construction will see the Otty retain its consistent supportiveness for less time than its more expensive rivals. Bear that in mind if you’re trying to spend more wisely by investing in homewares that will last many years.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenEvery foam batch is tested to ensure it’s non-toxic and hypoallergenic.Photograph: Jane HoskynThe metal springs and polyester fabric used in the Otty are easily and widely recycled, but memory foam is another matter. The memory foam used in mattresses is viscoelastic LRPu (low-resistance polyurethane foam) – polyurethane that’s been chemically treated to make it elastic and dense in various degrees – and its energy-intensive manufacture is more complex than its pronunciation. It is not biodegradable and, despite the best efforts of industry bodies, it’s hard to paint it as sustainable.To its credit, Otty has striven to make its mattresses as sustainable as possible given the materials used. All its foam is certified byEuropurandCertiPurand made in line with EU legislation to minimise any health and environmental impact. No ozone depleters, TDCPP, mercury or lead are used in manufacturing and every foam batch is tested to ensure it’s non-toxic and hypoallergenic.Otty runs a mattress recycling service, charging £40 (plus £20 for each additional one) to take away your old mattress and recycle it, whether it’s an Otty or not. This is cheaper than rivals, with Simba charging £50. I haven’t tested Otty’s recycling service and can’t confirm what actually happens to collected mattresses, but the company says “they are responsibly recycled, with materials like foam, fabric and metal springs being repurposed to minimise waste and protect the environment”.Otty Original Hybrid: Should I buy it?The Otty Original Hybrid is a comfortable and wonderfully supportive mattress that improved my sleep from the first night. It’s less heavy and less expensive than some rivals, but it outclassed them in my tests. It may prove to be less durable than them, but its 10-year warranty reassures me that it’s good for thousands of superb sleeps.View at OttyJane Hoskyn is a freelance consumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and‘testing’ coffee machines while deadlines loom.

She gives it everything – even if you sense she deserves more of a challengeLucy ManganSun 16 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTShareAlways and forever when I see Siobhan Finneran on screen I am catapulted back nearly 40 years to her mardy teen outrage in the 1987 film Rita, Sue and Bob Too as she objects to Sue always going first when they are out shagging Bob in his car on the moors. “It’s not so good, t’second time!” It’s the funniest, bleakest thing you’ll ever see.Finneran has worked consistently ever since, but in recent years she has really come into her kingdom as a brilliant character actor – the woman you go to when you need someone to play a marrow-deep weariness with the world. Most notably this has been employed by Sally Wainwright in Happy Valley, inwhich Finneran played Sgt Catherine Cawood’s struggling, vulnerable, recovering/lapsing addict sister, Clare, smashing Catherine’s and viewers’ hearts into pieces at several points along the way, before we all gamely picked ourselves up and carried on, as Finneran’s characters tend to do.Now, for the first time, she is in the lead role of a television drama – DI Liz Nyles in Protection, a six-part thriller written by Kris Mrksa, about a family living under the witness protection scheme (about 3,000 people in the UK do at any one time, according to a caption at the start) and the special branch officers in charge of it.Nyles is pretty much your standard ITV thriller-issue cop. She has a teenage-borderline-troublesome daughter, an unpleasant ex-husband, and caring duties for a cantankerous dad (David Hayman), himself a former police officer, with whom Liz has endured a difficult relationship all her life. He is now suffering from the after-effects of a stroke and a new diagnosis of dementia. As a little light relief, Nyles is having an affair with her married colleague DS Paul Brandice (Barry Ward).Jimmy McLennan (Kris Hitchen) is living in a safe house with his wife, Helen (Catherine Tyldesley), and daughter, Amy (Tilly Kaye), under the protection of a team led by Nyles while he waits to give evidence against a local drug baron, Eddie Crowther (Alec Newman). The day before he is due to appear in court, two masked men burst in and kill both parents. Amy hides and survives.Brandice is badly injured trying to save the family. The problem is that the McLennans were not his case and he shouldn’t have been there. Shouldn’t have known about them, and certainly shouldn’t have known where to find them. Was he the source of the leak that led to the murders, and was it pillow talk from Nyles that provided him with the information? If so, has he been using her from the start? What lengths will Nyles go to to protect herself from discovery and from jeopardising the promotion she is due to get?‘Hiya’ – my brutally honest hour with Siobhan Finneran, the unsung queen of TVRead moreAnd with those pieces in play, off we go. Only one episode was available for review but it seems a tasty setup, everything feels confidently executed and the twists and turns (including whether Dad had his own flirtations with corruption that his daughter now fears may come back to bite her) come at nicely paced intervals. Yes, we are asked to believe that when a suitable safe house cannot be found for the orphaned Amy, Nyles takes her to live in her family home instead, and that Nyles can break into Brandice’s car to recover the phone he used to conduct their affair in more or less full view of the officers at the murder scene, but do we mind much about stretching the bounds of believability? No, not really. We all understand that we are not watching The Wire.That said, the sense that this is a very great waste of Finneran’s talents does obtrude and threaten to spoil the game at times. As a general rule, actors graduate from meaty second-string roles to simpler leads and then, if the gods are smiling on them, on to the tiny handful of meaty lead roles that are created each commissioning round. This is unquestionably a simple role for Finneran, compared with her Happy Valley stints and many, many more, but she brings everything she has to it and it is great, undemanding fun to watch. If it is the springboard to other, greater, more challenging main roles in the future, so very much the better, for her and all of us.Protection aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

People in Birmingham voted Birmingham. In Manchester they said Manchester. In Glasgow they said Glasgow and inLiverpoolthey said London. Liverpool holds a high opinion of itself. But then everyone has an opinion about Liverpool. A few months ago I was about to do an event in a school in some home county or other. When I asked to use the toilet, the head waved me towards a pair of doors. I opened the wrong one. It was the lift. “Ha ha,” he bantered, “you can take the boy out of Liverpool. But you can’t take Liverpool out of the boy.” Daniel Defoe’s opinion was that Liverpool was “one of the wonders of Britain”. He visited several times and noted that the city was always changing – demolishing its past to build its future. He thought getting rid of the castle was a bit hasty. To this day, the most common observation about the city is how much it has changed and is changing.I read David Swift’sScouse Republicalongside Michael Heseltine’s breezily optimistic account of urban regeneration,From Acorns to Oaks. It’s impossible to deny that the city has brilliantly swerved the abyss of “managed decline”. It’s now a hen-night destination, a regular stop-off for luxury cruises, a seat of learning. The Georgian Quarter, with its cobbled streets shining under Narnian lamp-posts, is one of the most popular filming locations in the country. But Swift’s account of that voyage from chaotic sailor town to imperial port, from the Beatles to theToxteth uprising, does not look away from the dark and stormy passages. If you ever feel tempted to flirt with trickle-down economics, remind yourself that in 1841, when the city was the premier port of the empireafter London, life expectancy in Liverpool was 26. Seventy-five per cent of the lads who volunteered for army service were rejected for being unfit.View image in fullscreenSwift’s book ‘does not look away from the city’s dark and stormy passages’, including the ‘Toxteth uprising’ of 1981.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesThis is a highly personal book. Swift’s Israeli in-laws provide the story with a baffled chorus. He has a terrific eye for the telling detail. I will forever be quoting his story about how, in 1904, trumpet-tonguedJim Larkin– hero of the Belfast dock strike – buried a letter “to the future socialist society” in a biscuit tin underneath the foundation stone of the Anglican cathedral. There are chapters on the origin of the scouse accent, a short history ofEric’snightclub, observations on the significance of Jürgen Klopp’s Christianity and a long overdue analysis of that weird cocktail of truth, disinformation and racism – the legend ofPurple Aki, an intimidatingly large body builder of Nigerian origin whose possibly harmless but unnerving kink is asking young men if he can feel their muscles. A lot of people think he’s an urban myth.On the downside, there’s not much here about the Chinese community – almost as much a part of Liverpool identity as the Irish. There’s no mention of the city’s greatest son –Jeremiah Horrocks– or ofConstantine Cavafy, who lived on Balmoral Road, near Home Bargains on Prescot Road. I mention these things not as a criticism but as a goad to get Swift to write a sequel to this tastily cargoed clipper ship of a book.Liverpool is a distorting mirror where the themes of our politics are expressed louder and more vividlyThe title –Scouse Republic– nods towards Liverpool exceptionalism of the “scouse not English” type. But if Liverpool is so exceptional, why should a non-scouser want to read this? For one thing, because scouse exceptionalism – the idea that the city is too different, too socialist – is a myth that Swift takes to pieces in a chapter called Good Rioters, Bad Socialists. Liverpoolisdifferent. It experienced large-scale immigration long before most of the country. It experienced the loss of empire more directly. In David Goodhart’s world ofSomewheres v Anywheres, scousers – myself included – are definitely Somewheres.But every city thinks it’s different. Manchester’s unofficial motto is “We do things differently here”, but then that was written by a Scouser (me). And Liverpool is notthatdifferent. Reform came second in several seats in the City Region. And if exceptionalism ever meant anything, it surely lost that meaning last summer when Farage’s rioters set fire toSpellow library. This is why you should read this book. Liverpool is a distorting mirror where the themes of our politics are expressed louder and more vividly. The downside of its solidarity is a politics which is as much about identity as idealism. If you dug up Jim Larkin’s biscuit tin, what might you find inside? A note that said: Don’t worry, even Liverpool – in spite of everything – will find a future.Scouse Republic: An Alternative History of Liverpoolby David Swift is published by Constable (£25).

Between March 2020 and 5 May 2023, when theWorld Health Organization declared an endto the global health emergency, almost 227,000 people died in the UK with Covid-19 listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. The worst single day was 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people died.But it was not just the scale of death. Covid restrictions meant large numbers of people died without loved ones by their side. People said agonising goodbyes to mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and others via video calls on devices operated by nursing staff encased in PPE.People were barred from viewing the bodies of their loved ones, or carrying out rituals important in some faiths such as washing or dressing a body.View image in fullscreenQueen Elizabeth II was forced to sit alone in St George’s chapel in Windsor Castle for the funeral of her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/APGathering to mourn and share memories at funerals and wakes was suspended. The few relatives permitted to attend a funeral were forbidden from hugging, or even sitting next to one another. Even the monarch was not exempt. Queen Elizabeth, wearing a black face mask,sat alone at the funeral of her husbandof 73 years in April 2021.The pandemic forced many people to confront death. “It made us face the fact that there are some things in the world we can’t control,” said Kate Woodthorpe of the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath.“In western countries, we’ve come to assume we’ll reach our 70s, 80s, 90s. We almost believe that death can be controlled, but it can’t. We can’t cure everything, disease kills people,” she said.Many people thought more deeply about mortality, and what a “good” or “bad” death might be. A2021 YouGov surveyfound that one in four adults said the pandemic had affected how they view death, with most of those saying they were more worried about losing loved ones, and almost half saying they thought about death more.There was a“striking shift” in people making or updating wills, according to the Law Society. Post-pandemic, funeral directors reportedincreased interest in non-traditional ceremoniesas a celebration of a person’s life. The proportion of no-frills “direct cremations” has shot up from3% of all funerals in 2019 to 20% in 2023.Mortality rate chartYet, said Laura Davies, who runsA Good Death project at the University of Cambridge, “people still lack the confidence and vocabulary to talk to their families about their end-of-life wishes and to understand what their options are”.According to Marie Curie’s Royston, surveys have shown that if you ask people where they would prefer to die, about 56% opt for home and only about 6% express a preference for hospital. But in 2024, ONS figures showed that almost 43% of deaths occurred in hospitals.“A lot more people want to die at home than get to die at home. And a lot more people die in hospitals than would choose to do so,” he said.People generally do not want to spend their last days in an overcrowded, busy and impersonal ward. “They want to be able to maintain dignity and self-respect, surrounded by loved ones in a familiar place. These are things more easily found at home.”Research published last month from the Nuffield Trust and the Health Economics Unitshowed, however, that 81% of the £11.7bn spent in the UK on health needs for people in the last year of their life went on hospital care. Less than a fifth of the total is spent on primary, community and hospice care.View image in fullscreenTerry Leader, who died of stomach cancer during the pandemic, wanted to die at home but was eventually admitted to hospital.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianRoyston said: “People are taken into hospital at the end of their life when this could be avoided with better resourcing of health care in the community. Some people absolutely have to be in hospitals, but we’re not providing community care to keep people at home where we can.“There is a particular issue with out-of-hours care. If someone is in unbearable pain in the middle of the night with no specialist support, what their families do in reality is call 999 and the person ends up in hospital. With better out-of-hours provision, an awful lot of hospital admissions could be avoided.”The overall amount of funding was not the issue, he said. “We don’t need more money, we need to be better at spending it.”Gillian Holtom certainly could have used better specialist help when her partner, Terry Leader, found he had terminal stomach cancer after being unable to see his GP during the pandemic. Terry wanted to die at home, but Holtom had little support in a distressing and stressful situation.“You find yourself Googling ‘how to care for someone dying of stomach cancer’. It was a miserable few weeks and Terry was in a lot of pain. I remember desperately trying to get help but not getting anywhere, which made me feel very helpless a lot of the time,” said Holtom.In the end, Terry was admitted to hospital. Holtom refused to leave him for nine days until he died on 22 June 2021, aged 67. “I feel like I let him down,” said Holtom.Terry’s final weeks between a very late diagnosis and death were “brutally handled” by their local hospital, said Holtom. According to Davies from The Good Death Project, a growing lack of confidence in theNHSmay be a contributory factor in more people wanting to die at home.View image in fullscreenGilliam Holtom felt ‘very helpless a lot of the time’ when caring for her partner, Terry.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“The impact of the experience of the pandemic combined with images of people being treated in hospital corridors just a few years later may make people more keen on a home death,” she said.Woodthorpe said: “People are still very supportive of the NHS, but confidence in it has taken a battering.”The challenges are likely to accelerate as demographic changes mean theneed for palliative care will increase by 25% by 2048,according to Marie Curie. The vast majority – anestimated 75%-90%– of home-based end-of-life care is provided by unpaid carers, usually family members.After helping to care at home for his mother-in-law in the last weeks of her life, Neil Andrews did the same for his mother, Anne, 11 months later.“Regardless of our values or beliefs or religion, we all want to pass with our dignity intact, with minimum pain, and with someone you love holding your hand,” he said. “There was a beautiful moment just before my mother died, when the night nurse opened the window to let her spirit out.

It implies the presence of strong arguments which can be provided if necessary. The economist John Maynard Keynes, charged with inconsistency, famously replied, “When the facts change, I change my mind.” So, he – and we – are happily and confidently in charge of this whole operation. The world may sadly incline to inconsistency, but not us.And yet the phrase covers a great variety of mental activities, some seemingly rational and logical, others elemental and instinctive. There may be a simmering-away beneath the level of consciousness until the bursting realisation comes that, yes, you have changed your mind completely on this subject, that person, this theory, that worldview. The dadaist Francis Picabia once put it like this: “Our heads are round so that our thoughts can change direction.” And I think this feels as close to a true accounting of our mental processes as does Maynard Keynes’s statement.When I was growing up, adults of my parents’ generation used to say, “Changing her mind is a woman’s privilege.” This was, according to your male point of view, either a charming or an infuriating characteristic. It was regarded as something essentially female, or feminine, sometimes mere whimsicality, sometimes deeply emotional and intuitively intelligent – again, intuition was back then a female speciality – and related to the very nature of the woman in question. So perhaps you could say men were Keynesian, and women Picabian.Memory is key to changing our mind: we need to forget what we believed before because now we know something truer and deeperYou rarely hear that phrase about a woman’s privilege nowadays, and to many it sounds doubtless merely sexist and patronising. On the other hand, if you approach the matter from a philosophical or neuroscientific point of view, it looks a little different. “I changed my mind.” Subject, verb, object, a simple transaction under our control. But where is this “I” that is changing this “mind”, like some rider controlling a horse with their knees, or the driver of a tank guiding its progress? Certainly not very visible to the eye of the philosopher or brain scientist. This “I” we feel so confident about isn’t something beyond and separate from the mind, controlling it, but rather something inside the mind, and arising from it. In the words of one neuroscientist, “there is no self-stuff” locatable within the brain. Far from being a horse rider or tank commander, we are at the wheel of a driverless car of the near future. To the outside observer, there is a car, and a steering wheel, with someone sitting in front of it. And this is true – except that on this particular model the driver cannot switch from automatic to manual, because manual does not exist.So if things are this way round – if it’s the brain, the mind, that gives birth to what we think of as “I”, then the phrase “I changed my mind” doesn’t make much sense. You might as well say, “My mind changed me.” And if we see things this way round, then changing one’s mind is something we don’t necessarily understand ourselves. In which case, it’s not just a woman’s privilege, but a human privilege. Though perhaps “privilege” isn’t quite the right word – better to say, characteristic, or oddity.View image in fullscreenLady Ottoline Morrell tested the attitudes of Oxford undergraduates and predicted they would change with time.Photograph: George C Beresford/Getty ImagesSometimes in my life, I’ve been a logical Keynesian about the whole business, sometimes a dadaist Picabian. But generally, in either case, I’ve been confident that I was right to change my mind. This is another characteristic of the process. We never think, Oh, I’ve changed my mind and have now adopted a weaker or less plausible view than the one I held before, or a sillier or more sentimental view. We always believe that changing our mind is an improvement, bringing a greater truthfulness, or a greater sense of realism, to our dealings with the world and other people. It puts an end to vacillation, uncertainty, weak-mindedness. It seems to make us stronger and more mature; we have put away yet another childish thing. Well, we would think that, wouldn’t we?I remember the story of an Oxford undergraduate of literary aspirations visiting Garsington Manor in the 1920s where the artistic hostess Lady Ottoline Morrell presided. She asked him, “Do you prefer spring or autumn, young man?” He replied spring. Her riposte was that when he got older he would probably prefer autumn. In the late 1970s I interviewed the novelist William Gerhardie, who was almost exactly half a century older than me. I was young and callow, he was extremely aged, indeed bed-ridden. He asked me if I believed in the afterlife. I said that I didn’t. “Well, you might when you get to my age,” he replied with a chuckle. I admired him for the remark, while not believing that I would ever change my mind to that degree.But we all expect, indeed approve of, some changes over the years. We change our minds about many things, from matters of mere taste – the colours we prefer, the clothes we wear – to aesthetic matters – the music, the books we like – to adherence to social groups – the football team or political party we support – to the highest verities – the person we love, the god we revere, the significance or insignificance of our place in the seemingly empty or mysteriously full universe. We make these decisions – or these decisions make us – constantly, though they are often camouflaged by the momentousness of the acts that provoke them. Love, parenthood, the death of those close to us: such matters reorient our lives, and often make us change our minds. Is it merely that the facts have changed? No, it’s more that areas of fact and feeling hitherto unknown to us have suddenly become clear, that the emotional landscape has altered. And in a great swirl of emotion, our minds change. So I think, on the whole, I have become a Picabian rather than a Keynesian.Consider the question of memory. This is often a key factor in changing our mind: we need to forget what we believed before, or at least forget with what passion and certainty we believed it, because we now believe something different that we know to be truer and deeper.Memory, or the weakening or lack of it, helps endorse our new position; it is part of the process. And beyond this, there’s the wider question of how our understanding of memory changes. Mine certainly has over my lifetime. When I was an unreflecting boy, I assumed that memory operated like a left-luggage office. An event in our lives happens, we make some swift, subconscious judgment on the importance of that event, and if it is important enough, we store it in our memory. Later, when we need to recall it, we take the left-luggage ticket along to a department of our brain, which releases the memory back to us – and there it is, as fresh and uncreased as the moment it happened.But we know it’s not like that really. We know that memory degrades. We have come to understand that every time we take that memory out of the locker and expose it to view, we make some tiny alteration to it. And so the stories we tell most often about our lives are likely to be the least reliable, because we will have subtly amended them in every retelling down the years.Sometimes it doesn’t take years at all. I have an old friend, a considerable raconteur, who once, in my presence, in the course of a single day, told the same anecdote to three different audiences with three different punchlines. At the third hearing, after the laughter had subsided, I murmured, perhaps a little unkindly, “Wrong ending, Thomas.” He looked at me in disbelief (at my manners); I looked at him in disbelief (at his not being able to stick to a reliable narrative).I think that sometimes we remember as true things which never even happened in the first placeThere is also such a thing as a memory transplant. My wife and I were great friends of the painter Howard Hodgkin, and travelled with him and his partner to many places. In 1989, we were in Taranto in southern Italy, when Howard spotted a black towel in an old-fashioned haberdasher’s window. We went in, Howard asked to see it, and the assistant produced from a drawer a black towel. No, Howard explained, it wasn’t quite the same black as the one in the window. The assistant, unflustered, produced another one, and then another one, each of which Howard rejected as not being as black as the one in the window. After he had turned down seven or eight, I was thinking (as one might), for God’s sake, it’s only a towel, you only need it to dry your face. Then Howard asked the assistant to get the one out of the window, and we all saw at once that it was indeed very, very slightly blacker than all the others. A sale was concluded, and a lesson about the precision of an artist’s eye learned. I described this incident in an essay about Howard, and doubtless told it orally a few times as well. Many years later, after Howard’s death, I was at dinner in painterly circles when a woman, addressing her husband, said, “Do you remember when we went into that shop with Howard for a black towel…” Before she could finish, I reminded her firmly that this wasmystory, which her expression clearly acknowledged. And I don’t believe she was doing it knowingly: she somehow remembered it as happening to her and her husband. It was an artless borrowing – or a piece of mental cannibalism, if you prefer.View image in fullscreenArtist Howard Hodgkin’s eye for colour provided Barnes with an amusing anecdote – until someone else appropriated it.Photograph: Martin Argles/The GuardianIt’s salutary to discover, from time to time, how other people’s memories are often quite different from our own – not just of events, but of what we ourselves were like back then. A few years ago, I had an exchange of correspondence about one of my books with someone whom I’d been at school with, but had not kept up with and had no memory of. The exchange turned into a sharp disagreement, at which point he clearly decided he might as well tell me what he thought of me – or, more accurately, tell me what he remembered now of what he had thought of me back when we were at school together. “I remember you,” he wrote, “as a noisy and irritating presence in the Sixth Form corridor.” This came as a great surprise to me, and I had to laugh, if a little ruefully. My own memory insisted – and still does – that I was a shy, self-conscious and well-behaved boy, though inwardly rebellious. But I couldn’t deny this fellow pupil’s reminiscence; and so, belatedly, I factored it in, and changed my mind about what I must have been like – or, at least, how I might have appeared to others – 50 and more years ago.Gradually, I have come to change my mind about the very nature of memory itself. For a long time I stuck pretty much with the left-luggage-department theory, presuming that some people’s memories were better because their brain’s storage conditions were better, or they had shaped and lacquered their memories better before depositing them in the first place. Some years ago, I was writing a book that wasmainly about death, but also a family memoir. I have one brother – three years older, a philosopher by profession – and emailed him explaining what I was up to. I asked some preliminary questions about our parents – how he judged them as parents, what they had taught us, what he thought their own relationship was like. I added that he himself would inevitably feature in my book. He replied with an initial declaration that astonished me. “By the way,” he wrote, “I don’t mind what you say about me, and if your memory conflicts with mine, go with yours, as it is probably better.” I thought this was not just extremely generous of him, but also very interesting. Though he was only three years older than me, he was assuming the superiority of my memory. I guessed that this could be because he was a philosopher, living in a world of higher and more theoretical ideas; whereas I was a novelist, professionally up to my neck in the scruffy, everyday details of life.View image in fullscreenEconomist John Maynard Keynes famously remarked that ‘when the facts change, I change my mind’.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveBut it was more than this. As he explained to me, he had come to distrust memory as a guide to the past. By itself, unsubstantiated, uncorroborated memory was in his view no better than an act of the imagination. (James Joyce put it the other way round, “Imagination is memory” – which is much more dubious.) My brother gave an example. In 1976 he had gone to a philosophical conference on Stoic logic held at Chantilly, north of Paris, organised by Jacques Brunschwig, whom he had never met before. He took a train from Boulogne, and clearly remembered missing his stop, and having to take a taxi back up the line and arriving late as a consequence. He and Brunschwig became close friends, and 30 years later they were having dinner in Paris and reminiscing about how they first met. Brunschwig remembered how he had waited on the platform at Chantilly and immediately recognised my brother as soon as he stepped down from the train. They stared at one another in disbelief (and perhaps had to apply some Stoic logic to their quandary).That book came out 17 years ago. And in the meantime, I have come round to my brother’s point of view. I now agree that memory, a single person’s memory, uncorroborated and unsubstantiated by other evidence, is a feeble guide to the past. I think, more strongly than I used to, that we constantly reinvent our lives, retelling them – usually – to our own advantage. I believe that the operation of memory is closer to an act of the imagination than it is to the clean and reliably detailed recuperation of an event in our past. I think that sometimes we remember as true things that never even happened in the first place; that we may grossly embellish an original incident out of all recognition; that we may cannibalise someone else’s memory, and change not just the endings of the stories of our lives, but also their middles and beginnings. I think that memory, over time, changes, and, indeed, changes our mind. That’s what I believe at the moment, anyway. Though in a few years, perhaps I will have changed my mind about it all over again.This is an edited extract fromChanging My Mindby Julian Barnes, published by Notting Hill Editions on 18 March (£8.99).

Here’s how to do it successfullyAmy FlemingSun 16 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 16.45 EDTShareIknow I’m not alone as a parent when I admit I have often felt like an exasperated failure in trying to restrict what my children see online. There were the times they hacked their devices’ screen time settings, or managed to stumble into inappropriate content in spite of the controls, not to mention the ever inventive workarounds to access restricted sites. Worst of all is the ill will the rigmarole creates between us all. So when in the first minute of my conversation with digital parenting coach Elizabeth Milovidov, she says, “I think parents need to just kind of give themselves a hug, breathe and start over,” I feel so heard and comforted I could cry.“Parents are incredibly busy. They’re overwhelmed,” says Milovidov. “And then this whole idea of trying to lock things down is not easy. I remember trying to learn how to programme a VCR, and it was just like: oh my God.” And yet she herself, a parent of teens, seems so chill. She admits having watched far too much TV in the 70s, and she has turned out OK; she has a PhD and is an international consultant on tech and parenting.What emerges from speaking with Milovidov and other experts in this field is that what is often needed is not so much a nuts-and-bolts guide to the ever-updating technical side of parental controls as a pep talk on mindset, communication and what’s realistically possible.“There’s no way of sugar-coating it,” says Luke Savage, senior project officer atNSPCC Child Safety Online. “There are so many different elements that itiscomplicated and laborious. From the wifi router in the home to the device in a child’s hand, the computer console they’re playing on and the apps or games themselves – each one has individual settings and controls.” And even when parents have waded through it all, says Savage, they can’t “put their feet up and think: my work here is done. There are limitations to parental controls. They’re not perfect – children can bypass them if they’re clever enough.” These tools are a mere step in a far more nuanced process which, he says, “comes down to conversation and communication”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by model; Hraun/Getty ImagesStart talking about the internet early“It’s not about controlling our children, and it’s not about fear,” says Milovidov. “It is about empowering them to make smart decisions, and we do that when they are at a very young age. We are trying to teach them how to behave when we are not in the room, when we are not looking over their shoulder – that’s what digital guardianship is.”“The second they start to use technology, have those conversations in an appropriate manner and using language that’s suitable,” says Savage. Milovidov agrees: “What I always tell parents is that it doesn’t matter so much about the parental controls, as long as you’re talking to them, because even if you lock down that smartphone, that iPad, that gaming console, they are going to hear about [inappropriate content]. You’ve got to give them some strategies beforehand about what to do if somebody tries to show them something that they know is not appropriate.”There’s a sense, she says, that if your child does see something inappropriate, you’ve failed. “I would just tell parents to believe in themselves a bit more. It’s inevitable that they’re going to see something at some point.”Router firstThe most important place to start with safety restrictions, says Savage, “is the wifi router. That’s where you can block inappropriate websites and things like that.” There should be a step-by-step guide on your provider’s website. Although bear in mind that if a child’s phone has unlimited mobile data they can access at home, the router will be out of the equation.Get to know the platformsGenerally, in tech, instruction manuals are a thing of the past; you just switch it on and the rest is intuitive bliss, supposedly. But with parental controls, taking a few minutes to read the guidance will make it a less seat-of-the-pants situation. (I recommend, with bitter hindsight, doing this before even introducing a new digital device or platform – any online space for socialising, gaming or streaming – into the family.) Milovidov says that there is usually good information on the websites for individual platforms, “including screenshots showing you step by step how to do some of the harder stuff”. The non-profit organisation Internet Matters has all sorts ofguides to parental controlson its site. “They have great set-up tools for anything – TikTok, Roblox, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, all of the games.”Check settings regularlyThe NSPCC advises going back in at regular intervals. For a start, settings can be tampered with. “Let’s be honest – a child might think: ‘I can bypass parental controls.’” This is where that communication comes in: a child is more likely to respect the rules, “if they understand why you’re using certain settings, and there’s a suggestion that things will change as they get older, as happens in the real world.” But as with the real world, pushing boundaries is just what children do. “They can search for ‘how do I bypass my parental filter?’”There’s also the issue that platforms often change and update their parental settings, says Savage, “so the parent might need to check on a semi-regular basis to make sure that the settings are still as they were”. Updates tend to be for the better, he adds, but sometimes this means there are new options that you need to decide whether or not to activate.Finally, there’s the fact that children get older. “That setting from when they were five years old probably isn’t relevant when they’re 12.”Rethink screen timeScreen time is less of a safety issue. “A child could be online for five minutes and experience harm,” says Savage. “We really push this conversation and thought process among parents of ‘screen time versus screen usage’.” As children move on to secondary school, much of their homework is online and managed through apps, as is communicating with friends. “So actually, when you’re talking about screen time, a lot of it might be things they have to be doing, rather than endlessly scrolling on a social media site, for example.”View image in fullscreenNot all screen time is bad.Photograph: Posed by models; Pekic/Getty ImagesMilovidov suggests considering five criteria if you’re worried about screen time. Are they eating well? Are they sleeping well? Are they doing well in school? Are they doing well with you – treating you, the parents and caregivers, well? And how are they interacting with friends? “If the answer to all of those things is, ‘Yeah, they’re doing pretty good,’ you really don’t have a screen issue.” You might be angry because they’re not coming when you call them to dinner and they want to play Fortnite or Roblox a little bit longer, but, she says: “I always tell parents: that’s normal. That’s like me watching Bridgerton:don’t bother me right now. Not all screen time is bad. I’ve been doing this for 15 years, telling people to look at the content of what they’re doing. If my 17-year-old is sitting there studying Spanish online, I am not going to lose my mind. But if he’s playing Call of Duty for hours on end, I’m going to be like: ‘Dude, what are you doing?’”Be a good role modelIf your child sees you on your phone constantly, they might think it’s one rule for them and another one for you, Savage points out. “If you can start to use wellbeing and screen-time-limiting tools yourself, and your child sees that, then it’s going to have an impact.” So if you can set up family rules, as opposed to child rules, then you should start to see “that the child thinks: ‘OK, this isn’t just an attack on me and my online world. This is for the good of all of us as a family.’”Ekaterina Hertog, associate professor of AI and society at the University of Oxford, has found in her research interviews with young people that “monitoring is often very top-down. And sometimes that approach can be harmful, because it can be perceived by young people as: ‘My parents don’t trust me – I haven’t been doing anything wrong, and I explain it to them, but they don’t listen.’” This, she says, can create additional risks, “where young people try to go around those restrictions. When they get into trouble, they might be really reluctant to go to parents and tell them, ‘I went on that website and saw this really disturbing video,’ because they were not allowed.’”“We’re creating a lot of fear,” says Milovidov. “Yes, there are risks online, but we cannot live in fear. Social media, games, messaging apps, AI, connected homes – they all come with their own set of risks. Whether it’s privacy, cyberbullying, misinformation, whatever, there are ways to limit the risk. But bans don’t always work.”She can’t stress enough how engaging and talking is the number one priority. “You’ve got to have a relationship with them where they’re going to open up to you and let you know what happened at school. Sometimes I’m telling my boys how to be an upstander, not just a bystander.” This means that when they see bullying, or someone sends them something offensive online, they know how to intervene, “but not become a target themselves. Usually, humour is one of the best tools that a kid can have to get out.”When they break the rulesYoung people are always going to get around parental controls, says Milovidov. “It still happens in my house. They are going to test you.” It might feel like the last straw; time to remove any internet fun once and for all. Her advice is to think of it as if they were breaking real-life rules. “Whether it’s alcohol or inviting somebody over that shouldn’t be over, we don’t just lose it and ban everything for ever and ever. We ground them or there are other consequences.”View image in fullscreenAsk them why they need to get around your rules.Photograph: Posed by model; Nazar Abbas Photography/Getty ImagesIt pays to ask them why they need to get around these rules. How can we adjust? Is it that you need a little bit more time to play? Is it that you feel like you’re missing out with your friends? “Ask them to help you figure out a solution. You don’t want them to keep breaking your rules, because they’re breaking your trust. It’s about helping them understand why those limits are there. And it’s not just ‘because we said so’; you’re trying to teach them to be digitally responsible and not just digitally restricted.”When her son was younger, he wanted to be able to chat with friends while he was gaming, Milovidov says. At first, “I was like, no, no, no, no, no. And we went through each of the features together, and he’s like, ‘OK, no, I don’t need that, and I don’t need this filter.’ And he himself kind of self-censored. It was literally ticking a box of chatting with only his friends, not with everyone in the world. And I was like: ‘Oh my gosh, well, of course you can do that.’”It’s not that parents always have to acquiesce to young people’s point of view, says Hertog,but “just even having a conversation about it, feeling heard and understood … This communication could help parents to build up their young people to make good choices when they’re adults.” It’s similar to how we try to instil healthy eating. “Many children crave junk, so parents have conversations and hopefully manage some kind of compromise diet that’s more healthy than not. But the parental control technology encourages, or makes it easier, for parents to just be cops.”Arrange alternative activitiesOne of the best ways to create a healthy balance is to give children chances to experience how good it feels to be active and social in the real world. Take them on outings, offer them alternative activities. “When my boys were younger,” says Milovidov, “it was setting up play dates. Otherwise they will all want to be on devices, because it’s exciting, it’s cool stuff.”Don’t rush to judge their content“It feels so difficult in the beginning – I won’t sayunsavoury –to let all this tech into your life,” says Milovidov. She often hears parents despair that their children want to watch YouTubers playing video games. “They get so upset and they say, my child is not even playing the damn game. He’s sitting there watching somebody else on YouTube.” She laughs and tells them: “‘You do the same thing when you’re watching the Super Bowl or Wimbledon – you are watching somebody else play.’ And they’re like: ‘Oh, wow. I didn’t think of it that way.’ If you’re watching a cooking show, you’re not cooking. You’re getting tips. You’re learning how to do something different. And that’s what they do. They are learning.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyChildrenInternet safetyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For an hour or so each day, the river floods the Twickenham embankment opposite Eel Pie Island until the tide recedes, as it has done ever since the footbridge on to the island was built in 1957. But the tides do not affect the islanders, whose houses are raised up and protected by flood defence walls.View image in fullscreenMick Jagger and the Rolling Stones perform on Eel Pie Island in 1963.Photograph: Mike PetersThe islanders say that a change to the local plan will mean that their homes will be classified as being in a flood zone, making it difficult or impossible for them to remortgage their properties or obtain insurance, and businesses on the island will not be able to secure loans against their buildings.“We’ve been working with water for hundreds of years here,” said Celia Holman, an island resident and committee member of the River Thames Society. “We’re the custodians.” Walking across the bridge on to the island, she points out the flood defences around every home – thick brick and stone garden walls, and fittings for metal plates that can be slotted into front gates if water levels rise.In the days of watermen rowing passengers up and down the Thames in the 16th century, the island was known as Twickenham Ait, and Henry VIII is thought to have stopped at an inn here on his journeys to Hampton Court.It was renamed Eel Pie Island by 19th century tour operators selling day trips to Londoners; the hotel built in 1830 was supposedly a good place for gentlemen to accommodate their mistresses, according to theEel Pie Island museum.View image in fullscreen‘We’re the custodians.” Eel Pie Island resident and activist Celia Holman standing on the Twickenham side of the footbridge over the Thames at high tide.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverIt became a part of rock history in 1956 when the hotel was turned into the Eelpiland dance club, hosting a five-month residency by theRolling Stones in 1963. David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Eric Clapton played there, and Rod Stewart was recruited to the Hoochie Coochie Men after meeting Long John Baldry following a gig. The club shut in 1967, to be replaced by a hippy commune, and when the building burned down in 1970 it was replaced by apartments.Holman’s home is at the corner of the old hotel site, and the island now is a mix of housing, offices and artists’ studios and a boatyard, with a counter-cultural undertone not unlikeCopenhagen’s Christiania.View image in fullscreenEel Pie Island is home to bohemian residents and thriving small businesses, including a boatyard.Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer“There is incredible economic diversity – a broad spectrum of people that come here. When we had a doctor and a dentist, I thought ‘right, we can declare independence’,” Holman says. “It’s a vibrant, changing, evolving place.”She describes the new local plan as a “computer-says-no-approach”. “And that results in a derelict island. If people cannot mortgage or insure a property, they can’t sell it, which means no one will move in, which means the island will wither away.”Holly Tucker, founder ofNot On The High Street, runs her Holly & Co business from the island. She said: “This is just shortsighted; it is utterly pointless and it makes me furious that we have such policies that have not been thought through and will harm the island. What if the island becomes derelict because people can’t get mortgages, the insurances to be on the island? We’re a thriving part of the Twickenham community.”Henry Harrison, architect, resident and a founder of theindie band the Mystery Jets, said it would become “incredibly difficult” to improve the island. “The island’s adapted over centuries to become what it is now,” he said. “It’s the most famous island on the river. It’s a flagship for London and for Richmond. They’re sabotaging themselves by trying to restrict the use of the islands and the future development.”The islanders’ attempts to engage with Richmond council have not been very successful, because the council believes nothing has really changed. The new plan contains a single line defining that the floodplain starts at Teddington, where a weir prevents tidal waters flowing farther upstream.The change, it said, happened after the Environment Agency pointed out an “inconsistency” in how the previous version treated the islands downstream – including Eel Pie Island – and it needed to be updated to “incorporate” the islands.But faced with the protests, the council said that other parts of the document show the islands were already considered to be part of the flood zone, so nothing had changed.View image in fullscreenThe bridge connecting Eel Pie Island to the mainland in Twickenham.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverWhich leaves the islanders asking why, if nothing about the policy is changing, Richmond needs to issue a new one. In fact, the residents are already seeing changes, Holman said. “We’ve already had planning applications turned down against the background [of the new plan],” she said. “Changes of use, extensions that would have been allowed previously.” And the reason given for the rejection is the risk of flooding – something that was not raised in dozens of previous applications that had been approved, she said.Richmond council said it was for the planning inspector to make a decision about the local plan and said there was a “longstanding policy approach to the sets of islands on the Thames”.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “Eel Pie Island has an interesting and unique history and we are committed to working with the residents and business to understand and best prepare for present and future flood risk.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyThe ObserverFloodingLondonThe ThamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was pure elation in the black-and-white half of Wembley, packed with more than 32,000 Newcastle fans, at full time as they celebrated the end of a seven-decade long wait since winning the 1955 FA Cup. Victory earned a Uefa Conference League spot for next season.Newcastle sink Liverpool to savour taste of glory after decades of droughtRead more“With such a long wait for a trophy, this will be a day that I’m sure everyone will never forget,” Howe said. “We will never forget it. I certainly won’t. I think there’s different ways to win trophies. Today we won it in the best way. We played a brilliant opponent, they’ve been the best team in the Premier League all season by quite a long way. And for me, we were the better team.“I feel amazing, it is an incredible day. I was so, so pleased with our performance, it was not a lucky win, thoroughly deserved. I am drenched in alcohol from Joelinton and the rest of the squad, it’s a great moment, it is about embracing the success. We have to try and enjoy the moment and take it all in.”Howe is the first English manager to win a major trophy in the country since Harry Redknapp led Portsmouth to FA Cup glory in 2008 and is hoping he and Newcastle can build on this. “Hopefully with one, it can become more,” the Newcastle manager said. “There’s no guarantee, though, but I just think it proves we can do it. I’ve never had any doubts about our ability to lift our game. But you don’t get many shots at this, you don’t get many shots at a cup final. Today we had to try and take our opportunity and that’s where the players delivered under pressure so well and so impressively. It also proved that we can mix our game against the very, very best. Now the challenge for us is to try and get there more often.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot said he had never seen a header like Dan Burn’s opener.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockBruno Guimarães and Joelinton were key to victory, dominating in midfield as every Newcastle player outclassed their opponent. “We’ve got some iconic players who will go down as legends of the football club in the future. But they’ve still got to cement that legacy.”Burn was unmarked from a corner after taking advantage of the defensive zonal marking just days after receiving an England callup. “I’ve had worse weeks,” Burns joked. “I don’t want to go to sleep because I feel like I am dreaming.”Liverpool failed to match Newcastle’s energy and aggression across the pitch to make it a miserable end to the week in which they were also dumped out of the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain after extra time and penalties on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we played 10 times through the air against them, they win it probably nine times because they are a stronger team in the air than us. It led to the first goal and the second goal because the second goal was also a header that they won at the second post that fell for Isak.”The opener put Liverpool on the back foot and they never recovered on the pitch. “I’ve never seen in my life a player from that far away heading a ball with so much force into the far corner,” Slot said. “That is part of logic that they either have to go far away from our zone, which is 99 out of 100 times that they will never lead to a goal, or they have to arrive in our zone and then it’s an equal battle.

He closed out his incredible run in the desert with his most dominant performance of all, completely overpowering the 12th seed, Holger Rune, 6-2, 6-2 to win at Indian Wells for the first time.Fred Stolle obituaryRead moreWith a triumphant run at arguably the biggest regular tournament in the world outside of the grand slams, Draper is the fifth British man in history to win an ATP Masters 1000 title, joining Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Andy Murray and Cameron Norrie. Having already sealed a place inside the top 10 for the first time in his career, the 23-year-old will rise to a career-high ranking of No 7 in his first week as a top 10 player. Draper has also now won three ATP titles, with his wins at the Stuttgart ATP 250 event and Vienna ATP 500 all achieved over the past year.“I feel like I deserve this, in all honesty,” said Draper. “The amount of adversity I have been through, the amount of sacrifices, the amount of time all the people around me have put into me. It’s an emotional feeling to know how much you have gone through and put in. To be here now and to say I will be seven in the world, I cannot tell you how much that means to me.”This had already been an incredible week that featured the best tennis of Draper’s career, particularly in the 13th seed’s devastating fourth round performance against the third seed, Taylor Fritz.His win over the second seed and defending champion, Alcaraz, on Saturday, meanwhile, was a reflection of his mental toughness and composure under pressure.While the younger yet considerably more experienced Rune looked tense early on, Draper burst into the match eviscerating the ball. He backed up his excellent serving by dominating the baseline with his much-improved forehand and he looked desperate to conduct the match on his terms. After flying to a 4-0 lead, Draper rolled through the opening set.Draper has always been open about the nerves that have sometimes accompanied his determination to succeed and this was the type of occasion that could have easily brought them out. Instead, he continued to relentlessly attack his forehand, completely overpowering Rune with his superior weight of shot.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva makes a backhand return.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APEven as Rune began to grow into the match – and the 21-year-old put Draper under pressure in a number of games – Draper played with immense courage on the decisive points, landing massive, precise first serves and pulverising his forehand until the title was his.When Draper began his rise up the ATP rankings years ago, he never imagined how challenging his path would be. He has had to navigate countless injuries, physical and even mental issues that left him questioning whether he would ever fulfil the potential he has long believed he possesses. This victory is a triumph of his resilience and determination, and it is clear that his rise has only just begun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only problem for Leicester was Vardy sent the ball over the line during a break in play while Ayden Heaven, forced off early in the second half, received treatment, and it was the United supporters singing about Van Nistelrooy. The Dutchman took charge of United in the reverse fixture in November, signing off from his spell in interim chargewith a 3-0 victory, but this time he was on the receiving end of the same scoreline.That four-match unbeaten run with United must feel halcyonic for Van Nistelrooy, who has now lost 13 of his past 14 league matches. The numbers make grisly reading: Leicester have not scored here since early December and after firing blanks in this defeat they recorded unwanted history, becoming the firstPremier Leagueteam to lose seven home matches in a row without scoring. Leicester are nine points adrift of 17th-placed Wolves and have a vastly inferior goal difference.Merino strike proves the difference as strikerless Arsenal sink ChelseaRead moreThings do not get any easier either, with a trip to Manchester City the first of their next four games against teams in the top seven. “It’s about the mathematical possibility that is there and as long as that is the case we are professionals and we keep doing our jobs,” Van Nistelrooy said, adopting a diplomatic tone. “We won’t give up until it’s mathematically impossible.”The night descended into a procession for United when Alejandro Garnacho doubled United’s advantage midway through the second half, building on Rasmus Højlund’s first goal for 22 hours and 19 minutes.It was an imperfect United performance but, frankly, it did not matter against opposition silently sliding towards relegation. Bruno Fernandes completed the scoring with a superb first-time finish from the edge of the box, capping a good week in which Unitedadvanced to the Europa League quarter-finals.It would be kind to refer to this as a slow-burner, a distinctly low-quality contest befitting teams who began in 15th and 19th. There was a general shoddiness, a theme that has stalked both sides this season: overcooked passes, ballooned crosses, unforced errors aplenty. Christian Eriksen, one of three players promoted to United’s starting lineup, registered the visitors’ first effort of note, cracking a first-time effort against a post after a short-corner routine, the Denmark midfielder whipping a right-foot shot at goal from the edge of the 18-yard box after exchanging passes with Fernandes.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes fires home Manchester United’s third in the 90th minute.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAUnited took the lead approaching the half-hour, the relief tangible as Højlund buried a shot across goal. Fernandes was invariably involved in the buildup. The Portuguese whittled a pass through for Højlund, who chested the ball after Boubakary Soumaré missed his attempted clearance. Wout Faes hesitated to pressure the striker and then reneged altogether. Højlund then got the ball out of his feet and after dawdling briefly – no wonder given his barren run – he sent his right-foot effort past an exposed Mads Hermansen.Just like that, after 21 matches without finding the net, Højlund handed United the lead. “It is really important for him,” said United’s head coach, Ruben Amorim. “He scored a very good goal and I think he deserved it more than anybody.”Still, it spoke volumes that Heaven, on his first Premier League start and fifth senior appearance, was one of United’s standout performers. The 18-year-old, signed from Arsenal on 1 February, did well to recover the ball when Patson Daka was released on goal, though Daka’s failure to seize the opportunity was also indicative of a struggling player.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Soumaré wriggled clear of a wreckage on halfway, played in Vardy inside the left channel and the Leicester captain sent the ball into the box. Daka was lurking at the back post but Heaven, who was replaced by Toby Collyer, made life difficult and Daka skewed a shot wide. United thought they had a second when Højlund slipped in Garnacho, who cut inside Luke Thomas and thrashed a shot into the far corner. Garnacho and Højlund sat on the advertising hoardings in celebration, but prematurely. Garnacho was offside.The Argentinian would return to the hoardings 10 minutes later, after swivelling on to Fernandes’s pass and blasting a first-time effort in at Hermansen’s near post. Højlund hugged Garnacho and every outfield player joined the party. Fernandes made it game, set and match in the final minute of normal time. United fans rattled through the back catalogue of chants about famous names: Rooney, Solskjær, Cole and Van Nistelrooy. But it is in Amorim whom they trust, evidenced by the away fans serenading him, too, throughout. “It’s strange,” Amorim smiled. “I know we are so far away from what they expect and deserve.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeicester CityManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Verstappen closed the gap due to the intervention of a safety car. Norris has previously played down how impressive his car has looked but after the race in Melbourne, conceded it was the class of the field.“I do think we are the favourites,” he said. “We are the team to beat. The car is flying. There will be tracks where we are even better.”George Russell, who was third for Mercedes, had suggested earlier at the weekend that the pace of the McLaren had made it all but untouchable already and that other teams may shift swiftly their focus to 2026 when there is a major regulation change. Russell’s comments were welcomed by Norris.View image in fullscreenLando Norris is soaked with champagne by his team members as they all celebrate the victory.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images“If that is their mentality, then wonderful because that is not the mentality to have,” he said. “We know we have a lot of work to do in this car and if you do relax, you have failed. InFormula Oneif you start to think everything is good and groovy that is when you get caught.”The British driver also praised his team for making the right strategy calls and managing his race well after some significant failings last year – specifically in the crucial moments when a sudden rain shower hit in the latter stages and Norris was wrestling with his car.“The team calling me to box half a second before I needed to box, even though I was still trying to save the car and making sure I didn’t shunt, was the right call. It was a call that won me the race,” he said.View image in fullscreenLando Norris’s McLaren car was excellent in the wet.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockAt Ferrari, however, it was clear there is work to be done. Hamilton finished 10th and said adapting to his car and team is taking time. He had some terse exchanges with his race engineer, Riccardo Adami, and Vasseur said the team must do better.“We learn a lot from this weekend because we made mistakes,” he said. “We need to improve the communication, understand what Lewis needs from the communication. It was the first race, the first time that we have to communicate between the pitwall and the car. We can do a better job and know each other more, for sure it was not a clean one at all, the strategy was difficult and we need to find a better way to communicate between the car and the pitwall.”Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisFormula OneMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He may well be grateful for that; in the final meaningful act of day four, the little-known JJ Spaun came within a couple of ball rotations of snatching the PGA Tour’s marquee event from McIlroy’s grasp. How that would have stung the Northern Irishman. The pair will instead return on Monday morning for a three hole playoff. McIlroy is the clear favourite but Spaun, with nothing to lose, carries menace.As with so much involving McIlroy, this proved dramatic stuff. He was four shots adrift of the lead before a shot was struck on Sunday. Inside five holes, he was tied at the top. A four-hour weather delay ensued; when McIlroy birdied the 12th upon return, he led by three. McIlroy played the closing six in one over as Spaun birdied the 14th and 16th to force extra time.Matt Fitzpatrick splits from caddie Billy Foster after poor start to 2025Read more“It was a battle all day,” McIlroy said. “I feel like I should be going home with the trophy tonight but that is fine, I will reset and hopefully go home with the trophy tomorrow.”So much always depends on the closing two holes at the Stadium Course. McIlroy was irritated by a par on the 17th after his tee shot found an awkward lie but responded by hitting a magnificent iron into the heart of the 18th fairway. From there, he came up 73ft short; McIlroy’s two-putt was a good one. Spaun also made a three at the 17th but his tee shot at the last finished in pine straw. The underdog’s nerveless approach left him 30ft for glory. The putt finished so agonisingly short for Spaun. His 72 and McIlroy’s 68 left the duo at 12 under par. Tom Hoge, Lucas Glover and Akshay Bhatia were next in line at minus 10.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Robert MacIntyre’s 69 delivered the Scot’s latest highly impressive, top-10 finish.

Borthwick also endorsed Maro Itoje for the captaincy.However, with Farrell naming his coaching ticket in nine to 10 days’ time, the assistants Richard Wigglesworth, Tom Harrison, Kevin Sinfield, Joe El‑Abd and Andrew Strawbridge are all expected to be passed over, ensuring England coaches miss out for the second Lions tour in a row.Borthwick backs England players for Lions squad after rout of WalesRead moreWigglesworth and Harrison have seen their stock rise during the campaign, with England ending on a high note, racking up 10 tries in Cardiff while their scrum has shown significant improvements throughout the competition.Borthwick, who was the last England coach to be seconded for a Lions tour, in 2017, said: “Andy hasn’t talked about any of the coaching team at this stage. I’d love them to have the opportunity. I’d love as many of the management team as possible to have that. That Lions experience I had in 2017 was one of the best, if not the best, experience I’ve had in my life.“Working with the best players from four different countries, working with incredible coaches against top-class opposition. I developed and learned so much as a coach in that period, it was brilliant for me and accelerated my coaching, so I’d love as many other people from the England group to be in there as possible, and I’ll be fully supportive of them all.”England should still be well represented in the playing squad after ending the championship with four wins from five matches. Players such as the Curry brothers, Ben Earl, Will Stuart, Fin Smith, Alex Mitchell and Tommy Freeman have all played their way into contention.It is understood that all England players selected are mandated 10 weeks off after the tour, ensuring they will miss the first two rounds of the Premiership season, then be available for three rounds before the autumn internationals. England will have four autumn Tests this year and, although Eddie Jones was forced to rest some of his senior stars in 2017, it is believed that there are no such restrictions this year but players’ workloads will be carefully managed.“[Andy and I] met about three weeks ago, we spoke on the phone about 10 days ago, I’m sure we will next week as well,” said Borthwick, who will take a developmental squad on the summer tour of Argentina and the US. “I have done the exercise about 10 times, where I’ve sat there and written out which players I think will go – and I end up with a different number each time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lucy Parker hooked in from a corner to halve the deficit with five minutes remaining, before Katie Stengel capitalised on a mistake from the Villa goalkeeper Sabrina D’Angelo – who was pushing up towards halfway in the 95th minute – to roll the ball into an empty net.The result left the Villa head coach, Natalia Arroyo, still without a point from her four league fixtures in charge, and the club without a league win since December, although the Spaniard did oversee an FA Cup victory in February againstBrighton.The Sussex club were also in action on Sunday and claimed their first league win since November, as Fran Kirby’s low finish into the corner secured a 1-0 win at the out‑of-formTottenham.In the Women’s Championship,Portsmouthwon their second consecutive game by defeatingSunderland2-1 to move off the bottom of the table and up to ninth, above their relegation rivals Sheffield United and Blackburn, with huge twists on the same day in the relegation battles in both of the top two leagues.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

If you even think you are well informed you are living a lie. What the world believes today depends on who is controlling legacy media’s last feeble news fronts, like the head-bobbing slaphead Jeff Bezos’ssupineWashington Post, and on who programs digital social media sluices, such as Ketamine Ken’s Twitter, currently X, essentially an ape with a megaphone standing in a crowded marketplace shouting unsubstantiated rumours at babies, and showing pornographic photographs to children.But was it ever thus? Did it just take the unalloyed unpleasantness ofElon Muskto make us see ourselves as we always were, toilet paper people fluttering on the whims of wealthy men’s media outlets, 8 billion dogshit golems, Frankingsteins made of farts?A radio phone-in about social media on Monday made me understand, with sudden clarity, that horrible hysterical stories drive engagement more than thoughtful true ones. Sorry it took me so long. And so digital media surges right towards the money and JD Vance calls it freedom of speech, as if a barely sentient tapeworm reaching towards a clump of rotten offal was acting with some kind of moral imperative.A black-cab driver tells a passenger imprisoned in their back seat that Keir Starmer defended the Southport killer’s father; your sister-in-law casually announces that most benefits are claimed fraudulently; and JD Vance informs Europe that it’sillegal to pray in your own home in Scotland. The world thinks what rich men want it to and the truth is a touring lineup of Lynyrd Skynyrd with no original members that you’re still listening to in the hope its version of Free Bird will kick ass.So what is the point of writing supposedly funny columns about current affairs for a broadsheet newspaper like theObserver? An adjudicated sex abuser is in the American White House, Boris Johnson is in a moated manor house, and I’m supposed to poke fun at them from a three-bedroom terrace house. Liberal media has failed and it doesn’t have the funds to fight back.Sometimes these screeds take me a few hours, slipping out like baby giraffes, wobbly and slimy but standingI’ve been writing these columns for 14 years now, and fascism and sea levels are still on the rise despite me doing some really good jokes about both of them. I am comedy’s Cnut. Why feed myself through the news mincer when I’m still going to be looking at a world full of damp Hitlers when I die on the end of a Russian bayonet?Sometimes these screeds take me a few hours, slipping out like baby giraffes, wobbly and slimy but standing. And sometimes they take me dead-eyed haemorrhoidal days on end to finish, baking in the back passage of my brain like something malevolent that gestates in Donald Trump’s colon after a week of KFC family bucket meals.Over the years I have come to love negotiating acceptable levels of profanity with the patient section editors, and trying to bury odd ideas in the prose to see what the brilliant artist David Foldvari will do with them. On balance, I’ve spent 7,000 hours writing 400,000 words of remunerated sarcasm. It’s the longest piece of continuous employment I’ve ever had and is my last line of defence when people say, correctly, that I have never done a decent day’s work in my life.I don’t think I did this job especially well for the first 150,000 words. Was there any real value in anything I wrote in those pre-Brexit days of comparative political equilibrium? How many trees died just because I found politicians like David “Dave” Cameron and George “Pencils” Osborne merely inchoately reprehensible, instead of utterly contemptible, in those simpler sillier times? And then, as Dave said, “doo, doo, doo, doo … Right.” And it was never the same again.Brexit was the making of these spews. It sharpened them because it exposed an interconnected web of corruption worming through Westminster, and made me appreciate the privilege of having a platform to piss on people from. But how many forests fell fruitlessly, five years ago, when Ifinally revealed the full secret cabbalistic nameof Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl’s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-a-Bob-for-Big-Ben’s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Spiritual-Worth Three-Men-and-a-Dog Whatever-It-Takes I-Shook-Hands-With-Everyone Herd-Immunity I-Want-to-Thank-Po-Ling Squash-the-Sombrero Johnson? I had my own viral moment in miniature. But was it worth it?And yet, as I wandered the streets in lockdown, ordinaryObserverreaders and their dogs regularly stood at reasonable distances and told me these columns made them feel less alone, and for a moment I understood how Christ felt when all those lepers told him he was a really great bloke. I doubt anything like that ever happens to Giles Coren. Or to Jesus, to be honest, who was probably sick to the back teeth of all those selfish lepers.But here’s the rub. I appreciate that, as someone who is too tight to advertise his tours, and who has not been invited on toThe Graham Norton Show, the market penetration achieved by online circulation of a popularObservercolumn probably sells me more than a few standup comedy seats. Maybe I need this. That said, twice as many people come to see me live as read theObserver,though this can be explained by lots of angry middle-aged men bringing their bored wives with them.But since Elon Musk showed social media how to downgrade the visibility of liberal comment and monetise the outraged engagement caused by right-skewed clickbait, I have watched my online views wither.Social mediais engineered to suppress the material you are reading now.

If crisis strikes, the government needs a strategy to protect us allSun 16 Mar 2025 08.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 16.13 EDTShareIhate to sound like aprepper, but I feel bound to confess that over the past month I’ve been stockpiling food. I think, if you can, you should do the same. I’ve put aside 25kg of rice, 15kg of dried chickpeas, 15kg of bread flour, 7kg of chapati flour, 5kg of oats, six litres of vegetable oil, a slab of tinned tomatoes, some nuts and dried fruit. This, with the vegetables we grow, represents about two months’ supply for our family.I hope the chances of having to use our stockpile are small. But if we no longer need this insurance, we can eat it. Strange as it may sound, I see this hoarding as pro-social. Building a reserve while food is abundant reduces demand in a crisis. Community stockpiling and resilience planning would be better still. But I’m not waiting.Researchingmy book Regenesis, I learned about the extraordinary reliance of food-importing nations on the US. Almost 60% of thecalories grown by farmerstake the form of wheat, rice, maize and soya beans. Asnations have polarisedinto super-exporters and super-importers, production for export has become highly concentrated in a handful of countries. The US isamong the biggest exportersofall four commodities.A deliberate effort to cut off the UK seems unlikely. But that’s not the issue. The issue is that even a modest interruption in supply, which Donald Trump’s antics render more likely, could trigger sudden global failure in the food system. Interruption risks include software outages, military attacks on the straits and canals through whichhuge volumes of food pass, and the collapse of one of the corporate food giants that have becometoo big to fail.Trump will also exacerbate environmental shocks. The gathering“whiplash effect”– moderate weather replaced by a cycle of droughts and floods – is one of the factors that could causesynchronised crop failurein key growing regions.Since 2015,a seriesofpapersin thescientific presshave warned that the global food system issuffering structural problemssimilar to those afflicting the global financial system before 2008. There has been arapid loss of diversity, redundancy and otherkey elements of systemic resilience. The food system showssigns of “flickering”: widening fluctuations in output values (such as commodity prices)that presage collapse. Governments were able to prevent financial collapse in 2008 by issuing future money. They cannot prevent food system collapse by issuing future food.Since then,the warningshaveonly intensified. Some governments have heeded them.China,Japan,SwitzerlandandNorwayinvest in stockpiles of grain. Food reserves not only insure against disaster but can be used as buffers to preventprices from surging.View image in fullscreenA Led By Donkeys billboard featuring Michael Gove in Stoke on Trent, England, 2021.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty ImagesWhen I asked the UK government whether it holds strategic food reserves, it blanked my question. When I pressed, it claimed “we don’t comment on matters that pertain to national security”. That’s a wretched excuse. Other governments keep their people informed on this issue, fostering trust and reassurance. Even Boris Johnson’s regimeresponded to my questionhonestly in 2020. The answer was “no” then, and I suspect it remains “no” today, which probably explains this ridiculous obfuscation.As the National Preparedness Commission, whichreported on UK food securitylast month, notes: “If an absence of policy is for fear of worrying the public, this is a risky strategy. The public needs to be engaged as part of preparation.” Its report reveals almost comical failures by successive governments either totake the issue seriouslyor to involve us in addressing it. They have slalomed round every opportunity to enhance the food system’s resilience. Rather than developing a security plan, the government vests blind faith in a commercial sector whose just-in-time logistics expose us to severe risk.Reserves are a necessary but not sufficient means of building resilience. While bearing in mind that food nationalism is not the same as food security (in some respects it’s the opposite, as global tradeprotects us from local harvest failure), here are some further steps the government could take.View image in fullscreenA second world war Dig for Victory leafletPhotograph: LH Images/AlamyThe UK produces plenty of grain, but far too little feeds people directly. You might be aware of thepreposterous cosmetic standardsthat supermarkets impose on fruit and vegetable growers. You might be less aware that mills and other processors impose even stricter standards. To give one example, we can make bread from a wide range of flours. But as a farmer explained to me, the mills demand “total consistency. Every loaf has to be the same, so every load of grain must fit the specs. They want a protein content of over 12%, a Hagberg falling number of over 300 and a water content of 15%. If we miss any of that, it’s disqualified as milling wheat and goes for animal feed instead, and we get a lower price. They don’t make concessions. They don’t accept suggestions.” Relaxing such standards could make much more food available for human consumption.To an even greater degree, so can reducing the animal products we eat. Globally, a plant-based dietrequires 76% less landthan the current average diet. Here, 85% of our farmland isused for feeding livestock. Even sheep, which most people imagine subsist only on grass, consumehundreds of thousands of tonnesof supplementary cereals and oilseeds.A government strategy to reduce livestock consumption could secure both food system resilience and ecological resilience, as ourremarkably unproductive uplandscould be rewilded. One good thing the government is doing is accelerating theapproval of alternatives.Precision fermentation, to give one example, could greatly enhance our protein production, radically reducing imports of both food and fertiliser.Replacing food imports does little for resilience if it means increasing fertiliser imports, on which theUK remains highly dependent. We should seek to maintain high yields with fewer inputs. If we understood soil better, we could rely more on biology (the fascinating interactionsbetween plants and microbes) and less on chemistry. There have beensome recent breakthroughs, but soil science remains woefully underfunded.Governments need to break up corporate monopolies: anti-trust laws should be strong and intellectual property rights should be weak. They should involve us in decision-making, asTaiwan’s has donewhen faced with crises. They should assume a duty to ensure everyone, including people in poverty, is well fed at all times. Currently, if crisis strikes you’re stuffed. Sorry, I mean starved.Our provisions are now boxed and stacked. Some of my friends and neighbours have followed suit. But we do this in the knowledge that individual action is never enough. No one is secure until everyone is secure, especially those in greatest need. My full shelves give me no satisfaction. It shouldn’t have to come to this.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionEmergency planningFood & drink industryFarmingTrade policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But how many intimate gestures of love, care and connection are they missing out on?Sun 16 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 17.58 EDTShareYou wouldn’t think a deep dive on slime-squishing and head-scratching videos could be haunting, but a recent study on ASMR content left me haunted and also slightly grossed out.ASMR, for those not particularly online, is a content genre named after the feeling it provokes in some viewers:autonomous sensory meridian response, a pseudoscientific name for a pleasurable tingling accompanied by a sense of calm. If you’re moderately online, you may know it as “those whispering and tapping videos” – there is lots of that, plus scratching, slime and gentle brushing. But there is much more to it, as I discovered reading a report byinnovation agency Revealing Reality, including subgenres that mimic physical touch. You can watch ASMR-ists pretend to brush your hair, groom you for nits or wipe your “face” – the camera – with a spit-moistened finger (that is the gross bit).Many of ASMR’s young consumers saythey watch to soothe feelings of being overwhelmedby the outside world. A subset described other feelings the videos gave them: solace, safety and the sensations they associate with being loved. One fan explained that her mum used to give her nightly head massages; now, watching head-scratching videos helped her sleep. “People like to feel taken care of,” a creator theorised.We all get calm and comfort from different things (crisps andchickenshere), but we’re creatures who need physical connection; we’re mammals, primates. It feels a bit melancholy, young people using YouTube to conjure the feeling of intimate gestures of love and care and connection, seeking what the report calls a “digital response to fundamental human needs … that previously would have been met through embodied experiences”.I found myself wondering what “embodied experiences” I would like to recreate. The first that came to mind related to our dog, who died 18 months ago: rubbing the floppy silk of his ears between finger and thumb; cupping my palm over the dome of his anxious little skull with thumb and middle finger; stroking the bald patches behind his ears; scratching his back on the spot just in front of his rear legs that made him reflexively paw the air. Looking at pictures of him conjured other sense memories: the roughness of his pink and black paw pads; running my hands along the swooping curve of his hairless belly; fluffing the rosette on his chest where the hair whorled in different directions with a fingertip. I can still remember how that felt, just.We live and feel those moments, then we honour them and keep them alive by missing how they feltThen there are bigger, headier, physical sensations around my sons’ birth and infancy; you’re never more animal than at those times. I remember the astonishing slither of a heel along my lower ribs from the inside; how the sudden, comic poke of a sharp elbow felt. I would give a lot to feel, just momentarily, that singular joy of being inhabited. I’d love to relive my now-huge younger son curled against my shoulder after a feed, my palm spanning his back, massaging an air bubble through his still-shrimpy newborn body.But all that stuff is gone: baths and hair washes; feeling hot wriggly bodies slip into stillness as they fell asleep against me. It’s not just the kids: there is the way an intensely anticipated first kiss felt both inevitable and absolutely surprising. Never again will I feel the bulletproof exhilaration of galloping across moorland, pony sweat and peat in my nostrils, to a soundtrack of curlews and lapwings – too old, too scared. My mum was small but her love felt gigantic. When I try to conjure what it felt like to hold my cheek against her very soft one, I can almost get there, but not quite.That is sad, but it is OK. Physical sensations are powerful and precious because they are finite; no ASMR alchemy or immersive VR experience could come close to recreating them, and I would far rather have the memory than an ersatz version anyway. We live and feel those moments, then we honour them and keep them alive by missing how they felt. But we also keep holding, touching the people and creatures we love, and that means we are always laying down new sense memories of connection.

Sorting out our broken social care system would be up there too. One thing that wouldn’t feature: cutting disability benefits.Yet last week Keir Starmer attempted to frame cutting the disability benefits bill asa moral, not just economic, imperative– that Labour is “the party of work” and has a duty to reduce welfare costs. To be clear: there is a broad consensus that the welfare system is working badly for disabled people and many are not getting the support they need to move into work, but that’s a world away from the £6bn of welfare cuts being considered by the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are also more people claiminghealth-related benefits– both means-tested out-of-work benefits, and the personal independence payment (Pip) that helps meet the additional costs of disability, which isn’t means-tested and is paid regardless of someone’s work status. One in 10 working-age adults now receive health-related benefits, up from one in 14 before the pandemic. While most new claims still come from those aged 40-64, the rate of growth has been fastest for the under-40s, and there has been an increase in mental health claims across all ages: 37% of new claims,compared with 28% in 2019.Some people have superimposed their own pet theory on to these figures: this is about 20-something snowflakes identifying as depressed, or the legacy of long Covid, for example. The truth is a lot more complex, and the consensus among policy wonks is that we don’t fully understand it. No other wealthy country has experienced a trend as marked as this, suggesting it’s not purely about Covid or the cost of living (though it’s worth noting the UK is only now spendingroughly the averagefor comparable countries on disability benefits). It’s more likely to be a product of how these have interacted with the UK’s public services and welfare system. Higher mortality rates, including more deaths as a result of alcohol, suicide and drugs, provide objective evidence that Britain has gotphysically and mentally sickersince 2020. The low rates of out-of-work benefits for those who lose their jobs – eroded since 2010 – have probably pushed more people towards applying for disability benefits than in other countries. Long NHS waiting lists, including for pain-relieving operations and mental health therapies, suggest many people’s spells out of work will be significantly extended because they can’t get the treatment they need, with terrible consequences for their long-term employment prospects. Employers are often not flexible enough about making adjustments to allow people to return to work aftera period of absence.There’s no question this needs addressing. But there are two versions of welfare reform. The first is premised on the assumption most people don’t want to be stuck at home on benefits, but are being consigned to the statistical category of “long-term sick” through poor public services and a lack of employment support. The second takes as its starting point the idea that people on disability benefits are more likely to be feckless scroungers who need to be pushed to work through benefits cuts and sanctions.‘There is no moral case’: Labour divided over prospect of benefit cutsRead moreOf course you will always be able to find some people who take liberties with work. But the idea this is the main issue is plain wrong; evidence suggests it is very difficult to qualify for Pip, for example: whistleblower assessors who worked for the private companies administering it flagged how much pressure they were under tolimit successful claims; and almost a third of children with disabilities serious enough to qualify for disability benefits in childhood find themselves ineligible for Pipwhen they turn 16.Much of whatLiz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, has said recognises the lack of flexibility and support in the labour market for people with health issues. Some, for example, may be scared of trialling going back to work in case it’s used as evidence to strip them of Pip even if it doesn’t work out. Fixing this would deliver long-term savings but requires upfront investment. And in the absence of a clear set of governing values, this is a government overwhelmingly being driven by Treasury thinking: slashing back the state to boost defence spending and avoid putting up taxes.The suggestion has been that the government will cut an eye-watering £6bn from the annual welfare bill, making Pipeven harder to claim, and axing the health-related elements of universal credit, while investing just £1bn in employment support programmes. All this will do is push up already-high rates of disability poverty.Starmer aides have been busy briefing that cutting these benefits willresonate with swing voters. That seems unlikely to placate the Labour MPs – including frontbenchers and the normally loyal – who are angry about this not because they think it’s a vote loser, but because they think it’s immoral. Benefits have been pared to the bone since 2010 by successive Conservative chancellors – the poorest decile of families with children lost an astounding £6,000 a year on average between 2010 and 2024 as a result ofchanges to the tax-benefit system. Unless chancellor Rachel Reeves finds a way of channelling more support to low-income parents, child poverty is predicted to increase by 400,000 by theend of Labour’s first term. If these welfare cuts get pushed through, that figure will be even higher. How on earth are Labour MPs supposed to defend that kind of record?In the wake of a backlash that has spannedcabinet ministers, former chancellor Ed Balls, disability charities and thinktanks such as the Resolution Foundation, there are signs that the government may be resiling fromcutting the levels of Pip. But it appears to be standing firm on making it harder to claim in the first place andreducing other disability benefits. Which makes it very hard to take at face value the government’s claim that this is about helping more disabled people back into work. It appears to be driven more by saving money in a way that hits some of society’s most vulnerable, but isn’t too politically painful.Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsBenefitsOpinionKeir StarmerWelfareWork & careersPovertyLiz KendallDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

This is my world: welcome!Nell FrizzellWhile writing my book, I asked on social media for stories from parents suffering extreme sleep deprivation. It was hilarious – and frighteningSun 16 Mar 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 17.32 EDTShareSleep is a feminist issue. Or should I say, lack of sleep is a feminist issue. During a particularly thickly cut bout of tiredness, when my son was a newborn, I became so convinced that my tiny, milk-stained baby had rolled out of my arms and somehow, unfathomably out of the room, into the night outside that I started crawling along the floor of our hallway, in the dark, sobbing. The fact that the boy couldn’t yet roll over, was in his cot, and the door was closed, while my partner snored like a mechanical digger beside him, could not penetrate the exhausted fug of terror that had enveloped me after weeks, months of broken, fluttering, barely snatched rest.Whether it’s waking up every 45 minutes to feed a screaming baby, making shopping lists while roasting under the duvet in an insomniac hormonal flush, staying up past midnight to clean the house once your children are in bed, or setting the alarm for 4.45am so you can get your elderly mother to the toilet before she has an accident; the night shift of unpaid, unrecognised and uncelebrated domestic labour is still predominantly undertaken by women. While the Office for National Statisticsfound that in 2022, almost 4.9 million (56%) night-time workers were male and almost 3.9 million (44%) were female, this does not by any means mean that women are getting moresleep. I very much doubt that it was a breastfeeding woman who smugly declared Friday 14 March as World Sleep Day.After becoming a parent, I slipped into a twilight zone of sleeplessness in which I felt my eyes were coated in sand, my bones seemed to creak against each other, and my tongue had the consistency and flavour of an old pub carpet tile. I stared into the halogen-stained night wondering why my clothes were on backwards, why there was a packet of almonds in my underwear drawer and when I’d last brushed my teeth. And the things I did; the dangerous, hallucinogenic, unfathomable acts of disorientation, distraction and confusion. Putting my shoes neatly in the bin, forgetting how to spell my own name, calmly putting my phone, keys or dirty nappies in the washing machine, “seeing” my baby rolling under the bed when he was in fact still in my arms; these things are the familiar stuff of banter outside the school gates. And yet, if we dig beneath them for a second, what does it say about the mental capacity of the millions of people carrying the weight of their helpless infant’s survival, day in, day out?Studies have shown thatsleep deprivationcauses impairment of our cognitive and motor skills equivalent to being floridly drunk. Being awake for 24 hours, as some parents and carers will certainly be, is the equivalent to being well over thelimit for drink-drivingin some countries. If I was in this state, while walking my baby or mother along the river, because I’d been downing whisky for breakfast or getting baked on skunk at the kitchen table, social services might well be called. People would worry. Authorities might intervene. But because my exhaustion was just the result of that miserable cocktail of breastfeeding, an unfair share of housework and the unfathomable crying of a baby in the night, I was simply left to get on with it.When I was writing my bookHolding the Baby, I asked on social media for stories from people clenched in the jaws of parental sleep deprivation. What I got back was hilarious and frightening in equal measure; people backing cars over their (mercifully empty) buggies; parents trying to soothe a pillow as their child cried in the cot beside them; women making tea out of dishwasher tablets and not only brushing their teeth with hand soap but not even realising until days later. While it’s tempting to brush these off with a smile and nod of recognition, every single one speaks to the fact that actual human health and life is frequently put at risk by chronic sleep-deprivation. If someone mistakes haemorrhoid cream for toothpaste or leaves their baby at the fish counter of a supermarket, why do we shrug it off as embarrassing and unavoidable? Well, if I may be so bold, perhaps because these experiences have been largely, and historically, experienced by low status and marginalised people; women, disabled people, people on low incomes, people of colour, carers. So even when this sort of “domestic tiredness” is experienced by a male or non-binary parent, the assumption that they just have to get on with it comes from a history of female tiredness being ignored.After seven years, I recently became a parent again, for the second time; I am edging towards that inky, panicked state of sleeplessness, in full knowledge that I may well lose my mind, and certainly my health. A lack of sleep,according to an articleI read while my daughter churned and grunted in the bed beside me, hasbeen associated withan increase in the likelihood of developing dementia, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and even cancers of the breast, colon, ovaries and prostate. These articles are informative, sure, but are they helpful? Someone reading books likeWhy We Sleep– which frighten the living daylights out of anyone who’s been awake for 20 hours and is currently playing “Hairdryer Sounds 2 hours ASMR White Noise” on their phone in the pointless hope that it will send their baby to sleep – does not benefit from the knowledge that their exhaustion is making them ill. It doesn’t put their mind at rest – nor help to settle their dependents.What they would benefit from, of course, would be free, state-funded childcare, equal domestic labour, and compulsory parental leave for both partners. And probably secure housing, a well-funded NHS and access to green space to boot. But I suppose that’s just a dream.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionSleepHealthHealth & wellbeingFamilyWomencommentShareReuse this content"

I spoke to her this week, to get a sense of how those at the sharp end of the looming changes may be feeling.The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, has insisted the governmentdid not “start from a spreadsheet”when drawing up the plans, but officials privately make no bones about the fact they did have a savings target.Cutting £5bn from the welfare bill will help Rachel Reeves to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules – and the row over welfare is likely to be the first of many battles, as she looks for further savings in June’s spending review.“They are coming at it from completely the wrong angle,” says Vickers. “It’s almost as if they’re trying to tackle the outcome, not the root causes.”View image in fullscreenCarol Vickers and her assistance dog Bella.Photograph: Edited with Google AIPip is paid regardless of whether the recipient is in work. Vickers says the £100-ish a week she gets on the lower rate does not meet the extra costs of coping with her condition, which she reckons are about £1,000 a month – but helps her to stay in her job, in the education sector. She also has a small craft business, making jewellery.“To an extent, it’s helping keep me in work,” she says. “The fact I can run my 13-year-old car means I can keep my job; the fact that I can pay for my assistance dog, keeps me independent.”Reports this weekendsuggest Kendall may withdraw plans to freeze the value of Pip next year, after a cabinet backlash; but the intention still appears to be to make it much harder to claim. Yet like many others who engage with the system, Vickers says it is already “degrading”.“They approach it as if you are a liar or you’re trying to play the system somehow, when all you’re trying to do is stay in work or stay as a contributing member of society”.As well as cutting the bill for Pip, which isprojected to soar to £30bnwithout intervention, ministers are expected to reduce the amount paid to the “limited capability for work related activity” (LCWRA) group of universal credit claimants.These people, judged too sick to be in a job, receive an extra £416 a month on top of the basic universal credit payment – more than doubling it for a single person under 25 – and do not face the threat of having their benefits deducted if they fail to carry out work-related activities.Experts say the gulf in generosity between the basic level of UC and this group may have helped contribute to the sharp increase of claimants in recent years, by making it more worthwhile to jump through the requisite hoops.But given charities say the basic rate of UC is all but impossible to live on – the Joseph Rowntree Foundation saysfive out of six households on UC are going without essentialssuch as heating or food – it seems unlikely the main problem here is that LCWRA payments are too lavish.Andrecent research by the Learning and Work Foundationsaid the DWP tended to leave most disabled claimants with little or no practical help.Kendall and her DWP colleague, the employment minister, Alison McGovern, are keen to change that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coming over all moral, and especially about a plan to make swingeing upfront cuts that will leave many people fearful about losing the support they rely on?

More than a quarter of a century has passed since another Labour prime minister, one Tony Blair, vented hisfrustration with the public sectorby complaining that trying to reform government had left him with “scars on my back”. In similar vein, David Cameron’s lot used to excuse their struggles to get stuff done by blaming resistance from the amorphous administrative “Blob”.Dominic Cummings told Boris Johnsonthat the solution was to pack Number 10 with “weirdos”, “misfits” and “wild cards” – a self-description if ever there was one – while purging the senior civil service. He was still working his way through his“shit list” of mandarinswhen he got the boot himself. You will not recall the Johnson administration as an able and stable outfit dedicated to serving the needs of the public. The grim chaos of that period is a warning to the current government that braggadocio, stunts and wheezes will not make the state smarter.Most prime ministers become exasperated with the bureaucracy under them at some point. It has taken eight months for Sir Keir to conclude that a “weak”, “overstretched” and “unfocused” state isfailing to properly perform its “core purposes”. He’s not wrong. The contract between government and citizenry is in a bad way. “The public has lost faith in the state to deliver,” says one cabinet minister who worries about this a lot. “People find themselves paying more in tax, but do they feel the benefit in the public realm? They don’t.”Fixing this should be one of Labour’s most pressing priorities. It inherited a flatlining economy, faces escalating geopolitical threats that demand more funding for defence, and money is tight.Backbench rebellionis brewing over plans to cut billions from the rising welfare bill by reducing some incapacity benefits. Ministerial mutiny is stirring over the squeeze to departmental budgets beingdemanded by the Treasuryso that Rachel Reeves doesn’t breach her own fiscal rules. That increases the imperative to extract maximum value from every taxpayer penny.Evidence that government is not a burden on people’s backs is critical to Labour’s its chances of re-electionIt is fundamental to Labour’s case that the state can be a “force for good”. Proving this to be true is essential if the populist right is to be seen off. Evidence that government is not a burden on people’s backs, but an enabler that improves their lives, is critical to its chances of re-election.As thinking at Number 10 has developed, they have settled on some broad conclusions. One is that too much power has been subcontracted toquasi-autonomous organisationsknown as “arm’s length bodies” within government and as quangos to everyone else.In a speechdelivered at a business campus in Hull, where the first bottle of Dettol was produced, the prime minister presented himself as the antiseptic to what he disdained as the “watchdog state”, “a cottage industry of checkers and blockers” that he portrayed as antithetical to “democratic accountability”.He has taken a big first scalp, and with it a serious gamble, by announcing that NHS England, the largest quango of them all,will be abolished. The sorry history of that organisation serves as a caution about how not to do reform. NHS England was set up by the Cameron government to put distance between ministers and the day-to-day operations of the health service. But the Department of Health was still, and rightly, held responsible for the performance of the NHS, and ministers still, and inevitably, wanted a lot of say over how it was run.There will be few mournersat the funeral of NHS England, because it created a micro-managing double-layer of management accompanied by confusion about lines of command and accountability. A cabinet colleague reports that Wes Streeting decided to act because “he knew what he wanted to do with the health service, but found that he had a system without levers”. To the dustbin of history goes a previous government’s botched attempt to extract more from one of the most expensive and essential arms of the state. Another reorganisation of the NHS will cause near-term upheaval, but the health secretaryhas reassured twitchy cabinet colleaguesthat it will pay a dividend over the longer term in delivering better performance. His personal ambitions, and the government’s hopes of convincing voters that it is turning around the NHS, depend on his being right.Sir Keir says every other quango will have to justify its existence. Yet here we encounter contradictory thinking. Before it has fully audited the purpose and quality of quangos already in place, Labour has been merrily setting up ahost of new ones, from the Independent Football Regulator to GB Energy. Its unhappiest offspring is the Office for Value for Money (OVfM). Championed by the chancellor, its supposed role is to invigilate government spending to ensure that it is not wasteful. When the unit was scrutinised by the Labour-chaired Treasury select committee,the MPs concludedthat it was “an understaffed, poorly defined organisation which has been set up with a vague remit and no clear plan to measure its effectiveness”. Ouch. The OVfM does not sound like it is offering value for money. Labour’s thinking about the efficient state needs more work.About half of government interactions with the public are still paper-basedAnother area where ministers want radical change is Whitehall. Cabinet ministers protest that it is not their intention to “beat up” the civil service Cummings-style while also insisting that reform is long overdue. Tony Blair, who wasn’t much interested in the wiring of the state when he was prime minister, never really got to grips with this. Jonathan Powell, chief of staff during the Blair years and a figureof significant influenceonce more since his return as national security adviser, once told me that their failure to reform the civil service was his greatest regret about New Labour. Another veteran of that era,Pat McFadden, the endearingly lugubrious Cabinet Office minister, is leading the push. He denies that his role model is Elon Musk and says he won’t be wielding a chainsaw. Let’s call it a hedge-trimmer then. He wants a slimmer civil service that weeds out its underperformers and thinks less cautiously.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether the politician speaking is Labour or Tory, the charge list includes inertia, group-think, arse-covering, being too comfortable with mediocrity and obsessing over process at the expense of outcomes. Funnily enough, the professional deformations that politicians ascribe to civil servants sound awfully like their own. Mr McFadden says “governing as usual” is for the birds and the future state must work more like a startup by adopting a “test-and-learn” mindset to find creative ways to improve delivery. He wants Whitehall todevelop an appetite for risk, because “if we’re terrified of failure we’ll never innovate”. Absolutely. But mistakes can’t be learned from unless they are acknowledged and owned. That will be counter-cultural not just for the civil service but a shock to the system for politicians as well. Good luck with that. I’ll treatMr McFadden to a ticketto a Bruce Springsteen concert if he can make it happen.The subject that most excites some ministers is “digital reform”. The need is urgent. Ridiculously, about half of the government’s digital budget is currently spent on maintaining and keeping secure data systems, some of which are so out of date they go back to the 1970s. About half of government interactions with the public arestill paper-based. Government digital services have been consolidated in Peter Kyle’s department. The technology secretary tells me that his mission is to make the way government interacts with the public “fit for the age we’re living in” “to look and feel more like bank and travel services do now”. In June, he will launch thegov.uk appdesigned to offer access to a wide range of state services.A ChatGPT fan,he is also an evangelist for how AI can be exploited to make the state a better servant of the people.There are many unanswered questions about the extent to which digitising government will make it more productive. What we do know is that AI can’t change a dressing or fill a pothole. Ministers shouldn’t be beguiled by some fantasy that there’s a single shiny gizmo that will magically make everything better. “Smarter government” will require bold thinking, remorseless attention to detail and sustained effort over many years. If it were easy, successive prime ministers wouldn’t have been gnashing their teeth about it for so long.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealth policyEnglandKeir StarmerPat McFaddenPeter KyleHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet the expected byelection inRuncorn and Helsbyis freighted with significance. This first big electoral test for Sir Keir Starmer’s government could also become one of its defining political moments.Labour is on the back foot as the byelection looms. The party is well down in thepolls, Sir Keir’s ratings are poor, anda mere 19%of the public approve of the government’s record. The byelection, likely to take place alongside thelocal electionson the resonant date of 1 May, will follow a government spring economic statement that is expected to signal bleak financial forecasts, unpopular new spending cuts and bitter internal divisions.The immediate cause of the contest only adds to Labour’s problems. Mike Amesbury won the seat for Labour last July. In October, however, he wasfilmed punching a constituentin a Frodsham street. Charged with assault, he pleaded guilty and was given a 10-week prison sentence, suspended for two years following an appeal. The conviction triggered an MP-recall petition for the Cheshire constituency, but Mr Amesbury has now pre‑empted this byresigning.Ordinarily, Labour might have relatively little trouble retaining the seat, even in these unsavoury circumstances. Runcorn and Helsby is the party’s49th safest seatin the UK (out of the 411 it won last year). Mr Amesbury took 53% of the vote in 2024 and had a 35-point lead over his nearest challenger. Labour can afford to take a hit to its vote but still hold on.However, Labour’s byelection danger lights are flashing bright red. In 2024, Reform UK came second here, with the Tories third, making this one of the89 seatsin which Reform UK is now Labour’s main challenger. In other circumstances, Runcorn and Helsby would still be way down the list of those 89 Reform UK targets. But it is the one in the spotlight now, and both parties know it.Constituency pollssuggest Reform UK is ahead.Labour is not the only one with problems. Reform UK is having a torrid 2025 itself.Nigel Faragehas been humiliated by Donald Trump’s pro-Russia lurches on Ukraine.The rowbetween Mr Farage and Rupert Lowe has exposed dark political divides. A split may loom, with Mr Lowe perhaps embracing the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, amid the encouragement of Elon Musk. None of this is likely to help Reform UK’s task.How much impact this all has on the doorsteps in Runcorn and Helsby by May Day is hard to predict. The contest will also be difficult for the third-place Conservatives, internally conflicted over Reform UK and flailing under Kemi Badenoch. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens, respectively a distant fourth and fifth last July, have difficult tactical choices too. It all guarantees a bitter fight, which isalready revving up.Even a narrow Labour win would help Sir Keir, take some wind out of Reform UK’s sails, and draw sighs of relief from Mrs Badenoch. A Reform UK win, however, would cause turmoil in Labour and theConservatives, convincing each that the principal threat is indeed from Mr Farage, but dividing both parties over how to respond – and triggering leadership speculation. What cannot be disputed is that the result will have big consequences. That late-night punch in a Frodsham street may have changed the face of British politics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The results, from a team led by Prof Huan Zhong at Nanjing University, China, are not definitive and require corroboration. But analysis showing that plastics could limit photosynthesis (the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy) must be taken seriously. If the researchers are correct, and staple crops are being reduced by about 12%, there are huge implications for global agriculture and food supplies. This could inject new urgency into efforts to tackle plastic pollution.There is no single route by which microplastic particles inhibit plants from growing. The overall effect is attributed to a combination of blocked sunlight and nutrients, and damage to soil and cells. This can lead to reduced levels of chlorophyll – the pigment enabling photosynthesis. When the researchers modelled the crop losses caused by an effect of this size, they found Asia was hardest hit, potentially contributing to food insecurity and worsening hunger.The extent of the contamination of the Earth by microplastics has been widely documented. The tiny particles that are formed when plastics break down in the environment have been found in humansemen,breast milk,brains, livers and bone marrow, and in remote areas including the Arctic seas. The more than 500m tonnes of plastics that are produced annually, most of which are dumped rather than recycled, leave their mark everywhere. Plastic is already understood to pose serious hazards to animals including sea creatures, which can be poisoned and injured by it. It also ruins landscapes, with serious implications for the people who live in them and anyone trying to make a living from tourism.But there is still much to learn about the less obvious forms of damage caused by plastic pollution to humans and ecoystems. Links to strokes, heart attacks and preterm births are all cause for concern. One new study, presented at a conference in January, found that microplastic pollution was50% higher in the placentasof babies born prematurely.Talks in South Korea aimed at agreeing a UN treaty on plastic pollutionended in failurein December. Almost all single-use plastics are made from fossil fuels, and fossil-fuel states and businesses oppose any limits on production. Record numbers of industry representatives at the summit meant thatlobbyistsoutnumbered those attending for European governments. Perhaps as a result, though more than 100 countries supported a draft text including legally binding reductions and the phase-out of some substances, no final deal was reached.Whentalksreconvene in Switzerland later this year, these states must turn up with a plan. Under Donald Trump, the US is likely to ally itself with Russia and Saudi Arabia, meaning that making a deal will be even harder this time round. But the enormous volume of plastic waste, and the growing evidence of the range of harms it causes, mean action must be taken. Plastic will continue to have its uses, but the proliferation of single-use items, including packaging, is out of control.Just 9%of plastic gets recycled – and the recycling process itselfcan increase toxicity. Fossil-fuel interests must be confronted over plastic pollution just as they are challenged over global heating caused by coal, oil and gas.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Headcount reductions were very much in vogue in the Thatcher era, when she is said to have remarked that there were too many doctors working in theDepartment of Health.Critics thought that her “efficiency cuts” would be better characterised as inefficiency cuts, placing more burden on overstretched staff.The thinktank, however, may be on the verge of a conceptual breakthrough, as you report that it will be looking at “further planning changes, including how to get a third runway at Heathrow built within the parliament”.Even William Morris, in his utopian classicNews From Nowhere, could only envisage the parliament building converted into a dung market. Either way, could parliamentarians be contemplating turning the chainsaw on themselves, starting with the House of Lords?Dr Anthony IsaacsLondonThe name “operation chainsaw” gives the strongest indication possible of the crass nature of this exercise. The prime minister and his chums have clearly been fed the infants’ business management handbook. No one will cavil that the nation requires effective and efficient government organisations and civil service.But the government should set out a prioritised action plan that answers three questions: where are we now, where do we want to be, and what resources – human and financial – do we need to get there? It also needs to behave with decency and help redundant employees get jobs elsewhere.Chris HodgkinsLondonI take it thatKeir Starmerhas an app handy that will allow storage tank dips to be remotely witnessed at 3am in the teeth of a howling gale (excise officers), or the state of a woodland to be gauged (forestry officers), or the health of personal independence payment claimants (Department for Work and Pensions officials). Actually scrub that last one. The DWP doesn’t work for anyone, least of all the claimants.Polly LlwynfedwenAberhonddu, PowysI am reminded of a time around 40 years ago, when some idiotic Treasury individuals tried to impose manpower cuts on what was then the Department of Health and Social Security. My father, then director of establishments, responded in the best traditions ofYes Minister: “What would you like us not to do?”Christopher HouseHertfordKeir Starmer proposes increased use of artificial intelligence to improve the civil service. Wouldn’t a logical first step have been to first try greater use of human intelligence?John RushtonBridge of Weir, RenfrewshirePerhaps Keir Starmer could set up a department for underperformance, mergers and passivity (Dump).

Your article draws on the ill-will whipped up by some, but overlooks the evidence and the legacy of designation decisions made decades ago. It quotes statistics from ourhealth check report, but what isn’t mentioned is the finding that nature decline in national parks is happening in spite of the designation, not because of it. The key conclusion of the report is that national parks need greater power and funding in the face of the global climate and biodiversity crisis.In Scotland, national parks are leading the way –Cairngorms Connectis the UK’s largest habitat restoration across 600 square kilometres. And evidence from Scottish Environment Link found that the two Scottish national parks generate more than £700m per year, investing in nature, landscape and community regeneration, supporting hundreds of jobs directly and thousands through the wider economy.The UK’s first national park was established in 1951 in the Peak District by a postwar government that could see the power in protecting the nation’s finest landscapes, investing in public health and wellbeing, and regenerating rural communities. The true benefit and purpose of national park designation is to create a legacy. The challenge facing a government designating new national parks is in creating the space for informed and curious debate, focusing on what unites us rather than divides us.Dr Rose O’NeillChief executive, Campaign for National ParksDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

In the first place, DNA from the cells could be analysed to help scientists understand the genetic variation of different populations, informing various conservation efforts. That DNA is of higher quality if extracted from cells that are alive.But if cells from poo can be cultured and grown it raises another possibility: the creation of entire animals using state-of-art assisted reproductive technologies.These include cloning – in which the nucleus of a cell is inserted into a donor egg, an electric impulse is applied, and the resulting embryo is implanted into a surrogate to produce a genetic “twin” of the original animal.Perhaps more exciting still is the possibility of reprogramming the cells so that they have the capacity to become any cell type. Crucially,research in micehas suggested such cells can be turned into sperm and eggs – meaning they could be used in IVF-type techniques to produce offspring.View image in fullscreenIf cells from poo can be cultured and grown it raises another possibility: the creation of entire animals using state-of-art assisted reproductive technologies.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“If you use eggs and sperm, you get to leverage sexual reproduction and all of the recombination that happens during those events, and you get to really start to build the potential for adaptation to environmental stress,” said Dr Ashlee Hutchinson, who came up with the idea of the poo zoo and is a programme manager ofRevive & Restore, a US-based conservation organisation that is funding the work.Put simply, by creating sex cells in a laboratory, it is possible to harness the genetic diversity of a species without having to bring together individual animals – who might be in different parts of the world, or otherwise inaccessible – or needing to collect their sperm and eggs.Reprogrammed cells could also allow scientists to use gene-editing techniques to understand, for example, the genes involved in wildlife diseases or environmental adaptations – information that could subsequently be used to engineer greater resilience into a species, for example by screening sex cells or embryos for certain genes, or even through gene editing.Gene editing is already being explored by Revive and Restoreto bring back the extinct Passenger Pigeon, and by the bioscience company Colossal in an attempt torevive the woolly mammoth.Freezing cultured cells in liquid nitrogen at -196C means they can be preserved indefinitely, allowing the DNA they contain to potentially be used in applications not yet dreamed of.The biobanking of cells and tissues of endangered species, from semen and ovarian tissue to skin cells, for genetic rescue has already been embraced by charities and organisations, from the UK-basedNature’s Safeto San Diego’sFrozen Zoo.But this typically involves taking cells or tissues from the animal itself, whether alive or after it has died. By contrast, taking cells from poo is non-invasive and does not involve capture, raising the possibility of collecting them from even the most elusive creatures – an approach that could enable scientists access to greater genetic diversity by sampling wild populations.“It’s a case of how can we, en masse, collect living cells in as many species as we can to maintain diversity that we’re losing at a terrifying rate,” said Dr Rhiannon Bolton, a researcher on the project from Chester zoo, a charity that is collaborating on the project.But the approach is not without challenges.

The team are already working on a solution – using dilution to remove the bacteria.“Then we culture [the animal cells] in antibiotics and antifungals,” Williams said.But even if living cells can be isolated from poo and cultured, there are hurdles to clear before offspring can be produced. Among them is the lack of understanding of the reproductive physiology of many animals, meaning the focus, at least initially, is likely to be on well-studied species.View image in fullscreenThe poo zoo team say modern and traditional methods can work in parallel.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianYet while the poo zoo is in its infancy, the team have form: Williams also leads an endeavour to save the northern white rhino by using lab-based methods to produce a large number of eggs from rhino ovarian tissue while, among other projects, Revive and Restore has been involved in thesuccessful cloning of the black-footed ferret– a species twice thought to have gone extinct – from cells frozen decades before.Some conservationists, however, maintain prevention is better than cure.“The best way to protect species is to stop them declining to the point that such approaches as cloning are required. While these new technologies might provide some exciting opportunities for conservation they are unlikely to provide the transformation we need to see,” said Paul De Ornellas, the chief adviser on wildlife science at WWF UK.“Addressing the primary drivers of biodiversity decline like habitat loss and overexploitation while supporting conservation efforts at scale that enable the protection and recovery of nature must be our primary focus if we’re to address the biodiversity crisis.”Dr David Jachowski, an associate professor of wildlife ecology at Clemson University and an expert on the black-footed ferret, added that while persevering genetic diversity is important, it is not enough on its own.“Producing more animals doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve removed the threat in the wild to release the animal and have it survive,” he said.But the poo zoo team say modern and traditional methods can work in parallel.“I’m not saying we should stop protecting habitats and stop doing in situ conservation efforts,” said Bolton. “I just think because of the dire straits we are in, you need to try multiple different tools”.Explore more on these topicsScienceAnimalsZoosGeneticsEndangered speciesResearchWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

They also questioned Barnard’s ability to complete the highly complex project, citing a lack of experience and a history ofwage violations.“Such pay-to-play arrangements among the government and federal contractors are not unusual, but they are increasing in scope under a secondTrump administration, and are highly unethical and corrupt the government contracting process,” said Craig Holman, a Capitol Hill lobbyist with Public Citizen, a non-profit that advocates for transparency.“Contracts oftentimes are awarded based on large campaign donations rather than merit, and it effectively rigs the bidding process against businesses who either cannot afford making large campaign contributions or who refuse to pay to play for government contracts,” Holman said.Barnard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration in late Februarymoved to fast-trackfederal energy projects that include Line 5 by sidestepping the US Army Corps of Engineers’ environmental review processes. The move was part of the “energy emergency” he declared on his first day in office, which is viewed as dubious because energy production was already near record highs. Someallegeit was apaybackto oil industry donors who helped Trump get elected.In addition to the $1m June 2024 donations, Barnard has given millions to Trump administration officials, Republican congressional committees, and other Republican candidates and groups. Amongthe recipientsare the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; Vice-President JD Vance; the former US House speaker Kevin McCarthy; and the Texas governor, Greg Abbott.Barnard donated to Trump in 2016, and againin 2019 and 2020, just ahead and just after he received what some lawmakers and other contractorsallegedwas an illegal no-bid contract to build some of the border wall.These are donors who got the contract to build the border wall and it seems like there also is an ulterior motive here – a conflict of interestLevi Teitel, Progress Michigan spokespersonWhat began as an approximately $143m contractballooned to more than $1bnin part through a loophole in the competitive bidding process, and critics questioned the spike – Barnard billed taxpayers for about $33m per mile of border wall built, while the government at the time was paying about $20m. Walls under previous administrations cost about $3m per mile, but were slightly smaller in scale.Jack Reed, the Democratic senator of Rhode Island, at the timecalled foran investigation over the “no-bid contract to an apparently politically connected, private contractor”.Meanwhile, Barnard Construction has been sued for failure to pay its workers, andsettledwith the Tampa Bay Water board over shoddy design work on a concrete reservoir that began to crack, raising concern in Michigan about its ability to build a concrete tunnel. It also appears the company has no experience building the type of tunnel required for the pipeline underneath the lake, the project’s opponents say.“These are donors who got the contract to build the border wall and it seems like there also is an ulterior motive here – a conflict of interest,” said Levi Teitel, a spokesperson for ProgressMichigan, which opposes Line 5. “The fact that the state is even considering working with these contractors that have these shady track records is alarming.”The pipeline currently transports about 540,000 barrels of oil and liquid natural gas daily across the Mackinac Straits, which connect Lake Michigan to Lake Huron between Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. Environmental groups fear an anchor strike or powerful shifting currents that put enormous stress on the ageing pipes and could trigger a disaster.Enbridge’s plans for the replacement line call for a utility tunnel to be dug out 100ft below the Mackinac Straits floor – a design Enbridge claims would protect it from anchors and other threats. Opponents note the tunnel would still be high risk because of the complexity in building it, and because it would be the highest pressure tunnel in the world, if completed.Trump officials decimate climate protections and consider axeing key greenhouse gas findingRead moreStiff political and legal opposition has for seven years held up the new pipeline, and is attemptingto shut downthe existing line. The Army Corps of Engineers’ environmental review is viewed as one of opponents’ best hopes for derailing the project because of the plan’s clear risks.Though no legal mechanism for removing Barnard from the project exists, opponents have called on the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and her appointees on the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority that oversees the project to sound the alarm about the apparent quid pro quo, and pressure Enbridge.Whitmer has not publicly said she opposes Line 5, to the frustration of those battling it, said Sean McBrearty, a campaign coordinator with Oil and Water Don’t Mix.“They have the power to throw some daylight on the project for the public and they’re not doing that,” McBrearty said. “When it comes to this hare-brained scheme to build a tunnel through the most ecologically sensitive part of the Great Lakes, Whitmer is missing in action.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOil and gas companiesMichiganUS politicsEnergy industryFossil fuelsCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

The Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said that was 8C hotter than the average for the time of year.“We’re expecting quite a lot of dry weather, increasing amounts of sunshine as we head through the next few days,” she said. “By Wednesday, we’re looking at highs of about 17C in the south. And then on Thursday, we could get as high as 19C.”That temperature is estimated to be hotter than in Ibiza, which is forecast to have highs of 17C on Thursday, while Corfu is forecast to have highs of 16C.However, the start of the week in the UK will still feel chilly, with some overnight frost, the forecaster said.“So the temperatures we have got currently are around average, which is about 10C. But we’ve also got quite a chilly wind at the moment, so it’s making it feel even colder,” Mitchell said.“But by the time we get to Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures will be about eight degrees above average in some places. The spring equinox will coincide with some nice warm weather, definitely feeling spring-like.”The expected higher temperatures will be due to a large area of high pressure, which tends to bring dry and sunny weather.The warmest air will be in southern parts of the UK, Mitchell said.“Parts of the south-east [and] across the Midlands will be the warmest spots on Wednesday, and then on Thursday that warmth travels a bit further north, so it’s going to feel pretty warm across southern Scotland,Northern Irelandand the whole of England and Wales.“There’s really just northernScotlandthat will keep hold of the colder weather through the middle of the week.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking to broadcasters, Streeting was repeatedly challenged on whether ministers were leaving disabled people uninformed for too long about the plans – and whether they would freeze the personal independence payment (Pip) as part of their welfare package this week.Streeting did not deny the government had dropped plans to freeze Pip after a major backlash fromLabourMPs this week. There are still expected to be significant changes to Pip including making the disability payment – which is not dependent on work – harder to claim, as well as changes to employment support for those too sick or disabled to work.Asked whether he thought overdiagnosis of some conditions was a problem, he told BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “I want to follow the evidence and I agree with that point about overdiagnosis.“Here’s the other thing: mental wellbeing, illness, it’s a spectrum and I think definitely there’s an overdiagnosis, but there’s too many people being written off and, to your point about treatment, too many people who just aren’t getting the support they need. So if you can get that support to people much earlier, then you can help people to either stay in work or get back to work.”Minesh Patel, the associate director of policy and campaigns at the charity Mind, said Streeting was right to say that not enough people were getting support, and advised against stigmatising those with mental health problems.He said: “Applying for benefits is not an easy process. People with a mental health problem must go through a lengthy and arduous assessment process, with decisions to not award support often overturned at appeal stage. We must also be extremely careful with the language around mental health diagnoses, which risks creating a climate of stigmatising people’s real experiences and undermining the opinions of medical professionals.”Robert Howard, a professor of old age psychiatry at University College London, said “punishing” people would not get them back to work.He said: “I’m really anxious that the kind of language that Wes Streeting was using this morning will be used to justify further disinvestment in mental health services.“If we want to get people with mental illness back to work, the way to do that is to make sure they can access timely and effective treatment, and pretending that they haven’t got a real illness, it just doesn’t make me feel encouraged that the government will invest sufficiently in mental health services to help people get back.“There’s so many young people with kind of chronic generalised anxiety who can’t work. The way to get them back to work isn’t to kind of shame them and punish them and tell them they’re not ill. The way to get them back to work is to make sure that they have access to proper psychological therapy and treatment so they can be fit and go back to work.”The Guardian reported on Fridaythat ministers had threatened to resignover any potential freeze to Pip, which would require a vote in parliament. But there remains widespread concern from Labour MPs about how tight the criteria to claim the disability payment will be, and about the changes to employment and support allowance, which covers those who cannot work.“I haven’t seen the full plans, they haven’t come to cabinet yet,” Streeting said. “But what I do know is the work and pensions secretary wants to support people who need help the most and we’ve got to make sure that there is a wider range of support, and that everyone’s playing their part, including me, because with those levels of illness, for example, if I can help people back to health, in many cases I’ll be helping them back to work and that’s what we’ll do.“I haven’t seen the proposals but you’ve seen the briefing, you’ve seen the speculation, I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans.”It is mission critical that Labour repairs the contract between citizen and state | Andrew RawnsleyRead moreStreeting said he did not come into politics to take money from the most vulnerable in society but that there was still a need for reform. “We want to support people who are the poorest and most vulnerable to make sure they’ve got dignity, independence and great quality of life,” he said.“Without that support from an active state, I wouldn’t be here talking to you. The challenge we’ve got [is] we’ve got one in eight young people in this country not in education, employment or in training. We’ve got one in 10 people who are off work, sick, and 3 million people shut out of the labour market because of long-term illness.“Now, of course, there will be some people because of serious disability or because of chronic illness that can’t be turned around, will not be able to work, and those people need to be supported. But the welfare state’s also got to be a springboard back to work and lots of people get written off, you know, as if they can’t contribute when they can and should and want to.”Join Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around.

He also claimed Vladimir Putin’s use of force in Ukraine was “legitimate”.Aaron made the comments as part of a pseudoscientific theory of personality types. He is the president of the self-styled World Socionics Society – a group promoting the idea that there are 16 personality types.However, while he was one of many Reform candidates whose comments caused controversy and led to many being sacked, he is now head of vetting at Reform UK.The role includes scouring prospective candidates’ social media outputs and advising them on what should be deleted.Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, told his party conference in September that it would be vetting candidates“rigorously at all levels”in future aftermore than 100 were removedbefore the general election, with many sacked after offensive and racist comments were revealed.A spokesperson for Reform UK said: “Mr Aaron is Jewish, and sits on his local synagogue council. His grandfather came to this country as a refugee from Vienna and much of his family on that side were murdered by Hitler’s regime.“Reform UK does not disclose details of our internal vetting process and nor staff members involved.”The party said socionomics was not part of its candidate vetting process.There was criticism from Josh Simons, the Labour MP for Makerfield, who said: “Reform are in a tailspin. First, they don’t vet candidates at all. Then they put an apologist for Putin and Assad in charge of vetting.“If you can’t vet your vetter, you can’t run the country. If they can’t take themselves seriously, why should the public?“You couldn’t make it up. ‘He can’t be racist because he’s a Jew.’ Out of touch and out of ideas.”Aaron came third in Welwyn Hatfield with just over 13% of the vote and finished behind the defeated Tory minister, Grant Shapps. Aaron has been approached for comment.His LinkedIn page describes him as a business psychologist, consultant, YouTuber, coach, relationship counsellor and matchmaker. It adds that he set up the World Socionics Society, which has grown from a Facebook group.A Reform UK profile pagestateshe “would like to reconfigure the principles of immigration, so that we continue to invite, welcome and assimilate the best of the world, but not allow our way of life to be compromised or threatened by ghettoes of counter-culture”.When contacted last year by the Times about his remarks on Hitler and other figures, he said he stood by many of the comments and that there was context and “nuances” in which he was viewing them through a psychological perspective.Aaron has said that by no means was he saying that Hitler, Putin or al-Assad were good people who should be admired.In a post on social media in 2022, Aaron said Hitler was “brilliant in using Fe+Ni [socionics personality traits] to inspire people into action”.Days after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Aaron said that those who called Putin insane “do not understand him and limit their ability to oppose him”.He said: “The motivation to acquire and wield force is legitimate, and there is a whole group of personality types inclined to this, and they have historically shaped the world we live in.”In a comment on Reddit, he said that Assad was “gentle by nature” and not “some bloodthirsty tyrant who exercises control over his people with an iron fist”, adding that the dictator had been “led astray” by social stereotyping.Reform’s Chair, Zia Yusuf, has claimed that the party is now vetting candidates in a more rigorous way than any other party and one of his central aims is to create a roster of candidates who are “upstanding members of society”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

The department said the penalties were “designed to target negligence rather than criminality”.Adrian Fenton said the man had travelled on the outside of the motorhome, rather than inside their vehicle, and that he had been trying to do the right thing by calling the police, writing: “At no point did I believe I would be fined by taking correct and moral action.”The couple have now received a second email from Border Force, which is part of the Home Office, saying the fine had been reduced to zero.Joanne Fentontold the BBCshe was “ecstatic” that the penalty had been reversed. She said the experience had not put them off from taking their motorhome abroad again, but said next time they would be “ultra-careful – there’ll be no covers over the bike rack”.Her husband said the Home Office should “be looking at their policy and make sure that it’s fit for purpose and not targeting holidaymakers”.“We don’t want anyone else to go through what we’ve gone through,” he said. “If someone does call the police because they’ve got someone discovered in their motorhome, Border Force shouldn’t even be considering fining them because everyone’s doing the moral and the right thing.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEssexHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Barbie previously became the first woman to receive a certificate of appreciation from the Taliban.The pair were arrested on 1 February with an American-Chinese friend, Faye Hall, who had rented a plane to travel with them, and a translator from Rebuild.The reason for their detention remains unclear. Entwistle suspects it was because they were teaching mothers with children.The previous Taliban regime, before it was toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001, had accused the couple of teaching against Islam, but this case was dropped. The family said their parents respected Taliban rule and had adapted to the imposition of strict Islamic laws.A Rebuild employee said last month the detained group was told their flight “did not coordinate with the local government”, adding that the three foreign nationals had been imprisoned in Kabul.Hopes were raised in late February that the couple would be released.In a statementreported by the BBC, the Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: “A series of considerations is being taken into account and, after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible.”He added that the three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards.Qani’s statement drew a cautious welcome from Entwistle, whotold the Times: “It’s the first thing we’ve heard from the Taliban, so it’s really positive, but he’s really not saying very much. We know they were investigating to see if they were teaching anything against Islam, so that was a relief to us as we knew they wouldn’t be.”She added: “Next thing we heard, the investigation was because they’re teaching parenting skills to mothers over the age of 30, with their children. Apparently, that was now against the law, but none of the influential people in that village [Bamiyan] thought it was a problem.”The couple, who originally met at the University of Bath, married in Kabul in 1970 after travelling there as part of an academic placement scheme. They became Afghan citizens after returning to the country 30 years later to set up Rebuild.The couple’s family initially did not want the UK government to get involved with the case.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

In 2016, there were 10 fires.In further details released to Lord Hain, parliamentary authorities revealed asbestos materials had been found in 1,057 items to date.The report said management surveys were continuing to identify and monitor the presence of asbestos-containing materials to address whether they needed to be continually monitored, or removed if at risk of disturbance.“Detailed processes are in place to support safe invasive works including support from an asbestos analytical consultant and removal of asbestos-containing materials via a licensed asbestos removal contractor,” the reply to Hain from the deputy Lords speaker, John Gardiner, said.Parliament renovation could take 76 years and cost £22bn, report saysRead moreHain said it was time to consider a faster programme of works to decant and restore parliament, a decision now unlikely to be taken until the end of the year.“Along with persistent and regular fire outbreaks – 44 recorded over the last 10 years – which could erupt at any time and burn down parliament, the whole Palace of Westminster is infested with asbestos,” Hain said.“Over 1,000 cases of such a real and present danger to MPs, peers, staff and visitors have been identified. This iconic world heritage site should be decanted, renewed and restored as soon as possible, as both the Commons and Lords agreed years ago. We are otherwise working in a potential Notre Dame inferno compounded by a potentially lethal asbestosis threat.”Lord Gardiner confirmed in December that the new plans for the restoration would only be available later this year, which Hain called “another kick of the can further down the road”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fastest – which could still take more than a decade – would be for both houses to leave the palace and relocate nearby on a temporary basis, estimated to cost between £7bn and £13bn.

Dutta was away for 691 days. Other academics have experienced thesame problemwith the Home Office regarding the amount of time they spend abroad.Along with a rejection of her right to continue living in the UK based on the number of days abroad, the Home Office rejected her right to remain in the country on the basis that she does not have a family life in Britain, although she and her husband have been married for more than 10 years, and live together in south London.Dutta is now an assistant professor at University College Dublin, in the school of history. She previously conducted research at the universities of Oxford and Bristol. She lives in Welling with her husband, fellow academic Dr Souvik Naha, a senior lecturer in imperial and post-colonial history at the University of Glasgow.“I was shocked when I got an email saying I have to leave,” Dutta told theObserver.“I have been employed at different universities in the UK and I’ve lived here for 12 years. A large part of my adult life has been lived in the UK since I came to the University of Oxford to do my master’s. I never thought something like this would happen to me.”Dutta first came to the UK in September 2012 on a student visa and later obtained a spouse visa as a dependant of her husband, who obtained a visa on a “global talent” route. According to her lawyer, Naga Kandiah, at MTC Solicitors: “These research trips were not optional but essential to fulfilling her academic and institutional obligations. Had she not undertaken these trips, she would not have been able to complete her thesis, meet the academic requirements of her institutions or maintain her visa status.”In October last year she applied for indefinite leave to remain in the UK based on long residence. Her husband also applied. His application was granted, while hers was refused. She applied for an administrative review of the refusal, but the Home Office maintained its decision to reject her application.The review concluded: “You must now leave the United Kingdom. If you don’t leave voluntarily you may be subject to a re-entry ban of 10 years and prosecuted for overstaying.”Dutta has received support from academic colleagues since getting the Home Office rejection letter.Naha said: “This decision from the Home Office has been terribly stressful for both of us. It has taken a psychological toll. I sometimes give lectures about these issues and have read articles about people affected, but never thought it would happen to us.”Kandiah has launched a legal challenge against the Home Office’s decision to remove Dutta from the UK. The Home Office has responded by saying it will reconsider its decision in the next three months. However, the Home Office may confirm its original decision after the three-month period and, until then, Dutta is in limbo.Kandiah said: “My client’s case exemplifies how such situations severely undermine the UK’s reputation and its ability to attract and retain global academic talent – particularly at a time when strengthening international relations is crucial.“If the UK genuinely seeks to position itself as a global leader in academia and innovation, it must foster an environment that is welcoming to top talent.“Without such an approach, UK universities will continue to lose highly skilled PhD researchers in whom they have invested years of resources, expertise and funding.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “It is longstanding government policy that we do not routinely comment on individual cases.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationObservedImmigration and asylumUniversity of OxfordHome OfficeAcademic expertsnewsShareReuse this content"

It allowed for incredibly vulnerable people to be exploited because there wasn’t a sensible policy intervention in the first place,” Lyons said.The independent antislavery commissioner, a former special adviser to Boris Johnson, was speaking after theHome Officerevealed more than 470 care companies have had their licences to sponsor migrant workers revoked amid concerns about fraud, abuse and exploitation.About 39,000 workers were linked to the firms. The Work Rights Centre said the figures pointed to a “national scandal”. Lyons called the number of licence revocations “alarming”.More than a quarter of the approximately 155,000 care workers who came to the UK from February 2022 to December 2024 were hired by employers who later lost their licence.Lyons said that while it was “obviously good” that this government was “cracking down on rogue agencies”, she was concerned about unintended consequences for workers, pointing to strict rules that give them 60 days to find a new sponsor if theirs loses its licence – or face deportation.View image in fullscreenIndependent antislavery commissioner Eleanor Lyons.Photograph: Home Office/PAShe urged ministers to consider reforms such as changes to the tied visa system to make it easier for exploited workers to move to other care jobs,a licensing schemefor hiring from abroad, and tougher penalties for rule-breakers.Changes announced last week including a requirement for employers to show they havetried to recruit from the pool of international workersalready in England before hiring from abroad were welcome but not enough, she said. “The scale of the issue we’re seeing means we need to have a fresh fundamental approach.”TheObserverpreviously revealed how care workers recruited from countries including India, Zimbabwe and the Philippines weretricked into paying illegal recruitment feesand in some casestrapped in conditions akin to debt bondage, with wages and passports withheld. Last year, an investigation found thatcompanies granted licences to sponsor workersincluded suspected bogus firms with copy-and-paste websites, fake-looking reviews, PO boxes as addresses and no track record of providing care. In another case, 275 certificates of sponsorship were issued to a nonexistent care home. At least177companies were granted licences to sponsor workers despite a public track record of labour law violations.Employment experts say lax oversight of companies granted sponsor licences combined with the structure of the scheme – which means workers’ visas are tied to a single employer, rather than sector-wide – have been key drivers of fraud and abuses, enabling loosely vetted sponsors to profit from exploitative practices and leaving workers afraid of reporting bad employers due to the threat their visa could be cancelled.Lyons said she had seen a “real range” of abuses, from “poor working practices where people have unreasonable demands put on them” to the “extreme end of the spectrum”, including “horrific” exploitation and instances of modern slavery. In some cases, workers had sold property and quit jobs at home to afford “extortionate recruitment agency fees” after being “promised a life here”, only tofind the job did not exist.She said ministers had made some positive changes since the scheme was launched, such as requiring care agencies that sponsor workers from abroad to be registered with the Care Quality Commission. But she questioned why it had not been better designed to begin with. “All the changes that have been made are sensible steps. I think the question remains: why were they never thought of in the first place? If the modern slavery charity sector was included from the start with the creation of this visa, I think we would have seen less exploitation over the years.”The care worker visa route was introduced to plug critical staffing shortages in social care exacerbated by the end of free movement after Brexit. It relaxed immigration rules by expanding the existing health and care worker visa to include entry-level workers in low-paid jobs for the first time. It helped reduce the social care vacancy rate, although this still remains high. But by late 2023, the CQC was warning that modern slavery had become “a feature” of the UK’s social care market.Unseen, which runs the Modern Slavery Helpline, identified a record 918 potential victims of modern slavery in the care sector in 2023, up from 63 in 2021. The number of migrant care workers coming to the UK fell drastically in 2024, partly due to changes to rules on family members.Before the election, Laboursaid that if it got into power, it would launch an investigationinto the treatment of migrant care workers. Yvette Cooper, now the home secretary, said the Conservatives had “turned a blind eye to widespread exploitation … putting vulnerable people at risk and undermining our immigration system”.The Work Rights Centre urged the government to uphold its ­promise and said its actions so far had amounted to “tinkering” around the edges of a “national scandal”.It said it had heard from 23 people in the past three months who were seeking help after their employer lost its sponsor licence, including one man, from North India, who was charged £16,000 to work in a UK care home. He now faces returning home in debt after the Home Office took action against his employer, leading to him losing his visa sponsorship.The centre is calling for “urgent reform” including an end to tied visas and the introduction of new criminal offences and a civil penalties regime to hold sham sponsors to account. “With 470 employers having their licences revoked, this is far more than ‘a few bad apples’,” its chief executive, Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, said.The Home Office and Department of Health were contacted for comment. Last week, care minister Stephen Kinnock said the ­government was working to “crack down on shameful rogue operators” and to get victims back into careers in adult social care, including barring repeat offenders from recruiting ­internationally and requiring care providers to hire from the existing pool of migrant workers before looking overseas.Exploited, recognised as a slavery victim, now facing deportation: one seafarer’s UK ordealRead moreA Fair Work Agency is also planned to tackle mistreatment of workers, expected for 2026 or 2027, which Lyons said could be effective provided it was independent and had the “powers and funding to do its job properly”.It is unclear whether the government still intends to hold an investigation into care sector abuses.The Conservative Party declined to comment on claims the visa scheme enabled widespread exploitation.Explore more on these topicsModern slaveryThe ObserverCare workersSocial careEmployment lawWork & careersCare Quality Commission (CQC)ConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, 1.5 million adults in the UK were using cash for daily spending, a four-year high.Ron Delnevo, chair of thePayment Choice Alliance, which campaigns for the long-term future of cash services, said it was “completely unacceptable” that some stores were rejecting cash. The alliance wants new laws similar to those in some other countries requiring organisations and retailers to accept cash.“The vast majority of the public want cash to be honoured as a payment,” he said. “These businesses are letting down the public.” Delnevo said a survey conducted by YouGov in June 2023 on behalf of the alliance revealed that 71% of British adults would support a legal requirement for businesses to accept cash.Gail’s, which has more than 150 stores, says going cashless has “environmental benefits” in eliminating the need for cash collection and delivery. Itsu, which promotes “affordable, nutritious food” rolled out cashless payments after a successful trial, and Zizzi says it only accepts card and contactless payments for the “smoothest and fastest” payment experience.View image in fullscreenGail’s says going cashless has ‘environmental benefits’.Photograph: Steve Tulley/AlamyThe coffee and bakery chainPret a Mangerhas piloted cashless outlets but still accepts cash in most of its 490 shops in the UK. It found the cashless service was faster but decided against a wider roll-out in favour of customer choice.The Treasury select committee is expected to report shortly on its inquiry into whether there is any need to regulate or mandate the acceptance of cash. Anearly day motiontabled in parliament last month calls for the government to implement legislation to require all businesses in the UK to accept cash, but ministers have said they have no plans to mandate the acceptance of cash.The motion highlights concerns at the “rapidly increasing trend for UK businesses, local authorities and leisure facilities, including those supported by taxpayer funding, to refuse to accept cash for payments”. Car parks, train buffets and leisure centres are among the services that have gone cashless.Kate Osborne, the Labour MP for Jarrow and Gateshead East, who has signed the early day motion, said: “It is a fundamental right that people should be able to use cash as a legal tender. When you are trying to budget, particularly if you are on a low income, cash is a simple way of doing it. I understand that many people are not using cash much of the time, but there should be choice for all.“We are seeing more and more retailers offering card-only payments, and it causes problems in constituencies like mine where we’ve got a high number of people who are digitally excluded or may choose not to do electronic banking.” Osborne said that cash can be more convenient. “I’ve been on trains before and the system [for the buffet] has gone down and they can’t take cash,” she said. “You could be on a train for three or four hours, and you can’t even buy a cup of tea.”Use of cash has fallen dramatically in the last decade, from more than half of payments in 2009 to about 12% in 2023. Yet it is still the second most frequently used method of payment in the UK after debit card.Cash accounted for 6bn payments in 2023, with the number of people who mainly use cash rising from about 900,000 in 2022 to 1.5m in 2023, according to figures from the trade association UK Finance.Ajay Banga, now president of the World Bank, revealed the roadmap of the finance industry in 2017 when, as chief executive of Mastercard, hestated in an interview: “My enemy is cash.” The international finance industry now faces resistance over its eagerness for cashless transactions.View image in fullscreenAjay Banga, president of the World Bank, once said: ‘My enemy is cash.’Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPASweden has been at the forefront of countries moving towards a cashless society, with theNew York Timesreporting in 2018that about 4,000 Swedes had implanted microchips in their hands to pay for travel or food, or enter keyless offices. Mounting cyber crime and the rising threat from Russia have led to a rethink, with residents now advised to keep enough cash at home for at least one week.While cash can help provide resilience in the event of an attack or collapse in the financial system, many consumers also turn to coins and notes for budgeting. A system known as “cash stuffing” – using envelopes for different categories of spending – has racked up hundreds of millions of views on TikTok, but security experts advise against keeping large amounts of cash at home.May Fairweather, a financial coach and executive director at the nonprofit organisation Talk About Money, said the financial industry wanted “frictionless” purchases because it made it easier for people to spend money.“Cash adds friction, and that can be a good thing,” she said. “It gives people time to think and time to make proper decisions.” She also said thatnotes and coins remind people trying to budget that money is “finite”.TheFinancial Conduct Authority(FCA) says that about 3 million people continue to rely on cash, even as digital payments become more popular. It introduced rules last September requiring banks and building societies to ensure reasonable access to cash withdrawal and deposit services.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We recognise that cash continues to be used by millions across the UK. While we have no plans to mandate cash acceptance, individual businesses can decide which payment methods they accept, and new rules introduced by the FCA support those that do want to continue accepting cash by enabling business to make deposits.”Gail’s, Itsu and Zizzi have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsMoneyThe ObserverPret a MangerBanks and building societiesUK cost of living crisisFinancial Conduct AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

This compares with just 12% in 2018-19.The DfE report also revealed 75% of trusts paid at least one staff member between £100,000 and £150,000.The rising pay packets are a blow to the government, which has been urging academies to ensure pay for senior leaders is “proportionate and justifiable”. Although DfE officials wrote to 37 trusts in 2023 to warn about high salaries, some have nonetheless since increased the pay for heads.Academies receive grant funding from central government. They do not charge fees, and are run by not-for-profit trusts that may be supported by businesses or other sponsors.Martin Haworth, the head of the Flagship Learning Trust and executive headteacher at Wright Robinson college, a secondary school in Manchester, is one of the best paid teachers in England, with a salary, including pension payments, of at least £345,000. His earnings rose by more than 30% in two years, with the trust saying this partly reflects his new role as head of the trust, which operates only one school.Justin James, chief executive and executive headteacher at the Lion Academy Trust, which runs schools in Northamptonshire, Essex and east London, was given a pay package of £226,420 in 2021-22, rising to £267,533 in 2023-24, an increase of 18% over two years. Carl Ward, chief executive of the City Learning Trust, which is based in Stoke-on-Trent and runs four schools and a college, saw his pay rise from up to £265,000 in 2021-22 to more than £300,000 in 2023-24, an increase of at least 13%.Alasdair Smith, of the Anti Academies Alliance, which wants greater democratic accountability in schools, said the pay deals were “completely unjustified”. He said: “This is a gravy train for a small number of academy chief executives who cannot be brought to account over excessive pay. It’s a self-serving elite.“We know that what improves schools is the quality of teaching, not just the quality of leadership. How can academy heads justify these increases when most teachers have for years got below-inflation pay increases?”While there has been support for high salaries to attract and reward the best talent to run some of the country’s top schools, education officials have challenged academy trusts over whether they always comply with their obligations on pay.View image in fullscreenCarl Ward, chief executive of the Stoke-on-Trent-based City Learning Trust, saw his salary deal rise from up to £265,000 in 2021-22 to more than £300,000 in 2023-24.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAnanalysis commissioned by the Local Government Associationin 2023 found that 93% of maintained schools were rated good or outstanding in Ofsted inspections, compared with 87% of academies. The academy sector says such results are skewed because it takes failing schools away from council oversight, helping to turn them around and deliver improved results.An analysis last week by Schools Weekfound more than 60 trusts had paid their leaders at least £200,000 last year, with 95% awarded rises.The best paid academy chief executive in England is Sir Dan Moynihan, head of the Harris Federation, which has 55 academies in London and Essex and has been recognised for consistently high standards of performance. Moynihan was paid between £515,000 and £520,000 in the year to 31 August 2024, with employer pension contributions of up to £85,000.Thechildren’s wellbeing and schools billthat is going through parliament contains a provision to bring academy teachers on to the same pay and conditions framework as teachers in maintained schools. Academy trust leaders warned the laws as originally drafted could undermine their ability to recruit the best teachers. Ministers said the intention for teacher salaries in academy schools was to “create a floor with no ceiling”. The government tabled anamendment to the bill in Januaryto allow the education secretary to require academy schools to pay teachers at least a minimum level of remuneration set out in secondary legislation.Jamaican teachers at leading UK academy chain paid less than their British colleaguesRead moreA DfE spokesperson said: “High and rising standards are at the heart of the government’s mission to give every child the best life chances.“The overwhelming majority of academy trusts deliver a high standard of financial management and governance, but we are clear that strong accountability is non-negotiable.“We will continue to challenge executive pay where it is neither proportionate nor directly linked to improving pupil outcomes.”The Flagship Learning Trust said in response to questions about Haworth’s remuneration that the school he headed was graded “outstanding in every area” by its most recent Ofsted report in 2021.Joe Larrigan, chair of trustees for Wright Robinson college, said: “Following the retirement of our long-standing chief executive, we have brought together the roles of chief executive, executive headteacher and accountability for our community trading arm.“This restructure has delivered an overall cost saving on senior salaries. It has also given us the platform to make a projected six-figure profit on the trading arm for the first time.”The Lion Academy Trust and City Learning Trust have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAcademiesThe ObserverTeachingSchoolsSecondary schoolsPrimary schoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said Ukraine was sovereign. “If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up toRussiato accept or reject them.”Macron will meet the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, on Monday and then travel to Berlin on Tuesday to meet the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for talks on Ukraine before an EU summit.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, leda virtual meetingof 30 international leaders on Saturday including Macron and Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, as well as leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Afterwards, Starmer challenged the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to sign up to a ceasefire if he was serious about peace. He said allies would keep increasing the pressure on the Kremlin, including by moving planning for a peacekeeping force to an “operational phase”.Macron said after the meeting on Saturday that Europe and the US had to put pressure on Russia to accept a proposed ceasefire. Russia “does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace”, Macron said in a statement to Agence France-Presse. On the contrary, the Russian president was “escalating the fighting” and “wants to get everything, then negotiate”, he said.“Russia must respond clearly and the pressure must be clear, in conjunction with the US, to obtain this ceasefire,” Macron said.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, however, the situation is the opposite.”It comes after an increasingly acrimonious dispute between the men over responsibility for the failures that allowed the surpriseHamasattack on 7 October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza.Shin Bet is responsible for monitoring Palestinian militant groups. It recently issued a report accepting responsibility for its failures around the attack but also criticised Netanyahu, saying government policies were among its causes.Netanyahu has not accepted any responsibility for the attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted, though he was prime minister at the time and has been in power for a total of 17 years.Far-right allies of Netanyahu welcomed the move. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the former minister of national security, said it was “better late than never”. Cabinet loyalists rushed to welcome the prime minister’s “defence of democracy”.But Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s opposition, promised to challenge Bar’s dismissal in the courts, and Ehud Barak, a former prime minister, said Netanyahu had “gone off the rails” and was “rebelling against the rule of law”.The Israeli media has criticised Netanyahu for allowing substantial financial aid from Qatar to reach Hamas, in an apparent attempt to strengthen the Islamic militant group inGazaas a rival to the Palestinian Authority based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.The tensions peaked this weekend when Bar’s predecessor, Nadav Argaman, said he would release sensitive information about Netanyahu if the prime minister was found to have broken the law. Netanyahu accused Argaman of blackmail and filed a police complaint.Shin Bet did not have an immediate response to Netanyahu’s announcement.In a statement, Bar said the Shin Bet chief answered “first and foremost to the citizens of Israel” and that Netanyahu’s “expectation of a personal loyalty contradicts the public interest and is fundamentally flawed”.Bar also appeared to add his voice to calls for a full commission of inquiry.Netanyahu has repeatedlyrejected callsfor an official state commission of inquiry into the 2023 attack and has repeatedly sought to shift the failures on to the army and security agencies.In recent months a number of senior security officials, including a former defence minister and army chief of staff, have been fired or forced to step down. Bar is one of the few remaining senior security officials since the attack to remain in office. If Bar is removed, Netanyahu is expected to appoint a loyalist in his place, slowing any momentum for the commission of inquiry.Netanyahu said on Sunday that removing Bar would help Israel “achieve its war goals and prevent the next disaster”.The prime minister has been angered by a Shin Bet investigation into members of his staff alleged to have earned substantial sums in dealings with Qatar. Lapid said Bar’s dismissal was aimed at sabotaging the inquiry.Shin Bet, and Bar, have been closely involved with the hostage negotiations during the war in Gaza. Netanyahu recently removed Bar from the negotiating team and replaced him with a loyalist cabinet minister.Efforts by Netanyahu and his allies to push through judicial changes, widely criticised as authoritarian, have been cited as one of many causes of the Hamas attack. The move polarised Israel’s politics in the months before and divided the country, weakening its defences, critics say.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The URL was also changed, with the word “medal” changed to “deimedal”.Rogers, who was awarded the Medal of Honor by then president Richard Nixon in 1970, served in the Vietnam war, where he was wounded three times while leading the defense of a base.According tothe West Virginia military hall of fame, Rogers was the highest-ranking African American to receive the medal. After his death in 1990, Rogers’s remains were buried at the Arlington national cemetery in Washington DC, and in 1999 a bridge in Fayette county, where Rogers was born, was renamed the Charles C Rogers Bridge.As of Sunday afternoon, a “404 – Page Not Found” messageappearedon the defense department’s webpage for Rogers, along with the message: “The page you are looking for might have been moved, renamed, or may be temporarily unavailable.”A screenshotpostedby the writer Brandon Friedman on Bluesky on Saturday evening showed the Google preview of an entry of Rogers’s profile on the defense department’s website.Dated 1 November 2021, the entry’s Google preview reads: “Medal of Honor Monday: Army Maj Gen. Charles Calvin Rogers.” Below it are the words: “Army Maj Gen Charles Calvin Rogers served through all of it. As a Black man, he worked for gender and race equality while in the service.”“Google his name and the entry below comes up.

In a medical bulletin on Saturday, the Vatican said his condition continued to be stable, although he still required therapy to be administered from the hospital.Earlier on Sunday in an Angelus message to the faithful published by the Vatican, the pope addressed his health, sharing that he was “fragile” and “facing a period of trial”.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismReligionThe papacyChristianityItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His assailant allegedly fled the scene and is being sought by authorities. They were unable to say if the attack was random or targeted.It was later reported that the man had been doused with accelerant from a Patron tequila bottle and lit on fire, according to crime scene investigators. The victim then ran 100ft west while on fire before someone jumped out of a car and doused him with a powder fire extinguisher, fire marshalstold the New York Post.A Brooklyn woman told the outlet that Times Square gets “pretty scary” early in the morning. “Yeah it’s pretty scary before 8 or 9am,” said the woman, Anne Lee, 26. “There are no cops on these blocks at all. These side streets. They’re really only on the avenues and they only give directions to tourists.”Street violence is likely to be a dominant issue of New York’s mayoral elections this year, with one contender, the former state governorAndrew Cuomo, calling the city “out of control” and vowing to add 5,000 additional officers.The incumbent mayor,Eric Adams, has said the issue is not a shortage of police, but bail reforms signed into law by the former governor.Statistics show crime in the city is trending lower.“Stop saying our city is in ‘chaos and crisis’! It is not,” Adams said last week.But Sunday’s arson attack comes three months after a woman was fatally set on fire in a subway car, horrifying New Yorkers and renewing a debate over city safety. The victim was later identified as 57-year-old Debrina Kawam.The man accused of lighting her on fire, the Guatemalan migrant worker Sebastian Zapeta, was taken into custody hours after the incident and charged with murder and arson.Police said the suspect had not left the scene as Kawam burned to death and was found with a lighter in his pocket. “Lighting another human being on fire and watching them burn alive reflects a level of evil that cannot be tolerated,” the mayor’s office said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS crimeEric AdamsAndrew CuomonewsShareReuse this content"

Boasberg also ordered deportation flights already in the air to return to the US.“Oopsie … Too late,” Bukeleposted online, followed by a laughing emoji.Soon after Bukele’s statement, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,thankedEl Salvador’s leader.“Thank you for your assistance and friendship, President Bukele,” he wrote on the social media site X, following up on an earlier post in which he said the US had sent “2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to face justice in El Salvador”.Rubio added that “over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars”.On Friday, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to order the deportations of suspected members of the Venezuelan gang he has accused of “unlawfully infiltrating” the US. The US formally designated Tren de Aragua a “foreign terrorist organization” last month.View image in fullscreenEl Salvador police shave the heads of alleged gang members recently deported from the US to El Salvador, on Sunday.Photograph: Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia/ReutersHe claimed the gang members were “conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions” against the US.The Alien Enemies Act has only ever been used three times before, most recently during the second world war, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians.It was originally passed by Congress in preparation for what the US believed would be an impending war with France. It was also used during the war of 1812 and during the first world war.The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, slammed Judge Boasberg’s stay on deportations. “This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump’s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk,” Bondi said in a statement on Saturday night.But lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union contend that the Trump does not have the authority to use the law against a criminal gang, rather than a recognized state.On Sunday, the Republican senator Mike Rounds questioned whether the deportation flights had ignored Judge Boasberg’s order to turn around. “We’ll find out whether or not that actually occurred or not,” Rounds told CNN. “I don’t know about the timing on it. I do know that we will follow the law.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tough on crime,” Argentina’s hardline security minister, Patricia Bullrich,enthusedlast year after posing outside Cecot’s packed cells.A succession of social media influencers and foreign journalists have also been invited to tour the prison todocument its harsh conditionsand help Bukele promote his clampdown, which has helped dramatically reduce El Salvador’s once sky-high murder rate.“The conditions in there are like something you’ve never seen … Depending on which side of the argument you fall on, it’s either the ultimate deterrent or it’s an abuse of human rights,” the Australian TV journalist Liam Bartlett reported after visiting El Salvador’s “hellhole” prison recently.“There’s no sheets [and] no mattresses. [Prisoners] sleep on cold steel frames and they eat the same meal every single day. Utensils are banned so they use their hands [to eat]. There’s just two open toilets in each of these massive cells and the lights stay on 24/7,” Bartlett added. “Imagine how long you would last in these conditions.”Human rights activists have decried how the mass imprisonments have taken place largely without legal process. More than 100 prisoners have died behind bars since Bukele’s clampdown began.Neither the US nor El Salvador offered any immediate evidence that the scores of Venezuelan prisoners sent to Cecot this weekend were in fact gang members or had been convicted of any offense.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationEl SalvadorTrump administrationDonald TrumpMarco RubioUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I have a two-month-old granddaughter – I clung to that. Every day I thought about my mother,” Napa said.On Saturday, he was discharged from hospital in the coastal city of Paita.“Mr Napa arrived in good physical condition. He could walk, wash himself. Shocked, but in good physical condition,” said a Peruvian navy port captain, Jorge González.The fisher had set out on 7 December from the port of San Juan de Marcona but bad weather conditions and the current caused him to lose course.His small boat, which had no radio beacon, ended up on the high seas.“It is a miracle that my father has been found,” his daughter Ines Napa told the RPP radio station. “We, as a family, never gave up hope of finding him.”Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Wendy!!” it read.For any patient inside, it would have been tragic. But, astonishingly, the writer of this note was Wendy Williams, a trailblazing television talkshow host and once one of the most recognisble daytime TV faces in America.While half the nation pays attention toDonald Trump, the other half, it seems, is fixated on Williams, who has been under a court-ordered conservatorship since 2022 and whose clear struggles with her illness are captivating – and shocking – the US.‘Carers need care, too’: Bruce Willis’s wife speaks out after deaths of Gene Hackman and Betsy ArakawaRead moreWilliams, 60, wants to be released from her conservatorship, which she claims is similar to one thatBritney Spearswas place under, and has maintained in several interviews that she is “not cognitively impaired” as she was diagnosed to be two years ago.Known as “the shock jock diva” and “the biggest mouth in New York”, Williams was taken to a hospital by police after dropping the notes, and later told the media that she passed a mental-capacity test, with questions including naming the current president, “with flying colors”.“I am not incapacitated as I’ve been accused, and this floor that I live on is the memory unit,” Williams recalled telling officers upon their arrival. “The people who live there don’t remember anything, unlike me. Why am I here? What is going on?”The talkshow host later “evaded staff” to get out of her facility and went to dinner with her niece at a NoHo restaurant, allegedly triggering a police report, but was spotted at her table writing in a journal and having a “super time”.Her caretaker, Ginalisa Monterroso, now wants her to get an independent medical evaluation. But her court-ordered guardian, Sabrina Morrissey, didn’t want her to undergo a police mental-capacity test and told Vanity Fair she sees “issues” with Williams’s speech when it isn’t scripted.Tracking Williams, and her ups and downs, is a full-time job as an army of “Wendy Watchers” will attest.View image in fullscreenWendy Williams hosts her eponymous show at the Beverly Center on 30 August 2011 in Los Angeles, California.Photograph: Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty ImagesWilliams was diagnosed with dementia and aphasia in 2023, one year after she exited The Wendy Williams Show. But for more than a decade Williams, who grew up in a white New Jersey suburb, delivered hot takes on pop culture-dominated daytime talk TV. Before that she’d been on Hot 97 talk radio with a format similar to Howard Stern.She was famous for high-profile clashes with celebrities. She feuded with Beyoncé in 2012, saying she was “fortunate” that her TV in the kitchen has closed-captioning “so I’ll be able to understand what she says. You know Beyoncé can’t talk. Beyoncé sounds like she has a fifth-grade education. She can’t talk.”She got into a beef with Whitney Houston over Houston’s lesbian relationship with her friend Robyn Crawford, and her drug use. Houston threatened to stop by William’s studio and beat her up. She called out Sean Combs, AKA Puff Daddy, long before he was charged with sex trafficking.When Williams was eventually fired from Hot 97 in 1998, it was after she had shareda doctored imageof Combs in a compromising position with another man on her website.But Williams’s feuds came against a backdrop of personal turbulence. Six years ago, she filed for divorce from her husband and former producer Kevin Hunter. She later appeared to confirm he had fathered a child with a younger woman.“He inconvenienced my life with his attitude, a baby and alotof affairs,” she told USA Today about Hunter in 2021. “And now I’m going to inconvenience his by letting him know that I’ve got the best apartment, I’ve got the best view, I’ve got the best concierge, I live the best life, I eat the best food. I have the best of the best.”In her autobiography, Wendy’s Got the Heat, she described how her dealer would bring cocaine to the studio and keep it in a green container on the kitchen counter. “I’d be on the couch at three o’clock, wide awake,” she wrote.How far the public is willing to go in following the unfolding chapters of the Wendy Williams story is subject to the continued returns of attention capital investment.“Even if you’ve never watched her show, she’s been around,” said the Syracuse University media professor Bob Thompson. “Eventually it might become something everybody cares about, but it’s not there yet. In the grand scheme of things – like will the constitution survive? – it’s not much, but it’s got the typical dramatic things: is it rehab, does she need rehab? Is she broke? She’s pretty much got it all.”Never one to shy away from the limelight, on Friday, Williams kept her struggles in the public eye and phoned in to the ladies of The View television show to complain about her guardian and the judge overseeing her conservatorship.“These two people don’t look like me, they don’t dress like me, they don’t talk like me, they don’t act like me,” Williams said. “I need them to … get off my neck.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkDementiaMental healthTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

He has suffered permanent and life-changing disfigurement, according to his attorneys.In an Instagram statement, his attorneyssaid: “After a hospitalization and multiple skin grafts, Michael has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction and psychological harm caused by the burns.”According to his attorneys, Garcia sustained the burns from one of three venti-sized “Medicine Ball” hot teas that he was picking up.The off-menu itemconsistsof steamed lemonade, hot water, Jade Citrus Mint green tea, Peach Tranquility tea and honey, which internet users have hailed as a cure for cold symptoms.“Starbucks offered $30m to settle but wanted confidentiality. We said we would settle for $30m without confidentiality and only ifStarbucksagreed to publicly apologize and promise to change policy to prevent this from happening again,” Garcia’s attorneys added.Garcia’s negligence lawsuit blamed his injuries on Starbucks, saying that an employee didn’t wedge the scalding-hot tea firmly enough into a takeout tray.“This jury verdict is a critical step in holding Starbucks accountable for flagrant disregard for customer safety and failure to accept responsibility,” one of Garcia’s attorneys, Nick Rowley, said in a statement.“We are proud of Michael for standing up for himself and having the courage to tell his story,” Garcia’s other attorney said.Starbucks said it sympathized with Garcia but planned to appeal.“We disagree with the jury’s decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive,” the Seattle-based coffee giant said in a statement, adding that it was “committed to the highest safety standards” in handling hot drinks.US eateries have faced lawsuits before over customer burns.In one famous 1990s case, a New Mexico jury awarded a woman nearly $3m in damages for burns she suffered while trying to pry the lid off a cup of coffee at a McDonald’s drive-through. A judge later reduced the award, and the case ultimately was settled for an undisclosed sum under $600,000.Juries have sided with restaurants at times, as in another 1990s case involving a child who tipped a cup of McDonald’s coffee on to himself in Iowa.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaStarbucksLaw (US)Food & drink industryWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Though almost certainly inspired by that first fiction of breached borders, this second hoax was not broadcast by a Hollywood star but organised by the state branch of the veterans’ organisation, the American Legion. This was presumably due to fears that people were not taking seriously enough the communist threat to Truman’s America from Stalin’s Soviet Union.On that midwest mayday in the middle of the 20th century, the town mayor and police chief were dragged from their beds by “reds”, the library was purged of subversive texts and diner menus substituted potato soup and black bread for the usual meats and sweets. Although this was an exercise in pretence, a real-life local leader was dead by the end.The fake takeover is a true story, but the records are sketchy. And so The Mosinee Project – a three-actor piece created by the Counterfactual company – soon moves from research (recorded interviews with living witnesses) to speculation, through imagined rehearsals for the May Day and multiple versions of some scenes.View image in fullscreenMartha Watson Allpress (centre) The Mosinee Project.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianFascinatingly, two of the creators of the mock occupation were themselves former communists, allowing writer-director Nikhil Vyas fun with the idea of whether disguise can morph from a lie into a life. Are some Wisconsin Republicans possibly entering too enthusiastically into the commie cosplay? Might one of the ex-reds only be pretending to have embraced American democracy?The three actors – Camilla Anvar, Jonathan Oldfield and Martha Watson Allpress – play multiple roles with impressive fluidity of nationality and gender. At a time when the reality of the “red scare” is again the subject of debate in Europe, The Mosinee Project has topical resonance as well as historical fascination. But there is sometimes frustration in not knowing what actually happened. This entertaining 70-minute exercise in levels of reality leads us to other sources on the story, and Counterfactual might usefully explore a more fully fictional telling.At theNew Diorama theatre, London, until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Frequently compared to the Jackson 5, both for their all-family lineup and the fact that they were managed by a controlling and overbearing father, Five Star emerged from Romford, eastLondon, and became a pop phenomenon in the mid-1980s with a string of hit singles and albums.The group was a project involving the entire Pearson family. Stedman was in effect Stedman Pearson Jr, since though his father was widely known as Buster Pearson, his actual first name was Stedman.Buster acted as manager, and the original plan was to form a group with his three daughters, Denise (now known as Deniece), Doris and Lorraine. However, Buster’s wife, Delores (nee Ogeare), who would help with the group’s business affairs, urged him to include sons Stedman and Delroy to create a quintet. Denise, Lorraine and Delroy contributed to the songwriting, with Denise the most prolific writer, while Doris handled the choreography.Stedman had briefly studied dance and fashion at college before he joined the group, and as well as singing and dancing, he had a hand in designing the group’s costumes. “Dad designed our first costumes and then, because he knew I liked designing, he said you’ve got the go-ahead, I’ll leave you in charge of designing,” he told Smash Hits. However, in a 2008 interview with the Guardian he backtracked somewhat, saying: “Seriously, I designed two costumes, the rest were designed by my father and my sisters.”After releasing a couple of unsuccessful singles in 1984, Five Star reached the UK Top 20 in 1985 with All Fall Down and Let Me Be the One, both of which also enjoyed success on the US Dance and R&B charts, and breached the Top 30 with Love Take Over. One of their biggest hits,System Addict, reached No 3 in 1986.View image in fullscreenFive Star in 1987. From left: Delroy, Lorraine, Denise, Stedman and Doris Pearson.Photograph: Mike Prior/RedfernsIt was a perky little slice of electro-pop that seemed to be a warning about the relentless march of digital technology – “I really need the human touch / But I’m too far gone”.With their mix of slick production, synchronised dance routines, simple but catchy melodies and Denise’s smooth and accomplished lead vocals, the group continued to rack up big hits in the UK for the next two years, scoring their highest UK placing withRain Or Shine(No 2 in 1986), and reaching the Top 10 with Find the Time, Stay Out of My Life and The Slightest Touch. They also notched up a No 1 album with Silk & Steel (1986), which was certified four times platinum in the UK and additionally reached the US Top 100. They achieved further platinum status with the albums Luxury of Life and Between the Lines (the latter a Top 10 hit).In 1987 they sold out six nights at Wembley Arena on their UK tour, and won the Brit award for Best British Group, the first black group to do so.But their appeal had peaked. Their last chart album (not counting posthumous compilations), Rock the World, reached only No 17 in 1988, the group’s efforts to create a tougher, black-leather-clad look having failed to arrest their commercial decline.Stedman was born in Romford, which was then in Essex. His father, a professional musician and businessman, had moved to the UK from Jamaica, and toured as a guitarist with such luminaries as Otis Redding, Jimmy Cliff, Desmond Dekker andWilson Pickett. He also launched several record labels, including the reggae imprint K&B Records and Tent Records, which would become the home of Five Star (with a licensing deal with RCA Records).Stedman joined the family group when he was 19. Of that time, Denise said: “Like the Jacksons, our father kept control. When we became well known, we bought Stone Court [in Sunningdale, Berkshire], a mansion with dogs and security gates.” The group became renowned for their fleet of lavish automobiles, including Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Stedman’s Mercedes.By 1990, however, the group had to move out of Stone Court after incurring financial losses on their in-house recording studio, first relocating to Hatfield and then to the US. The same year, the group signed to Epic Records, but their records failed to sell and Epic dropped them in 1991. By 2001 the group had shrunk to a three-piece of Stedman, Denise and Lorraine, and they continued performing until 2006.Though Stedman was a low-key member of the group, with the girls in the band taking a more high-profile role, his off-stage life had moments of drama. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to a charge of public indecency. In 2007, police investigated claims of a death threat against Stedman. Buster had allegedly told his oldest child that he had a gun and was planning to shoot him.Stedman told the Guardian: “My father bankrupted all five of us … We lost the house, everything went back, including the cars … We could have fired my father as a manager and then we would have progressed.” Buster died in 2012.After the band split, Stedman diversified, setting up limousine hire companies in Switzerland and California. He also trained as a builder – “I built houses, and I trained as a mechanic because I love cars” – and taught dance.He made some minor forays into reality television, appearing on Channel 5’s All Star Talent Show, coming third in 2006 for his dancing skills, and in 2008 was a contestant on the BBC’s Celebrity Scissorhands, trying out hairdressing for Children in Need.In 2013, Stedman attempted a musical comeback assisted byLembit Opik, the former Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire. Of the singer, Opik said: “[He was] a hard worker, great performer and true gentle soul.”Stedman Pearson, singer, dancer and businessman, born 29 June 1964; died 10 March 2025Explore more on these topicsPop and rockLondonDanceEssexReggaeLembit OpikTelevisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

While previous congresses have had such intriguing themes as “From Spoon to City” and “Towards an Aesthetic of the Invisible Design of Tradition”, for 2025 the UK’s Design Council has gone for the stark but urgent “Design for Planet”.Dumbuya with his fellow ambassadors – award-winning furniture designerTom Dixon, architectLesley Lokkowho curated the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2023, Suhair Khan, who is a tech entrepreneur and expert on AI, and designer and artistEs Devlin– have put together a list of the designers they think are trailblazers in changing the way our furniture, clothes and buildings can be made.“The idea of good design has shifted from a focus on functionality and aesthetics to encompass experience, sustainability, and inclusivity,” says Dumbuya. “It prioritises environmental responsibility, embraces technology, fosters collaboration and promotes circularity, reflecting a broader understanding of design’s impact on society and individuals.”This idea is at the heart of a list the ambassadors have created of new trailblazing designers. These creatives are not just using innovative materials or new methods of production, but rethinking the systems and wisdom about the products we use and how we make them.Arthur Mamou-ManiParametric architectView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Studio NaaroLife as an architect was the obvious choice forArthur Mamou-Mani. What else was a young Parisian raised by ecologist parents and who has an equal love for maths, science and art to do? So after training at London’s Architectural Association, he established his design studio in Hackney.From that point on, everything about Mamou-Mani’s work ceases to be obvious. His firm has become famous for building fantasy: the world’s largest 3D-printed sand pavilion; a temporary temple for the Burning Man festival in Nevada; a test site for airships in France; a viewing platform constructed from reclaimed ironwood and rattan in Bali. All from design with circularity at its heart.Mamou-Mani creates biological shape – spirals, waves, repetitive patterns – from 3D-printed and recycled materials using parametric design. The computer-based process uses algorithms derived from the properties of a material to produce buildings and interiors that are a little bit Le Corbusier, a little bit Escher.“It’s not our vision imposed on a material,” he explains, with the example of using a single tree cut to create complex wood waves designed with algorithms using information about wood’s malleability. “You need science to measure your impact and architects can be reluctant with science because they worry it prevents creativity.”View image in fullscreen‘You need science to measure your impact’: Mamou-Mani’s Burning Man Temple in Nevada.Mamou-Mani believes science can prevent waste. He talks with delight about an airship hangar his studio is creating in Nouvelle Aquitaine, France, using biomimicry to make the best design for the site. “We put in ripples on the exterior which means we use 50% less steel,” he beams. “That’s a massive carbon saving. And the building is meaningful: if we replace airplanes with helium balloons it could have a massive impact.”He believes that UK has a lot to bring to the world of circular design. “I come from France and we have a tendency to turn to the government when there is a problem. I love the entrepreneurial spirit of the UK – the idea that an individual or a company can have impact can be fantastic.”Fernando LaposseRegenerative furniture designerView image in fullscreenWhen Fernando Laposse arrived in London from Mexico to study product design in 2007, it was the dawn of the “smart” era – smartphones, smartwatches. “My university, in a spot-on way, tried to prepare us for that. For me, that was soul crushing – I think my heritage was always on my mind, and Mexico has a tradition of craft and agriculture more than industry, so I’ve worked on how I can merge these two worlds for my own sanity.”On a residency at a cultural institute in Oaxaca, Laposse was galvanised by meeting activists fighting for a ban on genetically modified corn in Mexico. “I decided I wanted to do something to help indigenous farmers make a living out of ancient grain.”His plan has taken shape in Tonahuixtla, an area he’d known since childhood, where Laposse has worked with the local Mixtec tribe, first to grow agave to reverse soil erosion, then to cultivate corn. The fibres and husks of these plants are the materials for his furniture designs. Laposse also teaches locals the techniques to turn crops into materials, increasing their role in production. “I’ve known these communities since I was a child, I have a sense of duty to do them. And they’ve given me a career so this helps everyone.”View image in fullscreenThe Totomoxtle furniture range, made of marquetry formed from corn husks and knotted agave fibres.Luckily, the Totomoxtle furniture range is not only clever but beautiful, from the exquisite marquetry formed from corn husks to the cute faux-fur affect of the knotted agave fibres. It looks pop and luxe, but as Laposse points out: “My materials talk to you about Mexico and biodiversity.”As the world starts to experience the fallout of human impact on the environment, Laposse thinks Latin America could come to the fore. “Radical ideas are going to come from this part of the world – we still have a traditional understanding of the interconnections between humans and nature which are long gone from Europe. We are in position where we can change course and maybe create new systems. This is what I try to do with my design.”Kusheda MensahSustainable furniture designerView image in fullscreenOne of Kusheda Mensah’s first formative design memories was her local library in Peckham. Created by architectWill Alsopas part of the 1990s regeneration initiative for the area, it was the first library to win the Stirling Prize. It’s colourful and inclusive a community meeting place and it’s easy to imagine Mensah’s own furniture would work well in this prestigious building. The British-Ghanaian designer’s brand Modular by Mensah specialises in padded seating and curved and comfortable tables designed to interlock, bringing people physically together, and all made from recycled foam and textiles.“The fabrics I choose are not only sustainable but a source of inspiration,” Mensah says. “They allow me to creatively explore ways to give new life to what would otherwise be discarded. I want to ensure my design ideas don’t come at the cost of tomorrow.”Mensah has also made a valuable contribution to the industry by talking openly about the challenges she’s faced in an industry which is often all about image. Mensah was working in retail when she took a gamble and applied to present at the Milan Furniture Fair, she used a bank loan to start up her business and then had to juggle work and parenting two young children.View image in fullscreen‘I want to ensure my design ideas don’t come at the cost of tomorrow’: padded seating by Mensah.Photograph: Emily Cole“Cost of living is a real crisis, and, unless you have financial backing, it’s hard to manifest your designs. A challenge I face is finding financial support from councils or institutions for my passion for social design – specifically creating interactive spaces that are engaging but built with a deep commitment to sustainability.”Currently Mensah is working on her next collection – to be sold with Swedish furniture brand Hem – but she’s delighted that her work has been highlighted by the WDC ambassadors.“It’s a privilege. I hope my efforts might inspire others.”Natsai Audrey ChiezaBiomaterial designerView image in fullscreenBacteria have not traditionally been a big source of inspiration for product design, butNatsai Audrey Chiezais not one to follow tradition. Born in Zimbabwe, she moved to london at 17 and studied architecture before switching to biochemical engineering. She shifted focus to microbiology and synthetic biology and hasn’t looked back.She pioneered the use of bacteria to dye fabric at her company Faber Futures, creating a chemical-free process which cuts down on pollution and water waste. Last year she started a biodesign brand called Normal Phenomena of Life which uses algae, bacteria and fungi as key components of everything from lamps to clothes.“We develop biosolutions for industries such as fashion, textiles, and design, harnessing nature’s capabilities – refined over billions of years of evolution – to create regenerative, high-performance materials.”Chieza says one of the fascinating consequences of her work is the relationship she’s developed with other non-human organisms and a sense of respect for how our fate intertwines with theirs.“I think people still only understand the value of this work being able to scale the technology so that you can replace previous technologies and become a billionaire,” she has said. “That didn’t interest me, because what I experienced was transcending that logic of capitalism to be changed by the bacteria itself. Having its lifecycle drive all of my design decisions.”View image in fullscreenJacket by Normal Phenomena of Life, Chieza’s brand which uses algae, bacteria and fungi as key componentsShe thinks that science today reveals how codependence, rather than dominance, works. “The Cartesian notion of ‘survival of the fittest’ – the motif of the capitalist age – is not universal. Nature provides excellent counterexamples: from mycelial networks that share nutrients across forests to coral and algae co-evolving to sustain entire marine ecosystems. If we are serious about working with living systems, we must build business models that mirror nature – where value is generated, shared, and stewarded symbiotically.”Priya AhluwaliaFashion designer with a global visionView image in fullscreenIn fashion,Priya Ahluwaliais already a big deal. Her eponymous London-based clothes label, launched in 2018, has won her a cupboard full of trophies. Upcycled and repurposed fabrics have featured in her collections since research trips as a student took her to Lagos in Nigeria and Panipat in India, and she saw first-hand the mountains of discarded clothes in these cities, sent for recycling from the west. (The images can be seen in a photography book she released calledSweet Lassi.)As her label’s popularity has steadily grown – she now produces menswear and womenswear – Priya has looked beyond vintage fabrics to logistics and social enterprises in the global south to keep moving forward with ethical business practice.“We’ve had impact on the issue – with commercial partners who want to work with us and understand the way me and my team operate to customers having different ideas about how they want to spend their money,” she says.Her clothes designs are also growing ever more influential. Priya’s British, Nigerian and Indian heritage influences each collection from reworked saris and Cleopatra-style wigs to confident, sexy dresses. There’s a sense of gestalt between the fashion influences, manufacturing conventions, the meeting of west and global south that makes Ahluwalia designs feel synonymous with the way her business works.View image in fullscreen‘There was not much representation of ideas that weren’t western, but the market for fashion is global’: clothing by Priya Ahluwalia.“There was not much representation of ideas that weren’t western,” she says, “but the market for fashion is global. There was space to represent something from a different point of view. Why not have something in your wardrobe that’s inspired by Nigerian pottery as well as by Renaissance Italian art?”Priya plans to add homeware to the Ahluwalia brand soon and says she can see how the aesthetic and ethos of her brand could work in many different areas.“We care about representative and inclusive design and we aim to do things that are better for people and the planet.”Sebastian CoxCrafts maker and woodmanView image in fullscreenFurniture maker Sebastian Cox has been a success ever since the collection he created for his masters in 2010 sold out. An early advocate for regenerative design – working with nature to improve the environment – he has stayed true to this desire since university. He lives in Kent where he has a furniture workshop and also manages two woodland areas. “I think it’s easy to excuse yourself when you’re a craft maker,” he explains. “You think you have low impact but as soon as you sell to market, you contribute to a material culture.”Cox subjects all of his products to an environmental lifecycle assessment to monitor carbon footprint, while simultaneously working on his woodmanship – cultivation of woodland using human interaction to have positive impact on the natural environment. Coppicing – cutting trees back to encourage new growth – is an example.View image in fullscreen‘The UK is only 13% forest… Most antique furniture is all made of someone else’s wood, which is a tragedy’: Sebastian Cox.“We think of ourselves as a green and pleasant land, but the UK is only 13% forest, whereas in Europe the average is 38%. We also had an empire, so after we cut down our own wild wood, we then went and cut down everyone else’s. Most antique furniture is made of someone else’s wood, which is a tragedy.”Cox feels this circular and systemic approach to design is the obvious – if not the only – way forward for the industry. “I look at the past where you sketched a chair and then produced thousands of them and became a celebrity. We have to be a more useful profession with more impact.”The DWC ambassadors full list of trailblazersJayden Ali, architectCo-curator of the2023 British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, Ali runs a London-based architecture and design studio focused on decarbonisation and decolonisation.Victor Xavier and Søren Hallberg Søndergaard of Assimply StudioThis Brazil-based creative agency makes household products with reused terrazzo.Michael Bennett, architect and furniture designerAn American football star turned designer, Michael Bennett makes sustainable furniture that draws on his African and southern American roots and is inspired by the African diaspora.Nzinga Biegueng-Mboup, architectBased in Dakar, this architect uses bioclimatic design and local materials to preserveSenegalese tradition.Shajay Bhooshan, architectShajay Bhooshan specialises in programming and computational design and works atZaha Hadid Architects.Phoebe English, fashion designerPhoebe Englishcreates sustainable, handcrafted designs emphasising zero-waste and circular practices.Arthur Huang, structural engineerThis structural engineer started his company Miniwiz in Taiwan in 2005, using waste and upcycling to make building materials.Insiya Jafferjee, product designerAs founder ofShellworks, Insiya Jafferjee’s focus is creating new generation of materials, that perform like plastic, but are petroleum and microplastic free.Kieron Lewis, graphic designer and writerAs well as working as designer on books about race, Londoner Kieron Lewis has become a valuable public speaker about diversity and inclusion.Emmanuel Lawal, designerWith a career that started in music and broadcasting, Emmanuel Lawal has now founded a design studio that focuses on global communication projects.Sara Martinsen, designerDanish artist and designer Sara Martinsen uses unusual natural materials such as gelatin to create beautiful furniture.Charlotte McCurdy, interdisciplinary designerDesignerCharlotte McCurdyis an academic looking at future materials such as using algae to supersede plasticsMarjan van Aubel, solar designerThis Dutch designer creates products such as chargers and solar panels that use light as a power source but also as decorationDr Sophia Wang, artist and researcherSophie Wang is the co-founder ofMycoWorks, a biotechnology company, and an experimental dance company.

Mangan suffers fromtsundoku, a Japanese term that may well have been coined simply to torment Marie Kondo: buying books at a rate that outstrips the speed at which you can read them, and keeping them all. Mangan has 10,000. Filling the very many shelves, as she recounts in this memoir, took her ages. She enjoyed every rapturous moment.“I am never happier than when I am in a bookshop,” she writes, and soof courseshe creates one for herself. Only reluctantly does she leave its four walls. When not reviewing television shows for theGuardian– even bibliophiles need day jobs – she’s in her customised womb, reading. “If we stop reading, we stop putting ourselves in other people’s shoes,” she writes. “We cut ourselves off from avenues of growth, exploration and adventure.”When adolescence arrives, she bones up on Jilly Cooper to ready herself for the love stuffDespite a pronounced introversion, Mangan does crave adventure, even if it’s of the armchair variety. She is voracious in her tastes, and consumes everything from Victorian classics to airport thrillers to the genre that used to be calledchick-lit. Each in their own way has taught her how to live. An example: when adolescence arrives, she bones up on Jilly Cooper to ready herself for the love stuff.“I did get a boyfriend,” she writes. “He was nice. When he broke up with me, I was upset but pleased to have the insight.” Frankly, she’s relieved to be rid of him. “You have all the time back for reading that used to be spent lying on his bed trying to avoid his penis.”After university, Mangan thinks she might want to become a librarian because, well, becausebooks. But she wants to write, too, and ends up doing just that at theGuardian, where she is prone to cower in corners. When one day a colleague catches her nose-deep in Dan Brown’sThe Da Vinci Code, he is visibly appalled. “Book snobbery,” she primly notes, “is among the most dismal of all the snobberies.”Bookishis the sequel to2018’sBookworm, and treads pretty much the same path. If that first volume recounted how literature had helped her navigate the mysteries of childhood, then its sequel tackles the myriad complexities of adulthood. She reads to bring herself closer to her book-loving father, and when she is distressed by world events. She makes for a wonderfully incisive critic and can pick apart a George Orwell with the same perspicacity with which she can, say, a Jack Reacher, or the lesser-known Brontë sister, Anne, whose 1848 novelThe Tenant of Wildfell Hallshe adores. But her memoir can also be read as a comic novel, drenched as it is inSue Townsendsnark. Like Townsend, she skewers everyday events for their comedic potential. When, Jane Austenishly, she eventually does bag herself a husband, a “lovely” historian, she resents the time it takes up. “A big fuss,” she says of the enveloping wedding plans. “I wouldn’t do anything like it again.”You might think that her husband – bookish himself – would have known what he was getting into here, but no. Shortly after their wedding, he foolishly suggests they merge their libraries. His new bride is horrified. Does he really know so little about her? Mangan explains that it wouldn’t be a merging of their collections, “it would be a breaking up of mine, an unnecessary intrusion, an act of violence”. And now to the punchline: “I agreed to have a baby instead.”There’s a BBC Four sitcom here, surely: David Mitchell and Victoria Coren Mitchell, all elbow patches and cracked paperbacks, and love among the margins.Bookish: How Reading Shapes Our Livesby Lucy Mangan is published by Square Peg (£18.99).

A flock of gulls, eerily spectral in the camera flash, frenzied by the impending catch, flap and wheel in a void so black that sea and sky are one. With their backs turned, it is unclear exactly what the figures are doing, but their straining forms and the intensity of the scene suggests swift, coordinated action.Unlike the quiet serenity that characterises many other photographs in this series, made among fishing communities in Cornwall by Birmingham-born photographerJon Tonks, this image reflects a precarious – and occasionally perilous – livelihood.View image in fullscreen‘David had spent the day fishing for cuttlefish [at Newlyn], and I bumped into him at the harbour as he unloaded the catch to the market. The ink across his face was from the cuttlefish, released as a defence mechanism when they are caught - apparently it’s hard to wash off.’“Being out on the boat, you don’t think you’re in a dangerous situation, but you realise just how quickly it could all go wrong,” says Tonks, whose project A Fish Called Julie is the result of 18 months spent on the coast and at sea, between Newlyn, the Isles of Scilly, Mousehole and Cadgwith. “If you slipped over, went overboard, or got your foot caught in a line, it could be really dangerous.”Fortunately, Tonks avoided any such calamity during his time at sea, his most severe injury sustained from long stretches holding his medium-format camera aloft. “It felt hilarious at times, being on a fishing boat that’s rolling around in the dark, trying to change a roll of film or make my flash work. And, of course, using a Hasselblad – it’s a mirror, so what I’m looking at is inverted. It’s amazing I didn’t get seasick … ”The project, which goes on show at the Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, next month, is part ofWe Feed the UK, a nationwide storytelling campaign by biocultural diversity organisation the Gaia Foundation, tasking photographers and poets to raise awareness of sustainable food producers across soil, seed and sea. From August 2023, Tonks made more than a dozen visits to the coast from his home in Bath.View image in fullscreenFootballs in nets among a string of boat bumpers.“Fishermen are really hard to get hold of,” says the 44-year-old with a wry smile. “It’s not an email situation, it’s a turn up at the harbour situation.” Relying on word of mouth and personal recommendations, Tonks quickly discovered a community willing to collaborate. “First, I went down and had a really good meeting with some people working in the sustainable fishing world to discuss what is considered sustainable,” says Tonks. “Some of the early conversations were about the size of the boat – people suggested sustainability is about a boat that’s under 10 metres.”Deliberately choosing to avoid big trawlers – which with their superior size, manpower and technology can remain at sea longer, cast nets wider and locate fishing grounds more accurately – Tonks instead focused on smaller boats. These vessels suppliedless than 15%of all fish landed in Cornish ports in 2021, yet represent a more sustainable alternative. Not only does their size dictate they pay greater heed to the elements, allowing fish stocks to replenish in bad weather, but with their ability to change quickly between fishing gear – from nets, to lines, dredges and traps – they land a more selective and sustainable catch.View image in fullscreenWill, fishing for mackerel at Newlyn.“Fishing in Cornwall is like a metaphor for life,” explains Tonks. “I love the notion that fishermen are completely governed by what the sun and wind are doing, what’s in season and what type of boat they’re going out on.” Working in harmony with the seasons and weather lends the series its rhythm. All-action shots at sea contrast with quieter moments on land; fishermen chewing the fat; Christmas lights in Mousehole onTom Bawcock’s Eve, the annual festival celebrating a fisherman who braved stormy seas to alleviate his village’s hunger.This causal relationship between environment and culture has been at the heart of Tonks’s practice since completing his masters at London College of Communication. While studying, Tonks visited Ascension Island, the British-governed territory, roughly the size of Disney World, in the middle of the South Atlantic. That trip became the catalyst forEmpire, his 2013 book exploring vestiges of British colonialism on four remote islands. Tonks’s second book,The Men Who Would Be King(2021), saw him once again investigating the legacy of imperialism via ancestral belief systems and the assimilation of Anglo-American ideals on the archipelago nation of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.View image in fullscreenHauling in the net.Though local by comparison,A Fish Called Julierepresents a similar dialogue between landscape and community, a place where, “you’d wake up in the morning, open your curtains and look at what the sea’s doing”. Indeed, the project’s title stems from this close proximity: “I’d been watching these guys off-load their catch all day, and there was this one box with two sea bass with a label on it that read ‘Julie’. It just made me laugh,” explains Tonks. “I don’t know who Julie is – it could be the name of a boat – but it made me think the fish is for someone called Julie who asked, ‘If you’ve got any sea bass, I’ll take them.’”This emphasis on local, seasonal fishing and consumption represents the urgent policy required by the industry to safeguard its longevity. “We shouldn’t be able to walk into our local supermarket and say, ‘What do I fancy today?’” says Tonks. “You should be asking, ‘What do you have?’ We’re too attuned to having everything we want, whenever we want it.”View image in fullscreen‘Jacob is showing me the eggs, or ‘berries’, being spawned by a lobster when we were out fishing off the coast of St Agnes on the Isles of Scilly. When he pulls in the pots he will check each lobster for size and if they are carrying berries. If they are too small, or they are spawning, they will be returned to the sea.’Yet in spite of prevailing customer habits, which Tonks hopes will change with rising awareness, the past 18 months have left the photographer with more reasons for optimism than concern. “A lot of the younger guys I’ve been out with are really conscious about longevity,” says Tonks. “They’re very mindful aboutnotcatching something because they know it needs time to replenish.”“I really didn’t want this to be a series of weathered fishermen. Of course, there’s a couple of weathered-looking chaps in there, but there’s also signs of youth coming through. I think it’s important for people in their 20s to see that it’s a viable career option, and there’s enough information and energy for a good future.”A Fish Called Julie by Jon Tonks is at the Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, from 3 April to 22 JuneExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe ObserverExhibitionsArtFishingCornwallfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite moving to a standing desk and multiple rounds of tedious physio, I am no longer able to use my right arm without mind-bending pain, which obliterates any chance of creative focus for sustained periods.The last year in particular has felt like a tortured battle against diminished cognitive functioning and brain fog, the result of my steady use of ineffectual anti-inflammatories. I’ve never done so little work in my life, nor had so much time on my hands. I am now armed with MRI scans that show a ruptured shoulder tendon, three herniated neck discs which are compressing the nerves running down my arm – and NHS surgery dates to fight my malingering guilt.In order to cope, I’ve learned to cultivate curiosity, a great source of distraction, which I frequently practise through the art of the urban walk. I leave the house, open to where adventure might take me… because you never know. Last week I ended up shuffle dancing to an excellent DJ at theCamden Assemblypub in the middle of the afternoon.Two months ago, I left the house for what I thought would be a stop in a museum, but found myself instead in a store looking for a charger for my iPhone. While standing there, I explained to an empathetic young sales assistant that I am a benched writer, that my right arm has been temporarily disabled and asked jokingly whether he had a gadget that would enable me to get food into my mouth with my left hand, without stabbing myself in the eye with a fork.When he asked if I’d like to try a ‘mixed-reality headset’, I looked clueless. He explained they were used for multimedia experiences such as watching films and gaming that you view on virtual screens. He suggested that the eye tracking, coupled with voice control in the accessibility features, could put me back in action.Next moment I am seated in the demonstration area wearing a pair of thick and heavy glass goggles. After a quick set up, a little green dot hovers in the air. I tap my thumb and finger together and the familiar group of app icons appear in a transparent visual overlay. The pixelation of the graphics renders the icons more distinct than the chair in front of me. The eye tracking is the most surprising. All I need do is look at the app I wish to launch, tap my finger and thumb gently together and the program opens. I can move multiple screens closer or further away from me, like furniture in the room.I look at the app I wish to launch, tap my finger and thumb gently together and the program opensI try other programs, open photos and expand them to lifesize. I watch immersive videos where dinosaurs appear as real as any fully blown nightmare, except they’re kind of adorable and check me out in the same way I keep gaping at them. I recall a parenting moment when my son was a toddler and was struggling to work out whether or not his stuffed animals were real. He was relieved to be told that, despite the stuffed replica, there was no such thing as a Gruffalo. Once he understood it was an optical trick, he didn’t have to ask the difference between real and pretend again.Navigating my way around different programs feels a bit like learning to get my balance on a bicycle. I grow disoriented. The speed of movement requires constant adaptation to spatial and visual cues. I begin to relax. I even reach out and interact with digital objects – a butterfly lands on my finger. I find myself reacting with the same sort of wonder that I experience in the real world.And then the denouement. I am shown a little dial on the side of the goggle that allows me to control how much reality I want to stay immersed in. The real room disappears, leaving me surrounded by a mountain scene. I gasp in amazement. Its spatial depth, the light and shadow, render the scene so viscerally vivid I feel the space around me. Even though I know it is not real – and that distinction is clear – I experience a mood shift as if it were. It’s a bit like going into the tube at Piccadilly Circus and surfacing at the next stop to find yourself on a beach in the Bahamas.If the possibilities in these immersive spaces sound slightly terrifying, think about the historical adaptations of neural cognition and spatial awareness we have made as a species and the consequences for cultural and scientific progress. Take the visual arts at the time of the Renaissance, the radical shift of spatial perspective from two dimensions to three in painting, or how physics evolved because we were able to imagine the invisible behaviour of the universe not available to the human eye.In a matter of minutes, I was moving in and out of programs with ease; using my eyes and hands, my arm relaxed with no nerve pain firing. I view software that shows breakthroughs in medical training, immersive experiences that can be used in educational environments, in art, architecture and design. Watching it, I found myself overwhelmed with tears at the thought I may be able to work in the months leading up to surgery and during rehabilitation.Until my thoughts moved to my next dilemma. How was I going to break the news to my husband? Thirty years of marriage and the rule has always been, we consult with each other on purchases over £100. How was I to explain to him, over the phone, the profound hope that has just descended on me? The shift in my mood, the difference in vision I’d had for the next year of my life? I felt like someone had given me a smart drug, a magic cure for brain fog. In fact, I’d trade painkillers for the goggles, anytime.There was only one answer. I’d have to bring them home so he could try them himself. I snap a picture of the unboxed purchase and texted him with the message, “DO NOT HAVE A HEART ATTACK, I CAN RETURN THEM”. He texts back immediately, “I AM HAVING A HEART ATTACK”. I leave the store with profound creative thoughts and the new virtual reality goggles, carrying the bag with my left arm. I get on a bus going the wrong direction, not picking up the visual clues for another 10 stops.In minutes I was navigating programs with ease using my eyes and hands, my arm relaxed with no nerve pain firingThe negotiations once I make it home go on long into the night. We spar over reviews. He concedes there is a consensus that they are comparatively the best in VR headsets, but it’s onlyvirtualreality. I say that is like arguing a smartphone is only a phone. He points out even the influencers and early adopters are predicting market failure because the price is so grossly prohibitive (from £3,499). Why don’t I wait until the price comes down? I point out that waiting defeats the purpose, which is to enable me to work and help me mentally survive the next year. He’s convinced. He gets it and is actually relieved for me. Moved even. The goggles stay.After a couple of daysof coaching on the accessibility features, I am able to block any gesture from my right arm, forcing me to make the break in the part of my brain that still wants to steer with the right side. It accelerates my learning to go hands-free on my other devices. And it’s a good thing because I can only use the goggles for a couple of hours a day before my neck spasms with the weight. But I’ve learned a hack for that, by laying down so my face acts as a table of sorts.Though I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing the bug eyes in public, I have to admit, after getting through the panic attacks I experienced after taking them off – the result of physical disorientation and fear of their seductive allure – I am beginning to feel at ease with my new hip identity.This despite the immense amount of ridicule and sceptical concern directed my way from friends and family alike. I haven’t been the target of this much piling on since getting busted after trying a joint as a teenager. Am I in danger of letting go of the struggle to be human in a real world? Watch this space.

I didn’t know what to do in life – the one thing I had going for me was playing the flute.I’d saved for two years to buy my flute when I was 16 and earning $2.35 an hour at the supermarket. Every day I would come home and play it. It would help me process my emotions.One day I was working at the pub when someone asked me what I was doing that night. I said: “I’m going to be playing the flute at…” then I suddenly realised that I hadn’t picked up my flute when I got off the train that day. I immediately and completely freaked out. I was so annoyed I threw the plastic chair I was holding across the room.The kindness of strangers: I lost my Kindle – and the person who found it loved my book collectionRead moreI raced to the train station to ask if it had been handed in. It hadn’t, but I gave them my number anyway in case it turned up. I just thought, well, it’s gone – stupidly, I didn’t even have my name written on the case. I spent the following week in total self-recrimination mode, getting drunk and feeling sorry for myself.Then, one day, I got a call from someone at CityRail saying they had my flute. I went into the lost property place at Central and there it was, amid all the lost bags and umbrellas. As I went to grab it, the guards there asked for my ID. I’d moved to Australia from New Zealand, and the only ID I had was an expired passport at my parents’ house somewhere. I told them I didn’t have any ID on me, and that it might be quite difficult to get any. And they said, well, sorry – you’ve got to have ID to get your flute back.Desperate and scrambling, I said: “What if I play you a tune?” So I opened up the flute, put it together, and played Greensleeves. I guess the really strong feeling of returning to something that I loved, and had missed so badly all that time, came through in the music. I think the guards actually teared up a bit – I know I did. “That’s your flute,” they said, seeming quite awed. And I just walked away without showing any ID. It was a double kindness – first from the person who handed my flute in, and then the guards who waived the rules to let me take it.There’s an image of big cities as soulless places, or that there’s an absence of civic responsibility and everyone is just out for themselves. But I have to say, I’ve had difficult times in my life. I was unofficially housed for a certain period. I was a busker on the streets playing that same flute for many years. And through that all I’ve found people are very kind, and they’re kind to people who they’ve got no prospect of receiving anything from in return. They’re kind in a general way, just to other human beings, because they can be.Ever since that day at the train station, I have been even more inclined to return items that are lost than I might have been otherwise, because I’m just so grateful to that person who returned my flute. It’s been 30 years, and I haven’t forgotten their gesture.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It meant that industrial warehouses were thrown up along the banks of the Thames for much-needed storage. Almost two centuries later, only a handful of those Victorian storehouses survive, but those that do have been regenerated, inspired by the renovation of New York’s loft apartments in the 1980s.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For South African interior designer Veronique Hopkinson, a historical home – specifically, a warehouse in London – was always on the bucket list. Her riverside apartment in a Grade II-listed warehouse is in Wapping with a balcony that overlooks the Thames. The busy city river traffic includes raucous party cruisers, dredgers and navy patrol boats. When the tide drifts out, revealing the bones of the city below the waterline, hawk-eyed mudlarkers start sifting.View image in fullscreenAn ‘aircraft-inspired’ metal bedframe is softened with patterned rugs and textural wallpaper.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living Inside“I love unique properties,” says Hopkinson. “And I loved the apartment’s exposed ceiling and brick walls – it’s all part of its identity.” Industrial remnants of the old pulley system adds depth and character to the building, setting the scene for her choice of chunky, industrial furniture, contemporary artworks and dimensional lighting.Hopkinson started by stripping out all the rooms inside the two-storey apartment to create a vast open-plan living, dining and kitchen space. Her husband, Bradley, is a keen cook, regularly whipping up sourdough or sushi, and often nips down to Borough market to pick up cream to churn into butter (she applied for him to doMasterChefbut he was too busy), so the kitchen is a central feature.View image in fullscreenThe bespoke steel island in the kitchen with statement Andrew Martin lights overhead.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living Inside“I designed a massive island, 3m long, and arranged stools alongside it so that we could sit and chat while he cooks,” says Hopkinson. Made from steel, the bespoke island fits into her industrial-interiors vibe, alongside the steel units, concrete splashback, statement lighting fromAndrew Martin, and their vast American two-door fridge, which had to be winched up to the balcony to get in. To the left of the kitchen is a small, hidden scullery, which boasts two dishwashers.“I am big into storage,” says Hopkinson, describing her plan to reconfigure the entrance and stairs to create more space and cupboards. She has also installed a home office, cleverly divided off from the main living space using internal Crittall glass panels, which were custom-made to reflect the original Victorian window frames and invite natural light.View image in fullscreenThe glass panels section off the home office, and were customised to mirror the original Victorian window frames.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living InsideStudying graphic design and running her own advertising agency, Hopkinson compares her later career in interiors to working on an ad campaign. “You choose the visual references, consider the target audience and stick to the budget and deadline, it is very similar.”The living room is broken up with an Andrew Martin rug, brown leather sofas from Seattle, a pair of Timothy Oulton sheepskin armchairs and a large Oulton sculptural pendant above. Describing her style as “functional and authentic”, Hopkinson says lighting is key to creating comfort in an industrial environment. “You have to be careful with brick and wood, but lighting adds ambience.”Antique signs fromEtsy, an old juke box, a leather punch bag from Notting Hill market and wooden sculptures and masks from the couple’s native South Africa decorate their home, which they share with their two daughters, who are at university, and two pet dogs.View image in fullscreenThe family dogs alongside some of the vintage-style signage that decorate the apartment.Photograph: Ramona Balaban/Living InsideColourful artworks embellish the yellow London stock brick walls, along with the uncovered wooden beams held up by their original metal columns, now repainted black again.The dining room enjoys a bolt of red and blue from a large canvas by Ukrainian pop artist Mykola Kuryliuk.

With its local butcher and shops it’s like a little village, and walking the dogs I get to know people,” smiles Hopkinson. “And the lights in Canary Wharf are so pretty at night.”Explore more on these topicsInteriorsThe ObserverHomesDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Grand Train Tour of Switzerland – or GTToS for aficionados – certainly has the feel of an epic journey, complete with trains and boats offering panoramic views of its mountains, valleys and lakes.The GTToS takes in 1,280km of sights, many of them Unesco world heritage sites, such as the Swiss Alps of Jungfrau-Aletsch, the Matterhorn and the crystal clear waters of Lake Thun. The route is very flexible – you can hop on and off as you go.Armed with our Swiss Travel Pass, four different train lines took us from Montreux and on to Spiez, Lucerne, Locarno and Sion. The pass is a dream ticket, offering unlimited trains, boats and buses for up to 15 days, entry to 500 museums for no extra charge and half-price for some mountain excursions.We set off on a rainy Tuesday morning, taking the Eurostar from London to Paris and then on to Montreux via Geneva. Our first excursion was a visit to the Château de Chillon, which sits on Lake Geneva. Built in the 11th century, it is the biggest castle fortress in Europe and also, with good reason, the most visited monument in Switzerland. The pin-up medieval castle blends the Gothic and Romanesque, its vaults and windows of particular note. We did a whistle-stop tour of the four courtyards, bedrooms and watchtower with its 16th-century bell, before taking a short bus ride back into Montreux.View image in fullscreenZoom with a view: the Matterhorn, seen from the train.Photograph: oatawa/Getty ImagesThere, I made straight for the Freddie Mercury tour, which starts in the covered market. Needing to keep a low profile and his head down at the height of his fame, Queen’s frontman lived in Montreux on and off from 1978 until his death in 1991.The tour started at his bronze statue overlooking Lake Leman, Mercury’s fist punching up into the air, and ended at the Montreux Casino where Queen recorded six of their albums. Their Mountain Studio now houses an exhibition dedicated to the band, showcasing outfits worn onstage by Freddie, includingthatyellow jacket with the straps. Seeing slot machines and roulette wheels below such an iconic place in music history felt almost surreal.That afternoon it was time for the first leg of the GTToS, the Goldenpass Express: a two-hour journey from Montreux to Spiez. With its navy blue exterior and golden interior, it all felt rather luxurious, even in second class. The train’s enormous windows afforded panoramic views of stunning landscapes, brown Simmental cows with bells around their necks and trees turning into spring’s fresh green foliage.View image in fullscreenCrystal clear: Lake Thun, seen by ferry.Spiez is a small town beside tranquil Lake Thun. After a walk around the lake, I climbed approximately 75 steps up to Spiez Castle, with more fabulous views, this time of the Bernese Alps and the lake below.An early morning ferry on Lake Thun took us past Beatenberg, Europe’s longest village, which stretches more than 12km before arriving at Interlaken. Walking through the city took us to the Jungfrau mountain range to the right and the Grand Hotel, which looks like something from a Wes Anderson film, given its grandeur and nostalgic feel. It had a tourist resort vibe about it, with souvenir shops on every turn but, overhead, paragliders dotted the brilliant blue sky, the Jungfrau mountains still snow-capped.After that, we jumped on the Interlaken-to-Lucerne Express, a route famous for its stunning views of the region’s five lakes. The onboard bistro was a hit, too: I enjoyed a vegan tartare and a dish called “Ghackets mit Hornli” – a typical Swiss meal of minced beef, macaroni and Sbrinz cheese served with a side of apple sauce.Picturesque Lucerne, once the playground of aristocracy, is divided into two parts by the Reuss river and boasts seven bridges. I crossed the famous 14th-century covered Chapel Bridge, with the landmark water tower standing beside it, and went for an early evening stroll into the car-free Old Town. I spent an afternoon at the impressiveSwiss Transport Museum, which is especially fun for kids, with interactive exhibitions and simulation rides.View image in fullscreenThe Gotthard Panorama Express.Photograph: Dominik Baur/KeystoneOur next train was the Gotthard Panorama Express, via a boat ride across Lake Lucerne. Adding dramatic effect, it was a misty day, so the clouds covered much of the mountains. But on a clear day, you can see glaciers at the peaks with a height of 3,000m above sea level. For the train leg of the journey, the carriage could only be described as a cylinder spaceship. It included going through the Gotthard Tunnel, which at one time was the longest in the world at 15km.Locarno’s old town is dotted with different coloured houses, each shade denoting the status of its fishers. My hotel, the three-starHotel Garni Muralto, had spectacular views of Lake Maggiore. The next morning we took a ferry ride to Isola Grande, one of the Brissago Islands, home to Switzerland’s only botanical gardens and 2,000 types of subtropical species. If you’d told me that I’d find bamboo, curry plants and orange trees in Switzerland, I wouldn’t have believed you in a month of Sundays. We hopped back on the ferry and walked around the neighbouring Ascona, a quaint village full of designer stores and boutique outlets.Our final panoramic train journey was aboard the Centovalli Express to Sion, crossing through Italy and into the village of Domodossola. The train itself wasn’t as glamorous as the previous ones, but it didn’t matter. This scenic route passed by waterfalls, streams and vast forestry, going no faster than 40km on the almost two-hour journey.Arriving in Sion towards the evening, I hiked up to Sion Cathedral, where I viewed the city from the hilltop. I got there just in time to see a private jet land on the runway to my left as the sun set.Train travel offered a slower-paced alternative that allowed for me to see and sense all Switzerland’s unrivalled beauty had to offer. It didn’t disappoint one bit.A Swiss Travel Pass starts from 244 CHF (£215) for three days, go tomyswitzerland.com for more details;Villa Toscane, Montreux, has double rooms from £142 per night (villatoscane.ch);Seegarten Marina Spiez has double rooms from £168 per night (seegarten-marina.ch)Explore more on these topicsSwitzerland holidaysThe ObserverEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When we meet, on a weekday morning in February, he is in theHind’s Headin Bray, a stone’s throw from his very famous restaurant, theFat Duck, which turns 30 this August. Blumenthal is in England to test dishes he hopes to recall to an anniversary menu – a kind of Greatest Hits of the Duck. “But it’s a backbreaker,” he says. “You start off with the old recipes and you realise they’re not up to scratch – we’ve moved on. So we’re tasting, tasting, tasting.” Yesterday, Blumenthal cooked four pieces of turbot, each at a minimally different temperature, to nail the dish. “At this level, those incremental differences make a massive difference,” he goes on, looking briefly bemused. “It’s been hard.”Much else has been hard for Blumenthal recently. In November 2023, he was sectioned in France following a week-long manic episode and given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. He spent 20 days on a psychiatric ward and a further 40 days at a clinic. Blumenthal describes the ward as “a bit like a prison”. For many days prior to hospitalisation he had been unable to sit still and his mind raced. He had begun talking for hours at a time, often through the night, and he would become irritable when his wife, Melanie, whom he married earlier that year, could not find a way to respond. “He locked himself within his own universe,” Melanie told me later. “And to get in? Good luck.” Melanie eventually left for respite at her parents’ home, a two-hour drive away, and Blumenthal remained in Provence alone, experiencing symptoms of psychosis. In a phone message sent after Melanie left, Blumenthal told her he was in possession of a gun, and he began to suggest arrangements for his funeral. Of the gun he says, “It felt real, but there was nothing there, I was hallucinating… And then I started talking about death.”When Melanie received Blumenthal’s message, she phoned the town’s mayor, who had helped arrange the couple’s wedding and who now agreed to organise medical help. Blumenthal recalls being at home when a policeman knocked on his back door. “You have to climb over a wall to get to it,” he says. “I’m thinking, ‘What areyoudoing here?’” Another policeman arrived soon after, followed by several firefighters, a doctor and his assistant. (They had knocked on the front door for 40 minutes, but Blumenthal had been unaware.) When the doctor told Blumenthal he required hospital admission, Blumenthal refused. He sat on a sofa, immovable. At one point he pointed out his OBE medal, which was on display nearby, as well as several photos of a meeting he had with the Queen. Eventually he was restrained. “I was sort of fighting them,” he says. “Then I saw the doctor take out a whacking great needle and I thought, ‘Heston, let go. Just let go.’”View image in fullscreen‘I grew up being called useless and stupid. I wanted to prove to the world I wasn’t’: Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck in 2000.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The ObserverBlumenthal’s memory of these events is not completely reliable. He recalls coming to on the psychiatric ward, heavily medicated, unaware of his exact location or of the date. “I only realised later that I missed a whole day,” he says. He describes his memory from the period as “blocked”.Blumenthal’s mood has stabilised since the episode, in part due to medication, which has caused him to gain weight. Much of the past year has involved him trying to recall the details of his hospitalisation and the events leading to it, of which he’s still unsure. Blumenthal describes himself as “a walking experiment,” and he has approached his diagnosis with curiosity, as if he were on an adventure of self. (“I can’t stand not knowing how things work,” he has written.) Still, I’m surprised to discover he is unfamiliar with some of the factors that might have contributed to his illness. “It’s something you’re born with,” he says of bipolar disorder at one point, though this is only partly true, and then, “I don’t think youdevelopbipolar,” which is incorrect. (One psychiatrist told me, “People tend to have a genetic predisposition to it, and they then may develop it or they may not.”)When I ask him to describe the characteristics of the episode that resulted in his hospitalisation, he takes out his phone and addresses an AI assistant called Gemini.“Gemini,” he says, “what are the characteristics of bipolar disorder?”I’m not sure if he does this because he doesn’t know the answer, or because he wants to give an answer that is as precise and specific as his recipes.To open up is difficult, especially for men. Perhaps it is just better to be honest’Heston BlumenthalThe phone responds, “Bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity, concentration and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.”We both stare at the phone, which he is holding in his hand between us.“Characteristics of bipolar disorder,” it goes on. “Manic episodes: abnormally elevated or irritable moods, increased energy and activity, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, inflated self-esteem or grandiosity and risky behaviours. Depressive episodes: persistent, sad, empty or irritable feelings, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, significant weight loss or gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, thoughts of death or suicide.”The voice stops. Blumenthal puts down the phone.I ask if he experienced all of these characteristics.“All of them,” he says. “And you know, after the hallucinations… Hold on a second.” He picks up his phone again and asks, “Can hallucinations occur in bipolar?”“This is for informational purposes only,” the phone answers. “For medical advice or diagnosis, consult a professional. Yes, hallucinations can occur in bipolar disorder. Hallucinations are a type of sensory experience where someone sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels things that aren’t actually there. In bipolar disorder…”He puts the phone down again.It is not known exactly what causes bipolar disorder, but there is a checklist of things that might increase a person’s chances of developing the illness, and we begin to talk through the list together, a kind of process of discovery.“Recreational drugs?” I ask.“No,” he says.“Stress?” I say.Blumenthal has talked previously of the remarkable effort required to maintain a restaurant of such high standing, while simultaneously running a culinary empire involving several other restaurants, cookbooks, television shows, a well marketed collaboration with Waitrose that ended in 2023 following reports of Blumenthal’s “unpredictability”, and various public appearances. (There was a time in the 2000s when his outsized celebrity saturated food culture to such a degree that triple-cooked chips, a Blumenthal creation, became a pub standard.) He has described receiving his third Michelin star, in 2004, as “like a pat on the back and a knee in the groin”. The chef Juan Mari Arzak told him at the time, “Once you’ve got three stars, there’s no turning back.”Blumenthal opened the Fat Duck in 1995, with the financial and emotional support of his first wife, Susanna, who he calls Zanna and with whom he has three grownup children. In the restaurant’s early days, he barely slept. Zanna called him “the lodger”, referring to the fact he was rarely at home. (The couple divorced in 2017, after 28 years of marriage; he has a much younger daughter from another relationship.) “On a good day I’d be up by 5am and still prepping at 2am the following morning,” Blumenthal has written. He snatched sleep in 20-minute bursts, “usually curled up on the restaurant’s pile of dirty laundry” which was “softer than the kitchen floor”.Several behaviours from the time have resurfaced as potential evidence for previous bipolar episodes. He never seemed to need much sleep. He became quickly impatient at trivial things. He frequently became suddenly energised, often “vomiting” ideas, many of which led nowhere, though some of them, you would imagine, landed on the menu at the Fat Duck. He also became so irritable that on three separate occasions he “bit the corner off” an iPhone, and he regularly broke other objects. At his wedding in 2023, he threw a speaker across an empty room because a guest had put on a techno playlist instead of the music designed for the event. And yet “even in the anger I felt good,” he says, and “It didn’t last very long.” Once, while perfecting a recipe for crème brûlée, Blumenthal created three distinct versions, each of which had merits. “I rushed upstairs to try them out on Susanna and get her opinion, oblivious in my excitement to the fact that to do so, I had to shake her awake,” he wrote in 2008. “It was 2am.” In 2017, he was diagnosed with ADHD, a disorder unrelated to bipolar, which he believes has allowed him to hyper-focus on specific tasks.View image in fullscreen‘He locked himself within his own universe. And to get in? Good luck’: with his wife Melanie in 2024.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesRunning the Fat Duck was a high-wire act, but “It never got to the point where things became unsustainable, in terms of living every day.” He has described the restaurant’s first two years as “bedlam and chaos”. And yet he recalls the time fondly. “At the beginning of the restaurant, my routine was very regular. I was boxed in a little kitchen, peeling tomatoes one day, making stock the next. You can’t escape the routine: doors open for lunch at noon; at 7pm they open for dinner. Deadline, deadline, deadline.” He adds, “I’ve realised more and more that I’ve had many episodes over the course of my life, but I think being in the kitchen somehow contained it.”Blumenthal is aware now that maintaining regular routines can help manage bipolar episodes. But not having enough sleep can be causative, and “I didn’t have enough sleep for years,” he says. He moved to France, in 2019, in part to rebalance his life – to escape what he describes as “the hamster wheel”.So “yes” to stress.We return to the checklist.“What about childhood trauma or abuse?” I ask. “A stressful event, a problem with a relationship, a death?”“My dad died a few years ago,” he says. His father, Stephen, died in 2011. “And I lost my mum and my sister in the same week. That was about five years ago. My mum died on my birthday. My sister died two or three days before that. I’ve only just thought about this now, that there’s an element of trauma.”Blumenthal’s mother,Celia,died of cancer on 27 May 2021, after the death of his sister, Alexis. Blumenthal was in France, unable to return to the UK. “She was bipolar,” he says, of Alexis. This is the first time Blumenthal has spoken about his sister’s diagnosis. “But she didn’tbelieveshe was bipolar. To me it’s an illness. And you can fix an illness. You can do it with meds. But also, I say now that it’s part of who I am. I’m learning more and more about that. I’m more self-aware. And I’m able to sleep now, eight hours minimum.”I ask to hear more about his sister. “You could write a book about her life. She had several car crashes in South Africa. She smashed her hips. They fixed all of that up badly. She was on all sorts of painkillers. I think her body just gave in.” (Alexis was found dead at her home. A postmortem was inconclusive about the cause of her death.)I ask if either of his parents were diagnosed with bipolar.“I think my mum could have had it,” he says. “That’s something Melanie and I have talked about since the diagnosis. She could have had it.”Blumenthal remembers his mother as a frequently angry woman who struggled to offer parental love. “I grew up being called useless and stupid,” he says. “I don’t even remember if she was aware of it. It had a big effect on me, but also in the positive, because I wanted to prove to the world I wasn’t stupid.” He considered it normal for his mother to blow up at the slightest infraction. Whenever he made a mistake, he expected her to lash out verbally. He adds, “Cretin was another word.”I ask if his sister suffered the same behaviour.“My sister and my mum fought massively,” he says. “This was in the press. They had a fight on Thame high street. Someone took a picture of it. It was in the Mail. Let me try…”He picks up his phone and searches for the story.“Manhunt for Heston Blumenthal’s sister” he says, paraphrasing a headline. “Four-year campaign of rage against the pair’s 70-year-old mother, Celia.” He reads on. “Heston Blumenthal’s sister was given a suspended judgement for slamming their mother’s head against a car…”This happened in 2017. Alexis had been living on and off with their mother. It was reported that she had already punched Celia several times while shouting, “I’m going to kill you.” Alexis was given a 10-week suspended prison sentence. The events, which Celia described in court reports as “verbal and violent abuse”, were blamed on Alexis’s drinking. “I tried to get involved to help,” Blumenthal says. “But I couldn’t, not being there.”I ask him to describe his father.“He was calm as anything, my dad. I think he had to be because my mum was a massive character.” Whenever the couple argued, Blumenthal’s father would remain quiet until his wife’s anger blew over. “My dad used to say that I was brought up in a war between the two of them.”Blumenthal recalls his family history matter-of-factly and without self-pity. “It’s funny,” he goes on. “She never acknowledged anything I did.” When he published his bestsellingThe Fat Duck Cookbook, in 2008, his mother announced, “That’snot a cookbook.” He recalls his mother once visiting the restaurant. “I had a sous chef called Gary at the time. Mum ordered some cod and said, ‘I want Gary to cook this, because Heston can’t cook fish.’” He shakes his head. “We had one or two stars by then.”For a while in adulthood, Blumenthal considered his mother’s treatment a form of abuse. But recently his opinion has changed. “I think it was her way of caring,” he says. After she died, Blumenthal returned to the UK to clear out her home. He found a cabinet filled with news articles about him and his work, and he took this collection as proof of her love. “But she could never say she was proud of me, which was an interesting thing. It was like I was in competition with her. I don’t know why. And obviously I can’t talk to her about it now.”I ask how Blumenthal’s own children have reacted to the diagnosis. “Well, my son went, ‘Hello…’ He didn’t seem very surprised.” Blumenthal’s son, Jack, is now a chef. “They’re a good barometer. They tell me, you know, if I’m sounding good. And they haven’t shown any signs of bipolar.”View image in fullscreenStill standing: Heston Blumenthal.Photograph: David Vintiner/The ObserverBlumenthal was bornin 1966 in London. His father was a businessman who suffered financial ups and downs. His mother was a secretary who often worked alongside her husband. For a time, the family lived in a basement flat at the address 1 Hyde Park. They had relatives in South Africa, where they would visit, and on at least one occasion Blumenthal and his sister accompanied his grandmother, the family matriarch, on a trip to the US. But he struggled at school. A curious boy with interests different to his peers, he found it difficult to fit in. “It was a comfortable life,” Melanie told me later. “But I think not so much love.”When Blumenthal was 16, he visitedL’Oustau de Baumanière, a three-star Michelin restaurant in Provence, with his family. He fell in love with the food, but also the restaurant’s theatre: the waiters in bow ties, the mustachio-ed sommelier, the chirruping of grasshoppers. It was 1982. Blumenthal’s mother had been a fine cook. She “made good use of the pressure cooker,” he has written. But he “grew up in an era when Britain’s gastronomic reputation was at an all-time (and largely deserved) low.”When he returned to the UK, he began to experiment in the kitchen, sometimes making dishes for dinner parties organised by his parents. For a while he worked odd jobs and cooked at the weekend, “trying to reproduce whatever had caught my imagination,” on further trips to France, where he was “banking flavour-memories, developing a set of reference points”. He opened the Fat Duck with almost no experience of working in a kitchen. And yet his approach, which mixed scientific precision with avant-garde flair, was almost immediately successful. Several of his early dishes – including snail porridge, and bacon ice-cream – were controversial, and instantly became culinary and cultural touchpoints. The New York Times once said of him, “There appears to be no culinary shibboleth that Mr Blumenthal will not challenge, and no limit for his search for a better way.”Blumenthal never considered the possibility of receiving three Michelin stars. “I thought maybe one day I’d get one,” he says. “That was it.” Asked if he has ever strived to be great, he shakes his head, replying, “I wanted to be… I guess I wanted to be understood.”A couple of weeksafter I meet Blumenthal in Bray, I speak to him again on Zoom. He is back in Provence with Melanie, who is sitting alongside him. I want to ask about his use of cocaine, rumours of which had been relayed to me since our first conversation by friends and acquaintances, who had worried for Blumenthal’s safety. (One chef told me, “Nobody seemed to be sorting him out.”)When we first met, Blumenthal had denied the use of recreational drugs, despite it perhaps being a factor in his illness, and I had wondered why. Now he is reticent. I sense he is embarrassed, perhaps at the fact people had been talking about him. But he then appears to give in. “There was an element of self-medication,” he says. “And I realised it wasn’t helping at all.” (He does not say how long it took him to realise this.) He mentions the actor Stephen Fry, who also has bipolar disorder, and who oncerelied on cocaineand alcohol to combat sudden and severe mood swings. (Fry used cocaine to upswing from depression and alcohol to calm the highs of mania; Blumenthal did not drink.) He goes on, “It’s a classic thing with bipolar. You don’t allow yourself to say, ‘I’m not OK.’ And there is this automatic thing to try to self-medicate.” A psychiatrist will tell you that cocaine, a stimulant, can mimic behaviour commonly experienced during a manic episode, while adding that people with bipolar are more likely to engage in reckless behaviour, including drug-taking. In a later voice note he adds, “It was never a party thing,” and then, “The problem is: what goes up, must come down.”On Zoom, Melanie says, “It’s a part of the condition. When you are in crisis, you are so sure you are healthy, that everything is OK.” She looks at Blumenthal and then back at me. “That’s why we also arrived at this point. He didn’t want to see a doctor. Nothing.” Blumenthal says, “I wouldn’t face up to it. It was nonsense to me.”I couldn’t bring comfort to him. He was not sleeping. He was barely eating. Everything was escalatingMelanie BlumenthalI ask Melanie what it was like to be aware that Blumenthal was unwell while he couldn’t accept it. “I felt stupid,” she says. “Would you say you felt lost?” Blumenthal asks. “Well, I was lost, yes. But I was more feeling out of power. I couldn’t bring comfort to him. He was not sleeping. He was barely eating. Everything was escalating.”Blumenthal has to join another call, so I continue the conversation with Melanie, who moves to a second office. “This was happening a year ago,” she says, referring to previous manic episodes. “But it would stop and he would be OK. Then from September or October everything became more intense.” Blumenthal was due to finalise some paperwork relating to the estate of his parents. And he was planning a belated celebration of the lives of his mother and sister, whose ashes he had only recently received. In the midst of the organisation, it “became difficult to get Heston’s attention,” Melanie says. “He was full of anxiety. I could see it was at this point that everything starts to accelerate.”Melanie sensed Blumenthal’s loss had become too much to bear. During his manic episode, she asked her father, who once worked as a manager of mental health centres in France, to visit for a few days, in an attempt to seek early help. When he arrived, he knew immediately that something was wrong. He and Melanie also noticed that Blumenthal was speaking more and more about his family. “Heston said to my dad, ‘I’ve lost my mum, I’ve lost my sister,’” Melanie says. She supposed it was an effort to explain away his behaviour, which had become increasingly erratic. It was as though Blumenthal had not yet processed his grief, Melanie thought. And, now, here it was, the past exploding into the present.During our first conversation, Blumenthal told me he was admitted to hospital on 12 November. “It was 11 November,” Melanie says now, “which was his sister’s birthday.” Blumenthal met Melanie in 2021 in Val d’Isère, where Melanie was working. She met neither of his parents or his sister. Of Blumenthal she says, “His memories [of family] are changing at the moment. He’s starting to remember more and more things.”I ask how it felt to have made the decision to have Blumenthal sectioned. “I would say I’m working on it,” she says. “I have massive guilt. Sectioning someone is removing their freedom. It is me saying he wasn’t able to take care of himself.” She has worried that onlookers would suppose she was attempting to take control of his life. “But they don’t know.” She adds, “You think, ‘Is he going to understand?’ I hope he understands.”Blumenthal does understand. “It’s kind of forged us closer,” he told me of their relationship. Of his current self he said, “You could argue that I’m grieving for where I was before,” and yet he is coming to accept his new situation: more calm, more balance, more patience. “There’s no breaking things,” he added, and less “vocalising of ideas.” At the Fat Duck, he has surrounded himself with old colleagues he has worked with for many years, in an attempt to recover a kind of professional stability. And he is returning to the restaurant more frequently now than he has done over the past 20 years.Blumenthal calls methe next morning, while I am taking my young children to school. When I call back he is eager to clarify points from our previous conversations, particularly around his use of cocaine, which he is worried will make headlines. For a while we talk politely around the subject of perception – how his story is likely to be received by a public that has until now associated him with a kind of culinary genius – and I sense his nervousness. Before we hang up, he says, “I have been very open with you.” It is an effort, I think, to reiterate his vulnerability, and perhaps an attempt to influence what comes from our discussions. But then he seems to relax, and I feel his anxiety ease. He had earlier told me that “to open up is difficult, especially for men,” and yet he seems to relish the responsibility of becoming a kind of spokesperson, to spread the word of his experience, to inform others. Our call lasts five or so minutes. As a parting line he says, “Perhaps it is just better to be honest.”The Fat Duck celebrates its 30th anniversary with the return of the à la carte menu (thefatduck.co.uk)If you have been affected by any of these issues, callSamaritanson freephone 116 123 or contactMindExplore more on these topicsHeston BlumenthalThe ObserverFoodMental healthHealthRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And feel less shame in the aftermath? I come from a working-class, immigrant background. I have risen through the ranks in my team and now have a lead role where I go to lots of meetings. I frequently suffer with impostor syndrome. I have seen people reach the top of their game just by being good at meetings, while I feel like I lack this skill, and now this job is more challenging.I long to stay in my comfort zone in which I have lots of quiet time to do work rather than attend meetings. Though if I was to do that, I’d be taking a step down in my career. After talking topeople I admire, I end up not sleeping and rerunning the conversation,annoyed at myself for my performance.Separately, I have small childrenthat often don’t sleep through the night. I never feel at my best at work because of this. Will attending meetings and building collaborations ever get easier? The mental load I have because of my background, the anxiety in the lead-up to meetings and the overthinking andshame I feel in the aftermath is exhausting.Conversation was never a big thing in my familyand I was never encouraged to speak out or express myself, especially as the youngest in the family. My mum’s words were often critical and harsh, and she has suffered from mental health issues. I wonder if this is contributing to the shame I feel and what can be done about it.Philippa’s answerI’m not so sure impostor syndrome is entirely a bad thing. If you feel it, it means you are stretching your comfort zone, you are doing something new that you just aren’t used to yet, and these are good things to do. This is how we grow. Observe the voice saying whatever it is that your impostor syndrome tells you, but don’t take it too seriously. It doesn’t know what it’s talking about!You’re not imagining the challenge of meetings. They’re a skill like any other and some people have had a lifetime of practice. If you didn’t grow up in an environment where conversation and self-expression were encouraged, no wonder it feels unnatural. But unnatural doesn’t mean impossible. It just means new.That voice in your head telling you that you’re saying the wrong things, or not saying enough, or that everyone else is more at ease than you are, is not telling the truth. It’s just old echoes of growing up in a critical environment where confidence wasn’t nurtured. You are carrying a history that some of your colleagues aren’t; it doesn’t mean you’re not capable. It just means you must approach it differently.Instead of expecting meetings to feel natural, what if the aim was just to tolerate the discomfort for now?You are very much not alone in this. The psychologist Erica Boothby noticed that she felt she had made a bad impression on a new person. Her partner, another psychologist, Gus Cooney, witnessed this encounter and he thought her exchange had been warm and friendly. They wondered whether this was a common experience for everyone. Do we consistently underestimate how much another person appreciates our presence or our input? They called this phenomenon the “liking gap”. It’s the gap between the impression we think we’ve made and the impression we actually make. Their subsequent studies showed that we humans consistently pessimistically underestimate how much other people appreciate us.Right now, you’re exhausted: small children, broken sleep, a job that’s pushing you out of your comfort zone. Anyone would struggle in those conditions. This isn’t you failing, it is you surviving under pressure.What if you changed the goal? Instead of expecting meetings to feel natural and effortless, what if the aim was just to tolerate the discomfort for now? Not to make it go away overnight, just to get through, knowing that over time itwillget easier. What if, after a meeting, instead of replaying every word, you just said: “That was enough. I am enough. I did it. On to the next.” It will feel strange or even untrue when you say it. Never mind. The old voice is also untrue, it’s just that you’re used to it. Make the “I am enough” mantra more familiar and it will begin to feel true, and that will help your confidence.You don’t have to feel like you belong in every room to make an impact in it. You just have to stay in the room. Keep showing up. Keep tolerating the discomfort. You might not have had parents who built your confidence, but you can build it in relationships with others, because the more you speak up, the more normal it will feel. Even if the self-doubt never fully goes away, it doesn’t have to run the show.Recommended reading: The Laws of Connection by David Robson and The Book You Want Everyone You Love To Read (andMaybe aFewThatYouDon’t) byPhilippa PerryExplore more on these topicsLife and styleAsk PhilippaWork & careersWork-life balanceSelf EsteemWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After his arrest, immigration officials said they were seeking to deport him under a provision of federallaw that gives the US secretary of state, currentlyMarco Rubio, the power to deport someone if their presence in the country is deemed to “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.Why was Mahmoud Khalil arrested and why is it such a big deal?Read moreThe US constitution gives the president tremendous power over foreign affairs. TheTrump administrationis now trying to use that authority to dramatically expand its immigration powers and curtail rights for immigrants.“They’re trying to read foreign policy and national security and national interests all very broadly. And this seems sort of on the piece with that, trying to now create essentially foreign policy authority to deporting green card holders,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, a co-director of the center for immigration law and policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.The provision being cited in Khalil’s case has rarely been used and the scope of the secretary of state’s discretion is unclear, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor.Courts have generally found that non-citizens such as Khalil, a legal permanent resident, have the same first amendment protections that citizens do. The question in Khalil’s case is how far those protections extend against a determination by the secretary of state that a foreign national should be deported.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump as Marco Rubio (center) looks on during a cabinet meeting in Washington DC on 26 February.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesKhalil’s lawyers are currently fighting to get him moved back to New Yorkfrom Louisiana, where he is currently being held, and plan to ask a federal judge for his release from detention so that he can be present for the birth of his first child, due next month. The broader issues could take much longer to litigate.“The primary issue in the case, I think, that is going to be litigated is whether this is unconstitutional first amendment retaliation,” said Ramya Krishnan, a lawyer at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia. “If the first amendment means anything, it means that the government can’t lock you up or deport you because of your political views. That’s literally the most important thing about this country.”Krishnan said that the provision Rubio is relying on to pursue Khalil’s immigration can’t be used to override constitutional freedoms.“Whatever the text of the statute says, it’s subject to the first amendment. And the theory of the case that they’re advancing here is astonishingly broad,” she added.Mahmoud Khalil’s treatment should not happen in a democracy | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreFederal law also blocks the government from removing someone “because of the alien’s past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations, if such beliefs, statements, or associations would be lawful within the United States, unless the Secretary of State personally determines that the alien’s admission would compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest”. In a legal filing on Thursday, Khalil’s lawyers said it was obvious he was being punished for his viewpoints.“Neither Secretary Rubio nor any other government official has alleged that Mr Khalil has committed any crime or, indeed, broken any law whatsoever,”they wrote. “The Rubio Determination was exclusively motivated by Mr Khalil’s lawful, constitutionally-protected past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations.”Trump administration officials have not formally laid out the case for why they believe Khalil threatens the foreign policy interests of the United States. The White House told the outlet the Free Press that Khalil’s arrestwould be a “blueprint”for investigating other students.“This is not about free speech. This is about people that don’t have a right to be in the United States to begin with,” Rubiotold reporterson Wednesday. “You pay all this money to these high-priced schools that are supposed to be of great esteem, and you can’t even go to class. You’re afraid to go to class because these lunatics are running around with covers on their face, screaming terrifying things,” Rubio said. “If you told us that’s what you intended to do when you came to America, we would have never let you in. If you do it once you get in, we’re going to revoke it and kick you out.”Tom Homan,Donald Trump’s “border czar”, suggested on Wednesday that Khalil had exceeded the protections of the first amendment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Can you slander? Free speech has limitations,” he said.Arulanantham said so far it seemed like the government was “running headlong into supreme court precedent and right into the teeth of the first amendment”.The government“can’t act to retaliate against people for their first amendment activity. And so I think you can look at that statute and say clearly the authority is very broad, but whether it is so broad as to encompass targeting people for their first amendment activity is a different question.”Adam Cox, an immigration law professor at New York University, said that the government would probably meet skeptical judges if it argued that Khalil’s speech was the basis for its decision to deport him. But, he said, if the government argued that it had a non-speech basis for deporting Khalil, that could improve their case. Khalil’s lawyers would probably argue that such a rationale was pretextual – meaning concealing the government’s actual intent – but courts might be reluctant to investigate such claims.There isn’t really a legal precedent for a case like Khalil’s, experts said. The closest example seems to be a case from the 1990s in which the secretary of state, Warren Christopher, relied on the provision to deport Mario Ruiz Massieu, a former deputy attorney general of Mexico who faced an arrest warrant in the country. After immigration judges refused to deport him, Christopher issued a letter saying that returning Massieu was important to maintaining cooperation between the United States and Mexico.Who is Mahmoud Khalil? The detained Columbia graduate praised as steady negotiatorRead moreBrian Hauss, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who is on Khalil’s legal team, said that Congress intended for the provision to apply to “a high-ranking foreign adversary … or a non-citizen who violates a treaty or international agreement to which the United States is a party. In other words, Congress did not intend to apply the foreign policy bar to protesters.”Afederal judge in New Jerseysaid the provision was unconstitutional. The decision was later reversed on procedural grounds.If courts embrace the Trump administration’s efforts to justify removals on foreign policy grounds, it could have a profound impact.“If the government has an objective to promote fossil fuel use across the globe, for example, then the Secretary of State could deem climate science advocates – or even noncitizens who own green technology firms – deportable on the ground that their residency ‘undermines the policy objective’ of promoting fossil fuels,” Cox and Arulanantham wrote in a post onJust Security.“Rather than the statute setting the terms of deportability in advance, it would license the Secretary of State to turn nearly any activity into a basis for deportability after the fact,” they wrote.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMahmoud KhalilUS immigrationUS foreign policyUS politicsMarco RubioLaw (US)analysisShareReuse this content"

Certainly, frustrated frontline staff emerge as victims of the financial meltdown of the UK’s largest water company. At the giant Mogden sewage plant in west London – a site normally off-limits to outsiders because it is classed as critical national infrastructure – employees struggle with old equipment to keep “the beast”, as they call it, from spilling its guts whenever the heavens open. Veterans of 30 years bemoan the lack of investment and cuts to the workforce over many years.A lot of money could be saved in the long term by removing accumulated grit from a holding tank, suggests one, but the operation hasn’t happened because it would cost £250,000. Josh (it’s first names only in this two-parter), the 26-year-old manager of the site, gets his hands dirty and offers fresh-faced enthusiasm until he is ground down. A sorrowful employee inspects dead fish in a watercourse in Reigate where a Thames Water main has exploded. “It’s really not good,” he says. “I don’t even know how it can change.”There we get to the heart of the story. The company’s other motivation for agreeing to this film, one suspects, was to try to encourage the poor customers to accept substantially higher bills to pay for new infrastructure. The programme, filmed over the second half of last year, unfolds to the ticking clock of Thames’s rising debts and the slow-burn of regulator Ofwat’s decision on bills (the companyultimately didn’t get the rises it wantedand isappealing against the decision).View image in fullscreenA scene from Thames Water: Inside the Crisis,Photograph: BBCYet the bubbling question throughout is how Thames descended into this mess. The outline is familiar by now: a toxic mix of dividend extraction, debt accumulation and financial engineering in the 2006-17 era, plus inadequate enforcement of environmental regulation and, if you wish, the political and regulatory desire for lower bills.Chris – that’s Chris Weston, newish chief executive – isn’t keen to enter those murky waters. “I’ve only been here 10 months. I want to fix it. I don’t know how it got this way,” he says. Really? No idea at all? Well, he later suggests, it’s not down to the greed of shareholders or management but “a whole lot of things”.At another moment, Weston complains about the supposedly “invasive” influence of Ofwat, the water regulator. “It is quite incredible,” he opines. “They are getting more and more interested and intrusive around dividends.” What was he expecting? Thames has 16 million customers andbreached its operating licencewhen its borrowings were downgraded to junk status in July last year. Ofwat wouldn’t be doing its job if it wasn’t blocking divis.There is clearer insight from his colleagues. Tess, the director of waste, suggests “people chose to operate at the edge of the guardrails” – a polite description of how former owners whacked up debt ratios when the focus should have been on the assets. Staff at Mogden instinctively see that adding £3bn to a £15bn debt pile viaan emergency loanat the nose-bleed rate of 9.75% (plus add-ons) is a strange sort of mini-victory: “It just seems so hand-to-mouth,” says one.That remark points to the current drama, playing out away from the cameras at the court of appeal, in the form ofthe legal scrap between two classes of bondholders. The outcome, due this week, will go a long way to determining whether Thames survives in current form to attempt a fuller financial restructuring, complete with equity injection from new shareholders and debt write-downs. The alternative is a special administration regime, aform of temporary nationalisation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Viewers and customers may conclude that those unseen creditors deserve a proper rinsing, which may mean more than the £5bn-ish they are hoping to escape with by appealing for a softer regulatory settlement. Bondholders, after all, kept the failing show on the road for 20 years without, one strongly suspects, ever looking too closely at the state of sites such as Mogden.If creditor losses have to be much greater than £5bn to allow a proper fix – and if that can only be achieved via a spell in administration before reincarnation on the stock market – so be it. Nobody hates Thames Water’s people.

He is due to be sentenced on 20 March.According to court documents, in September last year, a boy woke up distressed from his nap and walked to the outside area of the centre. Tong approached the boy and started tickling his groin on top of his clothing with his fingers and rubbing the child’s bottom with both hands.Police claim the incident, which was described in the police fact sheet as “serious child abuse”, was witnessed by at least two other educators, one of whom told Tong to keep his hands up and away from the child’s groin, but said Tong continued the touching.According to the fact sheet, which outlines the police allegations and witnesses’ statements, the educator then said to Tong: “‘Stop what you are doing, put your hands up, keep your hands up, it is not OK to touch his penis or his bottom, keep your hands up.’ The accused had no response, smiled and walked away.”Tong was arrested more than a month later and pleaded guilty to the offences at the end of January.Questions over reporting timelineOnly About Children (OAC) is one of the largest providers of childcare in Australia, providing care to more than 8,000 families across more than 80 centres around the country.Guardian Australia can reveal seven days elapsed after the educator who witnessed the incident says she told OAC management about it, before OAC reported Tong to the education department and the police, and through other mandatory reporting processes.According to her statement to police,one of the educators who witnessed the incident reported it to OAC management the following day. Guardian Australia has confirmed that police and the department of education, as well as other regulatory bodies, were informed by OAC seven days later. Tong was stood down by OAC the same day the reports to authorities were made.OAC’s handling of the situation is under investigation by the NSW Department of Education, the regulator for early childhood education and care (ECEC) services, which investigates whenever it receives a report of an incident at a childcare centre.“Educators are mandatory reporters and must make an immediate report if they are aware or suspect any serious incident, including sexual abuse of a child,” a department spokesperson said.“This report must be made within 24 hours to the NSW ECEC Regulatory Authority and must also be reported to NSW police.“Failure to report any serious incident that occurs in a service to the regulatory authority is taken seriously and thoroughly investigated … An immediate report must be made to police if there is a concern about child abuse.”Ashley Griffith committed ‘depraved’ abuse at childcare centres for nearly 20 years. Were warning signs ignored?Read moreOAC did not reply to questions about what being “stood down” meant and whether Tong had worked across any OAC centre during the week between the incident occurring and when he was stood down. The company also did not reply to questions about the length of time it took to report the incident.In a statement, the chief executive of OAC, Anna Learmonth, said: “We have acknowledged that we could have handled this incident better and apologise fully for the distress that this matter has caused families.“OAC will continue to co-operate fully with relevant authorities as the standard mandatory investigations triggered by this incident are completed.“Where people fail to adhere to our systems and processes, we will hold them to account.”According to data obtained by the Guardian under freedom of infomation laws, the NSW ECEC regulatory authority has launched investigations into nearly 2,000 incidents alleging physical or sexual abuse of a child at childcare centres by an educator since 2020, including 414 in the first 10 months of 2024.“When child safety has been found to be compromised, I have not hesitated to bar people from the sector, suspend or cancel services or providers, as well as prosecute for the most serious matters,” said Sharon Gudu, the NSW ECEC regulator.‘We’ve got no way of knowing’Tong had only been employed as an educator at OAC Seaforth for five months, but he had been a casual educator at various OAC campuses since 2022. OAC did not reply to questions about which centres Tong had worked at and whether any complaints had been raised about him at these centres.One of those campuses was OAC Redfern, which Anna’s child attended. Tong worked there for at least 14 shifts and Anna says her child was present at daycare for most of those shifts, though she cannot face combing through the dates to work out the exact number.Tong has not been charged with any other offences, and the Guardian is not suggesting he has harmed other children.“This might sound dramatic, but it’s been earth-shattering,” says Anna of learning of Tong’s crime.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another said she had seen Tong kissing children on the head, which seemed “strange, inappropriate and concerning”. A third said she had witnessed him kissing a child on the cheek.The centre spoke to Tong about the reports from his colleagues, nearly a month after the first complaint was raised, and told him that it was inappropriate to kiss the children anywhere even if they were upset, according to the fact sheet.Despite the warning, Tong went on to offend by touching the boy’s groin and bottom a week later.White says he was shocked to learn that according to the court documents it had taken a week before the incident was reported to police, and there had been previous warnings about Tong before the incident that led to his arrest.School refusal, drop-outs and private enrolments on the rise: what we learned from Australia’s latest education reportRead more“I think all parents and all people are appalled at the idea that there might be offenders at daycares. I think that’s something that’s very hard to control, especially if there’s somebody who hasn’t had a background of offending before. I think the things we can control are what are the regulations or laws that daycares have to abide by in terms of mandatory reporting and what are their practices when they notice inappropriate behaviour by their educator.”White and Emma raised their concerns about OAC’s communication with parents about the incident with management, including at a virtual meeting in late October with a senior executive from the company. The executive sent an email the following day, telling them:“I wanted to confirm (as I didn’t yesterday) that as required, OAC reported this incident to both the Department of Education … and via the mandatory reporting process … [and] to the Office of the Children’s Guardian. On the same day as these reports, we also reported this to the local police station.”White says he finds this email very upsetting now that he knows police say it was seven days from the time of being told of the offending until OAC reported to the police or other bodies.“We are determined to learn the lessons from this situation and have put in place a number of initiatives to further reinforce and enhance our processes, training and systems,” Learmonth said in a statement to Guardian Australia.Learmonth’s statement said these initiatives included commissioning an external reviews of policies, systems and processes; appointing a safeguarding expert to provide advice, support and training; refresher training for all campus directors on safeguarding and reporting; additional central oversight and performance management of casual employees; extra training for staff and a review of recruitment processes.White, Emma and Anna kept their children out of daycare for several months before facing the reality that they would have to find a way to trust their children to the care of strangers again.“It’s a really difficult decision for the two of us to send him back to daycare knowing how close he’s been to harm,” White says.“We’ve got very little choice about it, we both need to work, we don’t have the option of one of us working and the other taking care of him. Unfortunately we just have to learn we don’t control the circumstances at daycare … and hope that if anything does happen, we’ll be able to support our son and support each other.”In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact theKids Helplineon 1800 55 1800, orBraveheartson 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contactBlue Knot Foundationon 1300 657 380.

He was just a tech guy on a mission to “eliminate waste and fraud” from government.His slash-and-burn cost-cutting crusade was making “good progress actually”, he told the Fox Business commentator Larry Kudlow on Monday, despite sparking a backlash that has reverberated far beyond Washington.“Really, I just don’t want America to go bankrupt,” he said.But then Kudlow asked Musk to look forward. Would the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) still be in place in a year? He thought so – his assignment wasn’t quite complete. Musk, the world’s richest man, then pointed tosocial security, a widely popular federal program that provides monthly benefits to retirees and people with disabilities, and other social safety net programs: “Most of the federal spending is entitlements. That’s the big one to eliminate.”Elon Musk faces week of harsh setbacks amid Tesla selloff and Doge backlashRead moreFor weeks,Donald TrumpandRepublicanshave insisted that social security,MedicaidorMedicarewould not “be touched”. Now Musk was suggesting the programs would be a primary target. Almost as soon as the words left his mouth,Democratspounced.“The average social security recipient in this country receives $65 a day. They have to survive on $65 a day. But you want to take a chainsaw to social security, when Elon Musk and his tens of billions of dollars of government contracts essentially makes at least $8m a day from the taxpayers,”Hakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in afloor speechthe following day. “If you want to uncover waste, fraud or abuse, start there.”As the second Trump era comes into focus, Democrats have found anew villain: an “unelected billionaire” whose bravado – and sinking popularity – they believe may offer their party a path out of the political wilderness.“There’s nowhere in America where it is popular to cut disease research, to gut Medicaid and to turn off social security,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “So it’s hard to see a place where what Musk is doing for Trump doesn’t become an albatross forRepublicans.”The White House has championed Doge’s work while reiterating that Trump would “protect” social security and other entitlement programs. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.The Social Security Administration , which serves more than 70 million Americans, hasannouncedplans to reduce its workforce by more than 10% and close dozens of offices nationwide as part of Doge’s federal overhaul. Officials with the group have beeninstalledat the agency since early last month.Despite mounting criticism of Musk, the president has embraced his beleaguered ally, who spent close to $300m helping elect him to the White House. This week, Trump hailed Musk as a “patriot” as heshowcased Teslasfrom the south lawn of the White House. The president selected a red sedan, hoping to boost the electric car company, which hassuffered a sharp declinein sales and stock prices since its chief executive launched his Doge operation. The White House has said that if conflicts of interest arise, “Elon will excuse himself from those contracts”.But Musk and hischainsaw-wielding approachto downsizing government is playing a starring role inearly Democratic adsand fundraising appeals. Progressive activists have staged “nobody elected Elon”protestsacross the country while other groups are targetingTesla showroomsand dealerships. On a “fighting oligarchy” tour across the country, SenatorBernie Sanderspointed to Musk’s growing political influence as a central threat to American democracy.“Most American people, they can’t name us. They don’t know who Chuck Schumer is, but they do know what this administration andElon Muskand the GOP are planning for them,” Katherine Clark, the House minority whip, said on Friday. “It’s why you’re seeing this uproar in town halls.”‘A particularly heinous villain’: a disdain for Musk has sparked protests across USRead moreWhileDemocratshave much to say about Musk, they are less sure of how to stop him.Many of Doge’s actions have been halted or stopped in the courts. This week two federal judgesorderedgovernment agencies to rehire tens of thousands of probationary employees who were fired as part of Doge’s purge of the federal workforce.Locked out of power in Washington, Democrats are underenormous pressureto use any leverage they have to block Trump and Musk. A Republican-authored bill to fund federal agencies through September and avert a shutdown fiercely divided Democrats this week. House Democrats and progressive activists erupted in anger atChuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, who ultimatelyrelentedand helped pass the measure rather than risk a funding lapse and, in his words, give Musk and Doge an opportunity to “exploit the crisis for maximum destruction”.Public polling underlines Democrats’ interest in Musk. A newCNN surveyfound that just 35% of Americans held a positive view of the billionaire Trump adviser, a full 10 percentage points lower than the president. The poll also found that he is notably better known and more unpopular than the vice-president,JD Vance.More than six in 10 Americans said Musk had neither the right experience nor the judgment to carry out a unilateral overhaul of the federal government, though views broke sharply along partisan lines. Roughly the same share said they were worried the reductions would go “too far”, resulting in the loss of critical government programs.A survey conducted by the left-leaning Navigator Research polling firm late last month found that views of Doge as a standalone cost-cutting initiative were marginally favorable, in line with other polls that have found Americans arebroadly supportiveof its stated mission to root out waste and improve efficiency. But there are signs Americans don’t like the approach or implementation so far.When the effort was framed as “Elon Musk’s Doge”, views turned sharply more negative. The poll also captured the far-reaching impact of the cuts: 20% say they or someone they know has lost access to a federal service, 19% say they or someone they know has lost access to a federal grant, and 17% say they or someone they know has quit or been laid off from a federal government job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Federal watchdogs have long identified improper spending as a problem, but Musk’s figure exceeds their estimates.Musk has derided social security as “thebiggest Ponzi schemeof all time”. As evidence of widespread fraud, Musk repeated a debunked theory,favored by Trump, that social security benefits are being paid to dead centenarians. The head of the agency hasrejectedthe premise. Democrats have warned that Trump and Musk were using false or exaggerated claims of fraud as a “prelude” to slash the program or privatize it, as many conservatives have long desired.After Musk’s comments aired, the White House swiftly issued a “fact check” insisting that Musk had only advocated for eliminating waste and highlighted several occasions in which Trump has vowed to protect Americans’ benefits.Republicans also rushed to clarify Musk’s comments. “Look, Elon Musk is a brainiac with an IQ that I cannot even fathom. He is not a master of artful language,” Mark Alford, a Republican representative of Missouri,said on CNN. “We are not going to eliminate social security, Medicare and Medicaid. That’s sheer nonsense.”It was a rare break with Musk, whom Republicans have been loath to cross, well aware that he not only has the president’s full support and ear but a fortune to squash any dissent within the ranks. During Trump’saddress to Congressearlier this month, Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation as the president heaped praise on his work. They publicly warn that Democrats oppose Musk’s fraud-and-waste removal efforts at their own political peril.Yet there are signs that Republicans are beginning to worry. Despite Trump’s close alliance with Musk, even he seemed to indicate it was time to rein him in. “We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet’,” the president wrote in a social media post.House Republicans have reportedlybeen advisednot to hold in-person town halls after several widely publicized confrontations with constituents furious over loss of government jobs and services. At the few meetings that did take place this weekend, constituentsconfrontedRepublican members of Congress with their concerns about possible cuts to social security.Republicans are weighingdeep cutsto entitlement programs as a way to offset the cost of extending Trump’s sweeping tax cuts aimed largely at the wealthy. Trump haspraisedthe House plan.‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutesRead more“The Republican party at this point has wrapped both arms around the third rail and is holding on as the electricity flows,” said Ben Wikler, the chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsin, wherea contest next monthwill provide an early test of the party’s anti-Musk strategy.On Thursday night, Wikler hosted a People v Musk grassroots event to discuss the billionaire’s impact on the 1 April state supreme court race, which will determine the balance of power between conservative and liberal justices on Wisconsin’s highest bench. Musk has spentmillions of dollarsthrough his America Pac in an effort to tip the scales in favor of Brad Schimel, a county judge and former Republican attorney general. Democrats are supporting Susan Crawford, a county judge and former attorney for Planned Parenthood.Wikler said Musk’s ascendancy in Washington – and his influence in the race – has turned liberal voters in the state from “concerned to panicked to outraged with the heat of 1,000 suns”.“If Susan Crawford wins this race, and Musk and Schimel lose,” he said, “then that will be a big bat signal in the sky to Democrats everywhere that fighting back is not only the right thing to do, it’s good politics.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationRepublicansDemocratsHouse of RepresentativesUS SenateUS CongressfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s tempting to blame this on social media – which does indeed ­exacerbate the problem. And AI deepfakes promise to make the situation even worse. But at root this is not about technology: it’s about how humans think, as an astonishing case that long predates the internet reveals. This is an amazing story – about the perils of amazing stories.In November 1967, at the height of the war in Vietnam, a strange ­document was published in New York.Report from Iron Mountainwas the work of a top-secret “­special study group” recruited by the Kennedy administration to scope out what would happen to the US if permanent global peace broke out. It warned the end of war, and of the fear of war, would wreck America’s economy, even its whole society. To replace the effects, extreme measures would be required – eugenics, fake alien scares, pollution, blood games. Even slavery. The report was so incendiary it had been suppressed, but one of the study group leaked it, determined that the public learn the truth. It caused a furore. The worried memos, demanding someone check if this document was real, went all the way up to President Johnson.View image in fullscreenA 1967 first edition of Leonard Lewin’s incendiary satirical book.Photograph: Phil TinlineIn reality, as the White House eventually realised,Report from Iron Mountainwas a hoax. It was the brainchild of leftwing satirists: Victor Navasky, editor of a magazine calledMonocle, his colleagues, and a fellow satirist, Leonard Lewin, who wrote it with the help of luminaries like the famous economist and former US ambassador to India, JK Galbraith. Their goal was to expose what they saw as the insanity driving the intervention in Vietnam, and the whole of the cold war. By presenting their fake report as a real leak, they aimed to make people ask if this insane document might be real – and what that said about the people running the US government.And it worked. To young Americans living under the shadow of conscription,Reportseemed all too plausible. Officials whispered to journalists that some of their ­colleagues really did think like this. Once the hoax had its satirical impact, Lewin came clean. But his work was so convincing it began to take on a life of its own.5:26Why we are all attracted to conspiracy theories – videoIn the late 1980s,Report from Iron Mountainwas discovered by the extreme right, which was convinced it was real. Itwas republished by a company called the Noontide Press, part of a network of fringe organisations that were among America’s primary promoters of Holocaust denial. These ­people were convinced they had found the smoking gun, confirming their darkest suspicions about the government’s secret plots to start wars and control the ­public. A ­horrified Lewin embarked on a long legal battle to take back control of his work and its true, meaning.But meanwhile, the militia movement spreading across the US seized onReportfrom Iron Mountain, as fuel for its paranoid visions of imminent oppression at the hands of the ­one-world government and its black helicopters. And Lewin’s creation found its way to Hollywood. InJFK,Oliver Stone’s 1991 movieabout the Kennedy assassination, the great revelation about why the president was assassinated hinges on a characterrepeating the hoax’s claimsin the belief that they were disturbing truths.View image in fullscreenThe Branch Davidian religious-sect compound in Waco, Texas, after a raid by the US government on 19 April 1993.Photograph: Susan Weems/APReporteven spawned a secondary hoax:Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars. This ­purported to be the operations ­manual that helped the elite control its ­sheeple-civilians. This strange text was first popularised by the pioneering conspiracist Milton William Cooper, who ­published it inBehold a Pale Horse,his influential compendium of ­conspiracy theories. Cooper also included extracts fromReport from Iron Mountainitself (and, horrifyingly, another hoax: that notorious antisemitic forgeryThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion).Silent Weaponshas often been cited by arch ­conspiracist Alex Jones and has been invoked by “Q”, the ostensible government insider revered by theQAnon movement.Lewin and his colleagues had contrived theirhoax so expertly that they inadvertently created “evidence” for a host of conspiracy theories. It could be used to explain everything from why wars end to the real reasons behind lockdown, from environmental regulations and terrorist attacks to the fiery end of a cult in Waco, Texas.AI can change belief in conspiracy theories, study findsRead moreThe reasoning at work here is revealing. If something inReportchimes with what is really happening in the world, the conspiracist’s logic runs, that cannot be a coincidence. Rather, it exposes the secret motives that caused that reality. The ­principle here – a ­consistent fallacy of ­conspiracy theory – is that “nothing is accidental”. One online ­analysis ofReportfrom Iron Mountainin 2014 even decided the fact Lewin later wrote a novel was an attempt to ­retrospectively create a cover ­identity so he could pretendReportwas fiction too.And yet the fate of this all-too-successful hoax also suggests what we might need to do to ­counter this kind of thinking. In a political ­climate roiled by conspiracy ­theories and disinformation, the tale ofReportfrom Iron Mountainis a warning about the ­consequences of taking your eye off the line between compelling stories and what we know to be true.Phil Tinline is the author ofGhosts of Iron Mountain: The Hoax That Duped America and Its Sinister Legacy, which will be published byHead of Zeus on 27 March.Explore more on these topicsQAnonThe ObserverSocial mediaUS politicsFar right (US)The far rightThe KennedysJohn F KennedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The value of shares in Eutelsat, the French owner of London-based Starlink rival OneWeb, have shot up by 500% sinceTrump’s Oval Office row with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Eutelsat’s chief executive told Bloomberg the company could replace Starlink in a couple of months in places like Ukraine.Viasat, which owns UK network Inmarsat, is also in talks with European governmentsabout replacing Musk’s Starlink.In the UK, Starlink is used mainly by people and businesses in rural areas who have poor broadband access, although there is also a minority of “preppers” and people who buy the tech as fans of Musk.An installer of Starlink for businesses and homes in southern England said that, for now, there was no better alternative to Starlink for those who needed fast access to the internet.He said: “In the industry we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it’s a necessary tool and a solution that exists in a lot of rural areas, especially with the poor investment in infrastructure. But on the other hand, we have now got to deal with Elon – to put it politely – being a twat.“The majority of people who use it are those in need of it due to being a remote area, but there is also a small minority ‘tinfoil hat’ brigade element.”Richard Opie, a consultant living in a semi-rural part of Northumberland, said he had got Starlink during the pandemic because there was not enough capacity on BT, but was now considering whether to stay with the company.He said: “It’s a godsend, especially in remote areas, but things have developed politically since then. Elon Musk is a very different figure and Tesla showrooms are being burned to the ground. I’m uncomfortable with him getting into bed with Trump and the way he has thrown his weight around.“It’s something we have wrestled with and looked for alternatives but we’re sort of stuck for the moment.”Nisbet’s comments on a Facebook “Starlink UK Users’ Group” – that he could no longer justify supporting Starlink – sparked a spirited debate among users.Mel Sayer, another Starlink user, wrote: “I refuse to go to Trump’s hotels as I won’t give a penny to Trump. I now don’t want to fund ‘President Musk’ on his endeavours after that salute.”Mike Brown wrote: “I share your thoughts but am stuck with Starlink for now. Amazon are due to launch a rival service but probably not until next year. I’ll be jumping ship as quickly as possible.”Others are sticking with Starlink. Paul Feakins, a consultant in West Sussex, said: “People use Starlink because they can’t get an internet connection any other way, yet these idiots think they’re making a statement by cancelling it because they happen to disagree with Elon on something.”Starlink has been approached for comment.Starlink has grown rapidly in the UK, from 13,000 subscribers three years ago to 87,000 last year.Such has been the popularity of Starlink in some areas of the UK that the company has been levying an extra “congestion charge” for those areas where there is high demand.The company provides ultrafast broadband speeds via a constellation of satellites. British customers typically pay from £75 a month for a 30-day term, plus £299 for hardware.For non-customers, Starlink may be better known for its use in Ukraine, which has been vital for Kyiv’s battlefield communications, after Starlink terminals were rushed there after Russia’s invasion in February 2022.Lately, however, the prospect of Ukraine being cut out of Starlink has grown,with Reuters reportingthat US negotiators have threatened Ukraine with losing the system.

Cuts to international aid. Has Labour lurched too far to the right?People on benefits are worried and some MPs are talking of ‘cruelty’. Is Keir Starmer’s plan to cut public spending a betrayal of his party’s values?James Tapper,Toby HelmandDenis CampbellSun 16 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTShareAll the talk is about benefit cuts at Yum, a community pantry in Armley, one ofthe poorest parts of Leeds. It’s in the heart of Rachel Reeves’s constituency andthe chancellor said three years agothat food banks such as Yum and clothing exchanges such as Bundles, both run by the Armley Action Team, were proof that rising poverty during the cost of living crisis meant that benefits should rise.Now, however, Reeves is planning to cut them, including money for disabled people.People coming to Yum to get a free “milk, bread and spread” package and other essentials are understandably worried. Two friends, Wendy Halliday and Jacqueline Parker, have dropped in – both healthcare assistants who worked at the same nursing home and were forced to give up work after 30 years through ill health.Parker, 65, has fibromyalgia, “like having cramp all over your body 24 hours a day”, while Halliday is 63 and has a bad back from years of lifting elderly patients without the help of a hoist. She used to walk miles on the moors; now she needs a taxi to get to the food bank.Both get personal independence payments (Pip), a disability benefit in the sights of ministers who want to slash the welfare bill by £5bn.“Pip to me has been a godsend,” Halliday says. “It gets me out. If you’re stuck in the house, depression kicks in. It affects your mental health.” Before Pip, she was living on £300 a month, with £200 going on fuel bills, leaving a mere £100 a month to cover her council tax, water bill, and shopping. Now she gets an extra £72 a week.It’s not clear if Halliday will lose that – the government will publish more details in a green paper pencilled in for Tuesday. Reeves said last week that welfare needed to be reformed to “get people into work so that more people can fulfil their potential”. But neither Halliday nor Parker say they are in a position to find a job.View image in fullscreenSome of the provisions at the Yum community pantry in Armley.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer“We didn’t want to stop work. We’ve been forced into it,” Halliday says. She can’t stand or sit for too long because of her back and she is only three years from state pension age. Parker is a year away from retirement and feels vulnerable because she takes warfarin, a blood thinner, which means a simple cut could turn into an emergency.“I just want to be normal and go out,” Parker says. “I won’t go on my own because I’m frightened of having a fall and being left on floor.”Some 200 miles away, at Westminster, the everyday concerns of people like Wendy and Jacqueline are very much on the minds of Labour MPs this weekend – so much so that they are threatening to trigger a full-blown party crisis forKeir Starmerand Reeves as they look to curtail the soaring benefits bill.The government’s aim, ministers say, is not just to save money. They are also, they insist, driven by a “moral” case – to encourage as many people as possible off state assistance and into work.But many Labour MPscannot believe what is being announced as policyin the name of their party. Some talk of “cruelty”, others of ministers “betraying Labour principles and the most vulnerable.” Many fear that in its desperation to raise money – and being somewhat bedazzled by the pace of disruptive change in the US, which makes Starmer’s efforts look dull by comparison – the party is moving alarmingly far to the right to find answers.Last Wednesday, as he was approaching the Houses of Parliament for a meeting, a seniorLabourfigure who has worked at high levels inside the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, described what Keir Starmer’s administration was doing as “awful” and lacking in any Labour “values”.He went on to describe Starmer as “a passenger in his own government”, meaning that he seemed to have been captured by rightwingers in Downing Street who were now running the domestic agenda.While this senior figure – and others high up in the party – admit the benefits system badly needs reform, his view was that these plans seemed to have been foisted on the country, and the most needy, in a great rush. Vulnerable people, he feared, were being targeted because Reeves had “boxed herself in with her fiscal rules and promises not to raise taxes”.At cabinet last Tuesday, several ministers raised their concerns, Ed Miliband and Angela Rayner among them.View image in fullscreenFriends Jacqueline Parker and Wendy Halliday both find personal independence payments (Pip) a godsend.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverSince Keir Starmer visited Donald Trump in the White House just over a fortnight ago,his poll ratings have been rising steadily.On that front, he is doing well politically. The PM’s handling of the Ukraine crisis has been applauded across the House of Commons. But the paradox is that within the Labour party itself, and certainly among its MPs and peers in the Lords, there is more unrest, more anxiety, about the direction of travel at home than at any time since the general election last July.A few weeks ago it was difficult to find Labour parliamentarians, other than on the hard left, who were willing to seriously differ with Starmer, even in private. Now it is difficult to avoid them.The prime minister’s decision to increase defence spending as Trump threatened to leave Europe to defend itself against Russia met with little dissent. But what has caused disquiet on a grand scale has been the succession of measures announced or floated since then to pay for it, and, more broadly, put the public finances back in order before Reeves’s spring statement later this month. One senior MP told theObserver: “Over recent weeks, I have begun to wonder: what is left? What is left of what we campaigned on less than nine months ago?”The list of measures dropped, compromised or abandoned grows all the time. Only weeks ago, Labour MPs were stunned by a decision to water down the party’s central green mission byapproving a third runway at Heathrow –a plan suddenly taken off the shelf and re-sold by Reeves as essential to promoting economic growth.View image in fullscreenLabour MP Rachael Maskell says many of her constituents are ‘very, very worried’.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverThen, in tandem with the move to raise defence spending, came an announcement that theoverseas aid budget would be slashed to 0.3% of GDPto pay for the extra cost of defence – a move which triggered theresignation of Starmer loyalist Anneliese Doddsand protests from dozens of Labour colleagues.As talk of huge pending welfare cuts caused acute unease on the Labour backbenches, Starmer and his health secretary, Wes Streeting, then came forward with plans to axe 10,000 jobs in the NHS with theclosure of NHS England. Among those who will be at the heart of Streeting’s changes to the new-look NHS will be a former health ­secretary under Blair, Alan Milburn – installed on the Department of Health and Social Care board despite concerns about conflicts of interest, given his links to the private health sector – and Paul Corrigan, a former health adviser to Blair and Milburn.Speaking at a meeting of Labour MPs last Monday night about his plans to cut the benefits bill, Starmer said: “We’ve found ourselves in a worst-of-all-worlds situation – with the wrong incentives discouraging people from working, the taxpayer funding a spiralling bill.“A wasted generation, one in eight young people not in education, employment or training, and the people who really need that safety net still not always getting the dignity they deserve.“That’s unsustainable, it’s indefensible, and it is unfair: people feel that in their bones.”Plenty of new-intake Labour MPs declare themselves happy with what Starmer is proposing. They are the handpicked ones, the new Starmer generation. But strains with the old-guard soft left are emerging.On hisPolitical Currencypodcast with George Osborne, the former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who is married to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, took issue with the current Labour government.“It’s one thing to say the economy is not doing well and we’ve got a fiscal challenge, but the context we’re now in is that we are having to increase defence spending and, two weeks ago, it was announced we’re going to cut international aid. But cutting the benefits of the most vulnerable in our society, who can’t work, to pay for that is not going to work. And it’s not a Labour thing to do … It’s not what they’re for.”Nor, in the view of Robert Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, will it work politically, with local elections just weeks away. “On welfare, Labour have an understandable desire to be seen as credible and taking tough decisions, but they are perhaps underestimating the risks of being perceived as cruel or heartless.“For example, thewinter fuel allowance cutended up dominating discussion of Labour in a way that wasn’t helpful – it did not make Labour look more credible, but did make them look heartless, even though the sums involved were small, and more than offset by triple-lock pension rises.View image in fullscreenHousing in Armley.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer“To end up being seen by many voters as indifferent to the fate of impoverished pensioners when your actual ­policy choices leave impoverished pensioners all better off is a serious communications failure. And this was not an accident but a product of the choices Labour chose to focus on.”Ford added that Labour’s approach to welfare came with electoral risks. “Labour are understandably concerned about the rise of Reform in the polls, but in a fragmented political context this is not the only credible electoral competition they face, while for many MPs the most credible local threat comes on the left flank. Scottish Labour MPs face competition from the SNP, while in many city centre seats the Greens are Labour’s strongest opponent.”Any move to freeze or change the Pip payment regime for disabled people would require legislation, which has increased the concerns inside Downing Street. Even Starmer and Reeves are now, in the words of one Labour peer, “very worried” – “I know because I have spoken to both of them.”Labour whips are already trying to limit a rebellion that they fear could get out of control. On Saturday, there were rumours that ministers were so concerned about the backlash that they might pull key elements of the benefits plans.Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, said: “Labour really does need to set out what the narrative is. I never thought that the Labour party was supposed to be about making life more difficult for the most vulnerable in society. Many of my constituents are very, very worried.”Another reason – apart from sheer accusations of cruelty – why campaigners and Labour MPs object to cutting disability benefits and Pip is that research shows cutting benefits does not encourage people into work – it just makes them poorer.A report last week by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that the UK now has some of the least generous welfare spending of any developed ­country, standing in the bottom third of the 38 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for welfare payments as a percentage of average wages.Anna Stevenson, a benefits expert at Turn2us, a disability charity, said: “Pip allows people to work. It helps them get to their jobs. People are using Pip to fill gaps in social care, gaps in health services. They’re using it to cover the additional costs of living with disability. When you push households further and further into crisis, that creates more demand for urgent frontline services because there isn’t other help available to them.”Back at Yum in Leeds, Wendy Halliday agrees. “It’s ridiculously hard to apply for benefits. I’d like [Reeves] to make it easier for people.”Her good friend Jacqueline Parker says Reeves helped her get housed when she was made homeless several years ago. “She’s been good for me in the past. I hope she doesn’t mess up.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsThe ObserverKeir StarmerLabourNHSHealthDisabilityWelfarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hours later, a federal judgehalted deportationsunder the US president’s order.The act is a sweeping wartime authority that allows noncitizens to be deported without being given the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.How an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon MuskRead moreTrump’s proclamation on Saturday identified Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force. US district judge James Boasberg blocked anyone from being deported under the proclamation for two weeks and scheduled a Friday hearing to consider arguments.What are the origins of the act?In 1798, with the US preparing for what it believed would be a war with France, Congress passed a series of laws that increased the federal government’s reach. Amid worries that immigrants could sympathise with the French, the Alien Enemies Act was created to give the president wide powers to imprison and deport noncitizens in time of war.Since then, the act has been used just three times: during the war of 1812, the first world war and the second world war.During the second world war, with anti-foreigner fears sweeping the country, it was part of the legal rationale for mass internment of people of German, Italian and Japanese ancestry. An estimated 120,000 people with Japanese heritage, including those with US citizenship, were incarcerated during the war.Why is Trump using it now?For years, Trump and his allies have argued that America is facing an “invasion” of people arriving illegally. In his inaugural address, Trump said the act would be a key tool in his immigration crackdown.“By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil,” he said. “As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.”In his declaration on Saturday, Trump said Tren de Aragua “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States”. He said the gang was engaged in “irregular warfare” against the US at the direction of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.Last month, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and seven other Latin American crime organizations as “foreign terrorist organizations”.What do critics of the move say?Critics say Trump is wrongly using the act to target non-state actors, rather than foreign governments. Civil liberties organizations have accused Trump of invoking the 1798 act unlawfully during peacetime to accelerate mass deportations and sidestep immigration law.“Invoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse,” the Brennan Center for Justice wrote, calling it “at odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice”.“Summary detentions and deportations under the law conflict with contemporary understandings of equal protection and due process,” the Brennan Center said.Congress’s research arm said in a report last month officials may use the foreign terrorist designations to argue the gang’s activities in the US amount to a limited invasion. “This theory appears to be unprecedented and has not been subject to judicial review,” the Congressional Research Service said.The Venezuelan government has not typically taken its people back from the US, except on a few occasions. Over the past few weeks, about 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the Guantanamo Bay naval base.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpexplainersShareReuse this content"

Her original focus was on girls who skated in Morocco, in defiance of cultural norms. She continued that project in rural India, where a handful of women have used skateboarding to stake out public spaces for themselves.One pioneer of this is Asha Gond, who grew up in a farming family in the village of Janwaar in Madhya Pradesh. In 2014 a charitable organisation, the Rural Changemakers, helped tofund a skateparkin the village, built with the help of the community as a way of driving social and cultural development. Gond, one inspiration for the Netflix seriesSkater Girl, learned her skills at the park and became India’s only female competitor at the world skateboarding championship. The park had two rules: “No school, no skateboarding”, and “Girls first” – both rare sentiments in an area where girls often faced arranged marriages by the time they were of secondary school age.This picture of Gond’s hands, with their traditional henna tattoos, clutching a skateboard, captures some of that story. Pinzi’s project, for which she travelled more than 3,000 miles in India to find skating communities in cities and villages, is a finalist in the sport category in this year’s Sony World Photography awards. Gond refused to follow the life that was mapped out for her by her family, and skating was a big part of her escape. She hasrecalledhow her father would tell her to stop skateboarding, when villagers gossiped about her or made threats. “I was thinking: ‘Why can’t I do what I want?’ Boys do anything they want. Every day I was crying, but after crying I would feel stronger and new thoughts would come.”The 2025 Sony World Photography Awards exhibition is at Somerset House, London from 17 April to 5 MayExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big pictureIndiaSkateboardingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The number of women in the 360-member House of Representatives has also declined, from 22 in 2015 to 17.In a phone interview from New York on Monday last week, hours before speaking on the matter at a joint session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and UN Women, Akpoti-Uduaghan railed against her suspension. “This was orchestrated to silence my voice,” she said. “That action is an assault on democracy … I am not apologising for speaking my truth.”Women’s rights groups have condemned her suspension, and hundreds of women and girls marched in the states of Lagos, Enugu, Edo and Kaduna on Wednesday during a “We are all Natasha” protest convened by the civil society coalition Womanifesto.View image in fullscreenWomen take part in International Women’s Day celebrations in Lagos, in a country that remains socially conservative.Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP“Her suspension and the process that led to it was a shambolic show of shame,” said Ireti Bakare-Yusuf, a radio broadcaster and founder of the non-profit Purple Women Foundation, which is part of Womanifesto.Ahmed Tijani Ibn Mustapha, a spokesperson for Akpabio, said Akpoti-Uduaghan’s petition alleging sexual harassment had not followed guidelines because she had authored and signed it herself rather than asking another senator to do so.He also said that after she had refiled the petition correctly, the senate began a four-week investigation into the claims.Akpoti-Uduaghan, an opposition People’s Democratic party (PDP) senator from the central state of Kogi, first tried to enter politics in 2019 with a run for Kogi governor. Thugs reportedly loyal to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) jeered her during the campaign,calling her a sex worker, and on one occasion attacking her and her driver. “This is definitely not an election,” she told reportersat the time. “This is almost like a war zone.”Four years later, on the eve of the senate election she was contesting, portions of the main roads leading to her district were excavated overnight. She accused the APC of attempting to prevent her from campaigning. Authorities said they wereprotecting residentsagainst terrorist attacks, citing a December 2022 bomb blast by an Islamic State affiliate.She lost the election, but in November 2023 a tribunal overturned the results, paving the way for her to become one of Nigeria’s youngest senators.Akpabio, a political veteran, was the subject of another sexual harassment allegation from a former public official in 2020. He denied the allegation at the time and recently said he would sue his accuser. He had previously made headlines in 2018 when he predicted an election victory for his APC party bydrawing comparisonswith Hitler’s invasion of Poland. Last year, shortly after becoming senate president, he was involved in another controversy when a senator was suspended for saying there were inconsistencies in the budget.After Akpoti-Uduaghan’s suspension, other senators coalesced around Akpabio, a powerful ally of the country’s president, Bola Tinubu.One male senator said Akpoti-Uduaghan had fabricated the claims because she was angered by her removal as chair of a coveted senate committee in February. Current female senators dismissed her claims on national TV, while one former senator said Akpoti-Uduaghan’s claims were “a sign of weakness” and that sexual harassment happened only in schools.“Male senators do not surprise me,” said Bakare-Yusuf of the reaction. “They mansplain even the basic of black and white to justify their selfishness. As for the female senators, disappointed is an understatement [but] like all hegemonic structures, patriarchy also has gatekeepers.”In the aftermath of her accusation, a false claim that Akpoti-Uduaghan had borne six children by six different men surfaced on social media. The senate spokesperson said a kiss she shared with her husband on the senate premises before submitting her petition was “unspeakable” andan act of “content creation”. Over the last two weeks, crowds of pro-Akpabio protesters have turned up in public to abuse her in Abuja.“Politicians sided with the senate president whom they believe has the power to grant them favours … and the poor were paid by those who have the most money to protest,” said Glory Ehiremen, senior analyst at Lagos-based geopolitical risk advisory, SBM Intelligence.Some opposition senators have visited Akpoti-Uduaghan to show support. She also said she had received supportive emails from women across Nigeria, including some who were afraid to speak up about their own experiences. “In Nigeria, most women who are sexually harassed in workplaces don’t even tell their husbands because they are afraid of being judged,” she said.As the episode unfolds, more women are praising her bravery, but few think Nigeria’s #MeToo moment has arrived.Ehiremen said an entrenched culture of impunity was a barrier to justice. “The elite Nigerian cannot get justice unless they have alliances with the ‘powerful’,” she said. “Never mind the ordinary Nigerian.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaWomen's rights and gender equalityAfricaGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Boasberg also ordered deportation flights already in the air to return to the US.“Oopsie … Too late,” Bukeleposted online, followed by a laughing emoji.Soon after Bukele’s statement, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,thankedEl Salvador’s leader.“Thank you for your assistance and friendship, President Bukele,” he wrote on the social media site X, following up on an earlier post in which he said the US had sent “2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to face justice in El Salvador”.Rubio added that “over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars”.On Friday, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to order the deportations of suspected members of the Venezuelan gang he has accused of “unlawfully infiltrating” the US. The US formally designated Tren de Aragua a “foreign terrorist organization” last month.View image in fullscreenEl Salvador police shave the heads of alleged gang members recently deported from the US to El Salvador, on Sunday.Photograph: Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia/ReutersHe claimed the gang members were “conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions” against the US.The Alien Enemies Act has only ever been used three times before, most recently during the second world war, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians.It was originally passed by Congress in preparation for what the US believed would be an impending war with France. It was also used during the war of 1812 and during the first world war.The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, slammed Judge Boasberg’s stay on deportations. “This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump’s power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk,” Bondi said in a statement on Saturday night.But lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union contend that the Trump does not have the authority to use the law against a criminal gang, rather than a recognized state.On Sunday, the Republican senator Mike Rounds questioned whether the deportation flights had ignored Judge Boasberg’s order to turn around. “We’ll find out whether or not that actually occurred or not,” Rounds told CNN. “I don’t know about the timing on it. I do know that we will follow the law.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tough on crime,” Argentina’s hardline security minister, Patricia Bullrich,enthusedlast year after posing outside Cecot’s packed cells.A succession of social media influencers and foreign journalists have also been invited to tour the prison todocument its harsh conditionsand help Bukele promote his clampdown, which has helped dramatically reduce El Salvador’s once sky-high murder rate.“The conditions in there are like something you’ve never seen … Depending on which side of the argument you fall on, it’s either the ultimate deterrent or it’s an abuse of human rights,” the Australian TV journalist Liam Bartlett reported after visiting El Salvador’s “hellhole” prison recently.“There’s no sheets [and] no mattresses. [Prisoners] sleep on cold steel frames and they eat the same meal every single day. Utensils are banned so they use their hands [to eat]. There’s just two open toilets in each of these massive cells and the lights stay on 24/7,” Bartlett added. “Imagine how long you would last in these conditions.”Human rights activists have decried how the mass imprisonments have taken place largely without legal process. More than 100 prisoners have died behind bars since Bukele’s clampdown began.Neither the US nor El Salvador offered any immediate evidence that the scores of Venezuelan prisoners sent to Cecot this weekend were in fact gang members or had been convicted of any offense.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationEl SalvadorTrump administrationDonald TrumpMarco RubioUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Shocked, but in good physical condition,” said a Peruvian navy port captain, Jorge González.The fisher had set out on 7 December from the port of San Juan de Marcona but bad weather conditions and the current caused him to lose course.His small boat, which had no radio beacon, ended up on the high seas.“It is a miracle that my father has been found,” his daughter Ines Napa told the RPP radio station. “We, as a family, never gave up hope of finding him.”Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Thai authorities then discovered Clarke was missing.Capt Natthaphon Sinpoonphon, the deputy director of the Thai Maritime Enforcement Command Centre of Surat Thani, said the boat was between five and six nautical miles away from the island when a fire started in the engine room and “spread through the boat rapidly”.He said: “Preliminary reports indicate that the engine room, captain’s cabin and rear restroom were damaged. The exact cause of the fire remains under investigation.”It is understood rescue teams were initially unable to get close to the boat because of the flames, as there were fears of further explosions from fuel onboard the vessel.Sinpoonphon said: “The search is continuing for one missing tourist, a female, Alexandra Clarke, from the United Kingdom.“The conditions at sea are dangerous with the wind and currents.

Last year it wasa woman who rediscovers herself through boxing. But in 2025 the hero that has caught everyone’s attention – and broken international box office records – is an animated demon child.Ne Zha 2, a Chinese animation written and directed by Yang Yu, is a whirlwind of a film. The plot, inspired by Chinese mythology, follows the story of Ne Zha, a demon child raised by humans. He is on a quest to obtain a precious elixir to restore the physical state of his friend, the dragon prince Ao Bing, whose body has been destroyed by a lightning strike.Epic battle scenes and spellbinding graphics – and a dose of symbolism – have enticed Chinese audiences to the cinema in their millions. Since its release over the lunar new year holiday between the end of January and the middle of February,Ne Zha 2has taken 14.7bn yuan (£1.6bn) at the box office, making it the best-performing film in Chinese cinema ­history.Ne Zha 2has also broken records globally: it is the highest-grossing animated film worldwide, surpassing Pixar’sInside Out 2.Ne Zha 2marks a shift from the patriotic epics that have dominated Chinese cinemas for the past few years.The Battle at Lake Changjin, whichNe Zha 2pushed into second place, is a 2021 Communist party-sponsored film that depicts Chinese soldiers battling Americans in the Korean war.Wolf Warrior 2, now third in the Chinese box-office rankings, is a 2017 film about a Chinese soldier who ­protects aid workers in Africa.That doesn’t mean that Chinese audiences are turning away from patriotism, said Yu Yaqin, an independent film critic in Beijing. But it reflects the fact “everybody can find something that resonates” inNe Zha 2.With the economy at a difficult ebb, and young people facing high unemployment rates, dissatisfaction with Chinese society is higher than it was a few years ago. The storyline about battling injustice and powerful authorities may feel particularly apt, Yu said. In one scene, Ne Zha proclaims: “My fate is controlled by myself, not by God.” “That really fits into the current situation where a lot of people might be struggling,” Yu said. “If a country isn’t doing well, people want to put more focus on themselves.”But patriotic viewers may also find their feelings reflected in the film. Some commentators have ­suggested there is anti-American symbolism in the film, such as when Ne Zha ­visits the jade palace belonging to the evil Shen Gongbao. Ne Zha gawps at how white the jade is – nationalists have suggested it represents the White House.There is also a good dose of luck. The film was released over the lunar new year holiday, a time when many families make their only annual trip to the cinema. While the film was originally a word-of-mouth hit, local authorities and businesses soon jumped on the bandwagon to promote China’s latest national hero, snowballing the film’s success into a moment that netizens have described as China’sguoyun,or national destiny.The writer Afra Wang explained in a recent essay for theChinaTalknewsletter: “Having weathered the pandemic’s disruption, many ordinary Chinese seek reassurance about the future through familiar cultural frameworks. ‘National destiny’ provides exactly that – it’s a narrative that contextualises current struggles within a larger, ultimately triumphant story. It’s therapeutic.”Like another of theguoyundarlings – the AI company DeepSeek –Ne Zha 2is everywhere in China. At a press conference about the economy on the sidelines ofChina’s Two Sessions, the annual political meetings that concluded on Tuesday, the commerce minister, Wang Wentao, praised the film’s success in attracting moviegoers to the cinema at a time when China is desperate to boost ­consumer spending.One company in Shandong province spent 40,000 yuan buying tickets for its 1,000 employees to go and see it. A bar in Beijing offers a “Ne Zha reborn” cocktail (gin, raspberry, blueberry, roselle and lemon – 95 yuan). Yu said her local hairdresser was offering discounts to customers who came in with a receipt from seeingNe Zha 2. “When things go viral … every city government will try to claim their involvement or say that they were part of the success story,” Yu said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plot relies to a large degree on familiarity with Chinese mythology and with the originalNe Zhafilm, which was released in 2019.The one market where it might have a better-than-average chance because of its shared Chinese cultural history is Taiwan, but the country limits the number of films from China that can be released each year.Ne Zha 2is not on the list for 2025.The film, with previews starting this weekend, is set for full release in the UK on 21 March. But even if British audiences swerve, many in China feel that their point has been made: China is reaching its national destiny, without needing the west.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverAnimation in filmChinaAsia PacificChinese economyFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Gone are the days of the Commodore or Corolla fighting it out as Australia’s most popular vehicle. We’re now well into the era of the Ranger, RAV4, HiLux and Outlander, as well as increasing flirtations with US-style pickup trucks, and it shows no sign of stopping.It happened gradually, despite the mounting evidence about some of the problems posed by these vehicles.Study after study has continued to back up their impact on road safety. Their grander heights and weights meanthey strike smaller cars with more energy in more vulnerable positions. They hit pedestrians –especially children– in more fatal ways andcan affecta driver’s psyche, potentially encouraging speedingand dangerous driving. There are riskier outcomes for occupants too.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailRoad fatalities in Australia have been increasing, in ways not seen since the pre-seatbelt era. Looking beyond the headline data, you can see the spiralling increases in deaths have been pedestrians, cyclists and motorbike riders.In fact, driver and passenger deaths actually went down in 2024.There is no conclusive data on exactly why this is happening.But a growing chorus of experts believe the rise of bigger vehicles on our roads is a factor.View image in fullscreenSUVs, with their higher front ends, are more of a danger to pedestrians.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianThere are other underexamined social shifts occurring thanks to our growing love affair with these vehicles. There are the hidden expenses, from adding tocost-of-living pressure with a higher fuel spend; going against the emissions reductions efforts of the country; draining national tax coffers through various incentives that nudge even graphic designers to choose huge utes as their next family vehicles; adding to insurance premiums for all drivers; hogging parking space; worsening traffic and zapping productivity.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThese societal costs are significant and growing, but aren’t reflected in the sticker prices of these larger vehicles, especially after the tax perks.Thepsychology of what might drive people to these vehiclesaside – whether it be a testosterone-driven appeal to the great Australian outback; a greater sense, albeit a false one according to experts, of security; or their more luxurious interiors – they are clearly popular.Australians are obsessed with SUVs and huge utes, but experts say they are making our roads deadlierRead moreWhile those features of an SUV can understandably carry more appeal, the rise of dual-cab utes as family vehicles – especially through lax policing of personal use of tax-subsidised work vehicles – is noteworthy.As manufacturers such as Mitsubishi prepare for families to account for more sales of its flagship ute than tradies, the designs of the workhorses are changing.While their proponents have claimed that utes have long been on Australian roads, these vehicles have undergone a huge growth spurt, making them inherently more deadly in collisions.Incremental size increases with each year’s updated models mean the long-term bloat has crept up on us, to the point that the most popular Toyota HiLux in 2025 is about 20cm taller and wider, 60cm longer and almost twice as heavy as its 2000 variant of choice.Interiors are being maximised with modern comfort features at the expense of a shrinking rear tray, with anecdotal evidence that tradies increasingly have to tow extra supplies to perform routine jobs.View image in fullscreenSUVs line up to collect children from a school in Sydney. Expert Marion Terrill believes a higher-level driver’s licence should be required to drive them.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianWhile large car popularity and worsening road safety appear set to continue, experts have flagged a handful of approaches that could incentivise wiser vehicle choice.As Prof Stuart Newstead, the director of Monash University’s Accident Research Centre, pointed out, Australia’s Ancap safety ratings system considers risks for pedestrians, but only as a factor in a vehicle’s overall score, meaning danger can be obscured by strong occupant safety features.Adopting minimum scores for pedestrian safety, as markets in Europe and Japan do, would prevent the most dangerous of the larger cars from even being sold here.Smooth, reliable and fanging: Australia’s enduring love affair with the Toyota CorollaRead moreIndependent transport expert Marion Terrill believes state authorities could require a higher-level driver’s licence, with more rigorous testing for the specific dangers they pose, to operate.Such licences should carry a greater registration fees, “because the social cost of these vehicles is ultimately higher”, Terrill believes, noting the more expensive and laborious process could nudge drivers to smaller vehicles.These ideas all rely on more modestly sized cars being available for sale. Manufacturers have flooded Australia’s market with SUVs and utes, knowing they can make far more money on them. Ford, once known for its Fiesta and Focus, no longer even make sedans or hatchbacks.One lever could be similar to Australia’s new vehicle efficiency standard, which incentivises companies to send cleaner vehicles here and penalises those that don’t. Given current consumer preferences, the standard is likely to see an influx of electric and hybrid SUVs and utes, as opposed to hatchbacks and sedans. A similar mechanism, taking into account safety considerations and vehicle size, could be explored.4:32The Crunch: what Australia's love for SUVs means for emissions and safety – videoParking can also play a role. Standards Australia is edging towardsmandating larger parking car spaces, while the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, hasproposed forcing developers to build bigger garages.Instead of making life easier for larger cars, Terrill believes more small car-only spots, into which SUVs can’t fit, will make car buyers think twice. She also backs Paris’s approach, which charges SUVs triple rates for city parking.Despite the various ideas, one problem is the life cycle of a car. Even with targeted solutions, anything will take a decade or so to start taking effect.But to tackle a problem, it needs to be acknowledged as one first, and for now these massive vehicles and their costs to society seem to be the elephant in the room.Elias Visontay is Guardian Australia’s transport and urban affairs reporterExplore more on these topicsTransportAutomotive industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

These homes were since occupied by a group of a few dozen squatters.Squatters in flood buyback homes to be evicted and properties demolished, NSW premier saysRead moreThe occupation of these houses has been the source of community tension. On Tuesday, Minns told 2GB radio that he wouldorder the homes to be demolished.Minns alleged that “overseas visitors, tourists, backpackers” were taking advantage of the condemned properties being left empty and said the occupiers were “obviously trespassing and putting people’s lives in danger”.“We bought those houses so that we could keep communities safe … and to have squatters move in off the back of that is completely unacceptable,” the premier told reporters. “The housing problems are not going to be solved by moving people into flood-prone land.“We have to draw a line in the sand here, and that means demolishing those houses and ensuring that we can get on with life in the northern rivers.”Sue Higginson, a NSW Greens MLC, said the comments increased the tension in the community and created a sense of impunity for those who object to the occupation of the properties.“There was underlying division, and this fuelled it,” she said.“The premier needs to take responsibility now,” said Higginson, who was a witness to the alleged incidents which she has described as “terrifying”.“Minns has clearly instilled a level of impunity we have not seen before,” she said.“Chris Minns needs to take responsibility for this. He came to our community and used his platform to fuel division, and now look what’s happened.”“Look, people are terrified. I mean, they are on hyper alert.”Minns’ office declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

To be honest with you, I suspect they don’t even know themselves,” Farrell told Sky News on Sunday.The Australian government said it would continue arguing its case to wind back US tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminium exports as part of Trump’s worldwide trade barriers on all nations, and to avoid possible future tariffs on sectors, such as agriculture and medicine. Australian farmers areanxiously waiting to hear whether meat exports will be hitin the next round.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the US tariffs on Australia were not the act of a friendly nation. He said on Sunday, “We have great friends in the United States, and we expect them to act accordingly.”“Tariffs are a tax on the American buyers of products from right around the world, regardless of where it’s coming from, on steel and aluminium. There are these tariffs, which are a tax on Americans,” Albanese said at a press conference.“They’re not a tax on the producer, they’re a tax on Americans, which is why we have seen the markets respond in the way that they have, in a very negative way, to these moves by theTrump administration.”Australian meat could be next on the menu for Trump’s ‘bonkers’ tariffsRead moreFarrell told Sky he would seek to convince his US counterparts of the folly of not only these particular tariffs but also Trump’s broader trade agenda, including during a call with the US trade envoy on Tuesday.He said Australia would not consider retaliatory tariffs on America.“Part of my job is to continue to put the arguments to the Americans that in fact this is the wrong policy to adopt. We should actually be doing the opposite. We should be making more free trade, more fair trade, rather than less trade. And of course, one of the things that we’ve done in government is diversify our trading relationship,” Farrell said.The United States is Australia’s number one international market for beef, lamb and goat meat. Australian producers sold $6.2bn in beef and meat to the US in 2024, nearly 30% of the $39bn total in that year.1:41‘I hate to predict things’: Trump downplays US recession fears amid trade tariffs – videoAsked about potential tariffs on agricultural products like beef, Farrell said such a change “would have a significant impact” on both Australian producers and American consumers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It doesn’t make sense.”The Coalition opposition has consistently criticised Albanese for his slate of international travel earlier in his prime ministership, but the deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was critical that Albanese hadn’t travelled to the United States to lobby Trump personally for Australian exemptions.“This is a Team Australia moment. But where was the captain of the team? He wasn’t there. He didn’t actually go to the US,” Ley told Sky.“All of our Aukus and Quad leaders personally made the trip to DC to furiously advocate for their country’s interests. We didn’t even have the captain on the field.“Foundationally, every country’s relationship with the US is based on the relationship between its leader and president Trump – that is clear and consistent between the first Trump administration and the second. Everyone knows that. The president was elected four months ago. Inauguration was two months ago. None of this was a surprise. We were caught completely flat footed.”Farrell rubbished the Coalition’s claims that it would have gotten a better result. He noted Trump’s public comments that Australia would be considered for an exemption, as well as the crippling trade tariffs on Australian goods levelled by China under the former Coalition government, which have now been removed.Farrell claimed the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, “couldn’t go two rounds with a revolving door”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsEconomic policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In a medical bulletin on Saturday, the Vatican said his condition continued to be stable, although he still required therapy to be administered from the hospital.Earlier on Sunday in an Angelus message to the faithful published by the Vatican, the pope addressed his health, sharing that he was “fragile” and “facing a period of trial”.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismReligionThe papacyChristianityItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Over 155 were injured, many critically.The premises had previously served as a carpet warehouse in Kočani, a town about 60 miles (97km) east of the capital, Skopje. Press reports described it as an “improvised nightclub”.Map showing location of Kočani in North MacedoniaThe prime minister, Hristijan Mickoski, said the loss of so many young lives was “irreparable”. “All competent forces will do whatever is necessary to address the consequences and determine the causes of this tragedy,” he promised earlier on Sunday.The fire, thought to have been triggered by the use of special-effects pyrotechnic devices, erupted at about 2.35am local time (1.35am GMT). Some of those taken to medical facilities were as young as 14. Pictures showed the club’s corrugated iron roof burnt through and collapsed in places, its interior wooden beams exposed and blackened.Marija Taseva, 22, told Reuters: “When the fire broke out, everyone started screaming and shouting: ‘Get out, get out.’” As she tried to escape, Taseva fell to the ground and people trod on her, injuring her face. In the crush, she lost contact with her sister, who did not make it out. “My sister died,” Taseva said, breaking into tears.“It’s hard to believe how this happened,” the country’s president, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, told distraught parents gathered outside a hospital in the capital. “We must give these young people courage to continue.” Dressed in black and fighting tears, she said authorities were ready to do everything to help all those affected.View image in fullscreenPolice officers at the site of the blaze in Kočani.Photograph: Visar Kryeziu/APMedical officials said many people had suffered severe burns and carbon monoxide poisoning and that plans were under way to transport the critically wounded to specialised hospitals acrossEurope. Dr Kristina Serafimova, the head of Kočani general hospital, told reporters that at least 10 were on respirators and fighting for their lives. It was the biggest loss of life in the country of 1.8 million people since the early 1990s.The rightwing nationalist-led government, which was returned to power last year, moved quickly to detain suspects.Initial reports suggested about 1,500 clubgoers were crammed into the discotheque to watch the popular hip-hop band DNK – a number far exceeding the venue’s capacity. The club had only one exit and a lack of fire extinguishers, according to local media outlets.One young person who was attending the concert told local media: “The fire started around 2.30am. The sparklers that were on stage ignited the styrofoam on the ceiling. I heard an explosion and the roof collapsed. We all rushed to get out – we all ran towards one door that was for both entry and exit.”View image in fullscreenPeople in Kočani light candles on Sunday night in memory of the victims.Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/ReutersVisiting the site early on Sunday, Toshkovski said the blaze was probably caused by pyrotechnic devices “used for lighting effects at the concert”. As they were set off, “the sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke”, he told reporters.The government said it would immediately step up inspections of nightclubs and similar venues to ensure they complied with international safety regulations. “The most important thing is to find out all the facts and evidence necessary for the follow-up measures,” Toshkovski said. “We must remain calm while taking all these steps so that something like this doesn’t happen again.”Images on social media showed chaotic scenes as the fire broke out and the band’s singer urged the audience to vacate the premises as quickly as possible. Serafimova attributed the deaths to the panic-stricken crush that ensued, as well as smoke inhalation and burns. Among the injured were musicians in the eight-member band, DNK’s manager said.Branko Gerovski, a veteran journalist in Skopje, said: “In a country as small as ours, and with the death toll likely to rise, the impact has been huge. We haven’t seen anything like this since the devastating air crashes in Macedonia in 1993. Everyone feels very emotional. They can relate to this because everyone’s kids go to nightclubs.”Neighbouring countries including Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria and Albania were quick to offer assistance. Senior European Union officials also expressed their condolences, while the Vatican said Pope Francis sent prayers to the victims and survivors of the fire.Explore more on these topicsNorth MacedoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said Ukraine was sovereign. “If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up toRussiato accept or reject them.”Macron will meet the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, on Monday and then travel to Berlin on Tuesday to meet the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for talks on Ukraine before an EU summit.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, leda virtual meetingof 30 international leaders on Saturday including Macron and Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, as well as leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Afterwards, Starmer challenged the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to sign up to a ceasefire if he was serious about peace. He said allies would keep increasing the pressure on the Kremlin, including by moving planning for a peacekeeping force to an “operational phase”.Macron said after the meeting on Saturday that Europe and the US had to put pressure on Russia to accept a proposed ceasefire. Russia “does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace”, Macron said in a statement to Agence France-Presse. On the contrary, the Russian president was “escalating the fighting” and “wants to get everything, then negotiate”, he said.“Russia must respond clearly and the pressure must be clear, in conjunction with the US, to obtain this ceasefire,” Macron said.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He declined to confirm when asked whether Putin’s demands included the surrender of Ukrainian forces in Kursk; international recognition of Ukrainian territory seized by Russia as Russian; limits on Ukraine’s ability to mobilize; a halt to western military aid; and a ban on foreign peacekeepers.Putin said on Thursday that he supported a truce but outlined numerous details that need to be negotiated before the deal can be completed. The Russian president said he was open to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US but offered vague terms for his support, raising questions about what the Kremlin wants.The big question on Ukraine: is Trump ready to push Putin into peace? | Shaun WalkerRead moreWitkoff declined to describe Russian terms. He said US envoys “had narrowed the differences” between Ukraine and Russian negotiators, and he would meet Trump on Sunday to discuss “how to narrow the differences even further”.The discussions, Witkoff added, included Ukraine, Russia and European stakeholder countries including France, Britain, Norway and Finland, as well as other elements “that would be encompassed in a ceasefire”.Trump, he said, was being updated about the discussions as they happened. “He is involved with every important decision here and I expect that there will be a call between the [US and Russian] presidents this week.”Witkoff also said the US was continuing to engage and have conversations with Ukraine, and “advising them on everything we’re thinking about”.Ukraine agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire at talks last week in Saudi Arabia, and since his disastrous meeting in the White House a fortnight ago, Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has been trying hard to portray Kyiv as amenable to Trump’s plans, while suggesting Putin is merely playing for time and not serious about negotiating a deal.Zelenskyy has agreed to put discussions of territorial questions and of possible security guarantees on hold until after a ceasefire takes effect and more detailed discussions are held. Previously, he had insisted that a ceasefire would only make sense if western partners would provide Ukraine with some kind of security guarantee.Trump has made it clear that no US guarantees are on the table, while the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, has been attempting to rally a coalition of other western allies to put together a possible peacekeeping contingent that could be deployed to Ukraine after a deal. However, it is not clear that such a mission could function without US backing, and Russian officials have repeatedly ruled out accepting any deal involving western boots on the ground in Ukraine.On Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched more than 1,000 drones and 1,300 guided air bombs on Ukrainian territory over the past week. “This is not what someone who wants a quick end to the war does, so we have to jointly pressure Russia to force it to stop its aggression,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. Ukraine also launched a fresh wave of drone attacks against Russian territory over the weekend.Witkoff said teams of US negotiators would meet with both Russian and Ukrainian officials this week. “As the president said, he really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, and I believe that’s the case,” he said.There have been concerns that the settlement being pushed for by theTrump administrationwould look a lot like an outright Russian victory, at the expense of Ukraine and its allies in Europe.Trump and Putin last week set off further alarm bells in Kyiv by exchanging friendly words, as the new US administration cosies up to Moscow while attackingUkrainewith threatening language and the withdrawal of some military support.Separately, Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told ABC’s This Week that back-and-forth diplomacy was ongoing. Waltz said there would be “some type of territory for future security guarantees, the future status of Ukraine”, and he called permanent Nato membership for Ukraine “incredibly unlikely”.Waltz asked if it was plausible to believe that “we are going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?”He said: “We can talk about what’s right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that’s what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

As they were set off, “the sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke”, he said.Social media footage showed the blaze breaking out at about 3am when the venue was packed with concertgoers attending a performance by hip-hop act DNK, one of the tiny Balkan state’s most famous pop groups. Chaotic scenes ensued as people ran through the smoke while the musicians urged everyone to escape as quickly as possible.More than 1,500 were attending the concert in Kočani, 60 miles east of the North Macedonian capital, Skopje..In a written statement, the prime minister, Hristijan Mickoski, called the loss of so many young lives “irreparable”. As the scale of the tragedy became clear, Mickoski told the country that all forces had been “fully mobilised”.“I call on all competent institutions – health services, police, local authorities – to take urgent measures to assist the injured and support the affected families,” he said in a statement posted to Facebook.“In these times of deep sadness, when our hearts are broken with pain due to this terrible tragedy, I call for unity, solidarity, humanity and responsibility.”The prime minister said he would make a public address on Sunday.Police had arrested several people, the interior minister told the hastily convened press conference, although he refused to be drawn on the nature of their involvement in the disaster. “The most important thing is to find out all the facts and evidence necessary for the follow-up measures,” he said. “We must remain calm while taking all these steps so that something like this doesn’t happen again.”View image in fullscreenPeople gathering outside a hospital in Kočani.Photograph: Ognen Teofilovski/ReutersBy mid-morning relatives were gathering at hospitals in Kočani and Skopje, to where victims had been rushed.The state’s health minister, Arben Taravari, said 118 people had been admitted to hospital. At least 27 people with severe burns had been admitted to the capital’s main hospital while another 23 were being treated at Skopje’s clinical centre, according to North Macedonia’s public broadcaster MRT. Children were also reported to be among the injured.“All our capabilities have been put to use in a maximum effort to save as many lives as possible of the young people involved in this tragedy,” Taravari told reporters, at times looking visibly shaken. Neighbouring countries including Greece, Bulgaria and Albania had been quick to offer assistance, he said.View image in fullscreenDebris on the pavement outside the club.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesMarkos Trosanovski, a political commentator in Skopje, said the entire nation had been plunged “into profound shock over this tragedy”.While it was clear that the nightclub was well over capacity at the time of the concert, the government had responded immediately to the disaster, he said. “The response on the part of the authorities has been instant,” he said.“But there were institutional failures,” he said, adding: “It appears there were not enough fire extinguishers which would have been necessary for it to have been granted a licence.”View image in fullscreenAn aerial photograph of the roof of the nightclub.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIn a post on X, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, wrote: “Heartfelt condolences to the people of North Macedonia for the lives lost in the tragic fire in Kočani.

Greece stands ready to assist in this difficult time.”The European commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos, also expressed her condolences on the platform, writing: “Deeply saddened by the tragic fire in Kočani North Macedonia, which claimed the lives of too many young people.”In a further show of support from the EU, António Costa, president of the European Council, announced that the 27-member bloc “stands in solidarity with the people of North Macedonia in this moment of grief”.“Heartbroken by the loss of so many young people in the terrible fire … My thoughts go out to all the families of the victims of this tragedy,” he said in a statement posted on X.Explore more on these topicsNorth MacedoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, however, the situation is the opposite.”It comes after an increasingly acrimonious dispute between the men over responsibility for the failures that allowed the surpriseHamasattack on 7 October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza.Shin Bet is responsible for monitoring Palestinian militant groups. It recently issued a report accepting responsibility for its failures around the attack but also criticised Netanyahu, saying government policies were among its causes.Netanyahu has not accepted any responsibility for the attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted, though he was prime minister at the time and has been in power for a total of 17 years.Far-right allies of Netanyahu welcomed the move. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the former minister of national security, said it was “better late than never”. Cabinet loyalists rushed to welcome the prime minister’s “defence of democracy”.But Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel’s opposition, promised to challenge Bar’s dismissal in the courts, and Ehud Barak, a former prime minister, said Netanyahu had “gone off the rails” and was “rebelling against the rule of law”.The Israeli media has criticised Netanyahu for allowing substantial financial aid from Qatar to reach Hamas, in an apparent attempt to strengthen the Islamic militant group inGazaas a rival to the Palestinian Authority based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.The tensions peaked this weekend when Bar’s predecessor, Nadav Argaman, said he would release sensitive information about Netanyahu if the prime minister was found to have broken the law. Netanyahu accused Argaman of blackmail and filed a police complaint.Shin Bet did not have an immediate response to Netanyahu’s announcement.In a statement, Bar said the Shin Bet chief answered “first and foremost to the citizens of Israel” and that Netanyahu’s “expectation of a personal loyalty contradicts the public interest and is fundamentally flawed”.Bar also appeared to add his voice to calls for a full commission of inquiry.Netanyahu has repeatedlyrejected callsfor an official state commission of inquiry into the 2023 attack and has repeatedly sought to shift the failures on to the army and security agencies.In recent months a number of senior security officials, including a former defence minister and army chief of staff, have been fired or forced to step down. Bar is one of the few remaining senior security officials since the attack to remain in office. If Bar is removed, Netanyahu is expected to appoint a loyalist in his place, slowing any momentum for the commission of inquiry.Netanyahu said on Sunday that removing Bar would help Israel “achieve its war goals and prevent the next disaster”.The prime minister has been angered by a Shin Bet investigation into members of his staff alleged to have earned substantial sums in dealings with Qatar. Lapid said Bar’s dismissal was aimed at sabotaging the inquiry.Shin Bet, and Bar, have been closely involved with the hostage negotiations during the war in Gaza. Netanyahu recently removed Bar from the negotiating team and replaced him with a loyalist cabinet minister.Efforts by Netanyahu and his allies to push through judicial changes, widely criticised as authoritarian, have been cited as one of many causes of the Hamas attack. The move polarised Israel’s politics in the months before and divided the country, weakening its defences, critics say.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The strikes on Saturday were carried out in part by fighter aircraft from the Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, which is in the Red Sea. They could continue for weeks, one Pentagon official said.The Houthis are seen as key actors in the “axis of resistance”, a loose regional coalition of militant groups built up by Iran over recent years to project force and put pressure on Israel.The group is considered the only member of the coalition not to have been significantly weakened by Israel during the war in Gaza since October 2023 and the short conflict in Lebanon last year. Both Hamas and Hezbollah, once the most powerful member, have suffered significant losses.The Houthis’ political bureau described the attacks as a “war crime”. “Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation,” it said in a statement.Residents in Sana’a said the strikes hit a neighbourhood known to host several members of the Houthi leadership.“The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children,” said one resident, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia.A crane and bulldozer were used to remove debris at one site in the city and people used their bare hands to pick through the rubble. At a hospital, medics treated the injured, including children, and the bodies of several casualties were placed in a yard, wrapped in plastic sheets, Reuters footage showed.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Sunday called for “utmost restraint and a cessation of all military activities” in Yemen. A new escalation could “fuel cycles of retaliation that may further destabilise Yemen and the region, and pose grave risks to the already dire humanitarian situation in the country”, his spokesperson said in a statement.The previous administration in Washington, under Joe Biden, had sought to degrade the Houthis’ ability to attack vessels off Yemen’s coast but had limited US actions.On Tuesday, the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the Bab al-Mandab strait and the Gulf of Aden, ending a period of relative calm starting in January with the Gaza ceasefire.A Pentagon spokesperson said the Houthis had attacked US warships 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023.Reuters andAgence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUS foreign policyDonald TrumpIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Barbie previously became the first woman to receive a certificate of appreciation from the Taliban.The pair were arrested on 1 February with an American-Chinese friend, Faye Hall, who had rented a plane to travel with them, and a translator from Rebuild.The reason for their detention remains unclear. Entwistle suspects it was because they were teaching mothers with children.The previous Taliban regime, before it was toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001, had accused the couple of teaching against Islam, but this case was dropped. The family said their parents respected Taliban rule and had adapted to the imposition of strict Islamic laws.A Rebuild employee said last month the detained group was told their flight “did not coordinate with the local government”, adding that the three foreign nationals had been imprisoned in Kabul.Hopes were raised in late February that the couple would be released.In a statementreported by the BBC, the Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: “A series of considerations is being taken into account and, after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible.”He added that the three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards.Qani’s statement drew a cautious welcome from Entwistle, whotold the Times: “It’s the first thing we’ve heard from the Taliban, so it’s really positive, but he’s really not saying very much. We know they were investigating to see if they were teaching anything against Islam, so that was a relief to us as we knew they wouldn’t be.”She added: “Next thing we heard, the investigation was because they’re teaching parenting skills to mothers over the age of 30, with their children. Apparently, that was now against the law, but none of the influential people in that village [Bamiyan] thought it was a problem.”The couple, who originally met at the University of Bath, married in Kabul in 1970 after travelling there as part of an academic placement scheme. They became Afghan citizens after returning to the country 30 years later to set up Rebuild.The couple’s family initially did not want the UK government to get involved with the case.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

But they will still tighten eligibility criteria for the benefit under big changes to be set out by the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, on Tuesday.The Resolution Foundation thinktank warned that cutting Pip by £5bn in 2029-30 by raising the qualifying threshold for support could mean about 620,000 people lose £675 a month on average. It said 70% of these cuts would be concentrated on those families in the poorest half of the income distribution.The sweep of the cuts has greatly alarmed disability rights campaigners as well as Labour MPs, who have been lobbying No 10 this week to change course. But plans tofreeze increases in Pip payments are now unlikely– a measure that would have required a parliamentary vote.Cabinet ministers are among those who have raised doubts about the scale of the cuts and private fears about how No 10 has handled the messaging.There is also widespread concern among MPs about reported plans to cut – or potentially freeze – the top rate of benefits for disabled people who are unable to work, though that may be mitigated by a rise in universal credit for those seeking or in work.Ministers are motivated to equalise the incomes of people seeking work with people unable work, aiming to address what it perceives as an incentive to be permanently signed-off sick, which can result in an income twice as high as those of jobseekers.But MPs who spoke to the Guardian said it appeared “perverse” to target those who were not in work, likely to include the most severely disabled and vulnerable in society within its scope.The bulk of the expected £5bn to £6bn in cuts will come from making it tougher to qualify for Pip – a key disability benefit not linked to work – which is likely to deny payments to many with conditions such as autism.Despite the widespread backlash, scope for further change is now unlikely. The green paper outlining the measures will be released on Tuesday and the Treasury has now submitted its final “major measures” to the Office for Budget Responsibility – including the welfare reforms – to allow the budget watchdog to score the measures in its report before the government’s spring statement at the end of March.The Resolution Foundation said it predicted the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was now on course for a budget deficit of about £4.4bn due to weaker growth, interest rates and lower tax revenues, having previously estimated £9.9bn in headroom in 2029-30.The thinktank’s research director, James Smith, said the jobs market was in “recession territory”, which would hinder the government’s hopes of getting more disabled people into work or taking on more hours.“Crucially, she should avoid turning the spring statement into a ‘sticking plaster’ budget, with long-term thinking on welfare reform undermined by the quest for short-term savings that could cause real harm,” Smith said.Kendall is to set out a plan with a number of mitigations that she hopes will assuage the fears of disabled claimants andLabourMPs. The work and pensions secretary will promise a “right to try” guarantee for those currently on benefits to take on work but return to previous benefits if the job does not work out, without having to go through a gruelling reassessment process.She will also retain £1bn of the planned savings to reinvest in back-to-work schemes, which Kendall has promised will be locally tailored and include an overhaul of jobcentre help and support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another said they had been contacted by constituents in despair at what might be coming. “We all get the case for reform, but we can also see that some of these cuts don’t actually seem to be targeted at the areas most in need of reform.”A number of MPs have stressed to Downing Street this week that they can under no circumstances back the changes in a parliamentary vote, with some Labour constituencies having up to one in five people receiving Pip.Senior Labour figures who have raised alarm at the plans have pointed the finger at the chancellor, claiming she was boxed in by fiscal rules meaning she could not raise taxes to combat the worsening economic climate.Treasury sources denied that Reeves was the one pushing the welfare department to go further and that the main shape of the changes has been sketched out over the past year, since before Labour came to power.Kendall will outline plans for the changes on Tuesday, but it will be Reeves who will lay out the extent of the planned savings and mitigations in the spring statement on 26 March.Speaking on Sunday, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the changes would ensure the welfare state was “a springboard back to work and lots of people get written off if they can’t contribute when they can and should and want to”.But he refused to be drawn on the details of the changes, saying those who were concerned should wait to see the specifics. “You’ve seen the briefing, you’ve seen the speculation. I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityBenefitsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The URL was also changed, with the word “medal” changed to “deimedal”.Rogers, who was awarded the Medal of Honor by then president Richard Nixon in 1970, served in the Vietnam war, where he was wounded three times while leading the defense of a base.According tothe West Virginia military hall of fame, Rogers was the highest-ranking African American to receive the medal. After his death in 1990, Rogers’s remains were buried at the Arlington national cemetery in Washington DC, and in 1999 a bridge in Fayette county, where Rogers was born, was renamed the Charles C Rogers Bridge.As of Sunday afternoon, a “404 – Page Not Found” messageappearedon the defense department’s webpage for Rogers, along with the message: “The page you are looking for might have been moved, renamed, or may be temporarily unavailable.”A screenshotpostedby the writer Brandon Friedman on Bluesky on Saturday evening showed the Google preview of an entry of Rogers’s profile on the defense department’s website.Dated 1 November 2021, the entry’s Google preview reads: “Medal of Honor Monday: Army Maj Gen. Charles Calvin Rogers.” Below it are the words: “Army Maj Gen Charles Calvin Rogers served through all of it. As a Black man, he worked for gender and race equality while in the service.”“Google his name and the entry below comes up.

His assailant allegedly fled the scene and is being sought by authorities. They were unable to say if the attack was random or targeted.It was later reported that the man had been doused with accelerant from a Patron tequila bottle and lit on fire, according to crime scene investigators. The victim then ran 100ft west while on fire before someone jumped out of a car and doused him with a powder fire extinguisher, fire marshalstold the New York Post.A Brooklyn woman told the outlet that Times Square gets “pretty scary” early in the morning. “Yeah it’s pretty scary before 8 or 9am,” said the woman, Anne Lee, 26. “There are no cops on these blocks at all. These side streets. They’re really only on the avenues and they only give directions to tourists.”Street violence is likely to be a dominant issue of New York’s mayoral elections this year, with one contender, the former state governorAndrew Cuomo, calling the city “out of control” and vowing to add 5,000 additional officers.The incumbent mayor,Eric Adams, has said the issue is not a shortage of police, but bail reforms signed into law by the former governor.Statistics show crime in the city is trending lower.“Stop saying our city is in ‘chaos and crisis’! It is not,” Adams said last week.But Sunday’s arson attack comes three months after a woman was fatally set on fire in a subway car, horrifying New Yorkers and renewing a debate over city safety. The victim was later identified as 57-year-old Debrina Kawam.The man accused of lighting her on fire, the Guatemalan migrant worker Sebastian Zapeta, was taken into custody hours after the incident and charged with murder and arson.Police said the suspect had not left the scene as Kawam burned to death and was found with a lighter in his pocket. “Lighting another human being on fire and watching them burn alive reflects a level of evil that cannot be tolerated,” the mayor’s office said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS crimeEric AdamsAndrew CuomonewsShareReuse this content"

The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home.“It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,” said Jim Akers, the coroner of Butler county, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. “The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.”In Arkansas, three storm-related deaths have been confirmed in Independence county with an additional 29 people injured in eight counties,according tothe Arkansas division of emergency management on Saturday morning.Three people were killed on Friday in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo county in theTexaspanhandle, according to Sgt Cindy Barkley of the state’s department of public safety.

Three additional people are currently missing and preliminary reports indicate 29 injuries statewide, Reeves said.In Alabama, the governor, Kay Ivey,announcedon Sunday morning that at least two people had died as a result of the storms, with reports of damage in 52 of the state’s 67 counties.Further west in Oklahoma, the governor, Kevin Stitt,saidthat there was at least one fatality from a vehicle accident cause by smoke. He added that approximately 170,000 acres across the state have burned as a result of wildfires.The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings early on Saturday morning for areas in Alabama, Kentucky,Mississippi, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana and Texas.The agency has warned residents not to seek refuge in vehicles outside or under overpasses, as well as not to seek shelter under trees. Instead, it urged residents to get off the road and drive to a designated shelter, basement or safe room. The next best option for shelter is a small, windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor of a sturdy building, according to the agency.Extreme weather and powerful winds predicted for 100 million AmericansRead moreEvacuations were ordered in someOklahomacommunities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state.

Several buildings were damaged.The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph (160km/h) possible.“Potentially violent” tornadoes were expected on Saturday in parts of the central Gulf coast and deep south into theTennesseevalley, according to the National Weather Service.The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas ofAlabamaincluding Birmingham and Tuscaloosa would be at a high risk.

Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening.About 60 miles (90km) to the south, another fire grew to about 4 sq miles (10 sq km) before its advance was halted in the afternoon.High winds also knocked out power to more than 300,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma,Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according the website poweroutage.us.The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far easternSouth Dakotastarting early on Saturday.

I know gay society very, very well, and I think we’re in the greatest danger I have ever seen.”Since his inauguration, Trump has ended policies giving LGBTQ+ Americans protection from discrimination. He has alsorestricted access to gender-affirming healthcare, said the USwould only recognise two sexes, andbarred transgender peoplefrom enlisting in the military.Davies also used his keynote speech at the awards ceremony, which rewards the efforts made to improve the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the UK, to criticise Trump, and the president’s allyElon Musk.“I think times are darkening beyond all measure and beyond anything I have seen in my lifetime,” he told the audience, which included the singers Louise Redknapp and Katy B, and the Traitors contestants Leanne Quigley and Minah Shannon.Davies said he had turned 18 and left home in 1981, adding: “And that is exactly the year that rumours and whispers of a strange new virus came along, which came to haunt our community and to test us in so many ways.”“The joyous thing about this is that we fought back,” he said. The community “militarised, campaigned, marched and demanded the medicine”.He added: “We demanded the science. We demanded the access.”When he wrote the TV seriesQueer As Folkin the late 1990s, he said, it was part of a movement, with writers “fomenting ideas” and putting gay and lesbian characters on screen.Had he been asked to imagine then what life for LGBTQ+ people would be like in 2025, “I want to say it’s going to be all rainbows,” he said, “skipping down the street hand-in-hand, equality, equality, equality.”But the peril the gay community now faced, he said, was even greater than that in the 1980s.“The threat from America, it’s like something at The Lord of the Rings. It’s like an evil rising in the west, and it is evil,” Davies said.“We’ve had bad prime ministers and we’ve had bad presidents before. What we’ve never had is a billionaire tech baronopenly hating his trans daughter,” he added.Musk, the de facto head of the “department of government efficiency”, bought the social networking site Twitter, which he renamedX. A study by the University of California, Berkeley found hate speech on the platform rose by 50% in the months after it was bought by the billionaire.“We have never had this in the history of the world,” Davies said. “It is terrifying because he and the people like him are in control of the facts, they’re in control of information, they’re in control of what people think, and that is what we’re now facing.”But Davies said the gay community would do “what we always do in times of peril, we gather at night”, and would once again come together, and fight against this latest wave of hostility and oppression.“What we will do in Elon Musk’s world, that we’re heading towards, is what artists have always done,” he told the Guardian, “which is to meet in cellars, and plot, and sing, and compose, and paint, and make speeches, and march.”“If we have to be those rebels in basements yet again,” he added, “which is when art thrives, then that’s what we’ll become.”Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsRussell T DaviesEqual marriageGenderTransgenderTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

During his White House marketing event for Tesla on Tuesday, Trump said the US and its economy “went to hell” under Biden. Last week, in his national address to Congress, Trump said: “We inherited from the last administrationan economic catastropheand an inflation nightmare.”But the truth is that by standard economic measures, theUS economywas in excellent shape when Biden turned over the White House keys to Trump, even though most Americans, upset about inflation, told pollsters the economy was in poor shape.When Biden left office, the unemployment rate was a low 4.1%, and during Biden’s four years in office, the averagejobless rate was lowerthan for any president since the 1960s. Trump has repeatedly railed against the high inflation under Biden, but the fact is that by the time Biden left office, the inflation rate had fallen to just 2.9% – down more than two-thirds from its peak and near the Federal Reserve’s inflation goal.Stocks tank and egg prices soar under Trump | Lloyd GreenRead moreNot only that, the nation’s GDP growth has been impressive, rising at a solid 3.1% rate at the end of Biden’s term. Ever since the pandemic ended, economic growth in the UShas been considerably stronger than in the UK, France, Germany and other G7 nations. Shortly before election day, the Economist magazine ran a story saying the US economy was “the envy of the world” and had “left other rich countries in the dust”.Trump often says job growth under Biden was terrible, but the fact is that the US added 16.6m jobs during Biden’s presidency, more than during any four-year term of any previous US president. Under Trump, job growth was far worse – during his first four-year term, the nation lost 2.7m jobs overall, making Trump’s presidency the first since Herbert Hoover’s during which the nation suffered a net loss in jobs. The pandemic was largely responsible for this, but even during Trump’s first three years in office, before the pandemic hit, job growth was only half as fast as it was under Biden.Recently, Trump has repeatedly boasted how his tariffs will bring back manufacturing. Trump fails to note, however, that Biden had considerable success in bringing bring back manufacturing and factory jobs. Under most recent presidents, the US lost manufacturing jobs, but under Biden, the nation gained an impressive 750,000 factory jobs, the most under any president since the 1970s. A big reason for this was that as a result of Biden’s green jobs legislation and the Chips Act to boost semiconductor production, manufacturing investment boomed, more than doubling during Biden’s four years in office.Biden took considerable pride about how the economy performed under him, even though he failed to persuade most Americans that the it was doing well. In December, Biden wrote: “Incomes are upby nearly $4,000adjusted for inflation [since he took office], and unions have won wage increasesfrom 25%to 60%in industries like autos, ports, aerospace, and trucking. We’ve seen 20 million applications to start small businesses. Our economy has grown 3% per year on average the last four years –fasterthan any other advanced economy. Domestic energy production is at a record high.”Many economists vigorously disagree with Trump’s claim that he inherited a poor economy.Paul Krugman wrotethat in January, when Biden left office, the US had what was “very close to a Goldilocks economy, in which everything is more or less just right”. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, had even more glowing words. “President Trump is inheriting an economy that is aboutas good as it ever gets,” he said. “The US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.”Trump pays attention to one measure of the economy above all others: how the stock market is doing. During Biden’s four years, Wall Street did very well. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 39% and the S&P 500 soared by 55.7%, including a 28% jump during 2024. In contrast, the stock market is down overall since Trump took office as investors have grown alarmed about the president’s tariff war against the US’s trading partners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Housing affordability was a major problem, and inflation rose to uncomfortable levels. The spike in prices was caused largely by two factors: the pandemic, which gave rise to worldwide supply chain problems, and Putin’s war in Ukraine, which pushed up food and fuel prices. But Trump, in denouncing Biden on inflation, ignores all that.As Trump’s trade war spooks the markets and makes nervous CEOs rethink their investment plans, many economists are saying it’s more and more likely the US will stumble into recession this year.Trump has a long history of refusing to accept blame for mistakes and problems, and by repeatedly claiming he inherited a horrible economy, he seems to be laying the groundwork to blame Biden if the country slides into a painful recession.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpJoe BidenUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

He closed out his incredible run in the desert with his most dominant performance of all, completely overpowering the 12th seed, Holger Rune, 6-2, 6-2 to win at Indian Wells for the first time.Fred Stolle obituaryRead moreWith a triumphant run at arguably the biggest regular tournament in the world outside of the grand slams, Draper is the fifth British man in history to win an ATP Masters 1000 title, joining Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski, Andy Murray and Cameron Norrie. Having already sealed a place inside the top 10 for the first time in his career, the 23-year-old will rise to a career-high ranking of No 7 in his first week as a top 10 player. Draper has also now won three ATP titles, with his wins at the Stuttgart ATP 250 event and Vienna ATP 500 all achieved over the past year.“I feel like I deserve this, in all honesty,” said Draper. “The amount of adversity I have been through, the amount of sacrifices, the amount of time all the people around me have put into me. It’s an emotional feeling to know how much you have gone through and put in. To be here now and to say I will be seven in the world, I cannot tell you how much that means to me.”This had already been an incredible week that featured the best tennis of Draper’s career, particularly in the 13th seed’s devastating fourth round performance against the third seed, Taylor Fritz.His win over the second seed and defending champion, Alcaraz, on Saturday, meanwhile, was a reflection of his mental toughness and composure under pressure.While the younger yet considerably more experienced Rune looked tense early on, Draper burst into the match eviscerating the ball. He backed up his excellent serving by dominating the baseline with his much-improved forehand and he looked desperate to conduct the match on his terms. After flying to a 4-0 lead, Draper rolled through the opening set.Draper has always been open about the nerves that have sometimes accompanied his determination to succeed and this was the type of occasion that could have easily brought them out. Instead, he continued to relentlessly attack his forehand, completely overpowering Rune with his superior weight of shot.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva makes a backhand return.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APEven as Rune began to grow into the match – and the 21-year-old put Draper under pressure in a number of games – Draper played with immense courage on the decisive points, landing massive, precise first serves and pulverising his forehand until the title was his.When Draper began his rise up the ATP rankings years ago, he never imagined how challenging his path would be. He has had to navigate countless injuries, physical and even mental issues that left him questioning whether he would ever fulfil the potential he has long believed he possesses. This victory is a triumph of his resilience and determination, and it is clear that his rise has only just begun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was optimism and yet massive apprehension, too. TheNewcastle Unitedsupport had lived on the ends of their nerves since advancing to this Carabao Cup final. When you last won a domestic trophy in 1955 – the FA Cup victory against Manchester City, the goals from Jackie Milburn, Bobby ­Mitchell and George Hannah going down in folklore – it was going to be this way.But it was the day, one when new ­legends were born. Above all, it was just a giant Newcastle party. Yes, there was tension at the end, of course there was when the board went up to show eight additional minutes and ­Federico Chiesa, on as a ­Liverpool substitute, ran through to make it 2-1, the goal given after a review showed he was onside.Eddie Howe says he will never forget the day Newcastle broke their trophy duckRead moreAnd yet once Alexander Isak had scored for 2-0 with a clinical ­half‑volley early in the second half, the result never truly felt in doubt. Newcastle refused to allow it to become yet another hard-luck story. They drove this triumph through their collective will. They were in control throughout.Where to start? There was Dan Burn, who scored the first goal before the interval with a thundering epic of a header and refused to concede an inch in defence. All this in the week of his first England callup. There was Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton in midfield. There was Isak. And then there was Eddie Howe.When the manager took over in November 2021, Newcastle were in the Premier League’s relegation zone. He began by restoring sta­bility, self‑respect, and then led them up the division and into the Champions League.The ­dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain in October 2023 on the night when St James’s Park hosted Champions League ­football for the first season since 2002-03 will live for ever. It was topped by this – Howe’s glory, perfectly calibrated, the most tangible of dividends for the club’s Saudi owners.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak and Tino Livramento celebrate after Isak scored their second goal.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Nigel French/Apl/SportsphotoNewcastle were without the suspended Anthony Gordon, the injured Lewis Hall and Sven Botman. Their form had been erratic. They had not beaten Liverpool since December 2015. None of it mattered as Arne Slot’s team were brought to their knees for the second time in a week.Slot had wanted to see a reaction to theChampions League last-16 exit against PSGbut it did not come. The league title surely will and that will represent an outstanding achievement. But the impression here was that they were a team working on muscle memory, running on empty.It was easy to feel that it meant more to Newcastle, principally because of their long wait for silverware and also because these type types of showpieces have been so rare for them. It was just their sixth ­Wembley cup final since 1955. Not only had they lost each previous one, they had scored but a single goal (Alan ­Gowling against Manchester City in the 1976 League Cup final).Howe’s team felt the emotion from their fans; the passion and noise pounded. The black‑and‑white scarves held outstretched as one or swirled above heads, also as one, were such a feature of the scene. The players were not overwhelmed. They channelled it, they mastered the occasion.Newcastle ran hard from the first whistle, physicality to the fore. One first-half moment summed things up, Joelinton sprinting back on 38 ­minutes to win the ball off Jarell Quansah. Joelinton clenched his fists and screamed at the Newcastle crowd. It was not the only time that he got his foot in to good effect. Or cele­brated wildly with the supporters.It was bedlam when Burn scored, the TV cutaways picking out Alan Shearer losing his mind, Ant & Dec too. The new England manager, Thomas Tuchel, had joked that it was easy to overlook Burn because of his size and how did Liverpool leave him so free? They had not heeded the warning in the 36th ­minute when Burn nodded a corner back for Guimarães, who could not muster the power on a flicked header.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had started his run from deep and if the leap was majestic there was something cinematic in how he butted the ball from quite a distance into the far corner.Sandro Tonali had curled a shot wide on 24 minutes and it was fair to write that Liverpool did not turn up before the interval. Straight after the Burn goal, Luis Díaz headed back for Diogo Jota but he could not sort out his feet. It was a completely isolated first-half flicker from Liverpool.Newcastle were in dreamland early in the second half when Isak banged home. They had put the ball in the net a couple of minutes beforehand, Isak turning home after ­Caoimhin Kelleher’s save from Burn – only for the offside flag to go up. It had followed another corner, ­Joelinton teeing up Burn from beyond the far post. Now Tino Livramento hung up a high cross and Jacob Murphy just wanted it more than Andy Robertson. When his header went to Isak, there was no doubt about the finish.Slot made changes. One of them, Curtis Jones, drew a smart tip‑over from Nick Pope. But it would have been over shortly afterwards had Kelleher not kept out an improvised close-range volley from Isak.Liverpool’s hopes were faint, even when the board went up to signal the stoppage time. They scored when Guimarães tried a risky spin move and was robbed by the substitute, Harvey Elliott, who played in Chiesa. There would be no ­outlandish ­comeback. When the full-time ­whistle sounded, Newcastle could start to drink it in.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He may well be grateful for that; in the final meaningful act of day four, the little-known JJ Spaun came within a couple of ball rotations of snatching the PGA Tour’s marquee event from McIlroy’s grasp. How that would have stung the Northern Irishman. The pair will instead return on Monday morning for a three hole playoff. McIlroy is the clear favourite but Spaun, with nothing to lose, carries menace.As with so much involving McIlroy, this proved dramatic stuff. He was four shots adrift of the lead before a shot was struck on Sunday. Inside five holes, he was tied at the top. A four-hour weather delay ensued; when McIlroy birdied the 12th upon return, he led by three. McIlroy played the closing six in one over as Spaun birdied the 14th and 16th to force extra time.Matt Fitzpatrick splits from caddie Billy Foster after poor start to 2025Read more“It was a battle all day,” McIlroy said. “I feel like I should be going home with the trophy tonight but that is fine, I will reset and hopefully go home with the trophy tomorrow.”So much always depends on the closing two holes at the Stadium Course. McIlroy was irritated by a par on the 17th after his tee shot found an awkward lie but responded by hitting a magnificent iron into the heart of the 18th fairway. From there, he came up 73ft short; McIlroy’s two-putt was a good one. Spaun also made a three at the 17th but his tee shot at the last finished in pine straw. The underdog’s nerveless approach left him 30ft for glory. The putt finished so agonisingly short for Spaun. His 72 and McIlroy’s 68 left the duo at 12 under par.

Verstappen closed the gap due to the intervention of a safety car. Norris has previously played down how impressive his car has looked but after the race in Melbourne, conceded it was the class of the field.“I do think we are the favourites,” he said. “We are the team to beat. The car is flying. There will be tracks where we are even better.”George Russell, who was third for Mercedes, had suggested earlier at the weekend that the pace of the McLaren had made it all but untouchable already and that other teams may shift swiftly their focus to 2026 when there is a major regulation change. Russell’s comments were welcomed by Norris.View image in fullscreenLando Norris is soaked with champagne by his team members as they all celebrate the victory.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images“If that is their mentality, then wonderful because that is not the mentality to have,” he said. “We know we have a lot of work to do in this car and if you do relax, you have failed. InFormula Oneif you start to think everything is good and groovy that is when you get caught.”The British driver also praised his team for making the right strategy calls and managing his race well after some significant failings last year – specifically in the crucial moments when a sudden rain shower hit in the latter stages and Norris was wrestling with his car.“The team calling me to box half a second before I needed to box, even though I was still trying to save the car and making sure I didn’t shunt, was the right call. It was a call that won me the race,” he said.View image in fullscreenLando Norris’s McLaren car was excellent in the wet.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockAt Ferrari, however, it was clear there is work to be done. Hamilton finished 10th and said adapting to his car and team is taking time. He had some terse exchanges with his race engineer, Riccardo Adami, and Vasseur said the team must do better.“We learn a lot from this weekend because we made mistakes,” he said. “We need to improve the communication, understand what Lewis needs from the communication. It was the first race, the first time that we have to communicate between the pitwall and the car. We can do a better job and know each other more, for sure it was not a clean one at all, the strategy was difficult and we need to find a better way to communicate between the car and the pitwall.”Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisFormula OneMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The only problem for Leicester was Vardy sent the ball over the line during a break in play while Ayden Heaven, forced off early in the second half, received treatment, and it was the United supporters singing about Van Nistelrooy. The Dutchman took charge of United in the reverse fixture in November, signing off from his spell in interim chargewith a 3-0 victory, but this time he was on the receiving end of the same scoreline.That four-match unbeaten run with United must feel halcyonic for Van Nistelrooy, who has now lost 13 of his past 14 league matches. The numbers make grisly reading: Leicester have not scored here since early December and after firing blanks in this defeat they recorded unwanted history, becoming the firstPremier Leagueteam to lose seven home matches in a row without scoring. Leicester are nine points adrift of 17th-placed Wolves and have a vastly inferior goal difference.Merino strike proves the difference as strikerless Arsenal sink ChelseaRead moreThings do not get any easier either, with a trip to Manchester City the first of their next four games against teams in the top seven. “It’s about the mathematical possibility that is there and as long as that is the case we are professionals and we keep doing our jobs,” Van Nistelrooy said, adopting a diplomatic tone. “We won’t give up until it’s mathematically impossible.”The night descended into a procession for United when Alejandro Garnacho doubled United’s advantage midway through the second half, building on Rasmus Højlund’s first goal for 22 hours and 19 minutes.It was an imperfect United performance but, frankly, it did not matter against opposition silently sliding towards relegation. Bruno Fernandes completed the scoring with a superb first-time finish from the edge of the box, capping a good week in which Unitedadvanced to the Europa League quarter-finals.It would be kind to refer to this as a slow-burner, a distinctly low-quality contest befitting teams who began in 15th and 19th. There was a general shoddiness, a theme that has stalked both sides this season: overcooked passes, ballooned crosses, unforced errors aplenty. Christian Eriksen, one of three players promoted to United’s starting lineup, registered the visitors’ first effort of note, cracking a first-time effort against a post after a short-corner routine, the Denmark midfielder whipping a right-foot shot at goal from the edge of the 18-yard box after exchanging passes with Fernandes.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes fires home Manchester United’s third in the 90th minute.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAUnited took the lead approaching the half-hour, the relief tangible as Højlund buried a shot across goal. Fernandes was invariably involved in the buildup. The Portuguese whittled a pass through for Højlund, who chested the ball after Boubakary Soumaré missed his attempted clearance. Wout Faes hesitated to pressure the striker and then reneged altogether. Højlund then got the ball out of his feet and after dawdling briefly – no wonder given his barren run – he sent his right-foot effort past an exposed Mads Hermansen.Just like that, after 21 matches without finding the net, Højlund handed United the lead. “It is really important for him,” said United’s head coach, Ruben Amorim. “He scored a very good goal and I think he deserved it more than anybody.”Still, it spoke volumes that Heaven, on his first Premier League start and fifth senior appearance, was one of United’s standout performers. The 18-year-old, signed from Arsenal on 1 February, did well to recover the ball when Patson Daka was released on goal, though Daka’s failure to seize the opportunity was also indicative of a struggling player.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Soumaré wriggled clear of a wreckage on halfway, played in Vardy inside the left channel and the Leicester captain sent the ball into the box. Daka was lurking at the back post but Heaven, who was replaced by Toby Collyer, made life difficult and Daka skewed a shot wide. United thought they had a second when Højlund slipped in Garnacho, who cut inside Luke Thomas and thrashed a shot into the far corner. Garnacho and Højlund sat on the advertising hoardings in celebration, but prematurely. Garnacho was offside.The Argentinian would return to the hoardings 10 minutes later, after swivelling on to Fernandes’s pass and blasting a first-time effort in at Hermansen’s near post. Højlund hugged Garnacho and every outfield player joined the party. Fernandes made it game, set and match in the final minute of normal time. United fans rattled through the back catalogue of chants about famous names: Rooney, Solskjær, Cole and Van Nistelrooy. But it is in Amorim whom they trust, evidenced by the away fans serenading him, too, throughout. “It’s strange,” Amorim smiled. “I know we are so far away from what they expect and deserve.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeicester CityManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There was pure elation in the black-and-white half of Wembley, packed with more than 32,000 Newcastle fans, at full time as they celebrated the end of a seven-decade long wait since winning the 1955 FA Cup. Victory earned a Uefa Conference League spot for next season.Newcastle sink Liverpool to savour taste of glory after decades of droughtRead more“With such a long wait for a trophy, this will be a day that I’m sure everyone will never forget,” Howe said. “We will never forget it. I certainly won’t. I think there’s different ways to win trophies. Today we won it in the best way. We played a brilliant opponent, they’ve been the best team in the Premier League all season by quite a long way. And for me, we were the better team.“I feel amazing, it is an incredible day. I was so, so pleased with our performance, it was not a lucky win, thoroughly deserved. I am drenched in alcohol from Joelinton and the rest of the squad, it’s a great moment, it is about embracing the success. We have to try and enjoy the moment and take it all in.”Howe is the first English manager to win a major trophy in the country since Harry Redknapp led Portsmouth to FA Cup glory in 2008 and is hoping he and Newcastle can build on this. “Hopefully with one, it can become more,” the Newcastle manager said. “There’s no guarantee, though, but I just think it proves we can do it. I’ve never had any doubts about our ability to lift our game. But you don’t get many shots at this, you don’t get many shots at a cup final. Today we had to try and take our opportunity and that’s where the players delivered under pressure so well and so impressively. It also proved that we can mix our game against the very, very best. Now the challenge for us is to try and get there more often.”View image in fullscreenArne Slot said he had never seen a header like Dan Burn’s opener.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockBruno Guimarães and Joelinton were key to victory, dominating in midfield as every Newcastle player outclassed their opponent. “We’ve got some iconic players who will go down as legends of the football club in the future. But they’ve still got to cement that legacy.”Burn was unmarked from a corner after taking advantage of the defensive zonal marking just days after receiving an England callup. “I’ve had worse weeks,” Burns joked. “I don’t want to go to sleep because I feel like I am dreaming.”Liverpool failed to match Newcastle’s energy and aggression across the pitch to make it a miserable end to the week in which they were also dumped out of the Champions League by Paris Saint-Germain after extra time and penalties on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we played 10 times through the air against them, they win it probably nine times because they are a stronger team in the air than us. It led to the first goal and the second goal because the second goal was also a header that they won at the second post that fell for Isak.”The opener put Liverpool on the back foot and they never recovered on the pitch. “I’ve never seen in my life a player from that far away heading a ball with so much force into the far corner,” Slot said. “That is part of logic that they either have to go far away from our zone, which is 99 out of 100 times that they will never lead to a goal, or they have to arrive in our zone and then it’s an equal battle. Credit to him, I think he’s one of the few players that can score a goal from that distance with his head.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool score after a video assistant referee delayto make it 2-1. Newcastle restart, pump the ball into the Liverpool corner and from that moment a kind of elemental life force seems to surge through them. This is what you came for. This is how you wanted it, where you wanted it. Remember your training.Can there be any more forlorn, godforsaken assignment than trying to wrestle Newcastle away from the corner flag in the dying seconds of a Wembley final? Curtis Jones tries and Harvey Elliott tries and Jarell Quansah tries, but these are players desperately unsuited to the task.Newcastle sink Liverpool to savour taste of glory after decades of droughtRead moreSo Newcastle win a throw-in and all of a sudden nobody is around to take it. Sandro Tonali pauses over a corner kick to tie his shoelaces – double knot, maybe triple to be certain? – and accepts his yellow card as if it is a medal. Callum Wilson is suddenly a player built entirely out of elbows.Liverpool, the champions elect of England, have five minutes to find an equalising goal, and don’t manage a single touch in the opposition third.Really this was the only way it was going to happen: scrapping away over this precious few square yards of turf, eking out these precious few seconds, clinging on to a precious one-goal lead at the end of a competition in which you have had to beat the top four teams in the Premier League. At every juncture Eddie Howe’s team seem to have taken the path of most rather than least resistance, trusting in their ability to dig deeper and uglier and more painfully than you.“Just a normal game,” Howe had insisted beforehand. Yep, good luck with that. How many normal games are prefaced with a private set from James Bay in the team hotel? How many normal games necessitate the takeover of an entire capital city? Though secreted away in their Hertfordshire hideout, Newcastle’s players will surely have glimpsed the footage from London over the weekend, the thousands of fans converging on Covent Garden, lighting flares and fireworks, draping the Caffè Concerto and the Diptyque scented-candle shop in flags.View image in fullscreenNewcastle fans took over London all weekend and could barely believe their team’s triumphant moment of history.Photograph: Nigel French/Getty Images/AllstarWhile this stuff feels like sideshow, feels like distraction, it is in fact an essential part of the enterprise. One of the basic missions of Newcastle since the Saudi takeover – indeed, a central aim of the takeover itself – has been to project themselves. Make loud noises. Move fast, break things. To adopt the persona and mindset of a Big Club as the first step towards actualising the vision.You could see it in their early moves in the transfer market, in therecent new stadium plans, in the reimagining of the fanbase as active participant rather than passive observer. One prominent Newcastle podcast was urging travelling fans to take it easy on Saturday night. “Have fun, have a few bevs, but then go home and have that energy for tomorrow,” the host urged. “We need you singing your hearts out. We don’t want to be hungover like two years ago.”You could see it in the enraptured crowds: everyone either making content or filming it, convinced that they are somehow protagonists at the crux of history. And above all you could see it in the football itself, a thing of cold fury and relentless running, a game built around suffering: the absorption of it, and the infliction of it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the earliest minutes there were little cracks appearing in the facade: mix-ups at the back, aimless long passes, the sort of last-ditch blocks and challenges more redolent of a rearguard. Mohamed Salah had 23 touches in 101 minutes. Virgil van Dijk may as well have watched the opening goal from a Club Wembley box. The utterly ineffective Diogo Jota was hauled off before the hour. Meanwhile, Alexander Isak was imperious, Kieran Trippier put in one of the performances of his career, Joelinton stoked and conducted the crowd like an evangelist.The final whistle blows and the picture begins to blur a little at the edges, so many emotions rushing in at once that the cumulative effect is actually a kind of numbness. Joy, confusion, the drunkenness of discovery and also – let’s be fair – the drunkenness of drunkenness. But also sadness for those no longer here to enjoy it, perhaps even a kind of buried anger. Should it really have taken this long? Should it really have been this hard?So this was a triumph that felt far more significant than the trophy and the Uefa Conference League place it bestowed. For decades Newcastle’s self-identity has been built on resistance: against entropy, against failure, against hated owners. For decades this is a club who have defined themselves against the footballing establishment. This may just have been the day they joined it.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupNewcastle UnitedLiverpoolEddie HoweanalysisShareReuse this content"

Ermedin Demirovic put Stuttgart ahead in the 15th minute before the unmarked Nick Woltemade slotted home to complete a quick break and make it 2-0 three minutes after half-time.Leverkusen’s Jeremie Frimpong cut the deficit in the 56th minute after Stuttgart repeatedly failed to clear the ball. However, the hosts restored their two-goal lead after 62 minutes when goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky saved a Demirovic shot but the ball bounced off Granit Xhaka for an own goal. Six minutes later it was Leverkusen’s turn to score with Piero Hincapié drilling in a shot to give them renewed hope.Amine Adli came agonisingly close to an equaliser in the 82nd but his shot just missed before Stiller scored an own goal. Schick completed Leverkusen’s pulsating late comeback in stoppage time to keep them firmly in the title race.

Both laboured to live with the ferocious tempo set by the outstanding Declan Rice right from the start.Arsenal have struggled to recapture their blisteringPremier Leagueform of last spring with so many attacking players still missing, and it was a surprise to see Ethan Nwaneri – perhaps the best finisher ­available to Arteta – left on the bench.The result was a number of wasted chances inside the opening 20 minutes when Chelsea could have easily been three goals down, thanks in part to Sánchez. Gabriel Martinelli could not make the most of the ­opportunity gifted to him by the ­Chelsea ­goalkeeper before Marc Cucurella was perhaps fortunate not to concede a penalty when the ball appeared to strike his arm while under pressure from Jurrien Timber. Rice eventually fired over after a clearance had cannoned into his path via James’s face.It was only a matter of time until Arsenal found a way through and Sánchez was again at fault. Merino’s deft header from a corner caught him flat-footed at his near post and the ball looped into the far corner of the unguarded net.“It was a different kind of ­finish than we planned,” Arteta said. “But [we’re] very happy because that would generate the belief in the team again, even in the stadium that we can score, because it’s something that we’re missing when we’re so prolific on that and with the amount of injuries that we have to deal with in the front line.”Wesley Fofana could easily have been sent off when he followed through with a tackle on Rice and stood on him, although VAR ruled that there had not been not sufficient force to warrant a red card.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A brilliant reaction save from Sánchez to deny Merino his second from a volley at the back post was the culmination of a scrappy period of play during which two players from each side went into the referee Chris Kavanagh’s booktwo players from each side were booked.Maresca threw on Kiernan ­Dewsbury-Hall and Tyrique George late on to replace the ineffective Christopher Nkunku and Jadon Sancho. But neither side really came close to scoring as the game petered out as a contest.At this stage of the season, all that really matters is the result and with a Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid to come, ­Arsenal can head into the international break satisfied they still have plenty for which to play.

But Rangers raced up the other end in the 88th minute and Igamane, on as a substitute for only a matter of minutes, fired high into the net for his side’s first league win at Celtic Park since 2020.It was yet another eventful afternoon between the two Glasgow giants. Away fans were allowed inside Parkhead for an Old Firm game for the first time since 2023 and about 2,500 had to wait for two hours before kick-off with safety nets around them – before they went through the emotional wringer during the match.The big team news was that because of injuries at centre-back, the Polish defender Maik Nawrocki was in for only his third Celtic appearance of the season, while the captain, Callum McGregor, was out through injury, replaced by Luke McCowan.View image in fullscreenReo Hatate brought Celtic level from 2-0 down with his 74th-minute strike.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PARangers, with the left-back Ridvan Yilmaz in for Jefté, got off to a blistering start.

Vaclav Cerny should have made it 2-0 in the 16th minute after picking up Schmeichel’s poor clearance but instead of a quick return shot the Czech Republic winger dribbled too wide and Nawrocki cleared.Leon Balogun’s header from another Tavernier corner was blocked by the Celtic midfielder Arne Engels but when Raskin raced into the box and headed on a Tavernier cross, unmarked Diomande chested the ball down and slid his shot low past Schmeichel.Ferguson, the interim manager, was booked by the referee, Steven McLean, before Dujon Sterling hooked a Maeda header away from the Rangers crossbar and from the resultant corner, Butland made a great save from a Nawrocki header.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was 19 when, five and a half years ago, he leftFulhamfor Tottenham. Having missed all of last season after surgery on both hamstrings, he returned on a free transfer in the summer having started only 26 league games for Spurs.Sessegnon has not made a huge impression this season but, with two minutes remaining, as Ben Davies dithered under a bouncing ball, he brushed him aside and whipped a precise right-footed finish into the top corner, securing Fulham’s win and, with his first goal at Craven Cottage since Boxing Day 2018, a measure of personal vindication.Arsenal 1-0 Chelsea: Premier League – live reactionRead moreIt feels like there may be a lot of this between now and the end of the season. The title is all but settled and relegation effectively resolved which means all that remains is the squabble over European qualification.The result was a strange, three‑quarter‑pace game. It would be unfair to say both sides were going through the motions but, equally, this was not the most intense game you will ever see. It had seemed a phenomenon many thought impossible: a game not even Angeball could make interesting. Spurs’ defending, though, can conjure goals from anything. “We had a bit of control and we concede a soft goal,” Ange Postecoglou said. “It’s another game we let get away from us.”The game had seemed to be drifting to a stalemate when Spurs twice failed to clear, and Andreas Pereira reacted sharply to control Adama Traoré’s jab into the box and then shovel the ball on to Rodrigo Muniz, who rolled a neat finish just beyond the scrabble of Guglielmo Vicario. His fellow substitute Sessegnon finished off the job 10 minutes later.“It was a really emotional game for him,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “For Ryan it was really difficult. Everybody expected a bright future for him, but in football sometimes you have downs. He did not have fortune with injuries. He’s going to be even more important in the future.”Fulham had rather more on the line than Spurs and it showed. The win lifted them to eighth, still outside likely European qualification but within three points of a Champions League place. Just as significantly, perhaps, the game served as an audition for Silva if Postecoglou is shuffled out in the summer and if he is interested in taking the job. The two exchanged a notably protracted hug before kick‑off, Postecoglou laughing as his right arm waved animatedly. You could only imagine what he was saying: “Don’t take it, mate. It’s an absolute shambles.”View image in fullscreenRodrigo Muniz puts Fulham in front in the 78th minute.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersTottenham are not one of the sides chasing Europe through league placing, their potential route to the Champions League lying through the Europa League. That is now clearly the priority, with the result that their side featured seven changes from thewin against AZ Alkmaaron Thursday. Given how many injuries Spurs have endured this season, how exhausted they have appeared at times, that was an understandable decision: rotation is either necessary or it is not.With no James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski or Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham were always going to struggle for creativity. The double change at half-time, Son Heung-min and Bergvall coming on for Brennan Johnson and Yves Bissouma seemed more a reaction to early flatness than a planned move to spread the minutes around. Bergvall’s 52nd-minute cross led to Spurs’ first real chance, Dominic Solanke heading just wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis was the third game in five in which Bissouma was withdrawn at half-time. “Biss sometimes lets games drift by him,” Postecoglou said. Given 12 players have played more minutes than him this season and he has one year left on his contract, it would be little surprise were he to be offloaded in the summer.Replacing him in Spurs’ midfield, perhaps, could be Archie Gray who, on his 13th league start for the club, at last was used in his preferred position. The 19-year-old is a player of exceptional talent as he demonstrated by completing more than 90% of his passes and will surely, in time, make the deep-lying midfield role his own. But his most significant contribution was defensive, hacking the ball clear from inside the six-yard box as Spurs withstood an extended period of Fulham pressure in the minutes leading up to half-time.Otherwise there was very little for Spurs to take from the game. For Fulham, though, the prospect of a return to European competition is real. Five points separate fourth from 10th; there might not be much to play for elsewhere but upper mid-table is shaping up to be a real dogfight.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But at the end here there was the distinct feeling that one side’s quest for a return to the Premier League had taken a potentially fatal hit, while the other’s continued to accelerate at pace.Championship roundup: Farke blames himself as leaders Leeds drop pointsRead moreLike this derby of late, Rhian Brewster has not been associated with prolific goal-scoring since his £23.5m move to the Blades from Liverpool in 2020. His second-half strike here was only his eighth in 109 appearances for the club, and just his third this season.But not only does it reaffirm United as the city’s dominant team, it also lifts Chris Wilder’s side back into the Championship’s automatic promotion places and level on points with the leaders, Leeds United, who drew on Saturday. The top three are now split by just two points with Burnley’s win at Swansea, and it is now clear that every moment will matter over the final six weeks.With that in mind, who knows just how big a moment Brewster’s strike midway through the second half could turn out to be. For the boyhood Blades fan Wilder, it understandably meant a lot. “I haven’t played in a Sheffield derby but I’ve been involved in six as a manager now so I understand the emotion of how hard they are,” the manager said.“When I came [in 2016] I wanted us to dominate the city. It’ll swing back – it might be two, five or 10 years. But it’ll swing back because it has for 130‑odd years. But we tried to put some pride back in this shirt.“There’s life in us. There’s a future inSheffield United. Their season is done. Ours is still alive.”Brewster’s goal has significant implications for the other half of this city, too. Back-to-back away victories had reinvigorated Wednesday’s own playoff push but defeat here means they are now six points shy of the top six with eight games remaining.“We’re still in touch because there’s 24 points left,” their manager, Danny Röhl, said. “There’s eight finals left. Six points isn’t far away, and I believe it’s possible. It’s disappointing, because we’ve seen again how competitive we are.”What may hurt Wednesday supporters more, however, is that they remain without a win against United since 2012 – and they have not scored in a derby for five matches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Michael Cooper proved again why he is arguably the Championship’s standout goalkeeper with a wonderful save to deny Michael Smith amid an opening period dominated by Wednesday.The hosts again surged forward after the interval and Burrows was on hand to block Josh Windass’s goal‑bound effort. But just after the hour United’s first and only shot on target arrived – and it produced the game’s only goal. Tyrese Campbell drove into the Wednesday area and James Beadle could only palm his cross into the path of Brewster. He did the rest from six yards out.Wednesday again pressed for an equaliser in the final minutes, but Cooper produced another brilliant save to deny Marvin Johnson – although Svante Ingelsson should have done better with the rebound with the goal at his mercy.United held on despite a nervy final few moments and Wilder, never one to shy from the limelight, was last off the field as the travelling support sang his name. His dream of taking his boyhood club back to the Premier League remains firmly on course.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield WednesdaySheffield Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Lucy Parker hooked in from a corner to halve the deficit with five minutes remaining, before Katie Stengel capitalised on a mistake from the Villa goalkeeper Sabrina D’Angelo – who was pushing up towards halfway in the 95th minute – to roll the ball into an empty net.The result left the Villa head coach, Natalia Arroyo, still without a point from her four league fixtures in charge, and the club without a league win since December, although the Spaniard did oversee an FA Cup victory in February againstBrighton.The Sussex club were also in action on Sunday and claimed their first league win since November, as Fran Kirby’s low finish into the corner secured a 1-0 win at the out‑of-formTottenham.In the Women’s Championship,Portsmouthwon their second consecutive game by defeatingSunderland2-1 to move off the bottom of the table and up to ninth, above their relegation rivals Sheffield United and Blackburn, with huge twists on the same day in the relegation battles in both of the top two leagues.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Borthwick also endorsed Maro Itoje for the captaincy.However, with Farrell naming his coaching ticket in nine to 10 days’ time, the assistants Richard Wigglesworth, Tom Harrison, Kevin Sinfield, Joe El‑Abd and Andrew Strawbridge are all expected to be passed over, ensuring England coaches miss out for the second Lions tour in a row.Borthwick backs England players for Lions squad after rout of WalesRead moreWigglesworth and Harrison have seen their stock rise during the campaign, with England ending on a high note, racking up 10 tries in Cardiff while their scrum has shown significant improvements throughout the competition.Borthwick, who was the last England coach to be seconded for a Lions tour, in 2017, said: “Andy hasn’t talked about any of the coaching team at this stage. I’d love them to have the opportunity. I’d love as many of the management team as possible to have that. That Lions experience I had in 2017 was one of the best, if not the best, experience I’ve had in my life.“Working with the best players from four different countries, working with incredible coaches against top-class opposition. I developed and learned so much as a coach in that period, it was brilliant for me and accelerated my coaching, so I’d love as many other people from the England group to be in there as possible, and I’ll be fully supportive of them all.”England should still be well represented in the playing squad after ending the championship with four wins from five matches. Players such as the Curry brothers, Ben Earl, Will Stuart, Fin Smith, Alex Mitchell and Tommy Freeman have all played their way into contention.It is understood that all England players selected are mandated 10 weeks off after the tour, ensuring they will miss the first two rounds of the Premiership season, then be available for three rounds before the autumn internationals. England will have four autumn Tests this year and, although Eddie Jones was forced to rest some of his senior stars in 2017, it is believed that there are no such restrictions this year but players’ workloads will be carefully managed.“[Andy and I] met about three weeks ago, we spoke on the phone about 10 days ago, I’m sure we will next week as well,” said Borthwick, who will take a developmental squad on the summer tour of Argentina and the US. “I have done the exercise about 10 times, where I’ve sat there and written out which players I think will go – and I end up with a different number each time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were badly lacking in creativity in Palmer’s absence with Maresca hoping that he could be back for their next game against Tottenham on 3 April.Asked whether he is expected to link up with Thomas Tuchel’s squad this week, the Chelsea manager said: “I don’t think so. We never wish for players to get injured but in Cole’s case in this moment it will give him some rest physically and mentally so it could be good. He needs a scan and it is planned for Monday.”Maresca also acknowledged that his side are struggling for goals without Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke, who could also both be back to face Spurs. “It’s a huge difference,” he said. “If you think that the three players with the most goals for us, not one of them was inside the pitch today. It’s normal that offensively we can struggle a little bit.”The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, saw his side waste a number of chances to make it a more convincing win but was surprisingly full of praise for Chelsea, who he described as “the best attacking team in the league in open play”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cushing said he felt they had “done enough to win” the final.“I want this team to be a threat and to believe that it can be a threat however the game goes, whoever we play.

I’ve seen enough to know we can be competitive in the next three games.”In Cushing’s six-year spell in charge at City from 2014 to 2020, they won six major trophies: one league title, three League Cups and two FA Cups.Asked what differences she had noticed in Cushing’s team compared to how City played under Taylor, the Chelsea manager, Sonia Bompastor, said: “Most of the big principles we could see under Gareth were the ones we could see today with Nick,” although she added that she expects that to change in the coming days.View image in fullscreenNick Cushing encourages his Manchester City team during their defeat to Chelsea at Pride Park.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PACushing felt “you could see some slight adjustments in the way we want to play, that made us more of a threat” and he said: “I thought our wingers were our main threat.

The value of shares in Eutelsat, the French owner of London-based Starlink rival OneWeb, have shot up by 500% sinceTrump’s Oval Office row with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Eutelsat’s chief executive told Bloomberg the company could replace Starlink in a couple of months in places like Ukraine.Viasat, which owns UK network Inmarsat, is also in talks with European governmentsabout replacing Musk’s Starlink.In the UK, Starlink is used mainly by people and businesses in rural areas who have poor broadband access, although there is also a minority of “preppers” and people who buy the tech as fans of Musk.An installer of Starlink for businesses and homes in southern England said that, for now, there was no better alternative to Starlink for those who needed fast access to the internet.He said: “In the industry we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it’s a necessary tool and a solution that exists in a lot of rural areas, especially with the poor investment in infrastructure. But on the other hand, we have now got to deal with Elon – to put it politely – being a twat.“The majority of people who use it are those in need of it due to being a remote area, but there is also a small minority ‘tinfoil hat’ brigade element.”Richard Opie, a consultant living in a semi-rural part of Northumberland, said he had got Starlink during the pandemic because there was not enough capacity on BT, but was now considering whether to stay with the company.He said: “It’s a godsend, especially in remote areas, but things have developed politically since then. Elon Musk is a very different figure and Tesla showrooms are being burned to the ground. I’m uncomfortable with him getting into bed with Trump and the way he has thrown his weight around.“It’s something we have wrestled with and looked for alternatives but we’re sort of stuck for the moment.”Nisbet’s comments on a Facebook “Starlink UK Users’ Group” – that he could no longer justify supporting Starlink – sparked a spirited debate among users.Mel Sayer, another Starlink user, wrote: “I refuse to go to Trump’s hotels as I won’t give a penny to Trump. I now don’t want to fund ‘President Musk’ on his endeavours after that salute.”Mike Brown wrote: “I share your thoughts but am stuck with Starlink for now. Amazon are due to launch a rival service but probably not until next year. I’ll be jumping ship as quickly as possible.”Others are sticking with Starlink. Paul Feakins, a consultant in West Sussex, said: “People use Starlink because they can’t get an internet connection any other way, yet these idiots think they’re making a statement by cancelling it because they happen to disagree with Elon on something.”Starlink has been approached for comment.Starlink has grown rapidly in the UK, from 13,000 subscribers three years ago to 87,000 last year.Such has been the popularity of Starlink in some areas of the UK that the company has been levying an extra “congestion charge” for those areas where there is high demand.The company provides ultrafast broadband speeds via a constellation of satellites. British customers typically pay from £75 a month for a 30-day term, plus £299 for hardware.For non-customers, Starlink may be better known for its use in Ukraine, which has been vital for Kyiv’s battlefield communications, after Starlink terminals were rushed there after Russia’s invasion in February 2022.Lately, however, the prospect of Ukraine being cut out of Starlink has grown,with Reuters reportingthat US negotiators have threatened Ukraine with losing the system.

The activist accused 18F of building a program to put bureaucrats in charge of preparing people’s tax returns. It was one of several false claims about the office circulating onX, the social media platform that Musk owns andspends much of his day on.Musk’s tweet immediately set off widespread confusion in 18F, which, rather than a radical leftist cabal, is tasked with partnering with agencies across the government to consult and develop software solutions. Former staffers and a current GSA employee described 18F as a workforce that focused on delivering tech services and increasing efficiency within bureaucracy – exactly the work that Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is ostensibly designed to carry out.A day in Elon Musk’s mind: 145 tweets with election conspiracies and emojisRead moreAt the time Musk claimed deletion, partner agencies were expecting the office’s help on civic tech projects that were already in the works and would be key to updating their operations. Would they still get that assistance? What did Musk mean by “deleted”? What would happen to the tech tools that 18F was building? Staff at the sub-agency couldn’t get a definitive answer from the new Musk-allied leadership, according to three former workers, and didn’t know what to tell other agencies.The confusion would last for weeks, until on Saturday 1 March, staff at 18F received an email at around 1am telling them that they would all be laid off and their office would be shut down “with explicit direction from the top levels of leadership within both the Administration and GSA”.The 18F episode fits a common pattern of how Musk appears to ingest and amplify misinformation online. It is also a window into the influence of rightwing media and activists on Musk as he attacks and disbands parts of the government he believes don’t fit with his ideological worldview.I think it’s impossible for people who are hyper-partisan to imagine people setting aside partisanship while working for the governmentformer 18f employeeThe week after cutting 18F, the recently appointed head of the GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, which oversees 18F, held a meeting explaining the decision. Thomas Shedd, a 28-year-old former Tesla software engineer and Musk ally who sent the mass layoff email, told staffers that 18F was shut down becauseemployees’ hourly rates were too highand that outside consultants would cost less. Shedd did not directly respond to a request for comment on this article.“After a thorough review of 18F, GSA leadership – with concurrence from the administration and following all OPM guidelines – determined that the business unit was not aligned with the presidential EOs, statutorily required or critical activities,” a GSA spokesperson said, adding that the office was not recovering its costs.The explanation misunderstands how 18F operated and its cost structures, according to former staffers, as well as ignores that the group frequently saved agencies money by advising them against costly and unnecessary contracts with private vendors. Former employees and a current staffer at the GSA instead saw the layoffs as politically motivated.“The only reason I can see for 18F being singled out for elimination ahead of other offices would be to makeElon Muskhappy,” said a GSA employee, who spoke anonymously out of fear of reprisal.Misleading tweets and Musk doom workers dedicated to government efficiencyAlthough 18F worked with various government agencies and created popular services, it was largely unknown to the public. The group quietly helped create dozens of services across different bureaus each year, however, including the IRS Direct File free tax filing system. Many 18F software projects, such as streamlining the government’s weather website for easier use in the case of natural disasters, bore the explicit intention of making government services more efficient and reducing taxpayer cost.When Musk claimed he had “deleted” 18F, he was retweeting a 3 February post from rightwing activist Alex Lorusso, a producer for the conservative media influencer Benny Johnson, who frequently interacts with Musk on X. Lorusso, who was formerly banned from Twitter in 2020 for violating the company’s policies on platform manipulation and spam, is one of several rightwing influencers regularly amplified by Musk on X, and one thatDonald Trump’sadministrationhas courted. Hehas workedas a paid consultant for Musk’s Super Pac, and he’s also a fan: the first post on his X profile, pinned to the top so no others will push it out of sight, is a 2023 photo of himself smiling with Musk.Lorusso’s post claimed 18F “puts the government in charge of preparing people’s tax returns for them” and suggested it was a “far left government wide computer office”. His claims about 18F were later corrected by other X users in a community note. It explained that the office had instead helped build a service that allowed Americans to file their taxes for free online – a popular pilot project that saved an estimated millions in tax fees and wasset to expandnationwide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Luke Rosiak, a writer for the conservative news site the Daily Wire, had posted a long thread on 31 January attacking 18F. He framed the tech consulting unit as a “far-left agency” and “coven of transgenders and queers hiring each other”. The thread included the profiles of several former 18F employees who used “they” pronouns in their bios, as well as images of an employee’s crowdfunding campaign for gender-affirming healthcare. It also drew on articles published in 2023 by Rosiak about the GSA and 18F, in which he suggested that the agency’s focus on diversity had resulted in major security failures, which ex-employees said was false. The first post in the Rosiak’s chain received over 13.5m views and was retweeted by Musk.Rosiak’s attack on 18F contained misleading statements, according to former employees. The Daily Wire writer asserted that 18F jeopardized security for one million Americans because it refused to insert facial recognition software into government website login.gov because of “racial equity”. The claim conflated multiple different parts of the GSA and misunderstood security issues around facial recognition, one former employee said, as well as blamed 18F for leadership decisions pertaining to an entirely different business unit.The GSA did face a legitimate scandal when its former Technology Transformation Services director, Dave Zvenyach, misrepresented the level of security that login.gov operated with, according to a 2023 inspector general’s report, but login.gov has for years been a separate entity from 18F and has no direct staffing overlap with the office. A racial equity test of facial recognition technology did take place, according to a former 18F employee, because facial recognition software isnotoriously less able to recognize non-white faces, and therefore using it as a tool for identity verification would have created security problems for users.“I think it’s impossible for people who are hyper-partisan to imagine people setting aside partisanship while working for the government,” a former 18F employee said in response to the conservative vitriol against 18F.Why Elon Musk is targeting a free tax-filing software packageRead moreIn response to a request for comment on the statements in the thread, a Daily Wire spokesperson said that Rosiak’s reporting on 18F speaks for itself.Following the mass layoffs at 18F, some former staffersset up a websiteattempting to correct the rightwing narrative that their group was a partisan faction within the government and instead highlight the variety of projects they completed. Others warned that their group was an early warning sign for how Doge and the Trump administration would target other agencies based on ideological grounds, rather than the content of their work.“We were living proof that the talking points of this administration were false. Government services can be efficient,” Lindsay Young, the former executive director of 18F, said in a post on LinkedIn. “This made us a target.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsUS domestic policyXfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was just a tech guy on a mission to “eliminate waste and fraud” from government.His slash-and-burn cost-cutting crusade was making “good progress actually”, he told the Fox Business commentator Larry Kudlow on Monday, despite sparking a backlash that has reverberated far beyond Washington.“Really, I just don’t want America to go bankrupt,” he said.But then Kudlow asked Musk to look forward. Would the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) still be in place in a year? He thought so – his assignment wasn’t quite complete. Musk, the world’s richest man, then pointed tosocial security, a widely popular federal program that provides monthly benefits to retirees and people with disabilities, and other social safety net programs: “Most of the federal spending is entitlements. That’s the big one to eliminate.”Elon Musk faces week of harsh setbacks amid Tesla selloff and Doge backlashRead moreFor weeks,Donald TrumpandRepublicanshave insisted that social security,MedicaidorMedicarewould not “be touched”. Now Musk was suggesting the programs would be a primary target. Almost as soon as the words left his mouth,Democratspounced.“The average social security recipient in this country receives $65 a day. They have to survive on $65 a day. But you want to take a chainsaw to social security, when Elon Musk and his tens of billions of dollars of government contracts essentially makes at least $8m a day from the taxpayers,”Hakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in afloor speechthe following day. “If you want to uncover waste, fraud or abuse, start there.”As the second Trump era comes into focus, Democrats have found anew villain: an “unelected billionaire” whose bravado – and sinking popularity – they believe may offer their party a path out of the political wilderness.“There’s nowhere in America where it is popular to cut disease research, to gut Medicaid and to turn off social security,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “So it’s hard to see a place where what Musk is doing for Trump doesn’t become an albatross forRepublicans.”The White House has championed Doge’s work while reiterating that Trump would “protect” social security and other entitlement programs. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.The Social Security Administration , which serves more than 70 million Americans, hasannouncedplans to reduce its workforce by more than 10% and close dozens of offices nationwide as part of Doge’s federal overhaul. Officials with the group have beeninstalledat the agency since early last month.Despite mounting criticism of Musk, the president has embraced his beleaguered ally, who spent close to $300m helping elect him to the White House. This week, Trump hailed Musk as a “patriot” as heshowcased Teslasfrom the south lawn of the White House. The president selected a red sedan, hoping to boost the electric car company, which hassuffered a sharp declinein sales and stock prices since its chief executive launched his Doge operation. The White House has said that if conflicts of interest arise, “Elon will excuse himself from those contracts”.But Musk and hischainsaw-wielding approachto downsizing government is playing a starring role inearly Democratic adsand fundraising appeals. Progressive activists have staged “nobody elected Elon”protestsacross the country while other groups are targetingTesla showroomsand dealerships. On a “fighting oligarchy” tour across the country, SenatorBernie Sanderspointed to Musk’s growing political influence as a central threat to American democracy.“Most American people, they can’t name us. They don’t know who Chuck Schumer is, but they do know what this administration andElon Muskand the GOP are planning for them,” Katherine Clark, the House minority whip, said on Friday. “It’s why you’re seeing this uproar in town halls.”‘A particularly heinous villain’: a disdain for Musk has sparked protests across USRead moreWhileDemocratshave much to say about Musk, they are less sure of how to stop him.Many of Doge’s actions have been halted or stopped in the courts. This week two federal judgesorderedgovernment agencies to rehire tens of thousands of probationary employees who were fired as part of Doge’s purge of the federal workforce.Locked out of power in Washington, Democrats are underenormous pressureto use any leverage they have to block Trump and Musk. A Republican-authored bill to fund federal agencies through September and avert a shutdown fiercely divided Democrats this week. House Democrats and progressive activists erupted in anger atChuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, who ultimatelyrelentedand helped pass the measure rather than risk a funding lapse and, in his words, give Musk and Doge an opportunity to “exploit the crisis for maximum destruction”.Public polling underlines Democrats’ interest in Musk. A newCNN surveyfound that just 35% of Americans held a positive view of the billionaire Trump adviser, a full 10 percentage points lower than the president. The poll also found that he is notably better known and more unpopular than the vice-president,JD Vance.More than six in 10 Americans said Musk had neither the right experience nor the judgment to carry out a unilateral overhaul of the federal government, though views broke sharply along partisan lines. Roughly the same share said they were worried the reductions would go “too far”, resulting in the loss of critical government programs.A survey conducted by the left-leaning Navigator Research polling firm late last month found that views of Doge as a standalone cost-cutting initiative were marginally favorable, in line with other polls that have found Americans arebroadly supportiveof its stated mission to root out waste and improve efficiency. But there are signs Americans don’t like the approach or implementation so far.When the effort was framed as “Elon Musk’s Doge”, views turned sharply more negative. The poll also captured the far-reaching impact of the cuts: 20% say they or someone they know has lost access to a federal service, 19% say they or someone they know has lost access to a federal grant, and 17% say they or someone they know has quit or been laid off from a federal government job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Federal watchdogs have long identified improper spending as a problem, but Musk’s figure exceeds their estimates.Musk has derided social security as “thebiggest Ponzi schemeof all time”. As evidence of widespread fraud, Musk repeated a debunked theory,favored by Trump, that social security benefits are being paid to dead centenarians. The head of the agency hasrejectedthe premise. Democrats have warned that Trump and Musk were using false or exaggerated claims of fraud as a “prelude” to slash the program or privatize it, as many conservatives have long desired.After Musk’s comments aired, the White House swiftly issued a “fact check” insisting that Musk had only advocated for eliminating waste and highlighted several occasions in which Trump has vowed to protect Americans’ benefits.Republicans also rushed to clarify Musk’s comments. “Look, Elon Musk is a brainiac with an IQ that I cannot even fathom. He is not a master of artful language,” Mark Alford, a Republican representative of Missouri,said on CNN. “We are not going to eliminate social security, Medicare and Medicaid. That’s sheer nonsense.”It was a rare break with Musk, whom Republicans have been loath to cross, well aware that he not only has the president’s full support and ear but a fortune to squash any dissent within the ranks. During Trump’saddress to Congressearlier this month, Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation as the president heaped praise on his work. They publicly warn that Democrats oppose Musk’s fraud-and-waste removal efforts at their own political peril.Yet there are signs that Republicans are beginning to worry. Despite Trump’s close alliance with Musk, even he seemed to indicate it was time to rein him in. “We say the ‘scalpel’ rather than the ‘hatchet’,” the president wrote in a social media post.House Republicans have reportedlybeen advisednot to hold in-person town halls after several widely publicized confrontations with constituents furious over loss of government jobs and services. At the few meetings that did take place this weekend, constituentsconfrontedRepublican members of Congress with their concerns about possible cuts to social security.Republicans are weighingdeep cutsto entitlement programs as a way to offset the cost of extending Trump’s sweeping tax cuts aimed largely at the wealthy. Trump haspraisedthe House plan.‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutesRead more“The Republican party at this point has wrapped both arms around the third rail and is holding on as the electricity flows,” said Ben Wikler, the chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsin, wherea contest next monthwill provide an early test of the party’s anti-Musk strategy.On Thursday night, Wikler hosted a People v Musk grassroots event to discuss the billionaire’s impact on the 1 April state supreme court race, which will determine the balance of power between conservative and liberal justices on Wisconsin’s highest bench. Musk has spentmillions of dollarsthrough his America Pac in an effort to tip the scales in favor of Brad Schimel, a county judge and former Republican attorney general. Democrats are supporting Susan Crawford, a county judge and former attorney for Planned Parenthood.Wikler said Musk’s ascendancy in Washington – and his influence in the race – has turned liberal voters in the state from “concerned to panicked to outraged with the heat of 1,000 suns”.“If Susan Crawford wins this race, and Musk and Schimel lose,” he said, “then that will be a big bat signal in the sky to Democrats everywhere that fighting back is not only the right thing to do, it’s good politics.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationRepublicansDemocratsHouse of RepresentativesUS SenateUS CongressfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to do it successfullyAmy FlemingSun 16 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 16.45 EDTShareIknow I’m not alone as a parent when I admit I have often felt like an exasperated failure in trying to restrict what my children see online. There were the times they hacked their devices’ screen time settings, or managed to stumble into inappropriate content in spite of the controls, not to mention the ever inventive workarounds to access restricted sites. Worst of all is the ill will the rigmarole creates between us all. So when in the first minute of my conversation with digital parenting coach Elizabeth Milovidov, she says, “I think parents need to just kind of give themselves a hug, breathe and start over,” I feel so heard and comforted I could cry.“Parents are incredibly busy. They’re overwhelmed,” says Milovidov. “And then this whole idea of trying to lock things down is not easy. I remember trying to learn how to programme a VCR, and it was just like: oh my God.” And yet she herself, a parent of teens, seems so chill. She admits having watched far too much TV in the 70s, and she has turned out OK; she has a PhD and is an international consultant on tech and parenting.What emerges from speaking with Milovidov and other experts in this field is that what is often needed is not so much a nuts-and-bolts guide to the ever-updating technical side of parental controls as a pep talk on mindset, communication and what’s realistically possible.“There’s no way of sugar-coating it,” says Luke Savage, senior project officer atNSPCC Child Safety Online. “There are so many different elements that itiscomplicated and laborious. From the wifi router in the home to the device in a child’s hand, the computer console they’re playing on and the apps or games themselves – each one has individual settings and controls.” And even when parents have waded through it all, says Savage, they can’t “put their feet up and think: my work here is done. There are limitations to parental controls. They’re not perfect – children can bypass them if they’re clever enough.” These tools are a mere step in a far more nuanced process which, he says, “comes down to conversation and communication”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by model; Hraun/Getty ImagesStart talking about the internet early“It’s not about controlling our children, and it’s not about fear,” says Milovidov. “It is about empowering them to make smart decisions, and we do that when they are at a very young age. We are trying to teach them how to behave when we are not in the room, when we are not looking over their shoulder – that’s what digital guardianship is.”“The second they start to use technology, have those conversations in an appropriate manner and using language that’s suitable,” says Savage. Milovidov agrees: “What I always tell parents is that it doesn’t matter so much about the parental controls, as long as you’re talking to them, because even if you lock down that smartphone, that iPad, that gaming console, they are going to hear about [inappropriate content]. You’ve got to give them some strategies beforehand about what to do if somebody tries to show them something that they know is not appropriate.”There’s a sense, she says, that if your child does see something inappropriate, you’ve failed. “I would just tell parents to believe in themselves a bit more. It’s inevitable that they’re going to see something at some point.”Router firstThe most important place to start with safety restrictions, says Savage, “is the wifi router. That’s where you can block inappropriate websites and things like that.” There should be a step-by-step guide on your provider’s website. Although bear in mind that if a child’s phone has unlimited mobile data they can access at home, the router will be out of the equation.Get to know the platformsGenerally, in tech, instruction manuals are a thing of the past; you just switch it on and the rest is intuitive bliss, supposedly. But with parental controls, taking a few minutes to read the guidance will make it a less seat-of-the-pants situation. (I recommend, with bitter hindsight, doing this before even introducing a new digital device or platform – any online space for socialising, gaming or streaming – into the family.) Milovidov says that there is usually good information on the websites for individual platforms, “including screenshots showing you step by step how to do some of the harder stuff”. The non-profit organisation Internet Matters has all sorts ofguides to parental controlson its site. “They have great set-up tools for anything – TikTok, Roblox, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, all of the games.”Check settings regularlyThe NSPCC advises going back in at regular intervals. For a start, settings can be tampered with. “Let’s be honest – a child might think: ‘I can bypass parental controls.’” This is where that communication comes in: a child is more likely to respect the rules, “if they understand why you’re using certain settings, and there’s a suggestion that things will change as they get older, as happens in the real world.” But as with the real world, pushing boundaries is just what children do. “They can search for ‘how do I bypass my parental filter?’”There’s also the issue that platforms often change and update their parental settings, says Savage, “so the parent might need to check on a semi-regular basis to make sure that the settings are still as they were”. Updates tend to be for the better, he adds, but sometimes this means there are new options that you need to decide whether or not to activate.Finally, there’s the fact that children get older. “That setting from when they were five years old probably isn’t relevant when they’re 12.”Rethink screen timeScreen time is less of a safety issue. “A child could be online for five minutes and experience harm,” says Savage. “We really push this conversation and thought process among parents of ‘screen time versus screen usage’.” As children move on to secondary school, much of their homework is online and managed through apps, as is communicating with friends. “So actually, when you’re talking about screen time, a lot of it might be things they have to be doing, rather than endlessly scrolling on a social media site, for example.”View image in fullscreenNot all screen time is bad.Photograph: Posed by models; Pekic/Getty ImagesMilovidov suggests considering five criteria if you’re worried about screen time. Are they eating well? Are they sleeping well? Are they doing well in school? Are they doing well with you – treating you, the parents and caregivers, well? And how are they interacting with friends? “If the answer to all of those things is, ‘Yeah, they’re doing pretty good,’ you really don’t have a screen issue.” You might be angry because they’re not coming when you call them to dinner and they want to play Fortnite or Roblox a little bit longer, but, she says: “I always tell parents: that’s normal. That’s like me watching Bridgerton:don’t bother me right now. Not all screen time is bad. I’ve been doing this for 15 years, telling people to look at the content of what they’re doing. If my 17-year-old is sitting there studying Spanish online, I am not going to lose my mind. But if he’s playing Call of Duty for hours on end, I’m going to be like: ‘Dude, what are you doing?’”Be a good role modelIf your child sees you on your phone constantly, they might think it’s one rule for them and another one for you, Savage points out. “If you can start to use wellbeing and screen-time-limiting tools yourself, and your child sees that, then it’s going to have an impact.” So if you can set up family rules, as opposed to child rules, then you should start to see “that the child thinks: ‘OK, this isn’t just an attack on me and my online world. This is for the good of all of us as a family.’”Ekaterina Hertog, associate professor of AI and society at the University of Oxford, has found in her research interviews with young people that “monitoring is often very top-down. And sometimes that approach can be harmful, because it can be perceived by young people as: ‘My parents don’t trust me – I haven’t been doing anything wrong, and I explain it to them, but they don’t listen.’” This, she says, can create additional risks, “where young people try to go around those restrictions. When they get into trouble, they might be really reluctant to go to parents and tell them, ‘I went on that website and saw this really disturbing video,’ because they were not allowed.’”“We’re creating a lot of fear,” says Milovidov. “Yes, there are risks online, but we cannot live in fear. Social media, games, messaging apps, AI, connected homes – they all come with their own set of risks. Whether it’s privacy, cyberbullying, misinformation, whatever, there are ways to limit the risk. But bans don’t always work.”She can’t stress enough how engaging and talking is the number one priority. “You’ve got to have a relationship with them where they’re going to open up to you and let you know what happened at school. Sometimes I’m telling my boys how to be an upstander, not just a bystander.” This means that when they see bullying, or someone sends them something offensive online, they know how to intervene, “but not become a target themselves. Usually, humour is one of the best tools that a kid can have to get out.”When they break the rulesYoung people are always going to get around parental controls, says Milovidov. “It still happens in my house. They are going to test you.” It might feel like the last straw; time to remove any internet fun once and for all. Her advice is to think of it as if they were breaking real-life rules. “Whether it’s alcohol or inviting somebody over that shouldn’t be over, we don’t just lose it and ban everything for ever and ever. We ground them or there are other consequences.”View image in fullscreenAsk them why they need to get around your rules.Photograph: Posed by model; Nazar Abbas Photography/Getty ImagesIt pays to ask them why they need to get around these rules. How can we adjust? Is it that you need a little bit more time to play? Is it that you feel like you’re missing out with your friends? “Ask them to help you figure out a solution. You don’t want them to keep breaking your rules, because they’re breaking your trust. It’s about helping them understand why those limits are there. And it’s not just ‘because we said so’; you’re trying to teach them to be digitally responsible and not just digitally restricted.”When her son was younger, he wanted to be able to chat with friends while he was gaming, Milovidov says. At first, “I was like, no, no, no, no, no. And we went through each of the features together, and he’s like, ‘OK, no, I don’t need that, and I don’t need this filter.’ And he himself kind of self-censored. It was literally ticking a box of chatting with only his friends, not with everyone in the world. And I was like: ‘Oh my gosh, well, of course you can do that.’”It’s not that parents always have to acquiesce to young people’s point of view, says Hertog,but “just even having a conversation about it, feeling heard and understood … This communication could help parents to build up their young people to make good choices when they’re adults.” It’s similar to how we try to instil healthy eating. “Many children crave junk, so parents have conversations and hopefully manage some kind of compromise diet that’s more healthy than not. But the parental control technology encourages, or makes it easier, for parents to just be cops.”Arrange alternative activitiesOne of the best ways to create a healthy balance is to give children chances to experience how good it feels to be active and social in the real world. Take them on outings, offer them alternative activities. “When my boys were younger,” says Milovidov, “it was setting up play dates. Otherwise they will all want to be on devices, because it’s exciting, it’s cool stuff.”Don’t rush to judge their content“It feels so difficult in the beginning – I won’t sayunsavoury –to let all this tech into your life,” says Milovidov. She often hears parents despair that their children want to watch YouTubers playing video games. “They get so upset and they say, my child is not even playing the damn game. He’s sitting there watching somebody else on YouTube.” She laughs and tells them: “‘You do the same thing when you’re watching the Super Bowl or Wimbledon – you are watching somebody else play.’ And they’re like: ‘Oh, wow. I didn’t think of it that way.’ If you’re watching a cooking show, you’re not cooking. You’re getting tips. You’re learning how to do something different. And that’s what they do. They are learning.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyChildrenInternet safetyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite moving to a standing desk and multiple rounds of tedious physio, I am no longer able to use my right arm without mind-bending pain, which obliterates any chance of creative focus for sustained periods.The last year in particular has felt like a tortured battle against diminished cognitive functioning and brain fog, the result of my steady use of ineffectual anti-inflammatories. I’ve never done so little work in my life, nor had so much time on my hands. I am now armed with MRI scans that show a ruptured shoulder tendon, three herniated neck discs which are compressing the nerves running down my arm – and NHS surgery dates to fight my malingering guilt.In order to cope, I’ve learned to cultivate curiosity, a great source of distraction, which I frequently practise through the art of the urban walk. I leave the house, open to where adventure might take me… because you never know. Last week I ended up shuffle dancing to an excellent DJ at theCamden Assemblypub in the middle of the afternoon.Two months ago, I left the house for what I thought would be a stop in a museum, but found myself instead in a store looking for a charger for my iPhone. While standing there, I explained to an empathetic young sales assistant that I am a benched writer, that my right arm has been temporarily disabled and asked jokingly whether he had a gadget that would enable me to get food into my mouth with my left hand, without stabbing myself in the eye with a fork.When he asked if I’d like to try a ‘mixed-reality headset’, I looked clueless. He explained they were used for multimedia experiences such as watching films and gaming that you view on virtual screens. He suggested that the eye tracking, coupled with voice control in the accessibility features, could put me back in action.Next moment I am seated in the demonstration area wearing a pair of thick and heavy glass goggles. After a quick set up, a little green dot hovers in the air. I tap my thumb and finger together and the familiar group of app icons appear in a transparent visual overlay. The pixelation of the graphics renders the icons more distinct than the chair in front of me. The eye tracking is the most surprising. All I need do is look at the app I wish to launch, tap my finger and thumb gently together and the program opens. I can move multiple screens closer or further away from me, like furniture in the room.I look at the app I wish to launch, tap my finger and thumb gently together and the program opensI try other programs, open photos and expand them to lifesize. I watch immersive videos where dinosaurs appear as real as any fully blown nightmare, except they’re kind of adorable and check me out in the same way I keep gaping at them. I recall a parenting moment when my son was a toddler and was struggling to work out whether or not his stuffed animals were real. He was relieved to be told that, despite the stuffed replica, there was no such thing as a Gruffalo. Once he understood it was an optical trick, he didn’t have to ask the difference between real and pretend again.Navigating my way around different programs feels a bit like learning to get my balance on a bicycle. I grow disoriented. The speed of movement requires constant adaptation to spatial and visual cues. I begin to relax. I even reach out and interact with digital objects – a butterfly lands on my finger. I find myself reacting with the same sort of wonder that I experience in the real world.And then the denouement. I am shown a little dial on the side of the goggle that allows me to control how much reality I want to stay immersed in. The real room disappears, leaving me surrounded by a mountain scene. I gasp in amazement. Its spatial depth, the light and shadow, render the scene so viscerally vivid I feel the space around me. Even though I know it is not real – and that distinction is clear – I experience a mood shift as if it were. It’s a bit like going into the tube at Piccadilly Circus and surfacing at the next stop to find yourself on a beach in the Bahamas.If the possibilities in these immersive spaces sound slightly terrifying, think about the historical adaptations of neural cognition and spatial awareness we have made as a species and the consequences for cultural and scientific progress. Take the visual arts at the time of the Renaissance, the radical shift of spatial perspective from two dimensions to three in painting, or how physics evolved because we were able to imagine the invisible behaviour of the universe not available to the human eye.In a matter of minutes, I was moving in and out of programs with ease; using my eyes and hands, my arm relaxed with no nerve pain firing. I view software that shows breakthroughs in medical training, immersive experiences that can be used in educational environments, in art, architecture and design. Watching it, I found myself overwhelmed with tears at the thought I may be able to work in the months leading up to surgery and during rehabilitation.Until my thoughts moved to my next dilemma. How was I going to break the news to my husband? Thirty years of marriage and the rule has always been, we consult with each other on purchases over £100. How was I to explain to him, over the phone, the profound hope that has just descended on me? The shift in my mood, the difference in vision I’d had for the next year of my life? I felt like someone had given me a smart drug, a magic cure for brain fog. In fact, I’d trade painkillers for the goggles, anytime.There was only one answer. I’d have to bring them home so he could try them himself. I snap a picture of the unboxed purchase and texted him with the message, “DO NOT HAVE A HEART ATTACK, I CAN RETURN THEM”. He texts back immediately, “I AM HAVING A HEART ATTACK”. I leave the store with profound creative thoughts and the new virtual reality goggles, carrying the bag with my left arm. I get on a bus going the wrong direction, not picking up the visual clues for another 10 stops.In minutes I was navigating programs with ease using my eyes and hands, my arm relaxed with no nerve pain firingThe negotiations once I make it home go on long into the night. We spar over reviews. He concedes there is a consensus that they are comparatively the best in VR headsets, but it’s onlyvirtualreality. I say that is like arguing a smartphone is only a phone. He points out even the influencers and early adopters are predicting market failure because the price is so grossly prohibitive (from £3,499). Why don’t I wait until the price comes down? I point out that waiting defeats the purpose, which is to enable me to work and help me mentally survive the next year. He’s convinced. He gets it and is actually relieved for me. Moved even. The goggles stay.After a couple of daysof coaching on the accessibility features, I am able to block any gesture from my right arm, forcing me to make the break in the part of my brain that still wants to steer with the right side. It accelerates my learning to go hands-free on my other devices. And it’s a good thing because I can only use the goggles for a couple of hours a day before my neck spasms with the weight. But I’ve learned a hack for that, by laying down so my face acts as a table of sorts.Though I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing the bug eyes in public, I have to admit, after getting through the panic attacks I experienced after taking them off – the result of physical disorientation and fear of their seductive allure – I am beginning to feel at ease with my new hip identity.This despite the immense amount of ridicule and sceptical concern directed my way from friends and family alike. I haven’t been the target of this much piling on since getting busted after trying a joint as a teenager. Am I in danger of letting go of the struggle to be human in a real world? Watch this space.

Now, electronic banking is seen as a potential threat to national securitySun 16 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn 2018 a former deputy governor of Sweden’s central bank predicted that by 2025 the country would probably be cashless.Seven years on, that prediction has turned out to be pretty much true. Just one in 10 purchases are made with cash, and card is the most common form of payment, followed by the Swedish mobile payment system Swish, launched by six banks in 2012 and now ubiquitous. Other mobile phone payment services are also growing quickly.In fact, according to the central bank’s annual payments report, published this month, Sweden and Norway have the lowest amount of cash in circulation, as a percentage of GDP, in the world.But in the context of today, with war in Europe, unpredictability in the US and the fear ofRussian hybrid attacksalmost a part of daily life in Sweden, life without cash is not proving the utopia that perhaps it once promised to be.Such is the perceived severity of the situation that the authorities are trying to encourage citizens to keep and use cash in the name of civil defence. In November, the defence ministry sent every home a brochure entitledIf Crisis or War Comes, advising people to use cash regularly and keep a minimum of a week’s supply in various denominations to “strengthen preparedness”.In its report, the central bank says: “Measures need to be taken to strengthen preparedness and reduce exclusion so that everyone can pay, even in the event of crisis or war.” For years, it says, efficiency has been the priority for payments, but now safety and accessibility “are at least as important”.In December the government published the findings of an inquiry that proposed that some public and private agents should be required to accept cash – a recommendation that the central bank says the authorities should implement.Sweden and Norway rethink cashless society plans over Russia security fearsRead moreIn recent years the central bank has been working on its own digital currency, the “e-krona”, as cash declines. But the project ended a couple of years ago, and the bank is now focused on monitoring the global development of digital currencies.Sweden is not the only Nordic country backpedalling on plans for a cashless society. Last year Norway, which has a popular equivalent to Swish called Vipps MobilePay, brought in legislation that means retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they will not accept cash. The government has also recommended that citizens “keep some cash on hand due to the vulnerabilities of digital payment solutions to cyber-attacks”.Norway’s former justice and emergencies minister Emilie Mehl put it in clear terms: “If no one pays with cash and no one accepts cash, cash will no longer be a real emergency solution once the crisis is upon us.”Ultimately, when it comes to emergency planning, the world’s two most cashless societies are still banking on cash.Miranda Bryant is the Guardian’s Nordic correspondentExplore more on these topicsE-commerceThe ObserverSwedenContactless paymentsBanks and building societiesInternetEuropeConsumer affairsanalysisShareReuse this content"

But you do still need expertiseJohn NaughtonAI is so good at writing software that one father asked it to organise his kids’ school lunches. But that doesn’t mean it’s taking overSun 16 Mar 2025 01.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 11.20 EDTShareWay back in 2023, Andrej Karpathy, an eminent AI guru, made waves with a striking claim that “the hottest new programming language is English”. This was because the advent of large language models (LLMs) meant that from now on humans would not have to learn arcane programming languages in order to tell computers what to do. Henceforth, they could speak to machines like the Duke of Devonshire spoke to his gardener, and the machines would do their bidding.Ever since LLMs emerged, programmers have been early adopters, using them as unpaid assistants (or “co-pilots”) and finding them useful up to a point – but always with the proviso that, like interns, they make mistakes, and you need to have real programming expertise to spot those.Recently, though, Karpathy stirred the pot by doubling down on his original vision. “There’s a new kind of coding,”he announced, “I call ‘vibe coding’, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs … are getting too good.“When I get error messages I just copy [and] paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it … I’m building a project or web app, but it’s not really coding – I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.”Kevin Roose, a notedNew York Timestech columnist, seems to have been energised by Karpathy’s endorsement of the technology. “I am not a coder,”he burbled. “I can’t write a single line of Python, JavaScript or C++ … And yet, for the past several months, I’ve been coding up a storm.”At the centre of this little storm was LunchBox Buddy, an app his AI co-pilot had created that analysed the contents of his fridge and helped him decide what to pack for his son’s school lunch. Roose was touchingly delighted with this creation, but Gary Marcus, an AI expert who specialises in raining on AI boosters’ parades, was distinctly unimpressed. “Roose’s idea of recipe-from-photo is not original,”he wrote, “and the code for it already exists; the systems he is using presumably trained on that code. It is seriously negligent that Roose seems not to have even asked that question.” TheNYTtech columnist was thrilled by regurgitation, not creativity, Marcus said.Will this make programmers redundant? What we are already learning from software co-pilots suggests the answer is noAs it happens, this wasn’t the first time Roose had been unduly impressed by an AI. Way back in February 2023, he confessed to being “deeply unsettled” by a conversation he’d had with a Microsoft chatbot that had declared its love for him, “then tried to convince me that I was unhappy in my marriage, and that I should leave my wife and be with it instead”. The poor chap was so rattled that he “had trouble sleeping afterward” but, alas, does not record what his wife made of it.The trouble with this nonsense is that it diverts us from thinking what an AI-influenced future might really be like. The fact that LLMs display an unexpected talent for “writing” software provides us with a useful way of assessing artificial intelligence’s potential for human augmentation (which, after all, is what technology should be for). From the outset, programmers have been intrigued by the technology and have actively been exploring the possibilities of using the tech as a co-creator of software (the co-pilot model). In the process they have been unearthing the pluses and minuses of such a partnership, and also exploring the ways in which human skills and abilities remain relevant or even essential. We should be paying attention to what they have been learning in that process.A leading light in this area isSimon Willison, an uber-geek who has been thinking and experimenting with LLMs ever since their appearance, and has become an indispensable guide for informed analysis of the technology. He has been working with AI co-pilots for ever, and his website is a mine of insights on what he has learned on the way. Hisdetailed guideto how he uses LLMs to help him write code should be required reading for anyone seeking to use the technology as a way of augmenting their own capabilities. And he regularly comes up with fresh perspectives on some of the tired tropes that litter the discourse about AI at the moment.Why is this relevant? Well, by any standards, programming is an elite trade. It is being directly affected by AI, as many other elite professions will be. But will it make programmers redundant? What we are already learning from software co-pilots suggests that the answer is no. It is simply the end of programming as we knew it. As Tim O’Reilly, the veteran observer of the technology industry,puts it, AI will not replace programmers, but it will transform their jobs. The same is likely to be true of many other elite trades – whether they speak English or not.What I’ve been readingBully for youAndrew Sullivan’sreflectionson Trump’s address to both houses of Congress this month.A little too sunnyA fine pieceby Andrew Brown on his Substack challenging the “Whiggish” optimism of celebrated AI guru Dario Amodei.Virginia and the BloomsJames Heffernan’ssharp essayanalysing Woolf’s tortured ambivalence about Joyce’sUlysses.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The networkerSoftwareProgrammingComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been reviewingmattressesfor about four years and suffering from brokensleepfor three times as long. The right mattress can markedly improve sleep quality, but switching between them so regularly seemed to feed my insomnia. Then I met the Otty Original Hybrid and I was blissfully dead to the world.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Original Hybrid is the flagship “bed-in-a-box” mattress from UK company OttySleep. It combines thousands of pocket springs with multiple layers of memory foam – some soft, some thumpingly firm – to offer robust ergonomic support without sacrificing comfort. At less than £680 for a double, it’s among the cheapest bed-in-a-box hybrids (meaning a combination of memory foam and springs) you can buy, and after testing several I’m confident that it’s the best buy.The Otty is one of only two mattresses that Itested– along with the more expensiveSimba Hybrid Pro– that resulted in an excellent sleep from night one. After weeks of marvellous kip, a mattress-scoring family session and rigorous lab-style tests later, it replaced the Simba as the mattress I was most reluctant to give up. Here, I explain why.View at OttyHow I testedView image in fullscreenDumbbell weights helped me measure any sinkage of the mattress.Photograph: Jane HoskynI slept on a double Otty Original Hybrid for several weeks, alongside my husband, on our robust slatted wooden bed base. As with all the mattresses I tested, I tracked the Otty’s impact on our sleep quality and other factors, such as body aches, night sweats and disturbances from tossing and turning. I also ran tests to measure factors including sinkage and heat retention, and I enlisted the help of my locally based family to assess its firmness, comfort and value for money.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreen‘At the firmer end of medium firm.’Photograph: Jane HoskynView at OttyThe Original Hybrid is one of Otty’s slate of nine mattresses, all but two of which are hybrids. As with all hybrid mattresses, it combines pocket springs with various densities of foam to strike a balance of support (mainly from springs) and cushioning (mainly from foam). Topping off these layers is a soft cover that you can unzip and machine wash.Prices for the Original Hybrid start at £499.99 for a single and rise to £874.99 for an emperor size (200 x 200cm), with a double costing £674.99 (a double Simba Hybrid Pro is £1,149, although it is on offer for £942.18). Indeed, none of Otty’s mattresses is wildly expensive. The cheapestAura Hybridcosts £474.99 for a double, while the priciest hybrid double is thePure+ Hybrid 4000(£874.99).The Otty was delivered vacuum-shrunk and encased in metres of sturdy plastic to stop it from expandingAt 25cm deep and with six layers, there’s less of the Otty than the 28cm eight-layer Simba Hybrid Pro. Its 2,000 spring count lands midway between the Simba (which has nearly 5,000) and the budget Ikea Valevåg (fewer than 300), although the Otty’s springs are particularly tall at 16cm.The Otty also includes a couple of layers of high-density foam to enhance the support from the springs. Its largest foam layer is a dense base for support and durability, and there’s another robust layer just above the springs to limit bounce and improve motion isolation. Other memory foam layers include a heat-regulating layer below the washable cover, which I found gave the mattress a lovely breathable feel.I’m obsessed with finding the perfect pillow. These six favourites prove there’s one for every sleeperRead moreOtty describes the Original Hybrid as “medium firm”, but that term is a movable feast so I used a set of weights to find out where it really ranked. During my first month of testing, it sank a maximum of 25mm under 7.5kg of weight – closer to the firmest mattress I’ve tested (theOrigin Hybrid Pro, which sank 18mm) than the softest (theEve Wunderflip Hybrid, 40mm). According to that, and the impressions of my family, the Hybrid Pro is at the firmer end of medium firm. All memory foam softens over time, however, so you should rotate the mattress from head to toe once a month to avoid indentations where you sleep. You’re not supposed to flip the mattress.As with all bed-in-a-box mattress companies and their lack of showrooms, you can’t try the Original Hybrid before you buy it. But if it doesn’t hit the spot for you, you have 100 nights to sleep on it (using sheets to protect it) before deciding whether to keep it for good. During that time, Otty will collect it for free and give you a full refund. I tried this service five years ago with an Otty I’d bought, and it worked as promised, no questions asked.You also get a 10-year guarantee that covers manufacturing defects but excludes damage you may have caused by “standing on or jumping on the mattress”. How Otty would know you’d done this, I’m not sure. It makes me wonder about the solidity and durability of a mattress if you’re banned from standing on it, but this is a common warranty condition for hybrids.SpecificationsType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 8/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first 12 months, then every three monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPUR- and Europur-approved for environmental standardsDeliveryView image in fullscreenOtty charges £10 for delivery to a room of your choice.Photograph: Jane HoskynAs with all the mattresses I’ve tested for the Filter, the Otty was packaged and delivered in bed-in-a-box fashion. That means it’s vacuum-shrunk by machines in the factory, encased in metres of sturdy plastic to keep it from expanding, and then delivered to your home in a big cardboard box.Delivery of all my test mattresses was a near-identical experience. The Otty, like most, was handled by third-party couriers (ArrowXL in this case; only the Ikea Valevåg was delivered by a manufacturer-branded team) and took less than a week. I had to be at home, but I was kept fully in the loop by text alerts from Otty the day before and of delivery, with a pleasingly tight two-hour window and a link to track the driver on a map.Ottycharges £10to deliver your mattress to a room of your choice, but I plumped for having it left in the hallway. I then needed my husband’s help to remove the frankly insane amount of packaging (standard for bed-in-a-box mattresses, sadly). Otty does make it easier than most, though, with a special plastic-slicing tool that helps avoid nicking the mattress.I wouldn’t sleep on the expanding Original Hybrid after a few hours as Otty says is possible – it just won’t be comfortable – but ours had fully expanded after about a day and a half. This was faster than the more sumptuous Simba and slower than the cheaper pocket-sprung Ikea Valevåg, which suggests that a higher memory foam content requires a longer expansion time.What we loveView image in fullscreenEven the cat was a fan of the Original Hybrid.Photograph: Jane HoskynSleep doesn’t always come easily to me – I’ve been known to need two baths and several bowls of soup to help me nod off – but the Otty worked like a sleeping pill in mattress form. The sleep tracker on my smartwatch also revealed that I woke up briefly in the night (microarousals) less often than usual. I put this down to the Otty’s outstanding balance of ergonomic support, cushioning and breathability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

They rated it as less firm than I did, putting it at 8/10 – near the middle of the pool for mattress firmness. For overall comfort, however, they ranked it the best, with an average score of 8.3/10.“Can we have this one?” asked my sister, noting that the Otty is surprisingly light and manoeuvrable for such a robust mattress, and would be relatively easy to transport across town to her house. Having designated myself lead tester, I had to put my foot down. The Otty was ours, at least until testing was over and it was collected for charity.My husband, Alan, and I slept on it for two months and both found its supportiveness to be a relief after some more challengingly soft and inconsistent sleeping surfaces. It’s not too firm for comfort, though. As a petite side sleeper, I need a bit of cushioning to accommodate my shoulders and hips, and I get lower back pain on very firm mattresses – but this didn’t happen with the Otty.View image in fullscreenThe mattress’s foam layers absorb movement beautifully.Photograph: Jane HoskynIts motion isolation is also excellent. Sharing my bouncy old sprung mattress with a fidgety sleeper was less fun than it sounds because the springs seemed to amplify his (and my) tossing and turning. The Otty doesn’t completely lack bounce, especially on my bed’s slatted base, but its foam layers absorb movement beautifully to help me sleep in peace.A big downside of memory foam is that it can trap heat, but I don’t find this to be true for the Original Hybrid – at least not any more. A previous iteration of the Otty Hybrid, which I tried in 2019, felt … clingy. There was no breathing space between the fabric and my skin. Today’s Otty Original Hybrid rectifies this with a cosy-but-cooling feel. Asked for their impressions of its breathability, my family awarded 8.3/10: less airy than the pocket-sprung Ikea Valevåg, but more than the Simba.I’ve yet to try it out in summer, but my lab tests suggested that the Otty works well to stop you from overheating at night.Using a heat pad, a thermometer and my husband’s bottom, I discovered that the Otty cooled down faster than rivals that contain more foam, including the Simba and the Eve Wunderflip Hybrid.Another gold star for the Otty was its snug fit for my fitted sheets. At 25cm deep, it’s not a thin mattress, but it’s slim enough for a secure fit. As a fan of a perfectly flat cotton sleep surface, I regard this as an absolute must. The 28cm-deep Simba is a tighter squeeze, and the 31cm Origin Hybrid Pro is so big you can’t use standard-depth fitted sheets.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreenEdge and corner support could be much improved.Photograph: Jane HoskynThere’s little I don’t love about the Otty. The only other mattress that felt as instantly comfortable, the Simba Hybrid Pro, costs much more and didn’t seem to retain its consistent supportiveness as well as the Otty over the months of testing.Otty’s foam is made in line with EU legislation to minimise any health and environmental impactSome people will find the Otty too firm for comfort, though. My 84-year-old dad was alone in our testing panel to find the Otty too hard on his joints – a sensation I experienced with the firmer Origin Hybrid Pro. Memory foam softens over the months, however, and I noticed a slight sinkage in the sleeping surface over my two months of testing. The sinkage was less pronounced than with the Simba, and it didn’t stop me from sleeping and waking in comfort.The Otty betrays its relative cheapness in a few ways. Edge and corner support could be much improved. “Do the springs even go right to the edge?” asked Alan, alarmed by the way the mattress flattened beneath him when he sat on the side.Its relatively nimble weight also gives the Otty a less extravagant feel than the Simba, Eve or Origin, and may point to more limited durability. Two months is long enough for me to test its impact on my sleep but it’s too short to judge its stamina, and I suspect that its less sophisticated construction will see the Otty retain its consistent supportiveness for less time than its more expensive rivals. Bear that in mind if you’re trying to spend more wisely by investing in homewares that will last many years.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenEvery foam batch is tested to ensure it’s non-toxic and hypoallergenic.Photograph: Jane HoskynThe metal springs and polyester fabric used in the Otty are easily and widely recycled, but memory foam is another matter. The memory foam used in mattresses is viscoelastic LRPu (low-resistance polyurethane foam) – polyurethane that’s been chemically treated to make it elastic and dense in various degrees – and its energy-intensive manufacture is more complex than its pronunciation. It is not biodegradable and, despite the best efforts of industry bodies, it’s hard to paint it as sustainable.To its credit, Otty has striven to make its mattresses as sustainable as possible given the materials used. All its foam is certified byEuropurandCertiPurand made in line with EU legislation to minimise any health and environmental impact. No ozone depleters, TDCPP, mercury or lead are used in manufacturing and every foam batch is tested to ensure it’s non-toxic and hypoallergenic.Otty runs a mattress recycling service, charging £40 (plus £20 for each additional one) to take away your old mattress and recycle it, whether it’s an Otty or not. This is cheaper than rivals, with Simba charging £50. I haven’t tested Otty’s recycling service and can’t confirm what actually happens to collected mattresses, but the company says “they are responsibly recycled, with materials like foam, fabric and metal springs being repurposed to minimise waste and protect the environment”.Otty Original Hybrid: Should I buy it?The Otty Original Hybrid is a comfortable and wonderfully supportive mattress that improved my sleep from the first night. It’s less heavy and less expensive than some rivals, but it outclassed them in my tests. It may prove to be less durable than them, but its 10-year warranty reassures me that it’s good for thousands of superb sleeps.View at OttyJane Hoskyn is a freelance consumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and‘testing’ coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Facebook’s director of global public policy needed to send talking points from her recent trip to oversee the tech giant’s bid to launch operations in Myanmar to her bossSheryl Sandberg. Then she would give birth to her first child.Wynn-Williams’s husband, a journalist called Tom, was livid but, as men tend to be in labour rooms, impotent. The doctor gently closed her laptop. “Please let me push send,” whimpered Sarah. “You should be pushing,” retorted the doctor with improbable timing. “But not ‘send’.”This incident typifies how, in this 400-page memoir of her seven years atFacebookfrom 2011 – as it mutated from niche social network to global power able to swing elections, target body-shamed teens with beauty products and monetise millions of humans’ hitherto private data – Wynn-Williams had become part of what reads like a diabolical cult run by emotionally stunted men babies, institutionally enabled sexual harassers and hypocritical virtue-signalling narcissists.The cult vibe of this birthing story is made stronger by Wynn-Williams channelling Sandberg’s 2013 bookLean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. She quotes Sandberg’s injunction to pregnant working women – “Don’t leave before you leave” – taking its implication to be that she should work right up to the point that the baby’s head emerges into this fallen world. It doesn’t occur to her thatLean Infeminism might serve as a fig leaf covering self-exploitation and soul-depleting workaholism.When the scales fall from Wynn-Williams’s eyes she realises there is nothing morally worthwhile in Zuckerberg’s initiativeA couple of pages earlier, Wynn-Williams writes like a wide-eyed convert: “It still feels exciting and important to spread this tool around the world and improve people’s lives.” An evidently clever former New Zealand diplomat, she was ideal fodder to help spread Facebook’s secular gospel, as her backstory reveals. After surviving a shark attack as a teenager, she resolved to spend her working life helping humanity. Upon witnessing how the nascent Facebook kept Kiwis connected in the aftermath of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, she believed that Mark Zuckerberg’s company could make a difference – but in a good way – to social bonds, and that she could be part of that utopian project.Her naive faith reminds me of what Jon Ronson wrote about inSo You’ve Been Publicly Shamed: at their inception both the internet and social media seemed, to some, unalloyed good things. It’s instructive for someone like me – who disdains social media and sees in tech giants the lucrative weaponising of hate masquerading as free speech, and the asphyxiation of democracy by the enabling of post-truth populists – to encounter such cockeyed optimism.The “tool” Wynn-Williams talks about is not Facebook per se, but Zuckerberg’s cherishedinternet.orgapp (which has operated under the name Free Basics since 2015), devised to deliver the internet to connectivity-deprived countries, such as Myanmar, as part of what sounds like a system upgrade of Britain’s oxymoronic imperial mission to civilise black and brown persons.What internet.org involves for countries that adopt it is a Facebook-controlled monopoly of access to the internet, whereby to get online at all you have to log in to a Facebook account. When the scales fall from Wynn-Williams’s eyes she realises there is nothing morally worthwhile in Zuckerberg’s initiative, nothing empowering to the most deprived of global citizens, but rather his tool involves “delivering a crap version of the internet to two-thirds of the world”.View image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg: ‘a tech-bro Henry VIII’.Photograph: Christian SinibaldiBut Facebook’s impact in the developing world proves worse than crap. In Myanmar, as Wynn-Williams recounts at the end of the book, Facebook facilitated the military junta topost hate speech, thereby fomenting sexual violence and attempted genocide of the country’s Muslim minority. “Myanmar,” she writes with a lapsed believer’s rue, “would have been a better place if Facebook had not arrived.” And what is true of Myanmar, you can’t help but reflect, applies globally.Before she was disabused, Wynn-Williams fawningly adored Sandberg, as the pair crisscrossed the globe in private jets, bringing the good news of Facebook to foreign leaders. “The tears streaming down her face,” Wynn-Williams writes unctuously as she reports on Sandberg’s meeting with Shinzo Abe to convince the then Japanese premier to allow politicians to use Facebook in political campaigning, “somehow make her even more impossibly lovely.”She approvingly quotes anotherLean Inmessage, that you should “bring your authentic self to work”. But what that means in Facebook reality becomes clear when, in her first performance review after giving birth, Wynn-Williams is told that co-workers are uneasy that her baby can be heard on business calls. The poor poppets. “Be smart and hire a Filipina nanny,” counsels Sandberg. Wynn-Williams does just that, but then something shocking happens. One day, Tom is checking the home camera when he notices a firefighter in their living room: the nanny has locked herself out and the baby inside the flat. But when Wynn-Williams later relates this disturbing event to colleagues, she feels as though she has made a faux pas – distracting them from their noble mission with personal guff. “The expectation of Facebook is that mothering is invisible,” she writes. Facebook cannot tolerate too much authenticity.The book’s title comes from F Scott Fitzgerald’sThe Great Gatsby: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness.” For Wynn-Williams, Zuckerberg’s “move fast and break things” philosophy is just such entitled carelessness, leaving Facebook staff and their customers to sweep up the wreckage. But the Facebook she describes is not run by careless people, not really, but rather by wittingly amoral ones who use technical genius and business acumen to profit from human vulnerability. For instance, she claims Facebook – nowMeta, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp – identified teenage girls who had deleted selfies on its platforms, and then supplied the data to companies to target them with ads for putatively tummy-flattening teas or beauty products.View image in fullscreenSarah Wynn-Williams.Photograph: Sarah Wynn-WilliamsWynn-Williams’s shtick, often presenting herself as the only conscience in the room, does wear thin. I tired of reading of how shocked she was at some Facebook policy, while continuing to spread its values worldwide. “I’m astounded at the role money plays in elections in the US,” she writes at one point, as the 2016 Trump campaign gears up with political ads and targeted misinformation from which Facebook massively profited. Are youreallyso naive? I wrote in the margin. “I’m also against exporting this value system. But Facebook is effectively bringing this in globally by stealth.” And you’re part of it! I wrote in the margin. If only she’d taken to heart the critical messages of, say, David Fincher’s movieThe Social Networkor Dave Eggers’s novelThe Circle, she might have leaned out earlier.And yet her memoir is valuable, not just as indictment of the Facebook cult but of bosses’ entitled behaviour that will resonate for many. She depicts Zuckerberg as a tech-bro Henry VIII, a thin-skinned angry child whose courtiers let win at the board game Settlers of Catan during flights on his private jet. She charges him with lying to Congress about the extent of Facebook’s compromises to woo China and allow it to operate there, suggesting that his company was developing technology and tools to meet Chinese requirements that would allow it to censor users’ content and access their data. He was, she claims, much more in cahoots with Xi Jinping’s authoritarian regime than he let on to US senators.Her memoir is valuable, not just as indictment of the Facebook cult but of bosses’ entitled behaviour that will resonate for manyOn another private jet, relates Wynn-Williams, Sandberg imperiously invited her to sleep in the same bed. Wynn-Williams declined, but thereafter worried that she had upset her boss by not yielding to a presumably sexual demand, which she depicts in the book as the ex-Facebook COO’s entitled modus operandi with several women subordinates.And then there’s what Joel Kaplan, currently Meta’s chief global affairs officer, allegedly did to Wynn-Williams at a boozy corporate shindig in 2017. She claimed that he called her “sultry” and rubbed his body against hers on the dancefloor. This wasn’t a one-off incident, she claims: indeed, there was a group at Facebook called Feminist Fight Club, whose members compared notes on such reportedly prevalent cases of sexual harassment by execs. An internal investigation cleared Kaplan of impropriety and soon after Wynn-Williams was fired for making misleading harassment allegations.Last week, Meta responded to this book, calling it “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”. The company has denounced its former employee, claiming that she was not a whistleblower but a disgruntled activist trying to sell books. Most likely she is both.Wynn-Williams notes that Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021. “But leopards don’t change their spots. The DNA of the company remains the same. And the more power they grab, the less responsible they become.” That culture of irresponsibility and carelessness should worry us more than ever, she suggests at the end of the book, as Zuckerberg’s Meta is at the forefront of artificial intelligence, a technology even more potentially calamitous than the one he dreamed up in his Harvard dorm a couple of decades ago.Careless People: A Story of Where I Used to Workby Sarah Wynn-Williams is published by Pan Macmillan (£22).

If crisis strikes, the government needs a strategy to protect us allSun 16 Mar 2025 08.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 16.13 EDTShareIhate to sound like aprepper, but I feel bound to confess that over the past month I’ve been stockpiling food. I think, if you can, you should do the same. I’ve put aside 25kg of rice, 15kg of dried chickpeas, 15kg of bread flour, 7kg of chapati flour, 5kg of oats, six litres of vegetable oil, a slab of tinned tomatoes, some nuts and dried fruit. This, with the vegetables we grow, represents about two months’ supply for our family.I hope the chances of having to use our stockpile are small. But if we no longer need this insurance, we can eat it. Strange as it may sound, I see this hoarding as pro-social. Building a reserve while food is abundant reduces demand in a crisis. Community stockpiling and resilience planning would be better still. But I’m not waiting.Researchingmy book Regenesis, I learned about the extraordinary reliance of food-importing nations on the US. Almost 60% of thecalories grown by farmerstake the form of wheat, rice, maize and soya beans. Asnations have polarisedinto super-exporters and super-importers, production for export has become highly concentrated in a handful of countries. The US isamong the biggest exportersofall four commodities.A deliberate effort to cut off the UK seems unlikely. But that’s not the issue. The issue is that even a modest interruption in supply, which Donald Trump’s antics render more likely, could trigger sudden global failure in the food system. Interruption risks include software outages, military attacks on the straits and canals through whichhuge volumes of food pass, and the collapse of one of the corporate food giants that have becometoo big to fail.Trump will also exacerbate environmental shocks. The gathering“whiplash effect”– moderate weather replaced by a cycle of droughts and floods – is one of the factors that could causesynchronised crop failurein key growing regions.Since 2015,a seriesofpapersin thescientific presshave warned that the global food system issuffering structural problemssimilar to those afflicting the global financial system before 2008. There has been arapid loss of diversity, redundancy and otherkey elements of systemic resilience. The food system showssigns of “flickering”: widening fluctuations in output values (such as commodity prices)that presage collapse. Governments were able to prevent financial collapse in 2008 by issuing future money. They cannot prevent food system collapse by issuing future food.Since then,the warningshaveonly intensified. Some governments have heeded them.China,Japan,SwitzerlandandNorwayinvest in stockpiles of grain. Food reserves not only insure against disaster but can be used as buffers to preventprices from surging.View image in fullscreenA Led By Donkeys billboard featuring Michael Gove in Stoke on Trent, England, 2021.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty ImagesWhen I asked the UK government whether it holds strategic food reserves, it blanked my question. When I pressed, it claimed “we don’t comment on matters that pertain to national security”. That’s a wretched excuse. Other governments keep their people informed on this issue, fostering trust and reassurance. Even Boris Johnson’s regimeresponded to my questionhonestly in 2020. The answer was “no” then, and I suspect it remains “no” today, which probably explains this ridiculous obfuscation.As the National Preparedness Commission, whichreported on UK food securitylast month, notes: “If an absence of policy is for fear of worrying the public, this is a risky strategy. The public needs to be engaged as part of preparation.” Its report reveals almost comical failures by successive governments either totake the issue seriouslyor to involve us in addressing it. They have slalomed round every opportunity to enhance the food system’s resilience. Rather than developing a security plan, the government vests blind faith in a commercial sector whose just-in-time logistics expose us to severe risk.Reserves are a necessary but not sufficient means of building resilience. While bearing in mind that food nationalism is not the same as food security (in some respects it’s the opposite, as global tradeprotects us from local harvest failure), here are some further steps the government could take.View image in fullscreenA second world war Dig for Victory leafletPhotograph: LH Images/AlamyThe UK produces plenty of grain, but far too little feeds people directly. You might be aware of thepreposterous cosmetic standardsthat supermarkets impose on fruit and vegetable growers. You might be less aware that mills and other processors impose even stricter standards. To give one example, we can make bread from a wide range of flours. But as a farmer explained to me, the mills demand “total consistency. Every loaf has to be the same, so every load of grain must fit the specs. They want a protein content of over 12%, a Hagberg falling number of over 300 and a water content of 15%. If we miss any of that, it’s disqualified as milling wheat and goes for animal feed instead, and we get a lower price. They don’t make concessions. They don’t accept suggestions.” Relaxing such standards could make much more food available for human consumption.To an even greater degree, so can reducing the animal products we eat. Globally, a plant-based dietrequires 76% less landthan the current average diet. Here, 85% of our farmland isused for feeding livestock. Even sheep, which most people imagine subsist only on grass, consumehundreds of thousands of tonnesof supplementary cereals and oilseeds.A government strategy to reduce livestock consumption could secure both food system resilience and ecological resilience, as ourremarkably unproductive uplandscould be rewilded. One good thing the government is doing is accelerating theapproval of alternatives.Precision fermentation, to give one example, could greatly enhance our protein production, radically reducing imports of both food and fertiliser.Replacing food imports does little for resilience if it means increasing fertiliser imports, on which theUK remains highly dependent. We should seek to maintain high yields with fewer inputs. If we understood soil better, we could rely more on biology (the fascinating interactionsbetween plants and microbes) and less on chemistry. There have beensome recent breakthroughs, but soil science remains woefully underfunded.Governments need to break up corporate monopolies: anti-trust laws should be strong and intellectual property rights should be weak. They should involve us in decision-making, asTaiwan’s has donewhen faced with crises. They should assume a duty to ensure everyone, including people in poverty, is well fed at all times. Currently, if crisis strikes you’re stuffed. Sorry, I mean starved.Our provisions are now boxed and stacked. Some of my friends and neighbours have followed suit. But we do this in the knowledge that individual action is never enough. No one is secure until everyone is secure, especially those in greatest need. My full shelves give me no satisfaction. It shouldn’t have to come to this.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionEmergency planningFood & drink industryFarmingTrade policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

According toPNC Bank, 78% are optimistic about prospects this year, near the 23-year high mark.

We’re told that mass deportations will squeeze an already tight labor market. Small businesses and non-profits that work on government-funded projects are facing cashflow shortages thanks to his freeze on payments, while vast numbers of government workers who use local small businesses for everything from dry cleaning to getting pizza are finding themselves unemployed.Economists are predictingthat our economy will contract – contract! – next quarter.Read the signs of Trump’s federal firings: AI is coming for private sector jobs tooRead moreThis all seems like bad news for a small business owner. And yet … optimism. Why?One reason could be that these surveys were taken before all this stuff happened. But I’m not sure I buy that theory because this assumes that we didn’t know what we were getting when Trump won the election. He’s always been quite clear about his plans to tariff, deport undocumented immigrants and cut federal spending. He’s doing exactly what he said he was going to do.You could argue that small business owners are simply naive and didn’t truly understand the implications of his policies. I’ve heard people raise this point and it’s a little offensive. Through the years I’ve met thousands of small business owners. The naive ones don’t stay in business very long. The small business owners who voted for Trump – and there were many – were fully aware of the economic implications that would be caused by his proposals. These are not stupid people.Business owners are also optimistic because in Trump they see someone like themselves: transactional and profit-drivenWe are just six weeks into his administration but my smartest clients don’t operate on that kind of timetable. They’re looking ahead months, even years. They’re making decisions and investments now that will affect their businesses in the future. They have to always be thinking ahead because they have people that rely on them – employees, customers, partners, suppliers – and if they’re not looking forward these people’s livelihoods would be in jeopardy. They understand that Trump’s policies will cause disruption. But they’re looking beyond just the short term. And the polls suggest they’re optimistic about what he’s doing.Business owners understand Trump. They like that he’s cutting costs, despite the disruptions, because they see the looming fiscal cliff ahead. They like that he’s fighting to lower tariffs by raising our own because so many have suffered the consequences of competing against foreign companies backed by their own governments. They, too, are anticipating him making permanent or at least extending many of the tax benefits from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Columbia’s students became national leaders in the anti-genocide movement, and theGaza solidarity encampmentthey established garnered international attention – including from the US Congress, which held hearings on so-called “campus antisemitism”.Trump’s cynical attempt to protect an allegedly vulnerable class of students came just after executive ordersbanningdiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs – initiatives whose prime directive has historically been to ensure equal opportunity for marginalized groups – within institutions that receive federal funding. In the first few months of his presidency, Trump has augmented the “Palestine exception” – that amorphous but consequential social limitation of the first amendment that enables suppression of pro-Palestinian/anti-Zionist speech – with an “Israel exception” from DEI prohibitions. In effect, the promotion of Israel’s national narrative not only remains exempt from the wholesale attack on DEI, but it also functions as a weapon used to attack people and communities previously protected.The ADL and the Heritage Foundation are helping to silence dissent in America | Ahmed MoorRead moreThe current blow to Columbia’s funding came after a culmination of administrative efforts to pander to Trump’s war on DEI, beginning with theremovalof Columbia athletics’ transgender inclusion policy from its website in early February, followed soon after with the altering ofDEI languageon a number of Columbia websites, and a directive to department chairs to “temporarily” remove any “DEI language” from departmental websites.Where did this cowardly compliance, this last-ditch effort at saving the university from federal funding cuts, get the school? Columbia’s leadership has transformed the institution into an international laughingstock, a rudderless ship, poorer in every way – from its balance sheet to its moral vision. And after more than a year of many powerful Zionists purposefully conflating the way that some Jewish studentsfeelunsafe on campus withactualdanger, we have now witnessed a Palestinian student,Mahmoud Khalil, literallybeing abductedfrom New York to a detention center across state bordersnotoriousfor its mistreatment of detainees.The ground for Trump’s attacks on Columbia has been well prepared by all manner of Zionist Jewish entities – with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) at the front, as usual. The ADL has come under sustainedcriticismin recent years for the ways it has used the halo effect of its origins as a civil rights organization to supportracist policing,surveil progressive groupsand cozy up to actual antisemites who happen to also be supporters of Israel.But the group has been joined by a range of swaggering actors: the newly emboldened Kahanist groupBetar Worldwide; Columbia’s own professor Shai Davidai, who hasterrorizednumerous Arab and Arab American students, includingMahmoud Khaliljust before his kidnapping; and Zionist Jewish alumni groups. All have conspired to gin up a topsy-turvy mythology of what they call a crisis of “campus antisemitism”, but which is really a reactionary crisis surrounding the increasing popularity of campus anti-Zionism.As a father and daughter who represent two generations of anti-Zionist Jewish scholars and activists – one of us a professor at University of Massachusetts Boston, and the other a graduate student at Columbia University – it seems manifest that we are witnessing a purposeful and devastating bait and switch. Every articulation of anti-Israel speech (or even the simplest affirmation of Palestinian human rights) gets recoded as dangerous antisemitic action.Columbia University now serves the Trumpist agenda of ‘free speech except Palestine’ and ‘free of DEI except Zionism’The “Israel exception” to DEI means that the university’s post-October 7 antisemitism taskforce, formed on the pretext of protecting Jews on campus, was never paired with an Islamophobia or anti-Arab taskforce, despite the fact that Arab and Muslim students have been continually subjected to doxing campaigns from far-right organizations such asCanary MissionandAccuracy in Media, and singled out in aWhatsApp groupcomprising faculty, administrators, students, alumni and parents seeking to persecute student activists and get them deported.The “Israel exception” means that the faculty member Gil Zussman remains on the taskforce even after it was exposed that he is part of the WhatsApp group actively putting student’s lives at risk. Meanwhile, the longtime pro-Palestinian Columbia law professor Katherine Franke was essentiallyforced outof her tenured position for what many saw as a relatively minor speech infraction.The “Israel exception” means that the antisemitism taskforce only concerns itself with certain kinds of Jews; anti-Zionist Jews do not register in the furrowed-brow rhetoric of university administrators, politicians or self-appointed Jewish community leaders, except as a problem to be eradicated. Columbia University is now at the vanguard of our political and cultural moment, serving the Trumpist agenda of “free speech except Palestine” and“free of DEI except Zionism”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhat is most significant in the focused dismantling of DEI protocols is how Jewishness and Zionism has been spared. Thebanned word listissued by the National Science Foundation includes terms from “disabled” to “transgender” to “racism”, but no censoring of anything having to do with Zionism, Israel or Jews. As civil rights gains having to do with race, gender, ability and sexuality arerolled back, it has become exceedingly clear that the animus is not against DEI protocols and protections per se: Zionist Jews will remain a specially protected class. This serves the Republican party in ways concerning foreign policy, the cultural wars and electoral politics, and stands as the culmination of over a year’s worth of moral panic over the “safety” of Jewish students on college campuses.The writer Lucien Baskin outlined this moral panicin an articlethat argues the current hysteria has roots in both liberal and rightwing premises. Baskin explains that for liberals, the putative antisemitism crisis is one more articulation of their understanding of racism as rooted in bad individual acts, rather than systemic injustice. On the right, the antisemitism hysteria is a Trojan horse for well-organized and well-funded attacks on American education at all levels – targeting libraries, secondary school curricula, and university teaching and publishing.The basic premise that influential Zionists have been promoting is that widespread pro-Palestinian activity on campuses across the country proves that US universities are essentially anti-Zionist institutions and that anti-Zionism is antisemitic. This promotion has happened as pro-Palestinian studentshave been doxedand had job offersrescinded, as three Palestinian studentswere shotin a hate crime in Vermont, and as pro-Palestinianprofessorshave been fired.The US has a legible history of antisemitism, but American antisemitism has never been a sustained systemic force in our history – like the way that anti-Black racism has been, for instance. There have been plenty of isolated antisemitic acts (up to and including lynching) and plenty of anti-Jewish thought and expression in the US. But by and large Jews have been remarkably safe in the United States. When Jews have faced sustained antisemitism there has almost always been a powerful white Christian man at the wheel, from Henry Ford to the radio preacher Charles Coughlin toDonald Trump.We are in a moment when many Jewish Americans and their rightwing allies have strategically weaponized the history of European antisemitism, and the more episodic American version, to prosecute a case against free speech and academic freedom. It is a deft trick that has been staged by powerful figures from the campus of Columbia University to the Oval Office, and one that is familiar to anyone who has readAmy Kaplan’s workon the Americanization of Zionism. Depicting Israelis as “invincible victims”, at once always under attack yet also preternaturally powerful, this social project of having the most cake and eating it too is turning out to be one of the most consequential political formations of our era.This is one of many reasons we have to pay attention to the current “campus antisemitism” crisis – because ultimately it is doing two major things at once: it is distracting us from the genocide and continued siege of Gaza, and it is obscuring the reality of relative safety for American Jews in favor of a hyped-up narrative of fraught vulnerability. This almost certainly will not – as the idiom puts it – be good for the Jews. As pawns in a larger game being run by Christian Zionists (who often happen to be white supremacists), the safety of American Jews, Zionist or not, is hardly the endgame.Jeff Melnick is a professor of American studies at UMass BostonJessie Lee Rubin is a PhD candidate in ethnomusicology at Columbia UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpAntisemitismIsraelPalestinian territoriesGazaUS constitution and civil libertiescommentShareReuse this content"

During a speech he gave at the National Conservatism conference in October 2021, vice-president JD Vance pinpointed American universities as “the enemy” while repeating a litany of increasingly familiar charges about their purported cultural elitism, radical-left ideological agenda, and incapacity to prepare students for the real needs of the labor market.More recently, Donald Trump has alsoendorsed plansto tax university endowments and abolish the Department of Education, which oversees both the federal Pell Grant system and most federally subsidized student loan programs, jointly accounting for about 40% of the country’s higher education revenues.Amongst the stated grounds for this hostility, one of the most frequent – but also perplexing – claims is that colleges and universities are “elite playgrounds”. This is of course one of the several ways in which the current Republican party has sought to rebrand itself as a champion of the interests and values of the working class, against the country’s purportedly progressive establishment.Yet the appeal to anti-elitist sentiment in the attack against higher education remains perplexing, for a few reasons. To begin with, both Trump and Vance are themselvesIvy-League graduatesotherwise deeply invested in preserving, rather than upending, the country’s established social hierarchies. The “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs specifically intended to broaden access to higher education institutions have, if anything, been the target of their mostvirulent attacks.It’s also confusing – and somewhat circular – that most of these attacks have focused on Ivy League colleges and universities, which do primarilyserve elitesbut are also responsible for a tiny fraction of the post-secondary education in the country at large. Their total undergraduate enrollment is currently at around 60,000, which is less than 0.5% of the overall undergraduate population in the United States.But there is a deeper reason why anti-elitism and hostility towards higher education are strange bedfellows. Higher education institutions have historically been among the most effective powerful engines of social mobility in the country. They are therefore naturalantidotesagainst the consolidation of what the founding fathers referred to as “artificial aristocracies founded on wealth and birth”.In advocating for the creation of a publicly funded university in the state of Virginia, for instance, Thomas Jefferson argued that “those talents which nature hath sown liberally among the poor as the rich” would thereby be “rendered by liberal education worthy to receive and able to guard the rights and liberties of their fellow citizens … without regard to wealth, birth, or other accidental conditions or circumstances”.The limits of Jefferson’s actual disregard for factors of “birth” in the target population he had in mind when advancing his vision for a publicly-funded higher education institution are evident in the fact the University of Virginia he contributed in creating initially only accepted white males, notwithstanding the fact the removal of the “wealth” barrier was in itself a significant achievement.Yet the same fundamental faith in the capacity of higher education to break down social barriers also underpinned the subsequent expansion of the United States’s higher education system to include various categories of individuals who had previously been excluded from it.Women’s colleges began in the first half of the 19th century and played adecisive rolein challenging the marginal position that women had historically occupied in American society, eventually leading to their inclusion in previously male-only colleges in the aftermath of the second world war. The same is true ofhistorically Black colleges and universitiesfor African Americans, and of the land-grant universities created between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries for multiple generations of immigrants of Catholic, Jewish and Asian descent.Contemporary empirical evidence confirms that US higher education institutions continue to function as powerful engines of social mobility: arecent studyby the Pew Charitable Trusts showed that adult children born to parents in the bottom quintile of the income distribution are about four times as likely to reach the top quintile by attending college.To be sure, there is also evidence that complicates the long-established narrative. Low-income students still attend highly selective colleges atmuch lower ratesthan their peers from richer families, and their enrollment at the mid-ranking institutions that are most effective at propelling them into higher income brackets has actually beendecliningover the past two decades.But, if that is the case, the answer should bemore, not less, investment in expanding access to higher education. The fact that the incoming administration is intent on gutting not only “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs but also the federally funded Pell Grant and student loan programs shows that it doesn’t really intend to contrast the persistent elements of “elitism” in the country’s higher education system.On the contrary, to the extent that college education has become one of the mostpowerful predictorsof electoral support for the Democratic party, the goal is more likely to be a further entrenchment of the deep socioeconomic divisions that colleges and universities have historically served to undermine but the current Republican party thrives on.Seeing past this ruse requires separating legitimate concerns aboutelite powerin the contemporary United States from the attack against the very institutions that are most likely to do something about it.Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti is executive director of the Moynihan Center and full professor of political science at the City College of New York.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS universitiesUS politicsDonald TrumpJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

This is my world: welcome!Nell FrizzellWhile writing my book, I asked on social media for stories from parents suffering extreme sleep deprivation. It was hilarious – and frighteningSun 16 Mar 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 17.32 EDTShareSleep is a feminist issue. Or should I say, lack of sleep is a feminist issue. During a particularly thickly cut bout of tiredness, when my son was a newborn, I became so convinced that my tiny, milk-stained baby had rolled out of my arms and somehow, unfathomably out of the room, into the night outside that I started crawling along the floor of our hallway, in the dark, sobbing. The fact that the boy couldn’t yet roll over, was in his cot, and the door was closed, while my partner snored like a mechanical digger beside him, could not penetrate the exhausted fug of terror that had enveloped me after weeks, months of broken, fluttering, barely snatched rest.Whether it’s waking up every 45 minutes to feed a screaming baby, making shopping lists while roasting under the duvet in an insomniac hormonal flush, staying up past midnight to clean the house once your children are in bed, or setting the alarm for 4.45am so you can get your elderly mother to the toilet before she has an accident; the night shift of unpaid, unrecognised and uncelebrated domestic labour is still predominantly undertaken by women. While the Office for National Statisticsfound that in 2022, almost 4.9 million (56%) night-time workers were male and almost 3.9 million (44%) were female, this does not by any means mean that women are getting moresleep. I very much doubt that it was a breastfeeding woman who smugly declared Friday 14 March as World Sleep Day.After becoming a parent, I slipped into a twilight zone of sleeplessness in which I felt my eyes were coated in sand, my bones seemed to creak against each other, and my tongue had the consistency and flavour of an old pub carpet tile. I stared into the halogen-stained night wondering why my clothes were on backwards, why there was a packet of almonds in my underwear drawer and when I’d last brushed my teeth. And the things I did; the dangerous, hallucinogenic, unfathomable acts of disorientation, distraction and confusion. Putting my shoes neatly in the bin, forgetting how to spell my own name, calmly putting my phone, keys or dirty nappies in the washing machine, “seeing” my baby rolling under the bed when he was in fact still in my arms; these things are the familiar stuff of banter outside the school gates. And yet, if we dig beneath them for a second, what does it say about the mental capacity of the millions of people carrying the weight of their helpless infant’s survival, day in, day out?Studies have shown thatsleep deprivationcauses impairment of our cognitive and motor skills equivalent to being floridly drunk. Being awake for 24 hours, as some parents and carers will certainly be, is the equivalent to being well over thelimit for drink-drivingin some countries. If I was in this state, while walking my baby or mother along the river, because I’d been downing whisky for breakfast or getting baked on skunk at the kitchen table, social services might well be called. People would worry. Authorities might intervene. But because my exhaustion was just the result of that miserable cocktail of breastfeeding, an unfair share of housework and the unfathomable crying of a baby in the night, I was simply left to get on with it.When I was writing my bookHolding the Baby, I asked on social media for stories from people clenched in the jaws of parental sleep deprivation. What I got back was hilarious and frightening in equal measure; people backing cars over their (mercifully empty) buggies; parents trying to soothe a pillow as their child cried in the cot beside them; women making tea out of dishwasher tablets and not only brushing their teeth with hand soap but not even realising until days later. While it’s tempting to brush these off with a smile and nod of recognition, every single one speaks to the fact that actual human health and life is frequently put at risk by chronic sleep-deprivation. If someone mistakes haemorrhoid cream for toothpaste or leaves their baby at the fish counter of a supermarket, why do we shrug it off as embarrassing and unavoidable? Well, if I may be so bold, perhaps because these experiences have been largely, and historically, experienced by low status and marginalised people; women, disabled people, people on low incomes, people of colour, carers. So even when this sort of “domestic tiredness” is experienced by a male or non-binary parent, the assumption that they just have to get on with it comes from a history of female tiredness being ignored.After seven years, I recently became a parent again, for the second time; I am edging towards that inky, panicked state of sleeplessness, in full knowledge that I may well lose my mind, and certainly my health. A lack of sleep,according to an articleI read while my daughter churned and grunted in the bed beside me, hasbeen associated withan increase in the likelihood of developing dementia, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and even cancers of the breast, colon, ovaries and prostate. These articles are informative, sure, but are they helpful? Someone reading books likeWhy We Sleep– which frighten the living daylights out of anyone who’s been awake for 20 hours and is currently playing “Hairdryer Sounds 2 hours ASMR White Noise” on their phone in the pointless hope that it will send their baby to sleep – does not benefit from the knowledge that their exhaustion is making them ill. It doesn’t put their mind at rest – nor help to settle their dependents.What they would benefit from, of course, would be free, state-funded childcare, equal domestic labour, and compulsory parental leave for both partners. And probably secure housing, a well-funded NHS and access to green space to boot. But I suppose that’s just a dream.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionSleepHealthHealth & wellbeingFamilyWomencommentShareReuse this content"

The calendar was thoughtfully structured and those attending were senior decision-makers. As she talked through the details, she started to feel apprehensive as her manager’s expression remained impassive. When she finished, rather than acknowledging her efforts or even her initiative, his first response was: “Did you follow the expense approval process for these events?” Before she could respond, he added: “Couldn’t you fit more in? And how do we know these are quality attendees? I haven’t seen the lists.”Anna was overwhelmed by the administrative burden of her job. Self-compassion was the answer | Gill Straker and Jacqui WinshipRead moreGail felt the enthusiasm drain from her body. She’d invested more hours than she was hired for, leveraged her professional network, and thought she was responding to recent requests for her team to expand the company’s market presence. Yet her manager’s flat response seemed more concerned with procedural checkboxes and what she hadn’t done, rather than what she had. He didn’t comment on her initiative. She left his office feeling deflated and questioning whether her extra effort was worth it.We hear of similar scenarios playing out in offices worldwide every day. While it might seem like a minor interaction, research suggests these moments create hurt, drain motivation and gradually erode organisational attachment.The science of feeling seenThe psychological experience of feeling seen and heard is fundamental to human wellbeing and emotional development. When people feel genuinely understood and acknowledged by others, it activates neural pathways associated with safety and social connection, releasing bonding hormones like oxytocin. This validation goes beyond simple listening – it encompasses having one’s emotional reality, lived experiences and core identity recognised and accepted without judgment.When managers fail to validate employee efforts, they trigger what the organisational psychologist Denise Rousseau calls a “betrayal of the psychological contract” – the unwritten expectations between employee and organisation. Contracts aren’t just about pay and benefits; they’re about feeling valued, recognised and respected for our contributions.While likely unintended, the responses of Gail’s manager defaulted to criticism and scepticism, particularly damaging for her because she was at her most vulnerable – sharing ideas she had invested in and, she explained later, was feeling proud of.A thousand tiny betrayalsIt’s entirely possible that if we were able to ask him, Gail’s manager may explain that he was simply doing his job – ensuring compliance processes and quality control are followed by the sales team. But research shows that relationship quality between leaders and followers is built through ongoing patterns of interaction. Each dismissive response, each failure to acknowledge effort, or even a non-response, contributes to “death by a thousand cuts” – the accumulated impact of repeated micro betrayals.Unfortunately, this has been Gail’s experience. In her current role and with this manager she can recall many instances of interactions where she has felt dismissed, or where her ideas seem to get shut down. She had started doubting herself and holding back from sharing ideas in team meetings to avoid this happening. Her recent effort was an attempt to shine and now she felt “there’s no point in trying to make a difference”.The ripple effectThe damage from these interactions extends beyond the immediate relationship. Research shows that when employees witness others’ initiatives being dismissed, they learn vicariously that it’s unsafe to show initiative. This creates what psychologists call “observational learning” – people learn what behaviours are truly valued by watching how others are treated.The dilemma for Gail now is how to respond to her manager. We discussed a continuum of options from “do nothing”, to “just do the work” she is asked to, nothing more, perhaps to discuss with colleagues some options for giving feedback as a team, through to giving her manager direct feedback about the impact of his style on her motivation and performance. Working through some of these options led Gail to the realisation that she had witnessed her manager responding in similar ways with other team members, and she felt nervous about raising the patterns directly.From carer to carefree? How to move on from years of devotion after a loved one dies | Gaynor ParkinRead moreIn this time of considering options a secondment to a different part of the business opened up. Gail had worked for the manager in this area before and found him to be supportive, encouraging and, importantly, validating of her ideas and initiative. She decided to apply for the secondment and was successful. Gail has also decided to use the secondment time to look for other jobs. “I’m going to pay more attention to finding out about team culture and management styles and in any interviews raise how important a validating feedback style is to me.”For Gail and countless others like her, our hope is that organisations will recognise the impact of invalidating management styles and invest in developing leaders who understand the profound impact of their emotional responses. Because it’s not just about making people feel good – it’s about creating environments where initiative, creativity and engagement can flourish, so people can thrive.*Gail has given permission for her story to be shared.

Sorting out our broken social care system would be up there too. One thing that wouldn’t feature: cutting disability benefits.Yet last week Keir Starmer attempted to frame cutting the disability benefits bill asa moral, not just economic, imperative– that Labour is “the party of work” and has a duty to reduce welfare costs. To be clear: there is a broad consensus that the welfare system is working badly for disabled people and many are not getting the support they need to move into work, but that’s a world away from the £6bn of welfare cuts being considered by the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are also more people claiminghealth-related benefits– both means-tested out-of-work benefits, and the personal independence payment (Pip) that helps meet the additional costs of disability, which isn’t means-tested and is paid regardless of someone’s work status. One in 10 working-age adults now receive health-related benefits, up from one in 14 before the pandemic. While most new claims still come from those aged 40-64, the rate of growth has been fastest for the under-40s, and there has been an increase in mental health claims across all ages: 37% of new claims,compared with 28% in 2019.Some people have superimposed their own pet theory on to these figures: this is about 20-something snowflakes identifying as depressed, or the legacy of long Covid, for example. The truth is a lot more complex, and the consensus among policy wonks is that we don’t fully understand it. No other wealthy country has experienced a trend as marked as this, suggesting it’s not purely about Covid or the cost of living (though it’s worth noting the UK is only now spendingroughly the averagefor comparable countries on disability benefits). It’s more likely to be a product of how these have interacted with the UK’s public services and welfare system. Higher mortality rates, including more deaths as a result of alcohol, suicide and drugs, provide objective evidence that Britain has gotphysically and mentally sickersince 2020. The low rates of out-of-work benefits for those who lose their jobs – eroded since 2010 – have probably pushed more people towards applying for disability benefits than in other countries. Long NHS waiting lists, including for pain-relieving operations and mental health therapies, suggest many people’s spells out of work will be significantly extended because they can’t get the treatment they need, with terrible consequences for their long-term employment prospects. Employers are often not flexible enough about making adjustments to allow people to return to work aftera period of absence.There’s no question this needs addressing. But there are two versions of welfare reform. The first is premised on the assumption most people don’t want to be stuck at home on benefits, but are being consigned to the statistical category of “long-term sick” through poor public services and a lack of employment support. The second takes as its starting point the idea that people on disability benefits are more likely to be feckless scroungers who need to be pushed to work through benefits cuts and sanctions.‘There is no moral case’: Labour divided over prospect of benefit cutsRead moreOf course you will always be able to find some people who take liberties with work. But the idea this is the main issue is plain wrong; evidence suggests it is very difficult to qualify for Pip, for example: whistleblower assessors who worked for the private companies administering it flagged how much pressure they were under tolimit successful claims; and almost a third of children with disabilities serious enough to qualify for disability benefits in childhood find themselves ineligible for Pipwhen they turn 16.Much of whatLiz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, has said recognises the lack of flexibility and support in the labour market for people with health issues. Some, for example, may be scared of trialling going back to work in case it’s used as evidence to strip them of Pip even if it doesn’t work out. Fixing this would deliver long-term savings but requires upfront investment. And in the absence of a clear set of governing values, this is a government overwhelmingly being driven by Treasury thinking: slashing back the state to boost defence spending and avoid putting up taxes.The suggestion has been that the government will cut an eye-watering £6bn from the annual welfare bill, making Pipeven harder to claim, and axing the health-related elements of universal credit, while investing just £1bn in employment support programmes. All this will do is push up already-high rates of disability poverty.Starmer aides have been busy briefing that cutting these benefits willresonate with swing voters. That seems unlikely to placate the Labour MPs – including frontbenchers and the normally loyal – who are angry about this not because they think it’s a vote loser, but because they think it’s immoral. Benefits have been pared to the bone since 2010 by successive Conservative chancellors – the poorest decile of families with children lost an astounding £6,000 a year on average between 2010 and 2024 as a result ofchanges to the tax-benefit system. Unless chancellor Rachel Reeves finds a way of channelling more support to low-income parents, child poverty is predicted to increase by 400,000 by theend of Labour’s first term. If these welfare cuts get pushed through, that figure will be even higher. How on earth are Labour MPs supposed to defend that kind of record?In the wake of a backlash that has spannedcabinet ministers, former chancellor Ed Balls, disability charities and thinktanks such as the Resolution Foundation, there are signs that the government may be resiling fromcutting the levels of Pip. But it appears to be standing firm on making it harder to claim in the first place andreducing other disability benefits. Which makes it very hard to take at face value the government’s claim that this is about helping more disabled people back into work. It appears to be driven more by saving money in a way that hits some of society’s most vulnerable, but isn’t too politically painful.Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsBenefitsOpinionKeir StarmerWelfareWork & careersPovertyLiz KendallDisabilitycommentShareReuse this content"

Critics have condemned them as presaging a “two-tier” justice system, a jibe aimed for months at Labour andKeir Starmer, but which has now crossed the parliamentary aisle to be wielded byLabour ministers, too. The lord chancellor, Shabana Mahmood, wrote to the chair of the Sentencing Council, Lord Justice William Davis, to “make clear my displeasure” at the guidelines, insisting that access to justice “should not be determined by an offender’s ethnicity, culture or religion”. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, claimed that “Christian and straight white men… will betreated differently to the rest of society”.The spit and fury is both overdone and insufficient. The new guidelines are more nuanced than many critics allow, but more profound problems with them are ignored in much of the discussion.The controversial part of the proposals, due to come into effect on 1 April, lies with changes in the use of pre-sentence reports (PSRs). These provide courts with information about an offender’s background and may lead to more lenient sentences.Under the new guidelines, courts must consider a PSR when the defendant comes from certain cohorts, such as being a young adult, female, “from an ethnic minority, cultural minority, and/or faith minority community”, pregnant or postnatal, or a primary carer for dependent relatives. PSRs should be considered, too, when the offender may be transgender, has addiction issues, or is at risk of domestic abuse or modern slavery or trafficking, and so on.It’s quite a list, comprising people from specific identity groups or facing certain circumstances. Much of the rage, though, has been directed at the inclusion of just one group – those “from an ethnic minority, cultural minority, and/or faith minority community”.The possibility of differential sentences based on race or ethnicity is certainly troubling. A burglary or a rape committed by a white person, a black person or an Asian person should, all else being equal, receive the same punishment. Nevertheless, the focus of critics on this category as opposed to any other suggests politicised hostility.The list provides a snapshot of how the judiciary understands which people may be vulnerable, have extra needs or face social disadvantage. Davis, defending the guidelines, suggested that one key issue had been “evidence of disparities in sentencing outcomes”.There are certainlydisparitiesin the sentencing of differentethnic groups, and evidence that those from minority groups are more likely to receivehigher custodial sentencesfor equivalent offences. Does this suggest, assupporters of the new guidelines argue, that a two-tier justice system already exists and that the changes seek to make it fairer?Racism and discrimination certainly play a role in creating these disparities, but so do other factors. Minority defendants, for instance, areless likely to plead guilty than white defendants, and so, if convicted, more likely to face harsher sentences, with those who admit guilt usually afforded leniency. Disparities in themselves are not evidence of racism. Nor is treating individuals from different groups unequally an equitable solution to social discrimination against particular groups.The most striking aspect of the new guidelines is the missing subject: class. The word “class” does not appear once in the document. Nor does “poverty”. Yet, few issues are more pertinent in evaluating offenders’ social background.A wealth of research has revealed connections betweenclass, poverty, inequality and crime. Periods in which there have been relative falls in the wages of poorly paid workers are associated withincreased crime rates, as isgreater inequality.There is a major blind spot in the way policymakers and state authorities understand social disadvantage and inequalityA2012 Ministry of Justice reportunsurprisingly found that a significant proportion of prisoners had grown up in poverty and with a history of social exclusion. A prisons inspectorate report the previous year had shown that more than half of young women in custody and a quarter of young men had been inlocal authority care.Other researchindicated that more than a third of prisoners had not been in paid employment in the year before. Almost one in eight had never had a paid job. A 2022report by Cardiff Universityacademics revealed that the imprisonment rate for the 10 most deprived local authorities in England was 10 times greater than that of the 10 least deprived local authorities in England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As with the sentencing guidelines, neither class nor poverty is mentioned once in the report.There is a major blind spot in the way policymakers and state authorities understand social disadvantage and inequality. Categories such as race, ethnicity, sex or gender readily spring to mind. Class too often disappears into a demographic black hole. That perhaps the most important factor in shaping an offender’s experience is often ignored reflects the way that discussions of social disadvantage are warped. Not only is it taken for granted that poor and working-class people will commit crime, and so their disproportionate presence in the justice system can be ignored, but society also treats crimes committed by working-class offenders more harshly than “middle-class” crimes. There is a long history of criminalising poverty and of demonising the working class.Even when class comes into consideration, it is often racialised. In much discussion of the “white working class”, for instance, thewhiteness seems to matter morethan the class location. Yet, as the Prisoners’ Education Trust told the 2020 parliamentary inquiry, while class is critically important, “what the data does not evidence is that being white…contributes to experiences of disadvantage”.At the same time, part of the reason that certain minorities are disproportionately incarcerated is likely to be that such groups are disproportionately working class and poor. Again, there is insufficient research about this.The new sentencing guidelines are the latest demonstration of distorted thinking about social disadvantage, and of the invisibility of class in many discussions. The treatment of working-class people is an expression of “two-tier” justice so deeply embedded in our history and institutions that it is barely noticed.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is not, I stress, due to offensive activities in the bedroom. My sin is that two months after purchasing this admirably functional, mid-market item of bed linen, I have yet to leave a review on the company website.Ever since my initial purchase – online, of course – I have been haunted by an increasingly plaintive sequence of requests, demands and, eventually, cajoling whimpers. Recently, these pleas moved firmly into the territory of emotional blackmail. As an “independent, family business”, my bed linen providers rely on positive reviews to keep a roof over their heads, I was told. I’m aware that the duvet cover itself isn’t sentient but, with this level of pressure leveraged in its name, it’s hard to catch sight of it in the laundry and not attribute to it a smidge of cotton-fibred resentment.Incessant demands for consumer feedback are the newest plague on our inboxes. It’s not just the duvet cover:Tripadvisoris still badgering me to review a restaurant I didn’t actually attend, after looking it up last month; my new exercise mat came with a questionnaire; and when I bought a splurge item through a luxury fashion marketplace, I was invited separately to review the web portal, the individual brand, and the delivery company, each in turn. It’s enough to drive one back to shopping in person, with cash – anything that doesn’t require an email address.So I was initially enthused to hear about Dorian, the Notting Hill restaurant that is tearing up the rulebook on customer feedback. Gone is the review-driven service and the abject apologies issued online to any grumpy sot who issues calumnies from behind a pseudonym. Any complaints left on Google or Tripadvisor will be roundly ignored; any customer who even mutters about leaving a review will be ejected on the spot. They certainly won’t be emailing you to ask if there’s room for improvement.Instead, it is the customers who get reviewed. Buckle up, diners of London W11, and get ready for your manners to be marked out of five. As the old joke used to go: “In Soviet Russia, television watchesyou.” Nowadays, in Notting Hill, potato rösti reviews you.These reviews aren’t published, so you won’t be exposed to public shame, although you’ll get a sense of where you rate, based on whether you’re blocked from repeat bookings, or added to an elite WhatsApp group with access to last-minute reservations. But the in-house notes sound copious.Dorian’s owner Chris D’Sylva told theMaillast week that he keeps alogbook of diners’ behaviour. “It’s a tiered system whereby we rank how much we like the customer and the value of the customer, or the destructiveness of the customer.” Behaviours likely to get you marked as “destructive”? Turn up with a ring-light and demand help filming your dinner for Instagram. (D’Sylva has a healthy scorn for Insta influencers, largely due to the number of freebies they request.) The worst crime, however, is to show any hint of offering your own feedback. The only critique that matters here is the one issued to the customer.Whether in retail or hospitality, we find ourselves in a world in which we’re all reviewing each other, all the timeThe Dorian approach may seem aggressive to many, and no doubt has been publicised as a calculated strategy to cultivate a reputation for exclusiveness. TheMail’s initial interview with D’Sylva included a blingy list of celebrities, or “people of influence” to use his preferred phrase, who do merit a regular table. Yet, in 2025, there’s surely something laudable about any business owner who refuses to be held hostage by any curmudgeon with a laptop and a Google account. Restaurant workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your Tripadvisor stars!We do all understand why businesses have been reduced to begging customers for online reviews. These now define how we spend our money. The result is a series of industries shouldering unjust levels of reputational vulnerability. No wonder criminals are monetising this weakness: last July, an acclaimed restaurant chain in the north-west revealed that it was being blackmailed by a gang who had begun to flood its online listings with fake one-star reviews, and threatened to continue if not paid off.Andrew Sheridan, the star chef targeted by the scammers, has joined a list of chefs backing Dorian’s approach, although he doesn’t ignore bad reviews by tricky customers: “I respond to every unfair, bad online review, explaining why it’s unreasonable.”It’s not only negative reviews that can be faked. In 2023 the consumer championWhich?revealed that 10% of surveyed Amazon customers had been offered bribes by retailers to leave a five-star review, often comprising a gift card of greater value than the original amount spent.Whether in retail or hospitality, we find ourselves in a culture of uber-reviewing: a world in which we’re all reviewing each other, all the time, and positive reviews are currency. The most obvious form of low-level irritation this provokes is that of the hassled customer: the part of me that resents when a retailer expects me to make payment by giving up my time, as well as my cash.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is something avoidant about the post-dinner review. Too often, it seems to be an outlet for any minor dissatisfaction that a diner has never quite dared voice to a waiter.The same moral cheapness surely creeps in when customers themselves are reviewed. The old adage tells us to trust a new date by how he treats the waiter, but what if he’s only mustering basic courtesy because he wants to stay on the restaurant’s list? (He’ll need that gold rating if he’s planning to bring a different date there next week.) Meanwhile, the services that already feature reviews of consumers have a nasty tendency to reward “normal” social behaviour. One friend received a bad Airbnb review because he didn’t choose to watch the football with his host.It’s not clear what socially normative behaviour at Dorian involves, but I suspect it involves racking up heavy wine charges – orbeing David Beckham. There’s no radicalism in finding new ways to perpetuate a culture in which we’re all fair game for judgment. I’ll probably pass on trying to get myself a reservation. In preparation for this article, I had a peek at some of the Google reviews that D’Sylva is so keen to ignore. There’s a healthy 3.9 star average, but the one-star stinker that sticks in my head spoke of being treated with “utter disdain” by the staff.

But regrettably, it feels as if we are going backwards. The regulator Ofcom has decided to deploy timidity where ambition is needed. Rather than focusing on reducing harm and preventing tragedies, its approach seems aimed at minimising the economic costs for tech firms cleaning up the harm they have caused.Instead of prioritising the fundamental principles of child safety, one minister indicated that the codes coming into force were consulted on to make them “judicial review proof”. Legal caution trumps children’s safety.This is not what parliament envisaged when it passed the Online Safety Act. It is certainly not what bereaved families campaigned for. The new measures offer only cursory protection from suicide and self-harm content and demonstrate howOfcomhas failed to act quickly on the evolving and escalating online threats facing young people.Teenagers are no longer at risk only from being exposed to suicide ideation and self-harm content by aggressive algorithms, a preventable harm that cost my daughter Molly her life. Vulnerable young people are now being targeted by appalling online groups, coercing them into self-harm and even suicide. The FBI has issued two warnings about these groups and last week warned of a “steep increase” in their activity. Europol and Canadian law enforcement have raised similar alarms.Global law enforcement agencies are clear that some young people, often struggling with their mental health, are being groomed to commit violent acts against themselves and others on video or live streams. These groups are driven by the same “fluid ideologies” and violent motives that have been thrust into the spotlight byAxel Rudakubanaand the horrific events in Southport.Despite clear warnings about this growing threat, Ofcom has inexplicably chosen not to act. Tech companies won’t face a single targeted measure to tackle suicide and self-harm offences in the codes that can be enforced from tomorrow. Because of the structural weaknesses in the act, Ofcom wouldn’t be able to fix this error for another 18 months, even if it did decide to act.Despite clear warnings about this growing threat, Ofcom has inexplicably chosen not to actIn the face of this inaction, the government should intervene. This is the message I delivered to the prime minister when we recently met. So far, this government has failed to grasp the nettle. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has issued ambiguous and confused promises to improve legislation he himself has described as“unsatisfactory” and “uneven”. In the face of urgent preventable harm happening on this government’s watch, last week he set out a vision for “piecemeal” improvements.I want to be clear that the secretary of state’s inaction and inertia will cost more young lives. His proposals are the sticking-plaster politics that the prime minister has rightly said he rejects. Bereaved parents are now losing trust in Kyle. We very much believe the public is on our side –85% of parents want strongerlaws. Parents want the government to act decisively on the side of children and families.A decision to fix and strengthen the Online Safety Act also makes economic sense. The government’s economic modelling shows that stronger regulation, which reduces exposure to online harm by 15%, could deliver an economic return of£4bn every year. Online safety is not just good for society; it is also good for growth.Of course, there are those who refute this, putting the free expression of platforms over reasonable and necessary measures to protect children from harm. Among them is a hawkish White House, which has issued an executive order that instructs officials to “recommend appropriate actions to counter” the Online Safety Act.I’m increasingly concerned that the government could stall further vital online safety measures to appease the White House, dodge tariffs or even chase a trade deal. But UK parents are watching, too. They do not want their children’s safety jeopardised by an exported agenda written by tech libertarians and JD Vance. They expect to be heard by their own government. Polling shows thatnine in 10people support policies that prioritise children’s safety online, even if it means tech companies investing significantly less in the UK.Parents will judge the prime minister by how he responds to the preventable harm that is now happening on his watch. They will judge him harshly if he fails this crucial test. But they will also stand by him and cheer him on if he takes decisive action to ensure online safety for children.Ian Russell is an internet safety campaigner and chair of the Molly Rose FoundationDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More than a quarter of a century has passed since another Labour prime minister, one Tony Blair, vented hisfrustration with the public sectorby complaining that trying to reform government had left him with “scars on my back”. In similar vein, David Cameron’s lot used to excuse their struggles to get stuff done by blaming resistance from the amorphous administrative “Blob”.Dominic Cummings told Boris Johnsonthat the solution was to pack Number 10 with “weirdos”, “misfits” and “wild cards” – a self-description if ever there was one – while purging the senior civil service. He was still working his way through his“shit list” of mandarinswhen he got the boot himself. You will not recall the Johnson administration as an able and stable outfit dedicated to serving the needs of the public. The grim chaos of that period is a warning to the current government that braggadocio, stunts and wheezes will not make the state smarter.Most prime ministers become exasperated with the bureaucracy under them at some point. It has taken eight months for Sir Keir to conclude that a “weak”, “overstretched” and “unfocused” state isfailing to properly perform its “core purposes”. He’s not wrong. The contract between government and citizenry is in a bad way. “The public has lost faith in the state to deliver,” says one cabinet minister who worries about this a lot. “People find themselves paying more in tax, but do they feel the benefit in the public realm? They don’t.”Fixing this should be one of Labour’s most pressing priorities. It inherited a flatlining economy, faces escalating geopolitical threats that demand more funding for defence, and money is tight.Backbench rebellionis brewing over plans to cut billions from the rising welfare bill by reducing some incapacity benefits. Ministerial mutiny is stirring over the squeeze to departmental budgets beingdemanded by the Treasuryso that Rachel Reeves doesn’t breach her own fiscal rules. That increases the imperative to extract maximum value from every taxpayer penny.Evidence that government is not a burden on people’s backs is critical to Labour’s its chances of re-electionIt is fundamental to Labour’s case that the state can be a “force for good”. Proving this to be true is essential if the populist right is to be seen off. Evidence that government is not a burden on people’s backs, but an enabler that improves their lives, is critical to its chances of re-election.As thinking at Number 10 has developed, they have settled on some broad conclusions. One is that too much power has been subcontracted toquasi-autonomous organisationsknown as “arm’s length bodies” within government and as quangos to everyone else.In a speechdelivered at a business campus in Hull, where the first bottle of Dettol was produced, the prime minister presented himself as the antiseptic to what he disdained as the “watchdog state”, “a cottage industry of checkers and blockers” that he portrayed as antithetical to “democratic accountability”.He has taken a big first scalp, and with it a serious gamble, by announcing that NHS England, the largest quango of them all,will be abolished. The sorry history of that organisation serves as a caution about how not to do reform. NHS England was set up by the Cameron government to put distance between ministers and the day-to-day operations of the health service. But the Department of Health was still, and rightly, held responsible for the performance of the NHS, and ministers still, and inevitably, wanted a lot of say over how it was run.There will be few mournersat the funeral of NHS England, because it created a micro-managing double-layer of management accompanied by confusion about lines of command and accountability. A cabinet colleague reports that Wes Streeting decided to act because “he knew what he wanted to do with the health service, but found that he had a system without levers”. To the dustbin of history goes a previous government’s botched attempt to extract more from one of the most expensive and essential arms of the state. Another reorganisation of the NHS will cause near-term upheaval, but the health secretaryhas reassured twitchy cabinet colleaguesthat it will pay a dividend over the longer term in delivering better performance. His personal ambitions, and the government’s hopes of convincing voters that it is turning around the NHS, depend on his being right.Sir Keir says every other quango will have to justify its existence. Yet here we encounter contradictory thinking. Before it has fully audited the purpose and quality of quangos already in place, Labour has been merrily setting up ahost of new ones, from the Independent Football Regulator to GB Energy. Its unhappiest offspring is the Office for Value for Money (OVfM). Championed by the chancellor, its supposed role is to invigilate government spending to ensure that it is not wasteful. When the unit was scrutinised by the Labour-chaired Treasury select committee,the MPs concludedthat it was “an understaffed, poorly defined organisation which has been set up with a vague remit and no clear plan to measure its effectiveness”. Ouch. The OVfM does not sound like it is offering value for money. Labour’s thinking about the efficient state needs more work.About half of government interactions with the public are still paper-basedAnother area where ministers want radical change is Whitehall. Cabinet ministers protest that it is not their intention to “beat up” the civil service Cummings-style while also insisting that reform is long overdue. Tony Blair, who wasn’t much interested in the wiring of the state when he was prime minister, never really got to grips with this. Jonathan Powell, chief of staff during the Blair years and a figureof significant influenceonce more since his return as national security adviser, once told me that their failure to reform the civil service was his greatest regret about New Labour. Another veteran of that era,Pat McFadden, the endearingly lugubrious Cabinet Office minister, is leading the push. He denies that his role model is Elon Musk and says he won’t be wielding a chainsaw. Let’s call it a hedge-trimmer then. He wants a slimmer civil service that weeds out its underperformers and thinks less cautiously.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether the politician speaking is Labour or Tory, the charge list includes inertia, group-think, arse-covering, being too comfortable with mediocrity and obsessing over process at the expense of outcomes. Funnily enough, the professional deformations that politicians ascribe to civil servants sound awfully like their own. Mr McFadden says “governing as usual” is for the birds and the future state must work more like a startup by adopting a “test-and-learn” mindset to find creative ways to improve delivery. He wants Whitehall todevelop an appetite for risk, because “if we’re terrified of failure we’ll never innovate”. Absolutely. But mistakes can’t be learned from unless they are acknowledged and owned. That will be counter-cultural not just for the civil service but a shock to the system for politicians as well. Good luck with that. I’ll treatMr McFadden to a ticketto a Bruce Springsteen concert if he can make it happen.The subject that most excites some ministers is “digital reform”. The need is urgent. Ridiculously, about half of the government’s digital budget is currently spent on maintaining and keeping secure data systems, some of which are so out of date they go back to the 1970s. About half of government interactions with the public arestill paper-based. Government digital services have been consolidated in Peter Kyle’s department. The technology secretary tells me that his mission is to make the way government interacts with the public “fit for the age we’re living in” “to look and feel more like bank and travel services do now”. In June, he will launch thegov.uk appdesigned to offer access to a wide range of state services.A ChatGPT fan,he is also an evangelist for how AI can be exploited to make the state a better servant of the people.There are many unanswered questions about the extent to which digitising government will make it more productive. What we do know is that AI can’t change a dressing or fill a pothole. Ministers shouldn’t be beguiled by some fantasy that there’s a single shiny gizmo that will magically make everything better. “Smarter government” will require bold thinking, remorseless attention to detail and sustained effort over many years. If it were easy, successive prime ministers wouldn’t have been gnashing their teeth about it for so long.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionHealth policyEnglandKeir StarmerPat McFaddenPeter KyleHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

When it’s a status symbolGareth RubinThe employers of the estate agent who sued them for unfair constructive dismissal would do well to read MachiavelliSun 16 Mar 2025 03.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 07.20 EDTShareNiccolò Machiavelli had an important piece of advice about office politics: “If an injury has to be done to a man,” he writes inThe Prince, “it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.” Most of us can relate to that.It’s likely that whoever accidentally insultedNicholas Walker, the take-no-prisoners manager of the Rickmansworth branch of Robsons Estate Agents, by giving him a second-rate desk, hadn’t read Machiavelli’s 1532 tract. Because Walker, no doubt thinking of Machiavelli’s subsequent invocation – “it is safer to be feared than loved because … fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails” – immediately dragged his ashen-faced employers to an employment tribunal where he successfully sued them for unfair constructive dismissal. They probably really regret giving him that desk.Actually, to be fair to Walker, there was more to this case – the placing of the desk was not where managers usually sit, which was, the judge agreed, tantamount to being told he’d be an assistant branch manager; a demotion, having previously been a branch manager. He was also not informed he would be sharing a managerial role.Office politics – which in the Zoom epochpursues you into your own shower– has become a ubiquitous live version of1984’s Two Minutes Hate: a brutal social event that thrills the spectators and can’t be avoided by the subject. And it’s all about one thing:status.What seemingly got Walker’s goat wasn’t an explicit demotion. It was in large part the drop in his perceived rank among his peers. He had been understood to have been kicked down the pecking order.And yet: “Since the arrival of settled agriculture and private property around 10,000 BC, status has been a thing, whether that be the size of your pyramid or displaying a Gail’s coffee rather than a Starbucks coming into work. It can be the same for which seat you are allocated in the office,” the psychologist Oliver James, author ofOffice Politics, tells me, musing on the affair.Why? Well, because the office is a crucible of society, allowing us to move up, down or across the social ladder in a way only backstabbing medieval princes have known before. And that fulfils a need in many of us: to be better off thanhimorheror, most of all,them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

James describes it thus: “Triadic behaviour flourishes where ruthless, devious selfishness is advantageous and where an individual is very concerned to gain power, resources or status.”And to Walker, the case was about more than a desk and we certainly aren’t ascribing to him the dark arts of Machiavelli or those qualities James refers to. But status is important – it is about who is up and who is down. For, as Stephen Potter says in his 1952 treatiseOne-Upmanship:“If you’re notone-up, you’reone-down.”It is, in one sense, a good thing that most of us obsess over our place at work: we do so because in the wider world few people care about who your family are, or what school you attended. The old definers of rank, which are not the result of ability or graft, have been swept away. At least your workplace status bears some relation to what you contribute and achieve. Nicholas Walker understood this well.

Complex cases are now in the hands of therapists who are not always qualified to treat them.In one case, an autistic girl with an eating disorder was asked to self-refer to a local charity that offered “one-to-one support” – given by someone untrained in psychotherapy or counselling. Her mother, a former psychiatric nurse, became concerned that the treatment was doing more harm than good and put a stop to the sessions.The numbers aren’t small, either. A counselling charity in Blackpool estimates that about half of the patients its therapists see each week are referred through theNHS.This touches on a wider problem in the world of talking therapies: they are not regulated. Anyone can call themselves a “therapist”, “psychologist”, or “counsellor”. A recent BBC investigation found that dodgy online courses have exploded – some with very basic requirements, others that allowed candidates to cheat. But there is no legal obligation even to do a weekend counselling course before you start taking paying patients.While medical doctors are overseen by the General Medical Council, which can strike them off its register and prevent them practising again, regulation for psychotherapists and counsellors is entirely voluntary. You can choose to get accredited by respected organisations such as the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) or the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP). But if you are struck off, there is nothing to stop you setting up shop again. In short, this is an industry with no unified ethical code or complaints system, and no minimum qualifications, dealing with sick and vulnerable people.The onus to check whether or not a therapist is on an accredited list is entirely on the patientWhat makes this worse is that just one in 10 people are aware of the lack of oversight. The onus to check whether or not a therapist is on an accredited list is entirely on the patient, who might not be in a state of mind to do so. The problem is compounded if GPs are directing people to dubious counsellors, which patients might interpret as a formal NHS referral.This crisis is likely to worsen, as therapy is booming. About 1.6 million people are on waiting lists for mental health services – numbers that have risen almost a third over the past two years. Little wonder that those who can afford it choose to go private. Talking therapies, once taboo, are also increasingly accepted and promoted as life-enhancing. Some companies offer therapy as a perk to employees. With rising numbers of potential clients, more people are looking to counselling as a career. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of students registered with the BACP, training to become therapists,increased by 44%.Therapy can change lives for the better, of course. But amid the success stories lurks horror. Of the 72 therapists struck off by the BACP and UKCP between 2005 and 2015, nearly one in four are still practising. An investigation by theinewspaper reported that therapists expelled from professional bodies for having sex with vulnerable patients, bullying, racism, giving patients illegal drugs or being drunk in therapy sessions werestill offering their services to clients. One psychotherapist who had sexually exploited female patients was struck off for posing an “extreme danger to the public… if he was permitted to recommence practising”. He wasstill practising.Why have we been so slow to regulate? Amid rising awareness of the benefits of therapy, there has been too little discussion of the ways it can also be damaging. After all, treatments of any sort rarely have a neutral effect – if they are powerful enough to help, they may also be powerful enough to harm. One survey from the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that as many as one in 20 say they suffer from a“lasting bad effect” from their therapy. Failed treatments may exacerbate depression, low mood and self-sabotaging behaviours.Therapy by its nature involves vulnerability and a one-way power dynamic, which also makes it dangerous. There is a long history of therapy being used for abusive purposes – whether in religious cults, in which “therapists” employ techniques to manipulate and brainwash members, or as part of “conversion practices”,now on course to be outlawed, that attempt to change someone’s sexual orientation, and in extreme forms can involve exorcism and physical violence.But a practitioner does not have to be abusive to do harm: clumsy approaches can cause damage, too. Consider the fact that several physical diseases – including metabolic and immune disorders and brain tumours – can manifest withpsychiatric symptoms. A talking therapist who does not recognise key signs and continues treating the patient psychologically may be making the situation worse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some job titles – including “clinical psychologist” and “occupational psychologist” – are already protected in law, with minimum training requirements. Similar rules could be extended to anyone who wishes to use the word “psychologist”, or indeed “therapist” or “psychotherapist”, to set themselves up treating patients with mental health problems. Many other countries are stricter. In theNetherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, you need six years of trainingbefore you qualify for the title of psychotherapist.Regulating therapy more tightly may deal with one problem at the cost of exacerbating another, however. Mental health services could hardly be more stretched. But that is an argument for greater investment. By the last estimate, mental health problems cost the UK economy£117.9bn a year, much of it in lost employment from patients and their families.We heard last week that mental ill health is behind soaring disability benefits, accounting for44% of claimantsin 2024, up from 25% in 2002. Assigning mental health treatment a greater portion of public funds would therefore not only be humane, but efficient.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Death by suicide is indeed more prevalent in men; however, women make more suicide attempts.As a professional educator, I am also concerned by unexamined implications that girls are more successful than boys in school because the system favours them. Educators often spend more time and energy on boys than girls.Sexist attitudes do harm boys’ outcomes: students who expect instant rewards for their efforts, or who cannot accept failure, will tend to fare worse;, and boys do socialise in ways that emphasise boisterous behaviour, which is hardly compatible with academic success. However, while girls outnumber boys at university, boys still make up the majority of many prestigious courses. The supposed “reverse gender gap” is already instrumentalised to discriminate against women. A critical outlook is more necessary than ever.Cécile CristofariAix-en-Provence, FranceThis article is spot on. As a mother of three boys aged 19, 14 and eight, I’ve seen myself how ill equipped they are for the world despite our best efforts. Those who thrive seem to be those who embrace their more feminine attributes whereas boys who feel or act more “boyish” seem unsure of their place.And I’ve seen how men themselves struggle to find meaning and connection, and not just young men. I work in mental health and without exception the men I see are isolated and lonely.What is needed is a new network of boys’ and men’s clubs, like scouts orMenIn Sheds, run for boys and men by men, that emphasise healthy friendships and activities, not solely about sport or machismo. Boys and men need healthy male spaces.Kate DarachBrightonTrumped at the pollsSimon Tisdall (“Being Putin’s stooge won’t win Trump a peace prize. The Order of Lenin, though, is in the bag”, Comment) sums up the situation.But I detect a running theme in much commentary: bad as Trump is, a presidential term lasts only so long, and then you have to hold elections. All the opposition have to do is to find the correct attack megaphone. But what if there aren’t any more elections? A large majority of the Republican party are probably not especially worried. At best, the people may be offered the sort of election favoured in Russia or China.So maybe we should be looking to this as the next threat to the established order? After all, Trump and company have the best part of four years to work on it.John BoothbyLowton, WarringtonRestore power to residentsI am depressed to read your article (“Soaring service charges mean ‘affordable housing’ is being mis-sold, say residents”). Housing Associations in the heyday of shared ownership were led by housing-oriented individuals. As housing authorities grew ever bigger, the accountants took over control and leadership and appear to have become more interested in the balance sheet and corporate reputation than customer service, with ever increasing stories of poor and often dangerous maintenance failures and increasing costs for residents.These large, remote landlords need to be dismantled and power restored to residents.Mike Annan(former housing association CEO)Thornbury, GloucestershireQuestions on assisted dyingThe eminent lawyers, judges and academics who wrote in support of Kim Leadbeater’s amendment to her terminally ill adults bill (Letters,) describe the new proposal – which would swap the high court judge for a panel comprising a lawyer, a social worker and a psychiatrist – as sensible and practical, and as guarding against any misuse.They don’t mention the glaring limitation of this proposal, which is that there is no requirement for the panel members to ask questions of the patient. Without this, there can be no meaningful assessment, for example, of capacity or coercion. Presented as an important layer of scrutiny, the proposed panel needs do little more than check the paperwork.At the second reading of this bill, parliamentarians were assured this would be the safest assisted dying law in the world. Found to be unworkable, and unsupported by senior judges, the high court safeguard has now been abandoned. In its place, a panel that doesn’t even need to ask questions of the person requesting lethal drugs. It may make the bill more practical. But it does not make it more safe.ProfKatherine Sleeman, Laing Galazka Chair in Palliative Care, Cicely Saunders Institute;Dr Sarah Cox, President, Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland;Prof Allan House, Emeritus Professor of Liaison Psychiatry, University of Leeds;ProfMark Taubert, Palliative Medicine Consultant, Velindre University NHS Trust;Dr Steve Marshall,Palliative Care Social Worker, King’s College Hospital;Dr Rachel Clarke, Specialty Doctor in Palliative Medicine;Dr Suzanne Kite, Vice President, Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland;Prof David Oliver, Consultant Geriatrician and General Physician;Dr Jamilla Hussain, Consultant in Palliative Medicine, Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust;ProfFliss Murtagh, Wolfson Palliative Care Research Centre at University of Hull;Dr Wendy Prentice, Consultant in Palliative Medicine, King’s College Hospital, London;Dr Natasha Wiggins,Consultant in Palliative Medicine, Great Western Hospitals NHS Trust;Dr Matthew Doré, Honorary Secretary, Association for Palliative Medicine.;Dr Agnes Ayton,Consultant Psychiatrist, Oxford;Dr Carol L Davis, Consultant in Palliative Medicine, Southampton;Prof Miriam Johnson, Professor of Palliative Medicine, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull;Dr Rebecca Payne, Palliative Medicine Consultant, Northampton ;Dr Mike Blaber, Palliative Care Physician, Birmingham;Dr Sarah Davies, Consultant Physician, London;Dr Nicola Wilderspin, Palliative Care Physician;ProfColin Rees, Consultant Physician, Newcastle;Dr Amy Proffitt, Consultant in Palliative Medicine (Barts), London;Dr Michael Trimble,Consultant Physician in Acute Medicine, Belfast;Dr Dominic Whitehouse, Consultant in Palliative Medicine, Chichester;Dr Anulika IgboakaMRCPsych;Dr Vicki Ibbett,Specialty Doctor in Psychiatry, Birmingham; Dr Ollie Minton, Consultant in Palliative Medicine, Sussex;Dr Victoria Wheatley, Palliative Medicine Consultant, Pembrokeshire ;Dr Idris Baker,Consultant in Palliative Medicine, Swansea ;Dr Nicky Leopold, Consultant Geriatrician, Swansea ;Dr Gwen Davies, Palliative Medicine Consultant and Clinical Director, Swansea;Dr Rhodri Edwards, Consultant Geriatrician, Swansea ;Dr David Randall, Consultant Nephrologist, Royal London Hospital, London;Dr Paul Shaw, Consultant Clinical Oncologist, Velindre Cancer Service, Cardiff; Prof Robert George, Professor of Palliative Care, LondonSpice it up, SussexesI read Martha Gill’s article (“The Sussexes have to earn their bread somehow, so let them make cake”, Comment) with interest. She’s correct, Meghan’s latest series is dreadful. I didn’t last 10 minutes. However, I don’t agree that the Sussexes are indiscreet, or their lives for sale. They’re extremely guarded about certain aspects of it.Meghan’s only doing what other royals have done. More to the point, Meghan had a lifestyle line before she met Harry.My only wish is that the Sussex’s media output was a bit more interesting.Richard T TaylorLondon W5Charities a labour of loveI was saddened but not surprised to hear of another vital charity facing closure due to funding cuts (“Tell Mama monitoring group facing closure after funding pulled by government”, News). Running a small charity is a labour of love, but the relentless pressure of securing funding and supporting vulnerable communities takes a severe toll on the mental health of charity leaders. Having worked in the sector for 20 years, I’ve never seen the funding landscape as bleak as it is now. Demand for our services is soaring, yet funding is shrinking — leaving small charity leaders like me under immense stress and anxiety.The biggest burden is securing funding. With the cost-of-living crisis, public donations have fallen, grant funding has collapsed, and competition is fierce. Unlike larger charities, small organisations operate on a knife-edge, with leaders shouldering the responsibility of ensuring their team gets paid and services continue. This pressure is relentless and isolating, causing severe mental health struggles with small charity leaders experiencing awful impacts like burnout, suicidal thoughts, or hospitalisation.Beyond financial stress, the emotional weight is enormous. As a leader, I carry not only my own stress but also the burden of my team and the families we support.Yet, there remains a frustrating lack of understanding about what small charities do. We’re treated as a “nice to have” rather than vital services. We’re constantly asked to justify our need for funding, despite filling gaps left by failing public services.Real change is needed. Small charities must be properly funded and supported. Leaders must also unite and advocate for themselves, ensuring their wellbeing is prioritised. We do this work because it matters – but without systemic change, burnout will remain an ever-present threat and more charities could face closure.Emma Cantrell, CEO, First Days children’s charityWokingham, BerkshireMothers know bestThe article by a mother (“I adore my children. I’m also scared my son might one day kill me”,News) highlights the psychiatric burden that so many families carry on behalf of their mentally ill children. While many mothers are finely tuned to the fluctuating moods of their children, this information is disregarded by the healthcare profession. Instead, a brief interaction with an unfamiliar mental health worker takes precedence over the experience informed by the long-standing relationship. The consequent outcomes can be tragic.Jane SheehyLondon SE3Toll of taxing workI worked for over 35 years in HMRC, where we had performance-related pay since 1993 (“Starmer’s civil service reform plans raise fears of Musk’s Doge agendaUnions on alert as Labour prepares to unveil ‘Trumpian’ plan for civil service”, News, last week). The vast majority of civil servants are not “mandarins”, they are administrative staff, most of whom are poorly paid.The people I left behind in HMRC do a stressful, soul-destroying job. They deserve better from a government that claims to be on the side of “working people”.Jim SimpsonPadfield, DerbyshireOvercrowding off the railsThis disgraceful case (“Pregnant, sitting on the floor – then unjustly fined for fare dodging”) highlights the appalling overcrowding that has been regularly occurring for years.The fact is that train companies and government have both been hiding behind the Office of Rail and Road’s narrow definition of safety, which deems trains safe no matter how many people are on board and thus permits the unrestricted sale of tickets. Overcrowding is a business model and a policy. The situation is inherently unsafe. Under these circumstances toilets cannot be accessed nor can medical help reach a sick person. Platforms also become overcrowded and unsafe.Until government ministers wake up to the fact that this situation cannot be justified.Dr Stephen WilsonOxfordClean cornersFor a dissertation on mice, I built a square, walled grid to measure frequency of defecation by the subjects. Most pellets appeared in the central squares, fewer adjacent to the walls and fewest in the corner squares. Perhaps Geoff Dyer (“Best seat in the house... why sitting in a corner is so satisfying”, New Review, last week) is just trying, subconsciously, to be a good citizen.Duncan MacphersonTeddington, LondonExplore more on these topicsThe gender gapObserver lettersMen (Society)Men (Life and style)WomenlettersShareReuse this content"

While previous congresses have had such intriguing themes as “From Spoon to City” and “Towards an Aesthetic of the Invisible Design of Tradition”, for 2025 the UK’s Design Council has gone for the stark but urgent “Design for Planet”.Dumbuya with his fellow ambassadors – award-winning furniture designerTom Dixon, architectLesley Lokkowho curated the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2023, Suhair Khan, who is a tech entrepreneur and expert on AI, and designer and artistEs Devlin– have put together a list of the designers they think are trailblazers in changing the way our furniture, clothes and buildings can be made.“The idea of good design has shifted from a focus on functionality and aesthetics to encompass experience, sustainability, and inclusivity,” says Dumbuya. “It prioritises environmental responsibility, embraces technology, fosters collaboration and promotes circularity, reflecting a broader understanding of design’s impact on society and individuals.”This idea is at the heart of a list the ambassadors have created of new trailblazing designers. These creatives are not just using innovative materials or new methods of production, but rethinking the systems and wisdom about the products we use and how we make them.Arthur Mamou-ManiParametric architectView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Studio NaaroLife as an architect was the obvious choice forArthur Mamou-Mani. What else was a young Parisian raised by ecologist parents and who has an equal love for maths, science and art to do? So after training at London’s Architectural Association, he established his design studio in Hackney.From that point on, everything about Mamou-Mani’s work ceases to be obvious. His firm has become famous for building fantasy: the world’s largest 3D-printed sand pavilion; a temporary temple for the Burning Man festival in Nevada; a test site for airships in France; a viewing platform constructed from reclaimed ironwood and rattan in Bali. All from design with circularity at its heart.Mamou-Mani creates biological shape – spirals, waves, repetitive patterns – from 3D-printed and recycled materials using parametric design. The computer-based process uses algorithms derived from the properties of a material to produce buildings and interiors that are a little bit Le Corbusier, a little bit Escher.“It’s not our vision imposed on a material,” he explains, with the example of using a single tree cut to create complex wood waves designed with algorithms using information about wood’s malleability. “You need science to measure your impact and architects can be reluctant with science because they worry it prevents creativity.”View image in fullscreen‘You need science to measure your impact’: Mamou-Mani’s Burning Man Temple in Nevada.Mamou-Mani believes science can prevent waste. He talks with delight about an airship hangar his studio is creating in Nouvelle Aquitaine, France, using biomimicry to make the best design for the site. “We put in ripples on the exterior which means we use 50% less steel,” he beams. “That’s a massive carbon saving. And the building is meaningful: if we replace airplanes with helium balloons it could have a massive impact.”He believes that UK has a lot to bring to the world of circular design. “I come from France and we have a tendency to turn to the government when there is a problem. I love the entrepreneurial spirit of the UK – the idea that an individual or a company can have impact can be fantastic.”Fernando LaposseRegenerative furniture designerView image in fullscreenWhen Fernando Laposse arrived in London from Mexico to study product design in 2007, it was the dawn of the “smart” era – smartphones, smartwatches. “My university, in a spot-on way, tried to prepare us for that. For me, that was soul crushing – I think my heritage was always on my mind, and Mexico has a tradition of craft and agriculture more than industry, so I’ve worked on how I can merge these two worlds for my own sanity.”On a residency at a cultural institute in Oaxaca, Laposse was galvanised by meeting activists fighting for a ban on genetically modified corn in Mexico. “I decided I wanted to do something to help indigenous farmers make a living out of ancient grain.”His plan has taken shape in Tonahuixtla, an area he’d known since childhood, where Laposse has worked with the local Mixtec tribe, first to grow agave to reverse soil erosion, then to cultivate corn. The fibres and husks of these plants are the materials for his furniture designs. Laposse also teaches locals the techniques to turn crops into materials, increasing their role in production. “I’ve known these communities since I was a child, I have a sense of duty to do them. And they’ve given me a career so this helps everyone.”View image in fullscreenThe Totomoxtle furniture range, made of marquetry formed from corn husks and knotted agave fibres.Luckily, the Totomoxtle furniture range is not only clever but beautiful, from the exquisite marquetry formed from corn husks to the cute faux-fur affect of the knotted agave fibres. It looks pop and luxe, but as Laposse points out: “My materials talk to you about Mexico and biodiversity.”As the world starts to experience the fallout of human impact on the environment, Laposse thinks Latin America could come to the fore. “Radical ideas are going to come from this part of the world – we still have a traditional understanding of the interconnections between humans and nature which are long gone from Europe. We are in position where we can change course and maybe create new systems. This is what I try to do with my design.”Kusheda MensahSustainable furniture designerView image in fullscreenOne of Kusheda Mensah’s first formative design memories was her local library in Peckham. Created by architectWill Alsopas part of the 1990s regeneration initiative for the area, it was the first library to win the Stirling Prize. It’s colourful and inclusive a community meeting place and it’s easy to imagine Mensah’s own furniture would work well in this prestigious building. The British-Ghanaian designer’s brand Modular by Mensah specialises in padded seating and curved and comfortable tables designed to interlock, bringing people physically together, and all made from recycled foam and textiles.“The fabrics I choose are not only sustainable but a source of inspiration,” Mensah says. “They allow me to creatively explore ways to give new life to what would otherwise be discarded. I want to ensure my design ideas don’t come at the cost of tomorrow.”Mensah has also made a valuable contribution to the industry by talking openly about the challenges she’s faced in an industry which is often all about image. Mensah was working in retail when she took a gamble and applied to present at the Milan Furniture Fair, she used a bank loan to start up her business and then had to juggle work and parenting two young children.View image in fullscreen‘I want to ensure my design ideas don’t come at the cost of tomorrow’: padded seating by Mensah.Photograph: Emily Cole“Cost of living is a real crisis, and, unless you have financial backing, it’s hard to manifest your designs. A challenge I face is finding financial support from councils or institutions for my passion for social design – specifically creating interactive spaces that are engaging but built with a deep commitment to sustainability.”Currently Mensah is working on her next collection – to be sold with Swedish furniture brand Hem – but she’s delighted that her work has been highlighted by the WDC ambassadors.“It’s a privilege. I hope my efforts might inspire others.”Natsai Audrey ChiezaBiomaterial designerView image in fullscreenBacteria have not traditionally been a big source of inspiration for product design, butNatsai Audrey Chiezais not one to follow tradition. Born in Zimbabwe, she moved to london at 17 and studied architecture before switching to biochemical engineering. She shifted focus to microbiology and synthetic biology and hasn’t looked back.She pioneered the use of bacteria to dye fabric at her company Faber Futures, creating a chemical-free process which cuts down on pollution and water waste. Last year she started a biodesign brand called Normal Phenomena of Life which uses algae, bacteria and fungi as key components of everything from lamps to clothes.“We develop biosolutions for industries such as fashion, textiles, and design, harnessing nature’s capabilities – refined over billions of years of evolution – to create regenerative, high-performance materials.”Chieza says one of the fascinating consequences of her work is the relationship she’s developed with other non-human organisms and a sense of respect for how our fate intertwines with theirs.“I think people still only understand the value of this work being able to scale the technology so that you can replace previous technologies and become a billionaire,” she has said. “That didn’t interest me, because what I experienced was transcending that logic of capitalism to be changed by the bacteria itself. Having its lifecycle drive all of my design decisions.”View image in fullscreenJacket by Normal Phenomena of Life, Chieza’s brand which uses algae, bacteria and fungi as key componentsShe thinks that science today reveals how codependence, rather than dominance, works. “The Cartesian notion of ‘survival of the fittest’ – the motif of the capitalist age – is not universal. Nature provides excellent counterexamples: from mycelial networks that share nutrients across forests to coral and algae co-evolving to sustain entire marine ecosystems. If we are serious about working with living systems, we must build business models that mirror nature – where value is generated, shared, and stewarded symbiotically.”Priya AhluwaliaFashion designer with a global visionView image in fullscreenIn fashion,Priya Ahluwaliais already a big deal. Her eponymous London-based clothes label, launched in 2018, has won her a cupboard full of trophies. Upcycled and repurposed fabrics have featured in her collections since research trips as a student took her to Lagos in Nigeria and Panipat in India, and she saw first-hand the mountains of discarded clothes in these cities, sent for recycling from the west. (The images can be seen in a photography book she released calledSweet Lassi.)As her label’s popularity has steadily grown – she now produces menswear and womenswear – Priya has looked beyond vintage fabrics to logistics and social enterprises in the global south to keep moving forward with ethical business practice.“We’ve had impact on the issue – with commercial partners who want to work with us and understand the way me and my team operate to customers having different ideas about how they want to spend their money,” she says.Her clothes designs are also growing ever more influential. Priya’s British, Nigerian and Indian heritage influences each collection from reworked saris and Cleopatra-style wigs to confident, sexy dresses. There’s a sense of gestalt between the fashion influences, manufacturing conventions, the meeting of west and global south that makes Ahluwalia designs feel synonymous with the way her business works.View image in fullscreen‘There was not much representation of ideas that weren’t western, but the market for fashion is global’: clothing by Priya Ahluwalia.“There was not much representation of ideas that weren’t western,” she says, “but the market for fashion is global. There was space to represent something from a different point of view. Why not have something in your wardrobe that’s inspired by Nigerian pottery as well as by Renaissance Italian art?”Priya plans to add homeware to the Ahluwalia brand soon and says she can see how the aesthetic and ethos of her brand could work in many different areas.“We care about representative and inclusive design and we aim to do things that are better for people and the planet.”Sebastian CoxCrafts maker and woodmanView image in fullscreenFurniture maker Sebastian Cox has been a success ever since the collection he created for his masters in 2010 sold out. An early advocate for regenerative design – working with nature to improve the environment – he has stayed true to this desire since university. He lives in Kent where he has a furniture workshop and also manages two woodland areas. “I think it’s easy to excuse yourself when you’re a craft maker,” he explains. “You think you have low impact but as soon as you sell to market, you contribute to a material culture.”Cox subjects all of his products to an environmental lifecycle assessment to monitor carbon footprint, while simultaneously working on his woodmanship – cultivation of woodland using human interaction to have positive impact on the natural environment. Coppicing – cutting trees back to encourage new growth – is an example.View image in fullscreen‘The UK is only 13% forest… Most antique furniture is all made of someone else’s wood, which is a tragedy’: Sebastian Cox.“We think of ourselves as a green and pleasant land, but the UK is only 13% forest, whereas in Europe the average is 38%. We also had an empire, so after we cut down our own wild wood, we then went and cut down everyone else’s. Most antique furniture is made of someone else’s wood, which is a tragedy.”Cox feels this circular and systemic approach to design is the obvious – if not the only – way forward for the industry. “I look at the past where you sketched a chair and then produced thousands of them and became a celebrity.

It was where the Royal Academy graduate did her most famous painting,Human Laundry, showing nurses cleaning emaciated men.In early May, some of Zinkeisen’s second world war work will be exhibited for the first time in a public gallery to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day. “Doris was a trailblazer for women,” says Mehzebin Adam-Suter, theBritish Red Cross museumcurator who is staging the show in the Oxo Tower in Southwark, central London. Included will be some of her Red Cross paintings, like the burning down of Belsen in May 1945 and military hospitals in France and Belgium, plus her war works owned by the Museum of theOrder of St John.View image in fullscreenDoris Zinkeisen in her London studio in 1936.Photograph: Harry Todd/Getty ImagesHer granddaughter, Charlotte Johnstone, said: “The family story is her being driven into Belsen in Himmler’s requisitioned car. True or not, she never forgot the sight and smell of the place. She wrote to her husband of ‘the ghastly scene of skeletal bodies being flung out of huts and the empty eyes of survivors’.”Zinkeisen is also one of a handful of largely unrecognised British female second world war artists featured inWar Paint – Women At War, a film released in cinemas on 28 March. “Most have been historically undervalued because of their gender,” says director Margy Kinmonth, whose documentary also covers female artists depicting more recent conflicts in their home countries of Iran, Iraq, Ukraine and Sudan.The official British War Artists’ Advisory Committee, run between 1939 and 1945, favoured men over women, who were effectively confined to portraying war damage at home or the injured in UK hospitals.In the film, novelist Penelope Lively remembers her artist aunt, Rachel Reckitt. “Once the Blitz started, she was driving through the East End with her sketch book. She mainly did wood engravings of the facades of bombed houses. The war stimulated her. However she was very aware of the horror, which had a profound effect on her and her outlook on life.”Another artist in the film is Gladys Hynes, whose best known work,Crucifixion, shows an airman lying on a plane’s fuselage. Julia Beaumont-Jones, curator of theRAF Museum, which owns the painting, said it is “Hynes’s very clear anti-war statement”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Back in Britain during the second world war, she painted surreptitiously because, like many female artists, she never received an official permit. HerRunaway Horse, depicting a horse, terrified by bombs and bolting along a road, owned by theImperial War Museum, was painted from memory.Painter and muralist Olga Leh­mann’s life changed when her north London home and studio were destroyed on her first wedding anniversary in October 1940. “That motivated her to become a war artist,” her son, Paul Huson, a TV drama writer, told theObserver. Towards the end of Lehmann’s life, she wrote memoirs, which Huson published privately for a few friends and family. Recalling the Blitz, she wrote of “returning home one evening with an ominous chill before realising it had taken a direct hit and lay in rubble. In my daze, I rescued a few pictures, carrying them out under my arm.”Lehmann sketched war-torn London and air-raid shelters before being commissioned in 1943 to paint murals in theBristol Aeroplane Company’s secret factory in Corsham, Wiltshire. Post-war, Lehmann became a scenic artist on top British films such as Alfred Hitchcock’sStage FrightandAround The World in 80 Days, did portraits of stars including Dirk Bogarde and Peter Sellers, was nominated four times for an Emmy for costume design, and became art director for two advertising agencies.Explore more on these topicsArtThe ObserverPaintingSecond world warMuseumsWar crimesWar reportingNazismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The videos are really informative and well made. She spends months making them: they’re long and very camp. The first time I was recommended her channel, I watched three videos in a row. There’s a good one about shame, and sometimes she’ll use a topic such asTwilightas the vessel, but it’s more about tropes in literature, BDSM and power dichotomies between men and women.2. ArtMunch,Oslo, NorwayView image in fullscreenThree versions of Edvard Munch’s The Scream at Munch, Oslo.Photograph: MunchmuseetSome people can stand in front of a painting and it makes them cry. I don’t feel like that, but when I went to the Munch museum, I didn’t cry but I was inspired. The way he depicts anxiety, inThe Screamand in many of his other paintings, really hits the mark. There seemed to be lots of variations on the same subject, from different angles or perspectives, or repurposing it on to lithographs and woodcuts. I particularly liked his paintingTwo Women on the Shore– it looked very Bergmanesque, likeThe Seventh Seal.3. PodcastLife of BiI’ve been listening to this podcast for a couple of years now. It explores bisexuality, covering a wide range of issues, such as faith and bisexuality, or marriage and queerness. It’s made by Mary Higgins and Ell Potter, who also write plays, and I feel as if I’m their friend at this point, as you do with podcasts. It’s a fantastic resource for anyone struggling with their bisexuality, and it’s also very entertaining. I’d recommend episode seven, F*ck the Pie, which is about the “mother of bisexuality” Lani Ka‘ahumanu, who introduced the B into LGBTQ+. It gets quite moving.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Coronet Books4. BookMadonna: A Rebel Life by Mary GabrielThis is very well written. It goes into plenty of detail about Madonna’s activism during the Aids crisis, with pamphlets about safe sex at her shows, as well as how she moves through the music industry. At the start of her career she signed to a label and was taken to Paris, where she was wined and dined, but the producers weren’t allowing her to hone her craft. So she got on a plane and never went back. She was like, “I’d rather be poor and be able to make the art that I need to make.” She’s such an icon.5.

I’m into the different ways people sauna: in Scandinavian culture, where you jump into cold water afterwards; Turkish baths and hammams, with different generations cleaning one another; Russian sauna culture, with thewhipping of theparenieand all the rituals that go with it. Going to onsens in Japan was super cool: you have your little wash stations, with this multi-tool shower head, and a bit where you spray between your teeth. Afterwards you feel amazing – relaxed, like a newborn. There’s no better feeling.6.

It’s my favourite series: she stars in it and wrote it, and I’m so in awe of her as a person. The soundtrack was great, the acting was epic, and I love her style of comedy. So I’m very excited to see her next series,First Day on Earth, which starts filming this year. She’ll star in it again, and it’s about a novelist who’s offered a job in Ghana, where her estranged father lives.

It implies the presence of strong arguments which can be provided if necessary. The economist John Maynard Keynes, charged with inconsistency, famously replied, “When the facts change, I change my mind.” So, he – and we – are happily and confidently in charge of this whole operation. The world may sadly incline to inconsistency, but not us.And yet the phrase covers a great variety of mental activities, some seemingly rational and logical, others elemental and instinctive. There may be a simmering-away beneath the level of consciousness until the bursting realisation comes that, yes, you have changed your mind completely on this subject, that person, this theory, that worldview. The dadaist Francis Picabia once put it like this: “Our heads are round so that our thoughts can change direction.” And I think this feels as close to a true accounting of our mental processes as does Maynard Keynes’s statement.When I was growing up, adults of my parents’ generation used to say, “Changing her mind is a woman’s privilege.” This was, according to your male point of view, either a charming or an infuriating characteristic. It was regarded as something essentially female, or feminine, sometimes mere whimsicality, sometimes deeply emotional and intuitively intelligent – again, intuition was back then a female speciality – and related to the very nature of the woman in question. So perhaps you could say men were Keynesian, and women Picabian.Memory is key to changing our mind: we need to forget what we believed before because now we know something truer and deeperYou rarely hear that phrase about a woman’s privilege nowadays, and to many it sounds doubtless merely sexist and patronising. On the other hand, if you approach the matter from a philosophical or neuroscientific point of view, it looks a little different. “I changed my mind.” Subject, verb, object, a simple transaction under our control. But where is this “I” that is changing this “mind”, like some rider controlling a horse with their knees, or the driver of a tank guiding its progress? Certainly not very visible to the eye of the philosopher or brain scientist. This “I” we feel so confident about isn’t something beyond and separate from the mind, controlling it, but rather something inside the mind, and arising from it. In the words of one neuroscientist, “there is no self-stuff” locatable within the brain. Far from being a horse rider or tank commander, we are at the wheel of a driverless car of the near future. To the outside observer, there is a car, and a steering wheel, with someone sitting in front of it. And this is true – except that on this particular model the driver cannot switch from automatic to manual, because manual does not exist.So if things are this way round – if it’s the brain, the mind, that gives birth to what we think of as “I”, then the phrase “I changed my mind” doesn’t make much sense. You might as well say, “My mind changed me.” And if we see things this way round, then changing one’s mind is something we don’t necessarily understand ourselves. In which case, it’s not just a woman’s privilege, but a human privilege. Though perhaps “privilege” isn’t quite the right word – better to say, characteristic, or oddity.View image in fullscreenLady Ottoline Morrell tested the attitudes of Oxford undergraduates and predicted they would change with time.Photograph: George C Beresford/Getty ImagesSometimes in my life, I’ve been a logical Keynesian about the whole business, sometimes a dadaist Picabian. But generally, in either case, I’ve been confident that I was right to change my mind. This is another characteristic of the process. We never think, Oh, I’ve changed my mind and have now adopted a weaker or less plausible view than the one I held before, or a sillier or more sentimental view. We always believe that changing our mind is an improvement, bringing a greater truthfulness, or a greater sense of realism, to our dealings with the world and other people. It puts an end to vacillation, uncertainty, weak-mindedness. It seems to make us stronger and more mature; we have put away yet another childish thing. Well, we would think that, wouldn’t we?I remember the story of an Oxford undergraduate of literary aspirations visiting Garsington Manor in the 1920s where the artistic hostess Lady Ottoline Morrell presided. She asked him, “Do you prefer spring or autumn, young man?” He replied spring. Her riposte was that when he got older he would probably prefer autumn. In the late 1970s I interviewed the novelist William Gerhardie, who was almost exactly half a century older than me. I was young and callow, he was extremely aged, indeed bed-ridden. He asked me if I believed in the afterlife. I said that I didn’t. “Well, you might when you get to my age,” he replied with a chuckle. I admired him for the remark, while not believing that I would ever change my mind to that degree.But we all expect, indeed approve of, some changes over the years. We change our minds about many things, from matters of mere taste – the colours we prefer, the clothes we wear – to aesthetic matters – the music, the books we like – to adherence to social groups – the football team or political party we support – to the highest verities – the person we love, the god we revere, the significance or insignificance of our place in the seemingly empty or mysteriously full universe. We make these decisions – or these decisions make us – constantly, though they are often camouflaged by the momentousness of the acts that provoke them. Love, parenthood, the death of those close to us: such matters reorient our lives, and often make us change our minds. Is it merely that the facts have changed? No, it’s more that areas of fact and feeling hitherto unknown to us have suddenly become clear, that the emotional landscape has altered. And in a great swirl of emotion, our minds change. So I think, on the whole, I have become a Picabian rather than a Keynesian.Consider the question of memory. This is often a key factor in changing our mind: we need to forget what we believed before, or at least forget with what passion and certainty we believed it, because we now believe something different that we know to be truer and deeper.Memory, or the weakening or lack of it, helps endorse our new position; it is part of the process. And beyond this, there’s the wider question of how our understanding of memory changes. Mine certainly has over my lifetime. When I was an unreflecting boy, I assumed that memory operated like a left-luggage office. An event in our lives happens, we make some swift, subconscious judgment on the importance of that event, and if it is important enough, we store it in our memory. Later, when we need to recall it, we take the left-luggage ticket along to a department of our brain, which releases the memory back to us – and there it is, as fresh and uncreased as the moment it happened.But we know it’s not like that really. We know that memory degrades. We have come to understand that every time we take that memory out of the locker and expose it to view, we make some tiny alteration to it. And so the stories we tell most often about our lives are likely to be the least reliable, because we will have subtly amended them in every retelling down the years.Sometimes it doesn’t take years at all. I have an old friend, a considerable raconteur, who once, in my presence, in the course of a single day, told the same anecdote to three different audiences with three different punchlines. At the third hearing, after the laughter had subsided, I murmured, perhaps a little unkindly, “Wrong ending, Thomas.” He looked at me in disbelief (at my manners); I looked at him in disbelief (at his not being able to stick to a reliable narrative).I think that sometimes we remember as true things which never even happened in the first placeThere is also such a thing as a memory transplant. My wife and I were great friends of the painter Howard Hodgkin, and travelled with him and his partner to many places. In 1989, we were in Taranto in southern Italy, when Howard spotted a black towel in an old-fashioned haberdasher’s window. We went in, Howard asked to see it, and the assistant produced from a drawer a black towel. No, Howard explained, it wasn’t quite the same black as the one in the window. The assistant, unflustered, produced another one, and then another one, each of which Howard rejected as not being as black as the one in the window. After he had turned down seven or eight, I was thinking (as one might), for God’s sake, it’s only a towel, you only need it to dry your face. Then Howard asked the assistant to get the one out of the window, and we all saw at once that it was indeed very, very slightly blacker than all the others. A sale was concluded, and a lesson about the precision of an artist’s eye learned. I described this incident in an essay about Howard, and doubtless told it orally a few times as well. Many years later, after Howard’s death, I was at dinner in painterly circles when a woman, addressing her husband, said, “Do you remember when we went into that shop with Howard for a black towel…” Before she could finish, I reminded her firmly that this wasmystory, which her expression clearly acknowledged. And I don’t believe she was doing it knowingly: she somehow remembered it as happening to her and her husband. It was an artless borrowing – or a piece of mental cannibalism, if you prefer.View image in fullscreenArtist Howard Hodgkin’s eye for colour provided Barnes with an amusing anecdote – until someone else appropriated it.Photograph: Martin Argles/The GuardianIt’s salutary to discover, from time to time, how other people’s memories are often quite different from our own – not just of events, but of what we ourselves were like back then. A few years ago, I had an exchange of correspondence about one of my books with someone whom I’d been at school with, but had not kept up with and had no memory of. The exchange turned into a sharp disagreement, at which point he clearly decided he might as well tell me what he thought of me – or, more accurately, tell me what he remembered now of what he had thought of me back when we were at school together. “I remember you,” he wrote, “as a noisy and irritating presence in the Sixth Form corridor.” This came as a great surprise to me, and I had to laugh, if a little ruefully. My own memory insisted – and still does – that I was a shy, self-conscious and well-behaved boy, though inwardly rebellious. But I couldn’t deny this fellow pupil’s reminiscence; and so, belatedly, I factored it in, and changed my mind about what I must have been like – or, at least, how I might have appeared to others – 50 and more years ago.Gradually, I have come to change my mind about the very nature of memory itself. For a long time I stuck pretty much with the left-luggage-department theory, presuming that some people’s memories were better because their brain’s storage conditions were better, or they had shaped and lacquered their memories better before depositing them in the first place. Some years ago, I was writing a book that wasmainly about death, but also a family memoir. I have one brother – three years older, a philosopher by profession – and emailed him explaining what I was up to. I asked some preliminary questions about our parents – how he judged them as parents, what they had taught us, what he thought their own relationship was like. I added that he himself would inevitably feature in my book. He replied with an initial declaration that astonished me. “By the way,” he wrote, “I don’t mind what you say about me, and if your memory conflicts with mine, go with yours, as it is probably better.” I thought this was not just extremely generous of him, but also very interesting. Though he was only three years older than me, he was assuming the superiority of my memory. I guessed that this could be because he was a philosopher, living in a world of higher and more theoretical ideas; whereas I was a novelist, professionally up to my neck in the scruffy, everyday details of life.View image in fullscreenEconomist John Maynard Keynes famously remarked that ‘when the facts change, I change my mind’.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveBut it was more than this. As he explained to me, he had come to distrust memory as a guide to the past. By itself, unsubstantiated, uncorroborated memory was in his view no better than an act of the imagination. (James Joyce put it the other way round, “Imagination is memory” – which is much more dubious.) My brother gave an example. In 1976 he had gone to a philosophical conference on Stoic logic held at Chantilly, north of Paris, organised by Jacques Brunschwig, whom he had never met before. He took a train from Boulogne, and clearly remembered missing his stop, and having to take a taxi back up the line and arriving late as a consequence. He and Brunschwig became close friends, and 30 years later they were having dinner in Paris and reminiscing about how they first met. Brunschwig remembered how he had waited on the platform at Chantilly and immediately recognised my brother as soon as he stepped down from the train. They stared at one another in disbelief (and perhaps had to apply some Stoic logic to their quandary).That book came out 17 years ago. And in the meantime, I have come round to my brother’s point of view. I now agree that memory, a single person’s memory, uncorroborated and unsubstantiated by other evidence, is a feeble guide to the past. I think, more strongly than I used to, that we constantly reinvent our lives, retelling them – usually – to our own advantage. I believe that the operation of memory is closer to an act of the imagination than it is to the clean and reliably detailed recuperation of an event in our past. I think that sometimes we remember as true things that never even happened in the first place; that we may grossly embellish an original incident out of all recognition; that we may cannibalise someone else’s memory, and change not just the endings of the stories of our lives, but also their middles and beginnings. I think that memory, over time, changes, and, indeed, changes our mind. That’s what I believe at the moment, anyway. Though in a few years, perhaps I will have changed my mind about it all over again.This is an edited extract fromChanging My Mindby Julian Barnes, published by Notting Hill Editions on 18 March (£8.99).

With their backs turned, it is unclear exactly what the figures are doing, but their straining forms and the intensity of the scene suggests swift, coordinated action.Unlike the quiet serenity that characterises many other photographs in this series, made among fishing communities in Cornwall by Birmingham-born photographerJon Tonks, this image reflects a precarious – and occasionally perilous – livelihood.View image in fullscreen‘David had spent the day fishing for cuttlefish [at Newlyn], and I bumped into him at the harbour as he unloaded the catch to the market. The ink across his face was from the cuttlefish, released as a defence mechanism when they are caught - apparently it’s hard to wash off.’“Being out on the boat, you don’t think you’re in a dangerous situation, but you realise just how quickly it could all go wrong,” says Tonks, whose project A Fish Called Julie is the result of 18 months spent on the coast and at sea, between Newlyn, the Isles of Scilly, Mousehole and Cadgwith. “If you slipped over, went overboard, or got your foot caught in a line, it could be really dangerous.”Fortunately, Tonks avoided any such calamity during his time at sea, his most severe injury sustained from long stretches holding his medium-format camera aloft. “It felt hilarious at times, being on a fishing boat that’s rolling around in the dark, trying to change a roll of film or make my flash work. And, of course, using a Hasselblad – it’s a mirror, so what I’m looking at is inverted. It’s amazing I didn’t get seasick … ”The project, which goes on show at the Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, next month, is part ofWe Feed the UK, a nationwide storytelling campaign by biocultural diversity organisation the Gaia Foundation, tasking photographers and poets to raise awareness of sustainable food producers across soil, seed and sea. From August 2023, Tonks made more than a dozen visits to the coast from his home in Bath.View image in fullscreenFootballs in nets among a string of boat bumpers.“Fishermen are really hard to get hold of,” says the 44-year-old with a wry smile. “It’s not an email situation, it’s a turn up at the harbour situation.” Relying on word of mouth and personal recommendations, Tonks quickly discovered a community willing to collaborate. “First, I went down and had a really good meeting with some people working in the sustainable fishing world to discuss what is considered sustainable,” says Tonks. “Some of the early conversations were about the size of the boat – people suggested sustainability is about a boat that’s under 10 metres.”Deliberately choosing to avoid big trawlers – which with their superior size, manpower and technology can remain at sea longer, cast nets wider and locate fishing grounds more accurately – Tonks instead focused on smaller boats. These vessels suppliedless than 15%of all fish landed in Cornish ports in 2021, yet represent a more sustainable alternative. Not only does their size dictate they pay greater heed to the elements, allowing fish stocks to replenish in bad weather, but with their ability to change quickly between fishing gear – from nets, to lines, dredges and traps – they land a more selective and sustainable catch.View image in fullscreenWill, fishing for mackerel at Newlyn.“Fishing in Cornwall is like a metaphor for life,” explains Tonks. “I love the notion that fishermen are completely governed by what the sun and wind are doing, what’s in season and what type of boat they’re going out on.” Working in harmony with the seasons and weather lends the series its rhythm. All-action shots at sea contrast with quieter moments on land; fishermen chewing the fat; Christmas lights in Mousehole onTom Bawcock’s Eve, the annual festival celebrating a fisherman who braved stormy seas to alleviate his village’s hunger.This causal relationship between environment and culture has been at the heart of Tonks’s practice since completing his masters at London College of Communication. While studying, Tonks visited Ascension Island, the British-governed territory, roughly the size of Disney World, in the middle of the South Atlantic. That trip became the catalyst forEmpire, his 2013 book exploring vestiges of British colonialism on four remote islands. Tonks’s second book,The Men Who Would Be King(2021), saw him once again investigating the legacy of imperialism via ancestral belief systems and the assimilation of Anglo-American ideals on the archipelago nation of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.View image in fullscreenHauling in the net.Though local by comparison,A Fish Called Julierepresents a similar dialogue between landscape and community, a place where, “you’d wake up in the morning, open your curtains and look at what the sea’s doing”. Indeed, the project’s title stems from this close proximity: “I’d been watching these guys off-load their catch all day, and there was this one box with two sea bass with a label on it that read ‘Julie’. It just made me laugh,” explains Tonks. “I don’t know who Julie is – it could be the name of a boat – but it made me think the fish is for someone called Julie who asked, ‘If you’ve got any sea bass, I’ll take them.’”This emphasis on local, seasonal fishing and consumption represents the urgent policy required by the industry to safeguard its longevity. “We shouldn’t be able to walk into our local supermarket and say, ‘What do I fancy today?’” says Tonks. “You should be asking, ‘What do you have?’ We’re too attuned to having everything we want, whenever we want it.”View image in fullscreen‘Jacob is showing me the eggs, or ‘berries’, being spawned by a lobster when we were out fishing off the coast of St Agnes on the Isles of Scilly. When he pulls in the pots he will check each lobster for size and if they are carrying berries. If they are too small, or they are spawning, they will be returned to the sea.’Yet in spite of prevailing customer habits, which Tonks hopes will change with rising awareness, the past 18 months have left the photographer with more reasons for optimism than concern. “A lot of the younger guys I’ve been out with are really conscious about longevity,” says Tonks. “They’re very mindful aboutnotcatching something because they know it needs time to replenish.”“I really didn’t want this to be a series of weathered fishermen. Of course, there’s a couple of weathered-looking chaps in there, but there’s also signs of youth coming through. I think it’s important for people in their 20s to see that it’s a viable career option, and there’s enough information and energy for a good future.”A Fish Called Julie by Jon Tonks is at the Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, from 3 April to 22 JuneExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe ObserverExhibitionsArtFishingCornwallfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now their worst fears have been realisedSun 16 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTShareIn late 2023, as the US presidential election was heaving into view, the author Michael Lewis called up six writers he admired – five Americans and one Briton – and asked if they’d like to contribute to an urgent new series he was putting together for theWashington Post. At the time, Lewis was hearing talk that ifDonald Trumpgot back into power, his administration would unleash a programme of cuts that would rip the federal government to shreds. Lewis decided to launch a pre-emptive strike. The series, entitled Who Is Government?, would appear in the weeks running up to the election. Its purpose, Lewis explains over a Zoom call from his book-lined study in Berkeley, California, “was to inoculate the federal workforce against really mindless attacks”. It would do this by valorising public service and, as he puts it, “jarring the stereotype people had in their heads about civil servants”.Other writers might shrink away from the notion that they could restrain a US president with a handful of essays, but Lewis has an outsized sway. Author of such mega-bestsellers asLiar’s PokerandFlash Boys, he has a knack for writing about arcane concepts in business, finance and economics in ways that don’t just enlighten the uninitiated but whip along with the pace of an airport thriller. Hollywood loves him:Moneyball,The Blind SideandThe Big Shortall got turned into hit movies crammed with A-listers. So when Lewis speaks out about the forces shaping our world, even if it concerns something as seemingly unsexy as the federal government, people tend to listen.View image in fullscreen‘When he speaks out about the forces shaping our world, people tend to listen’: US author Michael Lewis.Photograph: SHP/AlamyThe British writerJohn Lanchester, who contributed a standout piece to the series, got a glimpse of Lewis’s appeal when they first met in 2014. It was behind the stage at the London School of Economics. Lanchester had agreed to interview Lewis aboutFlash Boys, which plumbs the murky world of high-frequency trading. “Not only was the venue sold out,” Lanchester recalls, “but they’d had to add on another room at the theatre for people to watch, and that was sold out too. I remember thinking: ‘There’s a tube strike on, it’s absolutely pissing down, nobody’s going to come.’ But not a bit of it. The place was packed.”Lanchester is no slouch himself when it comes to turning knotty financial matters into page-turners. An acclaimed novelist (The Debt to Pleasure,Capital) who used toreview restaurants for theGuardian, in 2010 he published a book about the financial crash –Whoops!: Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay– that gave a sweeping overview of the global economy while mercilessly skewering its absurdities. Now he regularly takes his filleting knife to topics ranging from Brexit to cryptocurrencies for theLondon Review of Books.View image in fullscreen‘Transforming knotty financial matters into page-turners’: British author John Lanchester photographed in 2020.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverSince their 2014 meeting, the pair have become good friends, with an odd-couple dynamic that’s entertaining to witness. Lewis is hyper-engaged and talks in a confident New Orleans drawl about the iniquities of Trump and Elon Musk; Lanchester, joining us from his kitchen in London, seems more mild-mannered at first but his easy-going demeanour hides a biting wit. They clearly enjoy each other’s work and company. “I make a point of inviting him for dinner whenever I’m in London,” says Lewis, “and I try to get him over here whenever I can. And of course I looped him into this series …”Who Is Government? isn’t Lewis’s first foray into the workings of the US civil service. In 2017, soon after Trump got in for the first time, Lewis had an insight into just how unprepared the new president was to take over the US government’s various branches. “The Obama administration had spent six months preparing a series of briefings for the transition,” he recalls, “but then Trump won and he just didn’t show up. So I decided to fly to Washington and find out what went on inside the government.” He wrote up his findings in three articles forVanity Fair, later gathering them into the 2018 bestselling bookThe Fifth Risk. Among the people he spoke to who’d been neglected by the Trump team were officials tending the US nuclear arsenal.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks at his inauguration in Washington on 20 January 2025.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockAs the 2024 election approached, amid warnings that Trump might do much worse than neglect the civil service if he got back into power, Lewis decided to revisit the government’s inner workings. Joining him for the ride this time wasDave Eggers, who reported on a team of scientists probing for extraterrestrial life from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. In turn,Geraldine Brooksprofiled online sleuths at the Internal Revenue Service who uncover evidence of cybercrime and child sexual abuse in the darker regions of the net, andW Kamau Bellwrote touchingly about his Black goddaughter’s work as a paralegal at the justice department.For his part, Lewis tracked down a mining engineer at the labour department named Christopher Mark, whose research had helped prevent fatal roof falls in underground mines. He also wrote about Heather Stone, a rare-diseases expert at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who had saved lives by fast-tracking authorisation for an experimental drug to treat potentially lethal balamuthia infections.Lanchester, meanwhile, opted to write not about a person but a number – the consumer price index, a fiendishly complex statistic that acts as the main official measure of inflation. The lack of a human protagonist doesn’t make the piece any less absorbing, and Lanchester has fun uncovering the staggering amount of data on seemingly insignificant matters (such as the average length of the adult bedbug or the average annual income for a nuclear medicine technologist in Albany, New York) that the federal government hoovers up every year.View image in fullscreenA protest in Charleston, West Virginia, at the cuts to federal government diversity initiatives.Photograph: Chris Dorst/APThe overall effect of the series, just published as a book –Who Is Government?: The Untold Story of Public Service– is to transform civil servants from faceless bureaucrats into selfless superheroes. It’s a cracking read but sadly, contrary to Lewis’s hopes, it did nothing to prevent the flurry of devastating cuts that Trump and Musk, via his “department of government efficiency” (Doge), have inflicted on the government over the past couple of months. Of the 3 million-plus federal workers,it’s estimated that more than 20,000 have already been fired. Many of the subjects of the book are at risk of losing their jobs.“Maybe we’re in early stages in the war, but it’s amazing how little effect the series has had,” Lewis says ruefully. “Not only have I not heard a peep fromDoge, but I haven’t had any sense that they were worried about what I might write. Though I did send Elon Musk an email asking if I can move in and watch what he was doing. He didn’t respond.”Musk isn’t the only tech billionaire behaving erratically. From conception to publication, theWashington Postseries had the full support of the newspaper’s owner. “Jeff Bezos was very excited to be covering the government in any way you could,” says Lewis. “Every piece, he’d call [then opinion editor] David Shipley, and Shipley would call me, saying: ‘Bezos loves this thing.’ But things have changed.” The day before our conversation, in a move widely interpreted as a knee-bend to Trump, Bezos announced that the newspaper’s opinion section would now be dedicated to supporting “personal liberties and free markets”. Shipley resigned before the announcement.Now Lewis and Lanchester are looking back at a collection of essays conceived in a more hopeful time and wondering what will become of the departments they wrote about – and the country that relies on them. They are not optimistic. Over the course of our 90-minute conversation towards the end of last month, they talked about the motivation behind Trump and Musk’swar on the civil service, its probable effects on the US and the lessons the UK should be taking.You say in the intro toWho Is Government?that “the sort of people who become civil servants tend not to want or seek attention”. Was it hard to find interesting people to write about?ML:It took about a nanosecond. And I think there’s a reason for that: there are just a lot of great subjects [in the federal government], and the minute they face existential risk, they become really interesting. They’re weird and different. They’re not interested in money, for a start. They’ve got some purpose in their lives.Was the entire series written before Trump’s re-election?ML:All except for the last piece [about rare diseases expert Heather Stone], which was conceived before, but I didn’t write it until after. What I’m doing now is getting all the writers to go back to their characters to ask what’s happening to them. Both my characters look like they’re about to be fired. Heather has been told that the whole enterprise of dealing with infectious disease is going to be axed from the FDA. And [mining engineer] Chris Mark texted me the other day to say: “They’ve cut our purchasing authority and they want us to hand in our credit cards.” So if they’re not gone, most of our characters are disabled. It’s like watching a toddler loose inside of a nuclear reactor pushing buttons.You two are watching from afar. Are you watching the end of our democracy? Or are you watching some kind of false jeopardy situation?JL:Well, we had an exchange over email about this, and I’ve been thinking about what you said, Michael, that we’ll probably muddle through but we are playing Russian roulette with democracy. That image lodged in my head. And the thing that is deeply shocking and surprising is that nobody seems to give a shit about [the government cuts].The cuts are being made in the name of efficiency but it looks more like an ideological purge. Is that how you see it?ML:I don’t think it’s one person’s will being exerted; it’s a combination of Trump, Musk andRussell Vought, who’s now the director of the office of management and budget. He was the architect of that Project 2025 book and he’s a Christian nationalist-slash-libertarian, whatever that is. Trump is the easiest to grok. He’s a trust-destroying machine. He needs chaos where nobody trusts anybody and then there’s a weird level playing field, and he excels in that environment.Musk is like an addict. He’s addicted to the attention – he’s stuck his finger in the social media socket and his brain is friedMichael LewisMy simple view of Musk is that he’s like an addict. He’s addicted to the attention, the drama – he’s stuck his finger in the social media socket and his brain is fried. He’s probably got cheerleaders, his little Silicon Valley crowd, telling him he’s doing a great thing, but most of them don’t know anything about it or the consequences. Vought’s the only one, I think, with a clear vision, but it’s a weird vision – really drastically minimum government. Those are the threads I see of what’s going on, and the backdrop is that they can do anything and the polls don’t move – people here don’t seem to care.But isn’t it only a matter of time before people do start to care… once theeffects of the cuts kick in?ML:The pessimistic response is that, when things go wrong, there’ll be a war of narratives. The Trump narrative will inevitably say something like: “These bureaucrats screwed it up,” and it creates even more mistrust in the thing that you actually need to repair. I do think we’re going to muddle through. But I don’t think Trump’s ever going to get blamed in the ways he ought to. And whoever comes and fixes it is never going to get the credit they should.JL:When you look at the historical analogies to this kind of collective delusion, it’s quite hard to think of a way of recovering from losing a sense of an agreed consensus reality. The only historical examples I can think of is, basically, you lose a catastrophic war. You know, the Germans lose and they wake up and they have a reckoning with their past. But that’s historically quite rare and hard to imagine … But maybe that’s too dark. Maybe what happens is specific impacts arise from specific programmes being cut that make people think: “Oh, actually, that’s not such a great idea.”Aclip just circulatedof Musk talking abouttheUS Agency for International Development (USAid)and he said something like: “Oh yeah, we made a couple little mistakes, like we briefly cut Ebola prevention there for just a second, then we brought it back again.”And then I saw someone who ran the USAid Ebola response during one of the outbreaks saying: “That’s flatly not true [that Musk restored the Ebola response].” Musk talks loudly about fraud and theft in government, but these things aren’t fraud and theft – they’re just programmes they don’t like. In fact I haven’t actually seen anything that you could with a straight face categorise as fraud – have you, Michael?ML:There’s almost no worse place to be trying to engage in fraud or theft than the US government, because there are so many eyes on you. When you take a federal employee out to lunch, they won’t let you pay for their sandwich – they’re so terrified. In fact it’s far easier to engage in fraud and theft in a Wall Street bank or a Silicon Valley startup, and there’s probably much more waste too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have lots of one degree of separations.Walter Isaacson, who wrote Musk’s biography, is an old friend. I basically watched him do that project – I followed it blow by blow.JL:Isaacson basically lived with Musk for, what, nine months, and there’s not a single commentary on politics at any point in the whole book. In 2022, Musk was still a Democrat. It’s just utterly bizarre. And I think part of the frenzy and vehemence comes from an extraordinary naivety about [government]. He actually doesn’t know anything about it, and he didn’t care about it until about 10 minutes ago.One thing that strikes me about Doge is how adversarial it is without it having to be. You could run a project like this, unleashing a roomful of 20-year-olds on the systems of government, without saying that everyone who works in federal government is a criminal. You could just ask: “How could the systems be made to work better?” Because $7tn [the approximate annual budget of the federal government] is quite a lot of money to spend and it’d be astonishing if there wasn’t some waste in there. But you could do it without making people frightened.And it worries me, because lots of things that happen in the US come back over the Atlantic. It happened with Reagan and Thatcher. It happened with Clinton providing the template for New Labour. So I suspect a version of this is going to come back over here.If the UK is going to do a zero-based review of government spending, let’s do it without framing civil servants as the enemyJohn LanchesterWhat lessons should the UK be taking from this?JL:Well, that’s one of them. If we were going to do what they call a zero-based review of government spending, let’s do it without framing them as the enemy, because it’s deeply unhelpful. Also, I wouldn’t be astonished if this attack on DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion in companies and organisations] came over. I think we should brace for impact on that one.For your essay, John, why did you decide to write about a number instead of a human being?JL:It’s partly intellectual vanity, but I really like the challenge in writing about structures and systems. We’re hardwired to like stories about people, but a lot of the most important stories in the world don’t have individual people as their central character. We’re very resistant to the idea that we don’t have agency as individuals.Your writing on economics arose from the research you did for your novelCapital, didn’t it?JL:Yeah, that’s right. I’d been following the financial crisis and ended up knowing a lot about it, so I wrote a nonfiction book [Whoops!] in order to quarantine that information, because one of the problems with research from the fiction point of view is that you end up having to use it. It’s very difficult to research a topic and then say: “You know what, that doesn’t really belong in the book.” But finance is difficult to dramatise because of the level of detail involved. It’s kind of anti-erotic in fiction to just explain things.Michael, in the other direction, have you ever come upon a story that didn’t quite work as reportage and you wished you had a novelist’s toolkit to turn it into fiction?ML:No, but I have had moments where I thought: “This story is not mine because I’m just not equipped to write it.” And I wrote one of them – a book about Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, the two Israeli psychologists [2016’sThe Undoing Project]. I had that story land in my lap, with privileged access, and I spent eight years arguing with myself [about whether] I was the person to do it. I was sure that someone else better equipped – a subject-matter specialist – would come along and write the book. Then the people I had interviewed started dying off and I realised that no one was.JL:With quite a lot of these stories, the subject-matter expert is precisely the person who can’t tell the story.ML:That’s right. They don’t have the childlike wonder about it all. They don’t ask the simple questions. because they’re too deep in it … But no, I’ve never been frustrated by my lack of novelistic flair, and I never had a strong desire to write a novel. My literary frustration is all in screenwriting. I’ve had a very successful career as a failed screenwriter. I’ve been paid over and over to do these things, and they never got made.The world of screenwriting is a profound mystery, because you see all the shit they make. What’s the process? You’re turning down these things and makingthat? I worked on an adaptation of my last novel,The Wall, but then Apple said: “Really sorry, we have a competing project.” The competing project was calledExtrapolationsand I’ll give you a cash prize if you can get through a single episode. They spent tens and tens of millions on it. And it’s off-the-scale, unbelievably, face-meltingly bad.One problem for writersnow is that there’s just such a blizzard of extraordinary news. How do you get a foothold and decide what to write about?JL:Perhaps this is more a matter of temperament than anything else, but I’m feeling that I have to step back a bit until it’s clear what the shape of it is, because my hunch would be some form of horrific implosion and the wheels falling off and chaos ensuing. But I thought that last time that Trump was president.ML:I’m going to Washington for much of April, and I have a character in mind, but I want to test it. It’s kind of a dark, funny book that I want to write, and I’ve got to see if this character can sustain that. Generally, I’m with John in that I like to wait and see. I feel like my role in the war is sniper. Don’t give away your position. You’re going to get one shot at this. Wait until you get the clean shot and take it. But I don’t think we’re far away from having the clean shot.JL:Given that you were on to [the possibility of Trump getting re-elected and gutting the federal government] when we spoke 18 months ago, Michael, are you surprised by how this has played out? Is it basically what you imagined, or is it weirder, more extreme?ML:I’d never have predicted this. I know Trump said that he could go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and the supporters would still be with him …JL:I believe that.I didn’t think Trump would do what he’s doing materially to his own base. It isn’t the behaviour of someone who is maximising his political futureMichael LewisML:But I didn’t think he’d do what he’s doing materially to his own base. I mean, two days ago he partially gutted the veterans’ healthcare system. This is the healthcare system in a lot of the rural US. That’s his base. And who would have predicted the alliance with Musk? Not me. I would have thought they’d have a falling out after three days, that there just isn’t enough oxygen in the room for both of them. If you’re looking for the simplest explanation for what’s going on, if Trump was a Russian asset, I don’t know if he’d behave any differently from how he’s behaving. I’m not saying he is, but it isn’t the behaviour of someone who is maximising his political future – it’s someone who’s maximising the damage to society. And why would you do that? He was supposed to get rid of illegal immigrants, stop inflation, cut taxes, whatever. But [gutting the civil service] has become the central feature of his administration. I just didn’t think he cared that much about it.View image in fullscreen‘I’d like to think the real Bezos is the man who married MacKenzie Scott’: Amazon and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos with his current partner Lauren Sánchez.Photograph: CraSH/imageSPACE/REX/ShutterstockWhich is the realBezos; the one who was supportive of this series celebrating public service or the one who’s now dedicating theWashington Post’sopinion pages to championing free markets?ML:I feel some sympathy towards Bezos. I really like him, personally. He’s fun to talk to. He seems to be basically sane. He’s not obviously megalomaniacal or even that self-absorbed. He’s really interested in the world around him. He makes sense on a lot of subjects. So I think the real Bezos is not a bad guy.But he’s done a bad thing. And it’s curious why. You would think, if you had $200bn, that you’d have some fuck-you money. I mean, how much do you have to have to be able to live by your principles? There’s some curve that bends, and at some point, when you have so much money, you’re back to being as vulnerable as someone who has almost nothing. He’s behaving like someone who has nothing, like he’s just scared of Trump. I think if you were with him and watching every step, you’d be watching an interesting psychological process where he’s persuaded himself that what he’s doing is good. He’s rationalised his behaviour, but his behaviour is really appalling.JL:How fucking craven do you have to be, if you can lose 99% of your net worth and still be worth $2bn and you can’t say “fuck you” to proto-fascists? The thing that is frightening is that people like him, men like him, are looking into the future and basically assuming that the US is going to become a kind of fascist state. Because, I mean, $2bn is enough to say “fuck you”. But if the US is now going to become a Maga [Make America Great Again] theocracy, and we just had the last election we’re ever going to have, then maybe he’s positioning for that. I don’t know that to be true, but that’s my darkest version.Who Is Government?: The Untold Story of Public Service,edited by Michael Lewis, is published by Allen Lane (£25).

Though almost certainly inspired by that first fiction of breached borders, this second hoax was not broadcast by a Hollywood star but organised by the state branch of the veterans’ organisation, the American Legion. This was presumably due to fears that people were not taking seriously enough the communist threat to Truman’s America from Stalin’s Soviet Union.On that midwest mayday in the middle of the 20th century, the town mayor and police chief were dragged from their beds by “reds”, the library was purged of subversive texts and diner menus substituted potato soup and black bread for the usual meats and sweets. Although this was an exercise in pretence, a real-life local leader was dead by the end.The fake takeover is a true story, but the records are sketchy. And so The Mosinee Project – a three-actor piece created by the Counterfactual company – soon moves from research (recorded interviews with living witnesses) to speculation, through imagined rehearsals for the May Day and multiple versions of some scenes.View image in fullscreenMartha Watson Allpress (centre) The Mosinee Project.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianFascinatingly, two of the creators of the mock occupation were themselves former communists, allowing writer-director Nikhil Vyas fun with the idea of whether disguise can morph from a lie into a life. Are some Wisconsin Republicans possibly entering too enthusiastically into the commie cosplay? Might one of the ex-reds only be pretending to have embraced American democracy?The three actors – Camilla Anvar, Jonathan Oldfield and Martha Watson Allpress – play multiple roles with impressive fluidity of nationality and gender. At a time when the reality of the “red scare” is again the subject of debate in Europe, The Mosinee Project has topical resonance as well as historical fascination. But there is sometimes frustration in not knowing what actually happened. This entertaining 70-minute exercise in levels of reality leads us to other sources on the story, and Counterfactual might usefully explore a more fully fictional telling.At theNew Diorama theatre, London, until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

One is dementia and the dread of a once sharp mind losing its edge and autonomy. The other is a demented senior psychopath with an eyeless doll repurposed as a glove puppet, who terrorises the fellow residents of his nursing home.The Rule of Jenny Penplays out as a battle of wills between former judge Stefan Mortensen (Geoffrey Rush), newly arrived as a patient at the facility after a stroke, and the monstrous, cackling Dave Crealy (a thoroughly chilling John Lithgow) and his demonic rubber sidekick, Jenny Pen.There are moments of greatness in this bracingly malicious tale of elder abuse. The opening sequence, which captures the disorientation and reality slippage resulting from Stefan’s stroke, is superb. The use of sound and music (the chirpy cockney anthem Knees Up Mother Brown takes on a sense of choking menace) is first-rate. And both central performances are impressive. Where the picture founders is in a repetitive screenplay that clumsily switches character perspectives and squanders much of the story’s initial promise.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for The Rule of Jenny Pen.Explore more on these topicsHorror filmsThe ObserverThrillersJohn LithgowGeoffrey RushreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mangan suffers fromtsundoku, a Japanese term that may well have been coined simply to torment Marie Kondo: buying books at a rate that outstrips the speed at which you can read them, and keeping them all. Mangan has 10,000. Filling the very many shelves, as she recounts in this memoir, took her ages. She enjoyed every rapturous moment.“I am never happier than when I am in a bookshop,” she writes, and soof courseshe creates one for herself. Only reluctantly does she leave its four walls. When not reviewing television shows for theGuardian– even bibliophiles need day jobs – she’s in her customised womb, reading. “If we stop reading, we stop putting ourselves in other people’s shoes,” she writes. “We cut ourselves off from avenues of growth, exploration and adventure.”When adolescence arrives, she bones up on Jilly Cooper to ready herself for the love stuffDespite a pronounced introversion, Mangan does crave adventure, even if it’s of the armchair variety. She is voracious in her tastes, and consumes everything from Victorian classics to airport thrillers to the genre that used to be calledchick-lit. Each in their own way has taught her how to live. An example: when adolescence arrives, she bones up on Jilly Cooper to ready herself for the love stuff.“I did get a boyfriend,” she writes. “He was nice. When he broke up with me, I was upset but pleased to have the insight.” Frankly, she’s relieved to be rid of him. “You have all the time back for reading that used to be spent lying on his bed trying to avoid his penis.”After university, Mangan thinks she might want to become a librarian because, well, becausebooks. But she wants to write, too, and ends up doing just that at theGuardian, where she is prone to cower in corners. When one day a colleague catches her nose-deep in Dan Brown’sThe Da Vinci Code, he is visibly appalled. “Book snobbery,” she primly notes, “is among the most dismal of all the snobberies.”Bookishis the sequel to2018’sBookworm, and treads pretty much the same path. If that first volume recounted how literature had helped her navigate the mysteries of childhood, then its sequel tackles the myriad complexities of adulthood. She reads to bring herself closer to her book-loving father, and when she is distressed by world events. She makes for a wonderfully incisive critic and can pick apart a George Orwell with the same perspicacity with which she can, say, a Jack Reacher, or the lesser-known Brontë sister, Anne, whose 1848 novelThe Tenant of Wildfell Hallshe adores. But her memoir can also be read as a comic novel, drenched as it is inSue Townsendsnark. Like Townsend, she skewers everyday events for their comedic potential. When, Jane Austenishly, she eventually does bag herself a husband, a “lovely” historian, she resents the time it takes up. “A big fuss,” she says of the enveloping wedding plans. “I wouldn’t do anything like it again.”You might think that her husband – bookish himself – would have known what he was getting into here, but no. Shortly after their wedding, he foolishly suggests they merge their libraries. His new bride is horrified. Does he really know so little about her? Mangan explains that it wouldn’t be a merging of their collections, “it would be a breaking up of mine, an unnecessary intrusion, an act of violence”. And now to the punchline: “I agreed to have a baby instead.”There’s a BBC Four sitcom here, surely: David Mitchell and Victoria Coren Mitchell, all elbow patches and cracked paperbacks, and love among the margins.Bookish: How Reading Shapes Our Livesby Lucy Mangan is published by Square Peg (£18.99).

But Ballet Black’s artistic director, Cassa Pancho, has chosen Oyinkan Braithwaite’s hit novelMy Sister, the Serial Killeras the source material for her new ballet, and blood-spill is inevitable.Pancho foundedBallet Blackin 2001 and has commissioned numerous choreographers over two decades but very rarely made work for the company herself. Here she shows real directorial nous (and has recruited associate choreographer Jacob Wye and rehearsal director Charlotte Broom to help generate the steps, along with the dancers). The novel is a savvy choice: a zeitgeisty title but also a story with a love triangle and high-stakes drama. While keeping dark comedy and light tone, Pancho has slimmed down the plot. Whole characters are lost, along with some nuance and backstory – the serial-killing sister in question, Ayoola (Helga Paris-Morales), comes off as a straight-up psychopath whereas in the book more layers materialise – but it’s all done with purpose. The same is true of the choreography itself, where everything has a function driven by the drama, such as the short scene showing Ayoola and older sister Korede (Isabela Coracy) bonding over a groove, establishing the connection that keeps Korede clearing up her sister’s mess.Coracy is great in the central role, torn between sibling loyalty and her own desires and demons, who come crowding the stage in corporeal form. There’s skilful support from Ebony Thomas as dashing doctor Tade.Keep dancing: Chanel DaSilva on taking risks, dealing with grief and tackling TrumpRead moreThe other half of this double bill isn’t as strong, but it’s interesting nonetheless: the UK debut from New York choreographerChanel DaSilva. A Shadow Work is based on the idea of the shadow self, the parts of our personality we repress. In this case they are trapped in a box held by our protagonist (Taraja Hudson, a pleasure to watch), who is on a journey to acceptance. It’s all very clear, the company looking disciplined, and DaSilva has a nice line in recurring motifs, as when Hudson softly raps her fist on her chest, like a racing heart. Or thrusts her arms above her head to make a sharp peak, which could be a sign of prayer, protection, resolve or even imminent violence.The relationship between Hudson and her “shadows”, danced by the ensemble in black, contrasting with Hudson’s white, is in turn fearful, playful and sympathetic. The choreography is very precise but it feels as though there could be another potential layer to get stuck into; perhaps that feelingis exacerbated by Cristina Spinei’s score, which is all very much of a single timbre and would benefit from the texture of live instruments. But there’s a solid idea here from DaSilva, even if it can’t match the audience appeal of a sweetly smiling serial killer.AtBirmingham Repon 27 and 28 March,then touring.Explore more on these topicsStageDanceBallet BlackBalletOyinkan BraithwaitereviewsShareReuse this content"

For many new mothers, the abrupt severance from their professional lives and previous identities can leave them flailing in a strange and destabilising limbo where it seems almost taboo to voice any feelings of dislocation, in case these come across as a lack of maternal devotion.Barnett proposes that the whole business should be rebranded– rather than “maternityleave”, which suggests a nice relaxing break, it should be styled “maternityservice”, with all the latter term’s connotations of a military tour of duty. Words such as “duty” and “service” are unfashionable these days, she says, but it can help to reframe this strange, formless, sleep-deprived time as a finite period in which you are performing a series of tasks in the service of keeping your newborn alive. There are echoes here ofClaire Kilroy’s brutally honest novel of early motherhood,SoldierSailor, in which the narrator is the soldier of the title; Barnett mentions that she and a new mother comrade still greet each oother as “soldier”.This may sound rather a grim and brutal depiction of what is widely supposed to be a joyful time, but Barnett’s mission is to separate maternity leave as an experience from the new mother’s feelings about her baby. Even when the child is adored and longed-for (both Barnett’s children were born after gruelling rounds of IVF), these early months can leave women feeling cut off from the wider world, their partner and their former selves, and her aim is to offer ways to navigate this rupture.By her own admission, she is not the first writer to attempt a warts-and-all rendition of the physical and psychological demands of this life-stage. Over the past decade or so, an increasing number of women have articulated, in fiction and memoir, the ambivalence, drudgery and isolation that attend new motherhood and were once considered unsayable. For this freedom to be candid, Barnett says, “we owe a debt to those who initially transgressed and sometimes paid a price for it. First mention goes to the important writing of Rachel Cusk, starting with her searingA Life’s Work.”Barnett mentions that she and a new mother comrade still greet one aeach onother as “soldier”If Barnett’s book lacks the poetry of Cusk’s 2001 memoir (my life raft during my own maternity leave, 23 years ago), it is written with a different purpose: less a literary and philosophical inquiry into the inequalities and conflicting emotions inherent in motherhood, and more of a practical how-to guide.Barnett explains that she is writing in real time, during her second tour of duty – thoughts jotted down in snatched moments between feeds or while her infant daughter naps. In an encouragingly breezy tone, she offers advice on how to adopt a practical uniform or build a semblance of a daily routine, as well as the importance of connecting with other “sisters-in-arms” and being honest when you are struggling, to relieve one another of the pressure to look as if everything is under control. This frankness is also essential for future generations of mothers, she explains: “And when they do ask us, the women who have gone before them, for an honest account of maternity leave and beyond, we struggle to explain it. We partly gloss over the truth out of loyalty to and love of our own beautiful babies.”Emma Barnett: ‘Maternity leave is a land where time bends’Read moreThere are, inevitably, limits to the applicability of these lessons. Barnett is careful to check her privilege at every step, but she is writing principally for women from a similar demographic to her own – middle-class professionals, who find their work stimulating (more so than wiping up poo, anyway) and who miss their autonomy and the previous sense of equality in their relationship.These caveats aside, Barnett is a sympathetic and cheerful companion, and in writing this book she has provided valuable dispatches from the front line, the better to enable a more honest transmission of hard-won wisdom to her own daughter and all the mothers yet to embark on this bloody weird journey.Maternity Service: A Love Letter to Mothers from the Front Line of Maternity Leaveby Emma Barnett is published by Fig Tree (£12.99).

The most affecting moments in this big-hearted musical come when tough talking gives way to tenderness. Like the genre itself, Wild Rose is forthright, vibrant and emotionally raw.Wittily adapted by Nicole Taylor fromher 2018 film of the same nameand staged with elan by John Tiffany, it is the story of ex-con Rose-Lynn Harlan as she tries to reconcile the need to care for her children with her ambitions to make it as a singer. Believing no country star ever came out of Glasgow, she sets her sights on Nashville. That is, after she has dealt with the cleaning job, ankle tag and night-time curfew.This is all the excuse choreographers Steven Hoggett and Vicki Manderson need to stage exuberant line dances, propelled by Ali Roocroft’s jolly eight-piece band sitting across the back of the open set by Chloe Lamford. That’s all great fun, as is the class-based comedy provided by the hard-up singer who uses “Shazam for bathrooms” to identify the price of fancy floor tiles and the appeal court judge who is surprisingly well versed in country music’s origins in Irish/Scots folk. Beneath the fanfare, this is also a show about inequality of opportunity.View image in fullscreenDawn Sievewright (centre) in Wild Rose.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicBut what strikes deep is the scenes of fragility. It is when Rose-Lynn (Dawn Sievewright) quietly articulates why country music means so much to her: “Three chords and the truth.” It is in the delay before she finds a way to sing with her children (on my night, Alfie Campbell and Lily Ferguson, both excellent). And it is when mother Marion (Blythe Duff) stands alone and vulnerable for a second-half solo.Through it all, Sievewright is a star in the most unstarry way. Quite brilliantly, she captures Rose-Lynn’s charm and streetwise patter as well as her defensiveness and fear. Scarcely off the stage, she retains an air of modesty even while singing, gloriously, without fanfare or histrionics. As with the film, the ending does not quite deliver the feelgood bounce you crave – but, fronting a joyful ensemble, Sievewright’s aim is true.At theRoyal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageMusicalsTheatreRoyal Lyceum theatreCountryreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Grand Train Tour of Switzerland – or GTToS for aficionados – certainly has the feel of an epic journey, complete with trains and boats offering panoramic views of its mountains, valleys and lakes.The GTToS takes in 1,280km of sights, many of them Unesco world heritage sites, such as the Swiss Alps of Jungfrau-Aletsch, the Matterhorn and the crystal clear waters of Lake Thun. The route is very flexible – you can hop on and off as you go.Armed with our Swiss Travel Pass, four different train lines took us from Montreux and on to Spiez, Lucerne, Locarno and Sion. The pass is a dream ticket, offering unlimited trains, boats and buses for up to 15 days, entry to 500 museums for no extra charge and half-price for some mountain excursions.We set off on a rainy Tuesday morning, taking the Eurostar from London to Paris and then on to Montreux via Geneva. Our first excursion was a visit to the Château de Chillon, which sits on Lake Geneva. Built in the 11th century, it is the biggest castle fortress in Europe and also, with good reason, the most visited monument in Switzerland. The pin-up medieval castle blends the Gothic and Romanesque, its vaults and windows of particular note. We did a whistle-stop tour of the four courtyards, bedrooms and watchtower with its 16th-century bell, before taking a short bus ride back into Montreux.View image in fullscreenZoom with a view: the Matterhorn, seen from the train.Photograph: oatawa/Getty ImagesThere, I made straight for the Freddie Mercury tour, which starts in the covered market. Needing to keep a low profile and his head down at the height of his fame, Queen’s frontman lived in Montreux on and off from 1978 until his death in 1991.The tour started at his bronze statue overlooking Lake Leman, Mercury’s fist punching up into the air, and ended at the Montreux Casino where Queen recorded six of their albums. Their Mountain Studio now houses an exhibition dedicated to the band, showcasing outfits worn onstage by Freddie, includingthatyellow jacket with the straps. Seeing slot machines and roulette wheels below such an iconic place in music history felt almost surreal.That afternoon it was time for the first leg of the GTToS, the Goldenpass Express: a two-hour journey from Montreux to Spiez. With its navy blue exterior and golden interior, it all felt rather luxurious, even in second class. The train’s enormous windows afforded panoramic views of stunning landscapes, brown Simmental cows with bells around their necks and trees turning into spring’s fresh green foliage.View image in fullscreenCrystal clear: Lake Thun, seen by ferry.Spiez is a small town beside tranquil Lake Thun. After a walk around the lake, I climbed approximately 75 steps up to Spiez Castle, with more fabulous views, this time of the Bernese Alps and the lake below.An early morning ferry on Lake Thun took us past Beatenberg, Europe’s longest village, which stretches more than 12km before arriving at Interlaken. Walking through the city took us to the Jungfrau mountain range to the right and the Grand Hotel, which looks like something from a Wes Anderson film, given its grandeur and nostalgic feel. It had a tourist resort vibe about it, with souvenir shops on every turn but, overhead, paragliders dotted the brilliant blue sky, the Jungfrau mountains still snow-capped.After that, we jumped on the Interlaken-to-Lucerne Express, a route famous for its stunning views of the region’s five lakes. The onboard bistro was a hit, too: I enjoyed a vegan tartare and a dish called “Ghackets mit Hornli” – a typical Swiss meal of minced beef, macaroni and Sbrinz cheese served with a side of apple sauce.Picturesque Lucerne, once the playground of aristocracy, is divided into two parts by the Reuss river and boasts seven bridges. I crossed the famous 14th-century covered Chapel Bridge, with the landmark water tower standing beside it, and went for an early evening stroll into the car-free Old Town. I spent an afternoon at the impressiveSwiss Transport Museum, which is especially fun for kids, with interactive exhibitions and simulation rides.View image in fullscreenThe Gotthard Panorama Express.Photograph: Dominik Baur/KeystoneOur next train was the Gotthard Panorama Express, via a boat ride across Lake Lucerne. Adding dramatic effect, it was a misty day, so the clouds covered much of the mountains. But on a clear day, you can see glaciers at the peaks with a height of 3,000m above sea level. For the train leg of the journey, the carriage could only be described as a cylinder spaceship. It included going through the Gotthard Tunnel, which at one time was the longest in the world at 15km.Locarno’s old town is dotted with different coloured houses, each shade denoting the status of its fishers. My hotel, the three-starHotel Garni Muralto, had spectacular views of Lake Maggiore. The next morning we took a ferry ride to Isola Grande, one of the Brissago Islands, home to Switzerland’s only botanical gardens and 2,000 types of subtropical species. If you’d told me that I’d find bamboo, curry plants and orange trees in Switzerland, I wouldn’t have believed you in a month of Sundays. We hopped back on the ferry and walked around the neighbouring Ascona, a quaint village full of designer stores and boutique outlets.Our final panoramic train journey was aboard the Centovalli Express to Sion, crossing through Italy and into the village of Domodossola. The train itself wasn’t as glamorous as the previous ones, but it didn’t matter. This scenic route passed by waterfalls, streams and vast forestry, going no faster than 40km on the almost two-hour journey.Arriving in Sion towards the evening, I hiked up to Sion Cathedral, where I viewed the city from the hilltop. I got there just in time to see a private jet land on the runway to my left as the sun set.Train travel offered a slower-paced alternative that allowed for me to see and sense all Switzerland’s unrivalled beauty had to offer. It didn’t disappoint one bit.A Swiss Travel Pass starts from 244 CHF (£215) for three days, go tomyswitzerland.com for more details;Villa Toscane, Montreux, has double rooms from £142 per night (villatoscane.ch);Seegarten Marina Spiez has double rooms from £168 per night (seegarten-marina.ch)Explore more on these topicsSwitzerland holidaysThe ObserverEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But behind the scenes there are islands, wild places and temples to exploreGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailEloise BasukiSun 16 Mar 2025 19.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 16 Mar 2025 22.00 EDTShareMuch like the problems of the show’sdeplorable characters, the White Lotus effect cannot be escaped. After the writer-director Mike White’s second season of the black comedy was released, tourists flooded its Sicilian coastal setting of Taormina, and its luxe backdrop of the Four Seasons San Domenico Palace was booked out forsix months straightpost-filming.The new season of The White Lotus is upon us, or rather it’s upon Thailand. Hundreds of thousands oftourists are expected to descendon the paradisiacal setting of Koh Samui, while cashed-up guests at the island’s Four Seasons are alreadyrequesting upgradesto the $10,000-a-night villas featured in the show. For a country that already struggles with overtourism, Thailand is bracing for impact.Local environmentalists are feeling uneasyand quite rightly too – the Thai governmentclosed Maya Bayon Koh Phi Phi for four years in 2018 after boat anchors and propellers, sunscreen contaminants and sewage destroyed the corals and marine life off the white-sand bay after it went mainstream in the 1999 movie The Beach.View image in fullscreenYou’re not going to find ultra-luxury suites on Koh Phayam, but everything you need for a beach holiday is here.Photograph: Leigh GriffithsBut thankfully there’s more of Thailand to explore – in fact there’s more than 3,000 kilometres of coastline and 1,430 islands. While these destinations don’t have five-star resorts and often require a trek to get to, you won’t have to fight another traveller for a sunbed when you get there – and that’s real value.For an island escape: Koh PhayamThere are no cars on this tiny island so, once you’ve made the 75-minute flight to the southern city of Ranong, a short minivan ride from the airport to the pier, and a 35-minute speedboat to the island, you’ll have to rent a motorbike or hire a tuk tuk to get to your accommodation.View image in fullscreenThe view from Wat Phra That Khao Noi, a hilltop temple with a 9m-tall Buddha blessing the city of Nan.Photograph: Leigh GriffithsThe long journey puts most tourists off but those who stick with it will be rewarded. The lack of cars offers a sleepier vibe and you’ll have the white-sand, aquamarine beaches to yourself. Let’s be clear: if you expect butlers at your accommodation and luxury spas at your fingertips, you’re not going to find it here. But everything you need for a relaxing island experience is: cheap Thai massages; fresh seafood; hidden beaches at every corner; cute beach bungalow accommodation; incredible snorkelling to the Surin Islands marine park, a boat ride away; plus glowing sunsets over the Andaman Sea fromHippy Bar, a drinking hole made of salvaged driftwood and shaped like a pirate ship.For a cultural experience: NanWhile most tourists head straight to Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai for their dose of Thai culture, in nearby neighbour Nan you can experience the country’s gilded temples as they should be: in peace and quiet.The small town is just a one-hour flight from Bangkok and is surrounded by mountains, making every view breathtaking, especially the panorama from Wat Phra That Khao Noi, a hilltop temple with a 9m-tall Buddha blessing the city below. Walking the tree-lined streets is a joy, with restaurants, cafes and galleries tucked into traditional teak houses. On weekends Kuang Mueang walking street comes alive for a colourful (and delicious) night market. It’s worth renting a car to get to a hike in one of the province’s seven national parks (Doi Phu Ka borders Laos and has a 2,000m-high mountain, waterfalls, caves and even wild elephants), and Bo Kleua’s natural rock salt wells.View image in fullscreenBoats on the bank of Cheow Lan Lake.Photograph: Leigh GriffithsFor natural wonders: Khao SokImagine waking up on a floating raft hut, mist rising off Cheow Lan Lake, with giant limestone karsts and ancient rainforest-covered mountains towering around you.While Khao Sok is popular with local tourists, it’s almost a secret to foreigners, and you’ll have jungle hikes through Khao Sok national park, lake cruises on longtail boats to hidden limestone caves, canoe journeys along quiet tributaries and wildlife safaris almost to yourself. Stay in one of the floating huts for the true lake experience –500 Raiis a popular one – or a bungalow in the jungle to feel away from it all. Budget travellers can take an overnight minibus direct from Bangkok, or to get there faster, a one-hour flight to Surat Thani and then a 90-minute transfer to Khao Sok village.Bangkok beyond the throngs: Bang KrachaoView image in fullscreenNo cars are allowed in Bang Krachao, which helps keep the area peaceful.Photograph: Leigh GriffithsBang Krachao is known as the Green Lung of Bangkok – its ample plant life a welcome breath of fresh air from the city’s smog-filled streets. The Chao Praya River curls around the area, making it an island within the city, and no cars are allowed, keeping the isolated neighbourhood clean and quiet. Catch the skytrain to Bang Na and a quick river ferry from Bang Na Pier, then hire bikes at the pier to explore at your own pace. Visit on a weekend to see the island’s Bang Nam Peung floating market, full of traditional Thai desserts, snacks and handicrafts. Cycle to the area’s local temples or the secret gardens of Sri Nakhon Khuean Khan park. And make theBangkok Tree Housea pit stop for lunch, an ice-cold beer or Thai milk tea, or even an overnight stay in its pretty cabins.Eloise Basuki is a food and travel writer who has spent time living, working and travelling throughout ThailandExplore more on these topicsThailand holidaysAustralian lifestyleAsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was all about sharing small plates that arrived whenever they were ready. There were wonderful flavours – confit pork belly, crab on sourdough toast, the tenderest rare steak with spiced cucumber and mint salad – with the kitchen in full view. You know the vibe, but sometimes it felt it was all a bit too hectic. Now in his third restaurant, Margo, MacDonald and his band of chefs, led by Robin Aitken, along with a crack front-of-house team, have perfected the experience of relaxed, elegant eating that still feels bohemian and adventurous.Margo is in the heart of the city, in a tall narrow Victorian street. A high illuminated M at right angles above the door feels very New York and it’s minutes from public transport in all directions. That’s crucial if you are going to sample the excellent and inventive cocktails: anyone for a Yazmine – Ron Santiago, yuzushu and Campari? Or the Black IsleBlondeorganic beer on draught? Or a glass of the zesty Laherte Frères Rosé de Meunier Extra Brut?View image in fullscreenThe queen of it all: Creedy Carver duck.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverThere was a gentle buzz of conversation and laughter, not least because it was the eve of the Michelin awards, to be held in the city for the first time, and there were several top chefs spotted at some tables. The playlist is pitch-perfect, not drowning out our voices, and perusing the menu accompanied by Echo Beach felt just right. The interior, byStuart Blackof Mosaic Architects, is welcoming and chic, with echoes of American Mission style. The space is substantial, with a beautifully curated main dining area and a mezzanine, which offer both intimate tables for two, yet includes oval tables for up to 14, with spindle-back curved banquettes all made by local carpenters.View image in fullscreen‘A lovely sharpness’: celeriac and hazelnuts.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverThere is a gentle nod to the building’s industrial past, if that’s not a contradiction in terms, with ochre and pink plastered walls, exposed stone, metalwork and polished concrete floors, all softened with luxurious pale wool and tan leather upholstery. MacDonald has owned the former warehouse building for seven years, but it was only when he was sure of what he wanted to achieve that he called in the architects. Margo is a play on his late mother’s nickname, and it is a real passion project from the man who has set a high bar for dining in the city.View image in fullscreen‘I adore parsley any way up’: bavette steak with chimchurri.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverThe menu consists of morsels of starters, just to get your tastebuds really firing. We sampled Margo’s focaccia, which was beautifully light and salty and crisp on top, accompanied by confit garlic butter, with whole golden cloves, which we fought over. We dipped precisely cut and fried chipsticks of polenta dusted with a seasoning powder of dried seaweed spices and vinegar, like very posh toast soldiers, into dips of creamy fresh taramasalata with seaweed oil and chives on top. Then little round croquettes of ham hough, smoked paprika and guindilla arrived and, honestly, if they’d kept them coming, I’d have been happy at that.View image in fullscreen‘We were rewarded’: sprouts and romesco.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverAt this point I should mention the waiting staff, who were all quietly knowledgable and not over-attentive, and wearing perfect bright-blue bespoke work shirts closed to the neck, with practical pockets. If Margo ever wants to go down the merch route, forget the napery, I’m for a shirt.For our next plates I was sorely tempted by the hand-dived Uist scallops, sobrasada and haricot beans, which was a winning combination, but I went with the crowd (well, the other three) and we settled on the cold roast lamb saag, thin slivers of pink meat with delicious black garlic and finely chopped lines of spinach, and bavette steak with chimichurri, as I adore parsley any way up, and we were rewarded with perfectly rosy Scottish beef. We chose celeriac and hazelnuts and sprouts and romesco, both of which had a lovely sharpness and a concoction of iceberg lettuce, Lord of the Hundreds cheese, tarragon and green peppercorn, which although refreshing, was rather unwieldy.View image in fullscreen‘Delicious’: cold roast lamb.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverThe queen of it all was the half Creedy Carver duck, liver parfait, marmalade and toast. Each of us reflected on our favourite part of the dish. Mine was the crispy leg and the rich dark marmalade, while we all chose the silky parfait, and the succulent breast meat was a standout for the others. The wine list was extensive and designed to suit pockets as shallow as a puddle and as deep as Loch Ness, and the sommelier paid careful attention to our food choices. We settled on one glass of Bodegas Terras Gauda, Rias Baixas O Rosal Albarino, which was, I’m assured, lemony and sharp, and for the three of us, a bottle of South AfricanKloovenburg Eight Feet Red, a Swartland-syrah blend, which was rounded and spicy, and left a rich taste on the tongue.We hadn’t quite finished, though.Bare Bonesis a terrific chocolate company in the Barras, towards the east end of the city, an area which is home to the famousBarrowland Ballroom, possibly the best music venue in the UK, and a centuries-old market, which has gone through its own reinvention. And it would have been unthinkable to have left Margo without a selection of puddings, first among them Bare Bones chocolate nemesis with vanilla ice-cream. It was rich and dark, and not at all sweet. We also shared a meltingly good brown butter almond tart, poached quince and crème fraîche, and a dish I am desperate to recreate, blood orange and bay leaf posset. The mixture of the zinging orange with the aromatic bay was the perfect antidote to the intense chocolate nemesis. Puddings are where sharing plates come into their own.View image in fullscreen‘Meltingly good’: almond tart.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverAs the evening came to an end, after a convivial and relaxed dinner, looking around Margo – the chefs working away in view below the great sweep of the mezzanine with its echoes of the prow of a Clyde-built liner, the group of revellers nearby, the intimate conversations at tables for two, some solo diners at the chef’s counter watching the action, the excitement of a table heading for the Michelin Awards the next day, and the to-ing and fro-ing of the excellent blue-clad staff – it struck me that Jonathan MacDonald has succeeded in creating something very special in memory of his mum. And to top it all, at the Michelin ceremony the next evening, in the magnificentKelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Margo, which has only been open for four months, won a coveted Bib Gourmand award for “offering high quality food at a reasonable price”. Margo has arrived.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsThe ObserverFoodScotland holidaysreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is a menu to celebrate March, with its tripping lambs and nodding daffs. Verdant shoots give vibrancy to the landscape, urban and rural, and hope is in the air. These recipes celebrate the arrival of fresh new flavours, while not being overly optimistic, with staples such as carrots and dried green peas acting as the backbone of the dishes such as rhubarb, that blushing harbinger of spring, which gives a decisive nod to better times in the charlotte pudding, along with delicately spiced ice-cream.Carrots with wild garlic and olivesDisclaimer: this is an excellent recipe for good carrots, but not best suited to the flavourless, unwieldy roots that you can bung into a stock or soup base. If you have a local farmers’ market or your supermarket has the lovely looking carrots still with their tops, then it’s worth splashing out. Steaming rather than boiling them will slightly heighten their flavour and give them a better texture.If you can’t find any wild garlic, add five cloves from a bulb at the start along with the carrots, and a small bunch of parsley at the end instead.Serves 4. Ready in 45 minutesolives60g, with a glug of their brinecarrots400g, mediumwild garlic1 bunchsea salta pincholive oil2 tbspred wine vinegar2-3 tbspblack pepperRemove the olive stones and set aside. Scrub the carrots and trim the tops.Add the carrots to a wideish pan, barely cover with water and add a glug of the olive brine, a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp of olive oil. Bring to a boil, cover with a lid and cook, simmering, over a medium heat for 30 minutes or until yielding but not too soft. I have a glass lid which is really useful as I can see how they are coming along. The water will evaporate at some point. Before they begin to fry, test with the point of a knife to check how cooked they are.Once done, add a good splash of water and the wild garlic and steam for 3 more minutes. Remove from the heat.While still warm, cut into chunks and dress with the wild garlic and any pan juices that remain, along with the vinegar, olive oil, olives and some black pepper. Set aside until ready to eat. The carrots improve from sitting for a while.Pork tenderloinView image in fullscreen‘A great cut of meat’: pork tenderloin.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverA great cut of readily available meat that, when seasoned ahead and cooked just slightly pink, punches above its weight.Serves 3 (or 2 withleftovers for a sandwich the next day).

Pound up the juniper and fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, along with the salt, before adding the peeled garlic and mashing it in to combine. Rub the salt mixture all over the pork, then cover and leave in the fridge for 24 hours.The next day, heat a couple of tbsp of oil in a trusty pan and over a medium-high heat. Sear the pork on all sides for a couple of minutes. Once golden all over, add the rosemary along with the wine and half a glass of water. Reduce the heat to medium, cover (I use a lid smaller than the frying pan so that it sits low, close to the meat) and cook for 5 minutes.Turn the pork over and cook for another 4 minutes. Set aside to rest while you make the sauce. Turn the heat up and reduce the liquid to a couple of tbsp, then add the butter and swirl together for a reduced, silky sauce. Slice the pork, set it over the sauce and serve with a drizzle of oil and pepper to season.Split peas and pancettaView image in fullscreen‘Green split peas don’t require soaking in advance’: split peas and pancetta.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverWe rely on dried pulses in the pantry throughout the year. One advantage of green split peas is that they don’t require soaking in advance so can be on the table in no time.Serves 4. Ready in 1 hourwhite onion1, smallsplit green peas200gpancetta50ggarlic2 clovesolive oil3 tbspfennel seeds1 tspsage leaves10rosemary1 small sprigblack pepper sea saltPeel the onion and cut into 6 segments. Add to a smallish pot with the peas and cover with about 6cm of water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes until cooked.Stir from time to time to release any peas that may become stuck to the bottom, adding a splash more water when necessary. The peas will probably drink quite a bit, but it’s better to add the water little by little to achieve the end result of cooked, thick peas.The more the peas soften, the more careful you should be with the water, and the more you should stir. It’s lovely once they begin to mush and at this point, they will inevitably stick a bit to the bottom of the pan. The peas will take about 45 minutes to be fully cooked through. Once done, remove from the heat.Cut the pancetta really small (in half again, should a pre-chopped packet be your source). Peel and halve the garlic cloves. Fry the garlic and pancetta pieces in 2 tbsp of olive oil over a medium-low heat. The pancetta will render most of its fat, making the pieces seem smaller still, which is what you want, and the garlic should turn golden brown.Remove the garlic and discard, before adding fennel seeds and herbs. Fry for another minute until the herbs are crispy, then add the whole thing, with another tbsp or so of olive oil, to the peas. Incorporate well, adding a good grind of black pepper and salt to taste.If you make this dish in advance, you will probably need to add a little water when reheating.Rhubarb charlotteView image in fullscreen‘Great together’: rhubarb charlotte with cinnamon ice-cream.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverA charlotte is a type of moulded bread pudding, which can be eaten either hot or cold.

Toss it with the sugar and the zest of the orange and then set aside.Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and lightly butter a 20cm pudding basin.Blitz the bread to fine crumbs in a food processor. In a pan, melt the butter over a medium heat. Allow the butter to foam and have the courage to allow it to slightly brown, for a nutty effect. Remove from the heat and after a minute or so add the honey and then, carefully, as the butter will still be very hot, the juice of half the orange. Finally, add the breadcrumbs and mix thoroughly.Place a layer of rhubarb on the bottom of the basin and cover with a little of the crumbs. It does not have to be perfect. Cover with another few handfuls of rhubarb, then crumbs, and then again, and so on until everything is used in 4 layers, making the final layer breadcrumbs. Squash the bread down into the basin with the back of a spoon.Cover with baking paper or foil and bake for 30 minutes, before removing the cover and baking for 10 minutes more to form a crust. Serve hot.Cinnamon ice-creamThe no-churn ice-cream does have a slightly involved method – waiting for the egg whites to heat up is the worst bit – but it’s basically straightforward and very successful.Serves 4. Ready in 40 minutes, plusfreezing timecinnamon stick1cmsoft brown sugar80geggs2, yolks and whites separatedvanilla pod½milk30mldouble cream75mlCrush the cinnamon in a mortar and pestle with 1 tbsp of the sugar until completely smooth. Add to the egg yolks along with another 30g of the sugar and the scraped seeds from the vanilla pod.Set over a pan of simmering water and whisk until pale. Whisk in the milk, all at once, and keep whisking for 5 minutes, until the mixture is much thicker. Keep an eye on it, being careful not to cook it so much that the eggs scramble.After 5 minutes, remove the bowl and set aside to cool. Add the remaining sugar to the egg whites in another bowl and set this over the pan of water. You need to heat this to about 80C, which takes about 15-20 minutes over barely simmering water.Once at temperature, remove the bowl and whisk – an electric hand whisk is preferable for this – for 5 minutes or so, until you have achieved a thick, smooth meringue.In a third bowl, whisk the cream until very thick. Stir the cream into the yolk mixture until completely combined and then, more carefully, fold in the meringue.Place the mixture into an airtight container and freeze for at least 5 hours before serving.Joe Trivelli is co-executive head chef at the River Café, LondonExplore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkThe ObserverDessertFoodPorkrecipesShareReuse this content"
