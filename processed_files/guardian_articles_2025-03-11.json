It also showed a new electric model under its premium Lexus brand, with two more to come this year.The manufacturer was one of theleaders in making hybrid carsthat combine a petrol or diesel engine with a small battery, but it has been much slower to switch production over to pure battery electric vehicles than rivals.That cautious approach has paid off financially in recent months as the pace of growth in battery car sales hasslowed in some markets, including Europe. The company upgraded its profit forecasts last month after selling 10.8m cars in 2024.Matt Harrison, the chief corporate officer at Toyota Motor Europe, said the company would try to retain its eight European factories but that it would make the move to electric production gradually “over the next decade”. Toyotaopened its UK plantsin 1992 and they employ about 3,000 people.Toyota is aiming to keep European sales at about the 1.2m it achieved in 2024, a market share of 7%. Speaking at a launch event in Brussels last week, Harrison said car companies were facing “encouragement to localise supply chains” because of increasing trade barriers. Global trade frictions andtariffs are expected by most experts to increaseas Donald Trump continues his trade war against erstwhile allies.Toyota makes theCorolla hatchback at Burnaston, Derbyshire, and has other car plants in France, the Czech Republic, Portugal and Turkey.Asked if the Burnaston plant had a future making battery cars, Harrison said: “Ultimately that’s our goal, yes. We see that we want to keep all of our manufacturing assets and particularly with the geopolitical […] trends that we see now.”View image in fullscreenThe Toyota C-HR+ SUV is an electric version of its existing petrol C-HR.Photograph: ToyotaThe new electric models were an updated version of the bZ4X, the C-HR+ SUV, which is an electric version of itsexisting petrol C-HR, and the Lexus RZ.Toyota’s confidence in the future of its UK plants will be welcomed by the government, amid repeated criticisms from the industry of rules that force carmakers to sell an increasing number of electric cars every year. The UK government has pledged to relax the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate – despite the concerns of environmental campaigners – arguing the industry needed respite.On a trip to Japan last week, the UK business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told Toyota and its smaller Japanese rival Nissan that the government would “do everything possible to ensure automotive manufacturing remains in the UK”, including loosening the ZEV mandate.Toyota was also particularly concerned with the UK including some hybrids in a ban on new petrol and diesel cars between 2030 and 2035. A ban on models not capable of running on zero-emissions power could have ruled out models such as the Prius. However, the government is nowexpected to allow Prius-style hybrids, in part because ofToyota’s lobbying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that there was “no direct connection between Burnaston’s future and the ZEV mandate” because of its focus on exporting vehicles to Europe.“It’s the speed of transition in mainland Europe, not the UK, which will have the biggest bearing on sustainability of TMUK,” he said, referring to the UK factory. “Our strategy in Europe is we don’t believe we need to change our manufacturing footprint very much … we’re not looking to downsize, consolidate, or build a new plant.”That plan also applies to plants making engines, including sites in Deeside, north Wales, and Poland. Harrison emphasised that the company would not rush to make the switch because it is not certain over how quickly demand for electric cars will increase over the next decade.“We have to pick the moment of transition very carefully,” Harrison said. “We have to have critical mass and volume, otherwise we can’t have a competitive supply chain.”View image in fullscreenThe Toyota FT-Me concept car at a launch event in Brussels, Belgium.

It is continuing development for six types of propulsion technology: battery cars, hybrids, and plug-in hybrids capable of being charged with a plug, plus technologies not seen to have a significant future for mass-market cars, including hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen combustion and “carbon-neutral” petrol.Toyota also revealed plans to build an electric “microcar” to rivalStellantis’s Citroën Ami, the Swiss-made Microlinoand a series of Chinese competitors. Toyota’s FT-Me concept car will, if brought to full production, qualify as a quadricycle, meaning it could be driven by 14-year-olds in countries including France without a full licence.Explore more on these topicsToyotaAutomotive industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Sources suggested that thousands more could eventually be made redundant.Labour Together said it hopes to channel “[Javier] Milei’s energy but with a radical centre-left purpose” with project chainsaw, a reference to the libertarian agenda of the Argentinian president who gifted Musk the chainsaw.The thinktank will look at more legally risky ways to cut civil service numbers for poor performance, abolishing or merging government departments and further planning reforms, including how to get a third runway built at Heathrow within this parliament.A spokesperson for Starmer declined to say which bodies the prime minister had been referring to but said he thought the state had become “passive”. He did not respond to questions on whether ministers were planning a “bonfire of the quangos” akin to the 2010-15 reforms by David Cameron and George Osborne.“The state in Westminster has grown larger but it has not become more effective, and as [the PM] said in cabinet we have seen examples over time of government becoming more passive when it comes to decisions,” the spokesperson added.The number of non-departmental public bodies has been in decline for decades, and standing at just over 300 is down from about 700 in 2010 when Cameron took office. In the 1970s, there were as many as 2,000.Among the public bodies set up by the government since Labour won the election in July are GB Energy, Skills England, the National Jobs and Careers Service and the Office for Value of Money – though some of these are mergers of existing bodies.The Institute for Government suggested last weekend that Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, could consider compulsory redundancy rounds in the civil service. Previously, redundancies have been voluntary or by attrition.Alex Thomas, from the thinktank, said it would lead to a “mindset shift” among civil servants, saying voluntary schemes and hiring freezes often choked off talent.The government said on Tuesday that as part of steps to remove red tape for businesses, it would legislate to abolish the Payment Systems Regulator – which oversees operators such as Mastercard – and incorporate its functions into the Financial Conduct Authority.The decision follows complaints from businesses that they were wasting time and money engaging with three different regulators.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said the “regulatory system has become burdensome to the point of choking off innovation, investment and growth” and that ministers were taking steps to “free businesses from that stranglehold”.Starmer said that “for too long, the previous government hid behind regulators – deferring decisions and allowing regulations to bloat and block meaningful growth in this country. And it has been working people who pay the price of this stagnation.“This is the latest step in our efforts to kickstart economic growth, which is the only way we can fundamentally drive-up living standards and get more money in people’s pockets.”Explore more on these topicsQuangosLabourNHSKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

You failed.”Clifford began plotting the attack two days after she ended their 18-month relationship because he was angry at being rejected. He was also angry at the Hunt family because he “correctly assumed” they had advised Louise to break up with him.He deceived Carol to gain access to the family home before stabbing her to death and then waited for Louise to return. He restrained, raped and murdered her with a crossbow by shooting her in the back when he became aware that her sister Hannah was returning to the house.Clifford stopped during the attack to send a text message to John Hunt using Louise’s phone, asking him: “What time are you home?”After Hannah arrived, she and Clifford shouted and swore at each other but she managed to message her partner to say “he’s tying us up” in the minutes before she was fatally shot.John Hunt said in his statement that he believed his life had been saved by Hannah, adding: “I firmly believe that, had she not managed to show such amazing physical and mental strength in raising the alarm after you fatally injured her, then I would have been your fourth victim that day.”Addressing the victim impact statements by John and his daughter Amy Hunt, the judge said in his sentencing remarks: “They showed a gentle heroism of which you, Kyle Clifford, can only dream.”Handing Clifford “a sentence from which you will never be released”, he described him as “a jealous man soaked in self-pity, who holds women in utter contempt”.A prosecutor told the judge earlier in the hearing it was “no coincidence” Clifford had sought out podcasts by the self-styled misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate before the murders.Clifford had watched up to 10 videos of Tate in the lead-up to his crimes.On Tuesday, Alison Morgan KC, prosecuting, said: “Andrew Tate can properly be described as a poster boy for misogynists, a poster boy for those who view women as possessions to be controlled.“In that context, and in light of all the other background material, it is no coincidence, the prosecution submit, that it was Andrew Tate that the defendant turned to the night before he would go off to commit these acts of violence against women.”DCI Nick Gardner from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit said the sentence sent a message to men who perpetrated serious acts of violence against women that they would be held accountable and face the full force of the law.In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

He initially denied propositioning Imogen but later Millar showed him evidence that he had told an associate he had done so. Clarke corrected his earlier statement but said he only did it in response to her advances. “She was flirting first by taking my glasses and saying she wanted to be my secretary,” said Clarke. “I said: ‘Do you want to be more than my secretary?’”The court heard that the day after the dinner Imogen wrote on the social media site Tumblr about Clarke’s behaviour. Asked by Millar why she would make up such things, Clarke said she was “a writer”, adding: “On my kids, that is not what happened at our dinner, and she is a fantasist because that is what she does. She is into women’s rights, which I do not knock, I used to be as well.”Clarke also said that Imogen had been “annoyed” when told that a scene she was in had been cut from one of his films. But Millar said the scene involved just three lines and so “didn’t make a lot of difference to her career”. He told Clarke: “You’re just making up this stuff about her clearly being very upset … Actors and actors audition for lots of parts they don’t get … That’s not a reason to lie to the high court.”Speaking generally about the allegations made against him, including by more than 20 women in the Guardian articles, Clarke said they were either “untrue or embellished” and accused the Guardian of “agenda journalism”. He said: “If someone made a comment about you 20 years ago it doesn’t mean you have to go to a national newspaper and destroy their life.”His evidence will continue on Wednesday.*Name changed for legal reasons.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

Out of respect for the investigation and all involved we will not comment further at this time.”The investigation into the cause of the collision had been led by experts at the Marine Accident Investigation Branch but was escalated to a criminal investigation after early inquiries by Humberside police.The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel for the US air force when it was struck while stationary by the German-owned Solong on Monday morning. At least one of its tanks is leaking into the North Sea.The transport minister Mike Kane said there was “no evidence” of foul play at present but that something had clearly gone “terribly wrong”.The burning wreckage of the Solong could be seen drifting southwards off the coast of Grimsby on Tuesday. The smoking vessel was being shadowed by two tugboats to ensure it stayed away from land as it passed a nature reserve off the Humberside coast.MapThe ship is now expected to stay afloat, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said.“I am reassured to hear indications from the ship’s owners which suggest the sodium cyanide containers were empty and that efforts to confirm this by the salvors are under way,” she said in a statement on Tuesday.“I was also pleased to have been informed that early indications suggest that both vessels are now expected to stay afloat and that the Solong can be towed away from the shore, and salvage operations can get under way.“I will continue to monitor the response and have asked for regular updates, including on any potential environmental impacts, across government and our agencies.”Mike Ross, the Lib Dem leader of Hull city council, called on Keir Starmer to convene an emergency Cobra meeting to avoid “environmental catastrophe” in the region, which was described by one expert as an area of “immense biological, cultural and economic importance”.Experts welcomed the news that the Solong was not carrying the poisonous substance sodium cyanide but feared the highly potent jet fuel could be a “disaster” for local marine life.Dr Simon Boxall, an academic in oceanography at the University of Southampton, said the Jet A-1 fuel had a “much higher toxicity” than crude oil and that “the impact of that on life in the oceans would be devastating”.Specialist pollution-control vessels from Germany and Norway arrived at the scene on Tuesday to try to measure the scale of the spillage and contain any toxins.Dr Jennifer Allan, an expert in global environmental politics at Cardiff University, said it was a “disaster in every sense of the word”.“The health and environmental effects will be short- and long-term, local and regional,” she said. “The jet fuel will be harmful to local wildlife and beaches and the livelihoods that rely on them. In the long term, it could move up the food chain; for example, from fish into birds and people.”Investigators were expected to speak to many of the 36 crew members rescued from both ships in the coming days to try establish what went wrong.Maritime experts suggested human error was likely to have played a significant role in the incident but that a technical mishap or oversight could not be ruled out.Det Ch Supt Craig Nicholson of Humberside police said the force had “taken primacy for the investigation of any potential criminal offences which arise from the collision between the two vessels”.He added: “Following inquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision. This follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of the Solong.“Our thoughts are with the family of the missing crew member, and I have appointed family liaison officers to make contact and provide support to the family.“The man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst inquiries are under way, and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”The cost to repair the ships, let alone the cost of any environmental damage or cleanup, is expected to run into the tens of millions of pounds.Harj Narulla, a barrister specialising in climate and environmental justice at Doughty St Chambers, said Stena could sue the Solong’s owner if it was found to be responsible.Costs would include damage to the tanker and cargo ship, as well as loss of the value of cargo, loss of earnings and income as well as repair costs.Environmental damage costs would depend on how much was spilled, which chemicals and how much was contained after the spill.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Although ADHD prescriptions rose across all regions, London saw the highest annual increase of 28%, south-east England saw the second highest increase at 19.5%, and the north-east and Yorkshire had the lowest increase at 13%.The analysis also found there to be a strong association between factors such as ethnicity and deprivation and ADHD prescription rates. The researchers said that south-east England and north-west England, which have significant white populations, show higher prescription counts overall compared to more ethnically diverse regions like the Midlands and London.The researchers also said that “widespread disruption and increased psychological stress levels” could be a factor contributing to the rise in prescriptions. They added that their findings reveal that the increase in ADHD prescriptions is higher than reported in previous studies.The researchers said: “The findings of this study have significant implications for health policy and clinical practice. The significant rise in ADHD prescriptions across England highlights the urgent need for policies that address both regional and socioeconomic disparities in ADHD care access. The finding that more people are receiving ADHD treatment is encouraging, particularly given reports of long waiting times between ADHD referral and assessment, as well as variations across different regions in England.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many other mental health conditions can cause ADHD-like symptoms. For example, my own clinical work has revealed many cases where inattention problems were caused by untreated depression rather than ADHD. Also, ADHD is often accompanied by other mental disorders like autistic spectrum disorder, complex trauma, anxiety and depression.“Concerning demographic trends, lower engagement with assessment and treatment among minorities and poorer communities is nothing new and not confined to ADHD. There could be differences in the availability of ADHD services across the country and more research is required.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

A donor heart became available to be transplanted in March.Jansz said it was a privilege to be part of such an historic and pioneering Australian medical milestone.“We’ve worked towards this moment for years and we’re enormously proud to have been the first team in Australia to carry out this procedure,” Jansz said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was followed by Alex Klein, Hannah’s partner, and Amy Hunt, Louise and Hannah’s sister.John Hunt (Husband of Carol Hunt and father of Louise and Hannah)View image in fullscreenA courtroom sketch of John Hunt (centre) giving his victim impact statement.Photograph: Elizabeth Cook/PA“Do I really need to detail the impact of having three-quarters of my family murdered?” asked Hunt, addressing Clifford directly.“But then I realised that this was my final opportunity to say what I want to say to you specifically, Kyle, words that will also be directed to your family, who will carry guilt forward for the rest of their lives; I know you valued them so poorly from all the conversations we had, Kyle, but I suppose even they must be damaged by what you have done.“I also want to confirm to the world the truth, especially how Louise conducted herself within a textbook, mature break-up on her part, understanding the conflict of saying goodbye to someone she once loved but not allowing those memories to cloud her certain knowledge that you simply failed to be the person she needed. You failed.“Unlike you, Kyle, at every step of their lives they made the correct choices to improve themselves as people; Louise enjoyed more success and fulfilment in one morning than you achieved in your entire miserable life.“We all offered you kindness, especially Carol. She had picked up on your personal inadequacies right from the start. She sensed your immaturity but always knew Louise would work things out.“Carol still displayed her compassion right up until the moment she answered the door to you on July 9th.“I often think of the list Louise wrote to herself to remind her of the reasons that you fell short. The racism. She was rightly disgusted by that. Your belittling language. The fact that your family is a mess. Like any women should be allowed to do, she worked you out despite repeated deceit and said enough is enough. I hope women around the world will take Louise’s bravery as a shining beacon for their lives. If you feel enough is enough, then it is.”Hunt spoke of Louise’s favourite novel from her school days, Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, and how she would quote lines from it to match life’s challenges. One of them was about the goodness of mockingbirds who “don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy”.He added: “All their lives Carol, Hannah and Louise similarly spent their time bringing joy and colour and happiness to other people’s lives. You killed three beautiful mockingbirds, Kyle.“The impact of what you have done will be taken to my grave, but on the way there, I want you to know that I stand strong before you today. As you are consigned to a fate far greater than death, I can draw on the love and strength that I still feel from the girls in every moment of every day. I am lucky. I have the most wonderful daughter, Amy, who gives me such focus and purpose.“Whatever sentence you are about to receive, whatever misery lies ahead for you for the next 60 years, remember that after your days on earth are done, on your dying day, there will be no release for you. The screams of hell, Kyle, I can hear them faintly now. The red carpet will come out for you. At that point, when the person you could have been meets the person you are, you will realise your miserable fate will last for eternity.”Alex KleinView image in fullscreenAlex Klein, Hannah’s partner, also addressed the court.Photograph: Jacob King/PAClifford was described by Klein as “a coward – you simply were not good enough for an angel like Louise”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She would never lay a finger on anyone.“Hannah completed my life. We worked so hard to build a future together and achieve our goals and all I wanted was to share that with her.

Sections are covered in black soot, evidence of the raging blaze that engulfed the ship when it wasstruck by a smaller cargo shipon Monday morning, with the flames from multiple explosions only just dying down on Tuesday afternoon.The 220,000 barrels of jet fuel the tanker was carrying for the US military has mostly burned up, experts say, though it had ignited to a degree that the huge plume of smoke was visible from space, a swirl of black clearly identifiable on satellite images.Experts warn of North Sea collision’s ‘devastating’ impact on marine lifeRead moreThe vessel it was hit by, the 140-metre Solong, drifts about two miles south, also with grey smoke emanating from somewhere inside. Shipping containers on its deck are charred and beaten.“Modelling suggests that should Solong remain afloat, it will remain clear of land for the next few hours. The assessment of HM Coastguard is, however, that it is unlikely the vessel will remain afloat,” the maritime minister, Mike Kane, told parliament on Tuesday afternoon.Map showing location of collision off coast of YorkshireThough not entirely unique by global standards, a sight such as this is rare off the British coast, and a collision resulting in loss of life is even rarer.It was 9.48am when the alarm was first raised.The US-flag tanker, Stena Immaculate, had been stationary having arrived from a port in the Peloponnese region of Greece, ship-tracking software shows. It had been anchored while it waited for a berth to become available at the Killingholmeport, on the River Humber, its management company, Crowley, said.Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, at a speed of about 16 knots, equivalent to 18 miles an hour, when it collided with the tanker.Normally a ship should be detectable on radar 24 miles (39km) away, and visible approximately 10 miles away. Fog and haze meant the visibility was poor, though this is not something uncommon in the North Sea.There should have been at least one crew member on deck of the Solong but a crew member of the Stena Immaculate told CBS News that the Solong “came from out of the blue” and it appeared no one was on its bridge when the crash happened.It is thought alerts set up to warn of an impending crash may have been disabled. These devices are prone to false alarms, according to one former captain, and can be a nuisance for crews.At 10.20am, after reports of a “massive fireball”, the coastguard put out a signal to nearby boats and ships, saying: “Solong has collided with tanker Stena Immaculate in the outer anchorage, both vessels are abandoning. Vessels who have firefighting equipment or who can assist with search and rescue contact Humber coastguard on channel one six. Vessel Stena Immaculate is carrying jet 1A fuel, which is on fire and in the water. Request vessels remain at a safe distance.”1:34Drone footage shows cargo ship and oil tanker after North Sea collision – videoFirefighting vessels raced to the scene to help control the blaze and lifeboats were scrambled to support the response and assist in evacuating the crew of both ships. A total of 36 people were taken to shore safely, with one treated in hospital. One man is missing presumed dead, having entered the water and not been accounted for among those rescued.Initial reports speculated the highly toxic chemical sodium cyanide may have been aboard the Solong but these were later proved incorrect – it had four empty containers that had previously held the substance, its German owner, Ernst Russ, said.Fire crews battled to get the inferno under control throughout Monday and into Tuesday. By Tuesday afternoon most of the fire was out and a multimillion pound salvage operation was beginning, with experts and investigators arriving in Grimsby, attempting to understand how the crash occurred.While it remains unclear which country will lead the investigation into the collision – it is usually agreed between the “flags” of the vessels – Humberside police on Tuesday said a 59-year-old man had beenarrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.Explore more on these topicsUK newsYorkshireShipping industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the intervening years, more than7 million peopleworldwide have been reported to have died from Covid. For most people, life as they remember it before the outbreak has returned to the way it was before. However, respondents to a Guardian callout reflect a more complex picture for those who are still affected.While many reported feeling happier that working from home has allowed for a more flexible work-life balance and that eating more healthily and exercising has become a priority, many others described how they still live with what happened.‘The pandemic reinforced existing inequalities – it was a magnifying glass’: how Covid changed BritainRead moreAmong the scores of people who shared with the Guardian how Covid has affected them, many mentioned developing long Covid. Others who are immunosuppressed said they feel more isolated because there are no longer established precautions for those who are vulnerable.Those who lost loved ones to Covid feel as if they’re still grieving. Some people who lost their jobs and are struggling financially have found it especially difficult to cope with the cost of living. And for parents whose children missed school, the consequences for their development have been irreversible.Here, six people in the UK reflect on the ways they are still affected by the Covid outbreak five years on.‘We used to climb mountains, now we just stayhome’View image in fullscreenJade is a carer for her partner, Tom, who has long Covid.Jade from Sheffield has been with her partner, *Tom, both 37, for nearly 19 years. Before the pandemic they lived in a van and travelled across Europe. “We used to climb mountains and see the world, now we just stay at home,” said Jade who spends most of her time as a carer.Like many people they “vaxxed and relaxed” but in June 2022 Tom caught Covid at work and never fully recovered. He was diagnosed with post-Covid syndrome, has chronic fatigue and spends 22-23 hours a day in bed.“Looking back I feel misled about the risks of Covid,” said Tom. “We didn’t really learn about the risks of long Covid.”According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), approximately2 million peoplein England and Scotland between November 2023 to March 2024 said they experienced long Covid, with more than 50% of those saying their symptoms have lasted for at least two years.Tom said he feels “shocked” by the way vulnerable people have been “abandoned” and considers himself “excluded” from public life.“I miss community and being spontaneous – dealing with fatigue feels like I am rationing out life itself,” he added.Based on Tom’s experience, Jade co-founded Breathe Easy Sheffield with her friend Chloe in April 2024 which hosts events with enhanced safety measures for those who are still cautious about getting Covid.View image in fullscreenBreathe Easy help to set up Covid-cautious events in Sheffield.Photograph: Breathe Easy Sheffield/Guardian Community“People don’t want to be reminded of what happened, which I understand,” said Jade. “But we are not postpandemic, we’re post-precautions. Covid is still here.”‘He’s in secondary school and can’t do his times tables’*Margaret, 50, feels she is “unable to get out of lockdown” despite there no longer being stay-at-home restrictions. Part of this feeling, she said, comes from her 13-year-old son, who has autism, not being able to regularly attend school since 2020.“He found it really difficult to learn at home,” said Margaret, who is a single parent to her son and 27-year-old daughter, and works as a massage therapist in London. “He would freak out seeing his teacher on the computer and would hide under the table.” She said they had faced difficulties such as getting Covid, applying for an education, health and care plan (EHCP), and finding a school that could address his needs – all of which have made it difficult for him to return to education full-time.In the academic year 2022-23, about 1.6 million pupils were recorded as“persistently absent”in England, defined as such by the Department for Education as missing at least 10% of school sessions.Her son has just started at a new school but Margaret is worried about his development. “It’s mixed emotions for me,” she said. “I really want it to work out for him but common sense tells me it’s impossible because he’s so far behind. He loves to learn but he’s in secondary school and can’t do his times tables – he’s completely lacking social skills.”‘I don’t think I’ve processed it all properly’In March 2020, *Rosie’s 64-year-old father developed flu-like symptoms. His wife, who worked in a school, was the first to get ill but recovered shortly afterwards. He was asthmatic and within a week he died – after his death he tested positive for Covid. “He just didn’t wake up one morning,” said his daughter Rosie, 34, who is self-employed in the creative industry and from Yorkshire.Just under227,000 peopledied in the UK with Covid listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. On Sunday, hundreds of events took place across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to commemorate those who died.Rosie and her husband travelled from Leeds to the Lake District for her dad’s funeral but they couldn’t have a wake and returned home straight afterwards.“It just felt so surreal,” she said. “Not being able to give my mum a hug at the time felt so wrong. I think the shock of it all carried me through but I don’t think I’ve processed it all properly.”In light of her father’s death and the wider culture of remote working, Rosie ended up following in his footsteps by starting her own business in the creative industry in 2023: “I realised life is short and you have to do what makes you happy before it’s too late.“Not being able to discuss things with my dad is a continuously sharp reminder of him not being here. It’s bittersweet.”‘I don’t feel part of society’View image in fullscreenPeter has a rare condition called myasthenia gravis which causes muscle weakness.For the last five years, Peter Arrowsmith, 69, feels he has been “isolated” and “ignored” because of the neuromuscular condition he lives with. As someone who is immunosuppressed and vulnerable to Covid, he has only very recently started leaving the house more.“Many friends and relatives have not been willing to perform a simple lateral flow test to give me some reassurance and since the outbreak started I’ve only seen people in three households, in addition to shop workers and tradesmen,” said Arrowsmith who is a retired chartered accountant from Rushden, Northamptonshire.He was diagnosed with a rare condition called myasthenia gravis in 2013 that causes muscle weakness and can make simple tasks such as lifting objects and walking very tiring.Arrowsmith said people like him “do not feel part of society” and as a result he is “no longer tolerant” of those who don’t respect his health needs. “I still wear a mask when I go out and have been questioned and challenged by other people about it.“It makes me angry, the impression is that Covid is all over when it isn’t.”‘I felt I couldn’t forget the names of the deceased’View image in fullscreenZoe was redeployed within the NHS to work in a hospital mortuary early in the pandemic.When Zoe Clarkson, 35, from London, started working in an administrative role for the NHS in 2016 she never imagined she would be sorting, disinfecting and categorising the belongings of the deceased four years later. “I was unprepared for what I would see and do,” said Clarkson, who was redeployed to work in a hospital mortuary during the pandemic, and has since left the NHS and now works as a senior clinical data manager.Her experience left her with symptoms of PTSD and she still struggles with anxiety and feelings of isolation. “I kept running through people’s names in my head and felt I couldn’t forget them as it would be disrespectful.” Clarkson, who is now in therapy and on medication, feels she is still searching for closure but doesn’t know if she will get it. “I’m mainly just angry now,” she said.“I feel like I’ve lost a lot over the years and now, with the anniversary, it’s brought back a lot of memories and feelings. It’s hard to move on.”‘I walked into the cost of living crisis already on the back foot’“I’m still suffering with crippling debt,” said *Astrid, 49, who is self-employed from Surrey and who was not eligible for self-employment income support owing to her role as a limited company director. Unable to work regularly or apply for furlough, she took out a bounceback loan but is struggling to pay it back.Her financial situation has deteriorated drastically over the years. She has not been able to pay her taxes on time (subsequently getting fined), missed out on pension payments and has a poor credit rating. Her debt is still about £20,000.“The impact of the pandemic, combined with the cost of living and interest rates, has made it difficult for me to keep my head above the water,” she added. As a single parent of two teenagers, Astrid said she is worried about finding herself in a financially unstable situation again where she cannot work.“People like me walked into the cost of living crisis already on the back foot. I’ve still not recovered from 2020, but it’s like there’s a stigma around talking about the financial fallout myself and others are still experiencing. I’m constantly reminded of what happened – the fear doesn’t go away.”*Names have been changedExplore more on these topicsCoronavirusInfectious diseasesHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s in a contemplative, serious mood – you can tell because he’s not wearing his cowboy hat. “But that’s fine, you have to have that. You don’t want everybody one way.”Mr Maxwell is on British telly as part of School Swap: UK to USA, a documentary that sets up a good old-fashioned exchange trip. At first, it seems it might be a cheap, even dangerous stunt: teenagers from the racially diverse Elmgreen school in Tulse Hill, south London, are sent deep into the American south, Trump country. It’s five hours to the nearest airport, everyone has a gun and Confederate flags are proudly flown. And the south London kids are coming here…But Mena high school and Elmgreen, and their teens and parents, have been cleverly chosen for a social experiment that will make you laugh, cry – big, blobby tears that fall when you’re not ready for them – and repeatedly change your mind. You’re appalled at Arkansas and proud of south London; later, it’s the other way around. Then you flip back a couple more times before thinking: maybe it’s time to be less appalled and less proud.Episode one tackles the question of racism in Mena head-on, but before that, we have arrivals and introductions. Dae-Jaun leaves London, travels 4,500 miles to Mena, and is shown into the bedroom of his absent opposite number Waylon, who owns six guns, a crossbow and a drawer full of knives – although Waylon’s mum and dad, Stephanie and Justin, stress that all the above have been locked away for Dae-Jaun’s safety. “We had to go behind each door, make sure there wasn’t a gun back there!”View image in fullscreenThe British invasion … Tulse Hill, south London, comes to Mena, Arkansas.Photograph: Channel 4Waylon’s room is a woody, scratchy mess with skulls of deer the boy has shot mounted on the wall. Dae-Jaun, missing his mum and visibly wondering if he’s walked on to the set of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, waits for Stephanie and Justin to leave, then stands there and cries.Meanwhile, in London, Waylon is confidently regaling his host family – he’s not at Dae-Jaun’s place; the pairs don’t match up that way – with tales of his love of hunting, which is all fun and games until he talks about killing a raccoon, and refers to it using only the second syllable of the word. That unfortunate linguistic bump having been negotiated, Waylon gets on with becoming the show’s main character, and is utterly fascinating. He has a practical wisdom that makes him seem 10 years older than the British kids, not in spite of but because of the narrowness of his upbringing. He has no time for schoolwork (“I’ve learned how to build a fence and work cows. That’s going to help me way more in life than whatever the heck geometry is.”) and isn’t interested in exploring other countries, apart from Canada, where he hopes one day to shoot a moose.When the Elmgreen kids go to the park after school, Waylon gets bored sitting around on the grass, shins up a tall tree, and enjoys a view across London that nobody at the school has ever seen. Back in Mena, his dad, Justin, is introducing Dae-Jaun to fishing and hunting in the stunning Arkansas lakes and forests. Soon, the serenity of the infinite outdoors and Justin’s immense kindness – which becomes overwhelmingly moving when we learn that Dae-Jaun lost his dad at the age of four – have brought lovely, thoughtful, nervous “DJ”, as Justin insists on calling him, out of himself.View image in fullscreenMena student Jayla thrives on her trip to London.Photograph: Channel 4In the UK, another beautiful relationship develops, but it’s one that speaks to what is rotten in Arkansas. Jayla, who is mixed-race, is a pupil at Mena high school and she is quiet and cautious, not because she is naturally that way, but as a direct result of the bigotry of her peers. Jayla’s descriptions of her everyday experiences in Mena are hauntingly melancholic – on her trip to London, in a place where the colour of her skin attracts no interest, she lights up. Her travelling companion is her Mena classmate Sailor, a blond, God-fearing, popular girl who now understands the effects of racism more starkly through witnessing how Jayla thrives when that constant hum of hatred is taken away.Jayla tells a tearful, rueful Sailor that they mustn’t write Mena off entirely and, in case we hadn’t grasped that point by watching Dae-Jaun find his smile, next week’s second episode offers a shaming look at how healthy the Arkansas teenagers’ use of smartphones is compared with young Londoners. School Swap: UK to USA confirms some of our prejudices while upending others; in both cases, there are valuable lessons to learn.School Swap: UK to USA is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewArkansasSchoolsSecondary schoolsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Has the trope reached a tipping point?Get our weekend culture and lifestyle emailTue 11 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 19.45 EDTShareYou only need to look at some of the biggest stories of the past decade to realise popular culture from the late 2010s had a love affair with trauma. Online there was thepersonal essay boomthat kept websites including BuzzFeed, Jezebel and Australia’s own Mamamia afloat. In publishing, memoirs that explored the gamut of human suffering – everything from the pampered (Prince Harry’s Spare) to the impoverished (Tara Westover’s Educated) –broke sales records. And memoirs found their fictional counterpoint in novels including Gail Honeyman’s Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine and Miranda Cowley Heller’s The Paper Palace. Even television and film were trauma-obsessed. Cue the detective who must face his own trauma before he can crack the case (True Detective, The Dry); and the advertising executive who could write perfect copy if only he could stop running from his past (Mad Men).Shankari Chandran, Robert Dessaix, Diana Reid and more: Australian books to look forward to in 2025Read moreOur craving for tales of suffering reached a fever pitch in Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life.The 2015 novel follows a corporate lawyer, Jude (named after the patron saint of lost causes), as he stumbles through a glamorous life in New York, haunted by the abundance of abuse he suffered as a child. A 2022 theatrical adaptation by the Belgian theatre director Ivo Von Hove was so faithful and so bloody that when I saw it at the Adelaide festival in 2023, a woman beside me exclaimed aloud in the intermission:“Why?”Her cry resonated. Why were trauma narratives so popular? Was our appetite insatiable or were we at a cultural tipping point?Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIt’s not as if traumatic backstories were invented in TV writers’ rooms in the past decade. Indeed, the idea that one’s psyche can be shaped by early experiences – that a character can have an explanatory, humanising backstory – has been mainstream for more than a century. But there is a difference between threading trauma througha narrative and allowing trauma to become the whole story.View image in fullscreenIn the first season of True Detective, the characters played by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey have to recognise the mistakes they’ve made at work and in their personal lives before they can solve the case.Photograph: JIm Bridges/APIt was the use of trauma as a ballast for plot, not just as a technique to illustrate character, that was so striking. Again and again, audiences were spoon-fed the same plot. We were introduced to a protagonist who exhibited neurotic, self-destructive behaviours. (What form those behaviours took depended on the genre. If it was comedy, we metFleabag, who was as addicted to irony as sex. If it was climate fiction, heroines ran from society into the wilderness, such as in Charlotte McConaghy’s Once There Were Wolves.)Just as we began to wonder about why they were like this,flashbacks teased us with the promise of an answer: something really bad happened to them! But if you want to find out what it was, you must watch until the last episode, read until the final page.These kinds of stories satisfy us because they use good old-fashioned suspense. The flashbacks are bombs and we can’t look away until they have detonated. But the trauma plot also satisfies on a deeper level.The trauma plot has lost its cultural currency because it obfuscates much of the nuances of living with traumaIn real life, when someone tells the story of the worst thing that’s happened to them, it can be the first step towards healing. Indeed, it’s the whole point of talking therapy: that people might be able to find a narrative for their experiences, and thereby control and contain them. When those narratives are told to an audience – in a personal essay, or a memoir, or on a talkshow – the effect is powerful. It validates the speaker and empowers the audience to tell their own stories.The trauma plot is fiction’s substitute for this healing high. In fiction, once the trauma is ventilated, the story reaches its natural resolution: the tension abates, the mystery surrounding the protagonist dissipates. The audience’s relief mimics the feeling of witnessing or participating in real-life testimony: we have faced the worst, we are stronger and more resolute for having faced it.Of course, the trauma plot, like any narrative trope, was doomed to grow less potent over time. First, because it is now such a recognisable formula, it is too readily parodied. (In the comedian Kate Berlant’saward-winning solo showKate, she teases the audience by referencing a childhood trauma, which she can’t talk about … yet. The joke is that the “trauma” turns out to be a minor thing.)Second, the trauma plot has lost its cultural currency because it obfuscates much of the nuances of living with trauma. One of Yanagihara’sexpress aimsin writing A Little Life was to challenge the notion that any suffering can be overcome: she wanted to write a character “who never gets better”. And yet her textbook use of the trauma plot undermines this goal.Jude’s deepest, darkest secret – his most gruesome experience from a childhood of endless debasement – is illuminated in increasingly detailed flashbacks. When the last flashback is revealed, the feeling is one of overwhelming relief. For Jude, the memory of what happened might be something he never “gets over”. But for the reader it’s the answer to all our questions, the resolution we’ve been waiting for.In life, talking about your trauma does not always neutralise it. But in the trauma plot, all is resolved the moment the trauma is revealed. A character’s core wound becomes not just an extra detail in the rich tapestry of their psyche but the final clue that solves the mystery of who they are and why. The storytelling device designed to add depth ultimately has a flattening effect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Is it also part of a new Hollywood preference for origin stories?Photograph: Universal Pictures/APBut even as the trauma plot has grown stale, pop culture has not lost its psychoanalytic bent. Several of last year’s critical and commercial hit films, from Wicked to Mufasa toThe Apprentice, suggest that Hollywood has replaced the trauma plot with the origin story.We have all been shaped by our suffering. The challenge is to expand our vocabulary rather than dull it with clicheWe are no longer content to accept villains as mere agents of chaos. Now there has to be a formative experience that can account for their bad behaviour. Indeed, it seems the origin story is already going the way of the trauma plot: a device designed to complicate character and to demonstrate that no one is wholly good or evil, has been oversimplified: villainy always has a neat explanation.It raises the question, why do we keep looking to trauma as shorthand to better understand character, when it invariably proves such an unsatisfactory tool, one that flattens and obscures where we rely on it to clarify and complicate?View image in fullscreenA tale of moral ambiguitiesThe alternative – to excise trauma from storytelling – was chillingly dramatised in one of last year’s best origin stories: The Apprentice. In the final scene, Sebastian Stan’s Donald Trump ascends to full villainy the moment he looks a reporter in the eye and, in response to a question about his childhood, coldly replies, “I don’t like to think about that.”It requires humility to concede that character is malleable and to be vulnerable about the experiences that shape us. It is worth endlessly repeating the idea that we have all, to some extent, been shaped by our suffering. The challenge is to expand our vocabulary rather than dull it with cliche; to keep seeking new ways to tell stories about trauma instead of repeating those that came before.Diana Reid’s new novel, Signs of Damage, isout now through Ultimo PressExplore more on these topicsCultureAustralian booksTelevisionAutobiography and memoirFictionTV crime dramaHanya YanagiharacommentShareReuse this content"

Why are so many men going full frontal?Michael HoganTue 11 Mar 2025 09.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 17.42 EDTShareLucius Malfoy just showed us his wand. In the fourth and latest episode ofThe White Lotus, viewers saw more of actor Jason Isaacs than they expected. Several inches more. We screamed in unison with his character’s grossed-out children. You didn’t get that at Hogwarts.As wealthy patriarch Timothy Ratliff, he has been steadily coming off the rails at the five-star Thai resort. The dodgy dealings upon which he built his high-finance empire have been uncovered by journalists in the US. The feds are closing in. Assets have been seized. He is desperately trying to cover his tracks to avoid jail time, while hiding the scandal from his dysfunctional family, who were forced into a digital detox upon arrival at the spa. Safe to say they will have a fair few notifications when they switch their phones back on.As Tim spirals, he has turned to pill-popping by stealing his neurotic wife Victoria’s prescription lorazepam, washed down with copious whisky and wine. This wasn’t in the wellness brochure. “You’re not yourself,” Parker Posey keeps telling him in that mangled Mississippi accent.A phallic manifestation of his meltdown came as we reached the season’s midway mark. Shambling around half-stoned in a complimentary White Lotus bathrobe, Ratliff Sr inadvertently flashed his junk at his offspring. Cue hands over eyes, faces buried in cushions and grossed-out cries of “Dad!” from Saxon, Piper and Lochlan (the diet Succession).View image in fullscreen‘Dad!’ … Jason Isaacs’s character of Timothy Ratliff accidentally reveals himself to his kids in The White Lotus season three.Photograph: HBOAs well as Tim’s tackle, the latest series showed his sleazebag son Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) heading to the bathroom, butt-naked, to watch porn. It was squirmingly uncomfortable viewing – not least when he made meaningful eye contact with little brother Lochlan (Sam Nivola) before closing the door.Creator Mike White’s sun-soaked satire has made such moments a trademark. All three seasons have deployed flashes of male nudity for comic effect. Such shock tactics might seem puerile but in the White Lotus universe, it works. Showing the insufferable super-rich in states of undress is a metaphor for their vulnerability.It strips them of their generational privilege and aura of blithe superiority, reminding us that they are as flawed as the rest of us, if not more so. At any minute, the edifice could come crashing down. With an X-rated flourish, White shows the audience exactly who his characters are.The full-frontal assault started from the acclaimed anthology’s first ever episode. During the debut season, hypochondriac trophy husband Mark Mossbacher, played by Steve Zahn, arrived in Hawaii worried that he had testicular cancer and was doomed to die young like his closeted father. (“He could’ve still been butch, Dad,” his college student daughter, Olivia, reassured him. “Maybe grandpa was a power bottom.”) Unsuspecting viewers duly got an eyeful when Mark showed his swollen parts to his tech tycoon wife, Nicole (Connie Britton). Zahn later admitted that he got to choose his own prosthetic. Perks of the job.View image in fullscreenAn eyeful … Steve Zahn’s prosthetics shocked viewers shortly after this scene in White Lotus season one.Photograph: AmazonThe bare-all baton was promptly picked up by doomed resort manager Armond (the magnificent Murray Bartlett) who, after five years sober, fell off the wagon in spectacular style. Honeymooner Shane (Jake Lacy) walked in on Armond performing a sex act on waiter Dillon (Lukas Gage) during a drug-fuelled romp in his office. Analingus – “getting my salad tossed”, as Dillon put it – is an act rarely seen on television, so all the more taboo-busting. When Shane got him fired, Armond infamously wreaked revenge by squatting and taking a dump in the obnoxious guest’s open suitcase.The second outing, set in Sicily, didn’t stint on male flesh-flashing either. As cocky finance bro Cameron, actor Theo James wore a 9in prosthetic (which the actor joked was “ginormous”, “like a hammer” and “stolen off a donkey in a field”) for a sequence where his best college buddy’s wife, Harper (Aubrey Plaza), glimpses him changing into swimming shorts. Harper, who made a habit of rude interruptions, later walks in on her husband, Ethan (Will Sharpe), pleasuring himself in their suite.View image in fullscreen‘Ginormous’ … Theo James wears his prosthetic penis for a scene with Aubrey Plaza in The White Lotus season two.Photograph: AmazonMeanwhile, Essex boy Jack (Leo Woodall) was seen having graphic sex with his faux-uncle Quentin (Tom Hollander) – a scene Woodall admits left him “speechless” when he first read the script.Mike White, the showrunner, is openly bisexual and has said: “There’s a pleasure to me, as a guy who is gay-ish, in making gay sex transgressive again.”HBO dramas were once notorious for “sexposition” – the shameless technique of advancing the narrative against a backdrop of bare bodies. The Sopranos would set plot-progressing conversations at the Bada Bing! strip club, so boring old dialogue could be enlivened by pole-dancers. Similarly, Game of Thrones often spiced up its power-plays with Westeros sex workers as living scenery.Times have changed. Gratuitous female nudity is no longer the default setting. The GoT prequelHouse of the Dragonis more partial to, ahem, unsheathed swords. HBO stablemates such as Industry, Euphoria, And Just Like That and Scenes from a Marriage have also featured jaw-dropping phallic displays. Now comes The White Lotus and its priapic habit.Since the hit show’s inception, White has interrogated the nature of modern masculinity and the dark side of sexuality. His subversive sensibility ensures his creation is consistently provocative. The Daily Mail recently clutched its pearls with a story un-snappily headlined: “The White Lotus doubles down on full-frontal male nudity in every single series – with solo sex acts, incestuous romps and prosthetic penises sending shockwaves through fans.” White wouldn’t have it any other way.It’s a welcome rebalancing of the books after decades of the male gaze. TV has swapped sexposition for dicksposition, with The White Lotus leading the charge. Well, at least until next week’s Full Moon Party episode, when all bets are off and it’s an equal opportunities flesh-fest. Welcome to the White Lotus. Leave your clothes at the door.The White Lotus is on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK, Foxtel and Binge in Australia and HBO in the US.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionDramaJason IsaacsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A highway to hell. Or possibly heaven for the more perverse. A mission to make people’s lives as miserable as possible. To believe the worst of everyone. All under the guise of national redemption. A country fit for the 21st century.We live in confusing times. There was a time when it was easy to spot clear blue water between the main political parties. Increasingly, though, you’d be hard pushed to differentiate betweenLabour, the Conservatives and Reform. Especially when it comes to matters of welfare and social justice. Some Labour backbenchers must be wondering what the hell is going on, given the things they are now expected to justify. Their consciences are frazzled. Is this really what they entered parliament for?Time was when a Labour government could be relied on to give the benefit of the doubt to the poorest and most needy members of society. It’s the ticket on which they were elected. Only not so much these days. Now that things have temporarily quietened down on the Trump-Ukraine-Russia front,Keir Starmerhas been drip feeding the media with his planned cuts to disability and out-of-work benefits.And it’s not good news if you rely on state support to get by. Because the presumption of innocence is changing. The assumption is now that you’re a slacker trying to cheat the system. Someone wangling to get the state to pay for their Netflix subscription because of some hyper-woke imaginary complaint that prevents them from being arsed to leave the house to go to work. Better that 700,000 disabled people are pushed into poverty than one scrounger gets away with a life of free-rolling. It’s God’s work. What Jesus would have wanted.And don’t give us all that long Covid bullshit. We all know that you’re just terminally lazy. Tough choices for tough times. So it’s time for people to get on their hands and knees and crawl if necessary to do the jobs that no one in the cabinet would dream of doing for a second. All to neutralise the siren voices of those on the far right. Redemption is a very last-year ideal for Starmer.The only excuse Labour is offering is sophisticated dialectics. Only Labour can be trusted to slash the welfare bill because they are the party for whom it raises a few moral qualms. Though not nearly enough. No wonder, then, many on benefits are looking back on the last Tory government with affection. They may have talked a tough game but they never got round to radically changing anything. Too lazy themselves.Much the same could be said of the justice system. On Tuesday morning, the Commons was more than half full for justice departmental questions. And you would have been hard pushed to find a single MP who wasn’t keen to bang someone up for some crime or other. Thought crimes would do these days. In fact, they are probably the worst. Deserving of a full-life tariff at the minimum.The justice secretary and lord chancellor,Shabana Mahmood, captured the zeitgeist. “We need to make sure that we never run out of prison places,” she said. “You have my word that there will always be a prison place for everyone.”There we had it. She wouldn’t rest until the entire population of the United Kingdom had been sent down. Never mind the pretext. Only once everyone was in prison could we be sure the country was properly safe. The only flaw in her argument was that she couldn’t say who would be left to maintain the prisons. Or what she would find herself inside for.But MPs on all sides of the house were prepared to overlook this flaw in Mahmood’s logic. She had spoken a Higher Truth. That we were a Fallen People in need of incarceration. Throw away the key. There was no sentence that could not be commuted to capital punishment. Lee Anderson looked up. He was very much hoping that his former Reform colleague, Rupert Lowe, would be looking at the inside of a prison cell. With no chance of remission. Hell hath no fury …All of which was somewhat problematic for shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick. There is nothing more that Honest Bob would like to do than create trouble for Labour but he has almost no wriggle room. Because every time he comes up with an idea he finds that Mahmood is already on the same page.They are in the death spiral of the compassionless. A race to see if the other also has no soul. This might explain why Honest Bob appears to have developed a nervous twitch. Though that might be a side-effect of the Ozempic. Soon there will be nothing left of him but negative space.First off Honest Bob wanted to know why so many prisoners who were released early had gone missing. “Aha!” said Mahmood. She too was appalled. It was all down to the tagging contract with Serco that the Tories had agreed. She was on a mission to round everyone up. Including Serco. And the Tory ministers who had signed the deal.Jenrick looked distraught and sat down disconsolate. This is his one chance to parade his leadership credentials to the Tories and his Labour opposite number was consistently ahead of him. Hell, he was meant to be the modern face of the Nasty party. Being marginally brighter than Kemi wasn’t really cutting it.Things didn’t improve when we got to the main action. The new guidelines of the sentencing council. Honest Bob thought he had got ahead of the game by rubbishing them as two-tier justice. Unfair to white men. Only to find that Mahmood had got there first. She and Jenrick chose to ignore the fact that both Labour and the Tories had been happy to agree the new guidance only months ago.That was then. This was now. The public wanted a scapegoat and Labour was happy to give them one. The idea that black people might have been given longer sentences than white people under the existing guidelines never crossed Mahmood or Jenrick’s mind. Performance politics was the order of the day.It was all contagious. Junior justice minister Nic Dakin used to be a sweetheart. A liberal through and through. Now he is forced to adopt the persona of a rabid attack dog. He looks miserable. “Lock everyone up,” he yelled, his crazed eyes rotating manically. To wild applause. Mahmood then declared there were two prison wings in the UK that were drug free. Take me to them. Please. I don’t want any of the Kool Aid on which the Commons is overdosing.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchWelfareLabourKeir StarmerShabana MahmoodPrisons and probationcommentShareReuse this content"

The residents’ average age was 88, and three-quarters of them were women. Every resident had multiple medical conditions. Almost half required help to engage in the essential activities of daily life: getting out of bed, going to the bathroom, bathing, walking, eating. But they were survivors. Some had survived the Holocaust. Others fled the Cossacks. They all lived through the Great Depression.View image in fullscreenThe Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged in 1963.Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty ImagesThey were idealresearch subjects for Maria Fiatarone, a young doctor and faculty member in geriatric medicine at both Tufts and Harvard. In terrible shape, with lifetimes of practice overcoming great challenges: to Fiatarone, they were perfect.Beginning in the late 1980s, Fiatarone ran a series of studies in which she asked residents to commit to a regimen of high-intensity strength training. To many of her colleagues, the research seemed risky. Conventional wisdom in medicine at that time said the oldest people were not capable of lifting heavy weights – it might cause cardiac events. In all of western medical literature, Fiatarone found no evidence that any doctor had ever previously tried to teach frail 90-year-olds to do this kind of training.But she pressed forward with the research, and the Hebrew rehab liftersproduced unprecedented proof that high-intensity progressive resistance training can strengthen and build muscle even for the oldest people, with life-changing effects. Hebrew rehab residents who lifted weights gained power to function more independently, and to live with more autonomy and dignity, into their last years.View image in fullscreenThe Hebrew rehab lifters showed that strength training can be not only safe for practically everyone but also feasible.Photograph: Reproduced with permission of The Jewish Advocate, copyrighted, all rights reserved.Of the 10 residents Fiatarone chose for the first study – six women and four men – eight had a history of falls. Seven used canes or walkers to get around. Most were on at least four medications. Most had at least four chronic diseases. The most common diseases in this group were osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension and osteoporosis.Their workout program would be simple. It would consist of one exercise. The exercise was the knee extension. Picture someone sitting on the edge of a straight-backed chair. She contracts her quadriceps to extend her knees, lifting her lower legs. At the top of the motion, both legs extend straight out from her lap. Then she bends her knees to lower her shins and feet back down. The lift comprising that whole movement, up and down, is called the knee extension.Two things make the knee extension a good exercise for 90-year-olds. You can do it sitting down, and it strengthens muscles that help you stand up.To begin the study, Fiatarone and colleagues conducted maximal strength tests, determining the heaviest weight each person was able to lift one time with perfect form and through a full range of motion – their “one-repetition maximum”, or 1-RM. On average, the 10 maxed out at lifting less than 20lb. One person lifted almost 40. One person lifted about five.Each of the 10 residents then started coming to the physiotherapy room for three strength training sessions per week. In the first week, they lifted weights equal to 50% of their 1-RM, and for the rest of the two-month program, they lifted 80% of 1-RM. Their muscles adapted quickly, so the 1-RM tests were repeated every other week, to keep their efforts at 80% of maximum, allowing for consistent progress in their training to get stronger.One month into the two-month program, an 86-year-old man dropped out – an old hernia repair was bothering him – and then there were nine. In each training session, the lifters completed three sets of eight repetitions. They raised and lowered the weights very slowly: three or four seconds up, three or four seconds down. Between each of the three sets, they rested for a minute or two.There were no cardiovascular complications among the nine. They lifted and lowered the weight so slowly that their blood pressure and pulse rates (which were continuously monitored)barely changed. Four of the nine occasionally reported some discomfort in the hips or knees, but not to the point where anyone had to take a pain reliever or miss a training session. Everyone was able to do what was asked of them. And everyone did it. The study’s attendance rate was 98.8%.link to other well actually storiesThese people were dedicated, and they got stronger. The smallest strength gain was 61%. The largest was 374%. The average gain was 174%. The average increase in walking speed as measured by tandem gait was almost 50%. The magnitude of improvements for men and women were the same. Their muscles had not only grown stronger, but also bigger. In 1990, the Journal of the American Medical Association publishedresults of Fiatarone’s study, a paper now widely considered to mark the start of a paradigm shift in scientific understanding of muscle, strength and ageing.The 90-year-olds’ muscles grew by almost the same amount that a younger person’s muscles would grow in response to a similar lifting program.When Fiatarone began her research, she confronted skepticism and prejudice, stemming from ambivalence about muscle and weight training that was baked into medicine and mainstream popular culture. Even as she first proved that progressive resistance exercise is critical to long-term health for all, weight training was widely scorned, slighted and dismissed as hedonistic and extreme – because it was linked in that era’s headline news with steroid scandals, a newly reported psychiatric disorder among bodybuilders that would eventually be named “muscle dysmorphia”, and Saturday Night Live’s Hans and Franz.‘The only thing you need is your own mind’: how to start meditatingRead moreFiatarone was not distracted or deterred. Her studies of weight training, built upon and inspired by others’ research on younger subjects, helped establish a new perspective on their subject: for young and old alike, muscle-strengthening exercises can be a locus of regeneration, offering chances for growth and development; for service and self-improvement; and for healing and renewal.From birth, through the typical course of growth, most peoplebuild muscleup to a peak at the age of 30 or so. Then comes decline, when peoplelose muscleat a rate of at least 3-5% per decade.By the time we are older, in our 60s and 70s, therate of losscan accelerate to roughly 1% a year, or 10% a decade. General physical activitydoes not preventage-related loss of muscle, but with progressive resistance training, the losses can be slowed, or even substantially reversed.Even in the short time of Fiatarone’s eight-week study at Hebrew rehab, when older people’s muscles changed, their lives changed.Dorothy Tishler was 92. In her first session she lifted 17lbs with each leg. Eight weeks later, her strength had more than tripled. She lifted 60lbs with each leg. “I love it,” she told the reporter from the Jewish Advocate who visited the gym. “I have become younger. When I came here five years ago, I could hardly walk. Now I walk better than my daughter, who’s only 72.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In structured regimens overseen by qualified trainers, high-intensity strength training involves very low risk, even for the frailest, oldest people. As Fiatarone wrote, edging as near sarcasm as the idiom of medical literature allows: “The known hazards of immobility and falls seem to outweigh the potential risks of muscle strengthening interventions in this population.”Since then, research has consistently shown that resistance training injuries are rare, especially when people follow planned exercise programs under expert supervision; and this is true for people of all ages, at all levels of ability.The Hebrew rehab lifters showed that strength training can be not only safe for practically everyone but also feasible: easy and convenient. Fiatarone would later say: “To me, it was always the idea to keep exercise simple, keep focused on what was the most feasible thing to do.” Strength training is feasible in nursing homes, she says, whereas aerobic training may not be. To some, that may sound counterintuitive, but it’s the commonsense conclusion of her experience working with the oldest people. She continues: “When you go to a nursing home, it’s quite clear that people can’t do lots of kinds of aerobic exercise. Simple walking is really hard. Yet people can sit at a machine and lift heavy weights. It’s very much the opposite of what people think.”The Hebrew rehab strength-training study had extensive practical implications. Its philosophical implications were at least as far-reaching. What happened at Hebrew rehab upended the traditional story of ageing. The cliché of inevitable decline – as age increases, function wanes – turned out to be false. What happened in Dorothy Tishler’s legs suggested nothing less than a new way of considering the course of human life. The cliche that it’s never too late turned out to be true. Even into oldest age, even in dire situations, every person has some power to change how time changes the body. Especially if you have help, and knowledge.View image in fullscreenWhat happened at Hebrew rehab upended the traditional story of ageing.Photograph: Silvia Jansen/Getty ImagesStill, the Hebrew rehab lifters had not conquered time. Their example offered hope to others, but demanding hope. “All subjects resumed their sedentary lifestyle” after the study ended, Fiatarone found in follow-up visits with them. They resumed their sedentary lifestyle because the nursing home had no system or program in place to help them continue training. One month after the nine stopped lifting, they had lost, on average, a third of what they had gained during three months of workouts.“Changes in muscle function are not maintained in the absence of continued training,” Fiatarone wrote in the published study. Ongoing improvement would require “an ongoing program of muscle reconditioning”.Changes in muscle are not maintained for long periods of time, in the absence of continued training – for anyone, of any age. Up to the age of 35 or so, most younger people are, however, able to maintain muscular strength and mass with minimal frequency of exercise – as little as one workout per week, involving as little as one set per exercise. Likewise, most older people who have gotten stronger at the gym can maintain their increased ability to exert force with the same modest number of workouts, just one per week. Maintaining muscle mass for older people seems to require more exercise, though – at least two workouts per week, involving at least two or three sets per exercise.How do I stay healthy in my 70s?Read moreBy 1992, four years after the first small group of residents at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center began lifting weights, workouts had become a fixture of the culture of this nursing home. About half the residents had adopted some kind of strength training regimen by the late 1990s.An article in the Jewish Advocate in 1999 marked 1o years since the newspaper covered Fiatarone’s first strength training study.“Is the program merely the outgrowth of a perverse and impossible forever-young culture,” asked an intrepid reporter, “or is there meaning behind the madness? What is it?”“It’s a godsend, that’s what it is,” Ben Engleman said. He was 93 years old. He had been a shoe salesman in Swampscott, Massachusetts. When he arrived at the nursing home, he could not comb his hair or tie his tie. Four years later, because he followed a strength-training regimen, he was able to make himself look sharp again, without needing a hand from anyone else.Maria Fiatarone’s discoveries that older people could build muscle, strength and functional abilities by lifting heavy weights were reproduced by many other researchers around the world. Nevertheless, in most of the medical profession, as in global popular culture, ignorance about older people’s potential to build muscle and strength persists, as part of a general failure to recognize the centrality of muscle in human life and health for everyone, throughout the lifespan.This is an adapted excerpt fromStronger: The Untold Story of Muscle in Our LivesbyMichael Joseph Gross, a longtime Vanity Fair contributing editor.

There is something decidedly retro about the plans, which depict a vast tensile canopy stretched over the 100,000-capacity stadium and its surrounds, covering what Lord Foster says will be “arguably the largest public space in the world”. Putting something bigger than Tiananmen Square under a tent doesn’t sound like a particularly appealing prospect, but then the Man Utd mantra appears to be bigger is better.Stretched between three tall masts – which recall etiolated cousins of theSkylon, erected on the South Bank for the 1951 Festival of Britain – the project looks like a vision of the future from another era. It could be something dreamed up back when Foster was a lad in Levenshulme, growing up in poverty while his father laboured at the Metropolitan-Vickers works in Trafford Park, near where his new stadium will rise. The architect lord may now fly helicopters and enjoy homes in Cap Ferrat and Martha’s Vineyard, but for the purposes of this project at least, his northern working-class roots remain strong.View image in fullscreen‘A pleasure dome worthy of Kubla Khan’ … Foster’s Khan Shatyr shopping centre in Astana, Kazakhstan.Photograph: Andrey Orekhov/Getty Images/iStockphotoFoster’s festive visuals may conjure thoughts of Zippos travelling circus, but the big tent has an illustrious architectural history. The Russian engineer Vladimir Shukhov was the first to experiment with tensile membrane structures at scale, creating thrilling enclosures for theNizhny Novgorod Fair of 1896. His work inspired the German engineer Frei Otto to createthe world’s first tent-covered stadium for the 1972 Munich Olympics, which remains a stunning, gossamer thing to encounter. Its delicate roof hangs like a series of taut spider’s webs, dancing over the stands and concourse, suspended from tilting masts. It spawned a wave of similar experiments with tensile structures in the following decades, culminating in the big top to end all big tops, the Millennium Dome, designed by Foster’s former partner, Richard Rogers.Not to be outdone, Foster has already gone one better. The architectural lineage of his Old Trafford fantasy is not Frei Otto’s stadium, nor Rogers’ dome, but his own humungous shopping mall for Kazakhstan’s former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Unveiled in 2006, the Khan Shatyr stands at the end ofthe monumental urban axis in Astana, its cable-net roof rising at a jaunty angle to 150 metres, glowing pink and green by night, just as his Old Trafford big top will throb red. It is a pleasure dome worthy of Kubla Khan, housing dodgems, a rollercoaster and an artificial beach, beneath the biggest tent in the world. For now.If all goes to plan, Manchester could one day own that pleasure dome crown. The images depict an entire world swept beneath Foster’s three-pronged canopy – the trio of masts a reference to the club’s devil’s trident logo. They show vast acreages of concourse populated by crowds frolicking beneath the glossy red haloes of the stands, stacked in shimmering ringsrecalling Foster’s Apple HQ, while holograms of footballers float around them. Punters sit on grassy steps beside a water feature while a night-time scene shows people dancing on a stage with coloured lights suspended from the great tent, giving it the look of a disco at Center Parcs.But, just likeChelsea’s grand plans for a brick cathedral of football by Herzog & de Meuron, which was scrapped in 2022, could it end up being a PR mirage, as flimsy as Foster’s tensile membrane? Manchester United is currently £1bn in debt, and the club has yet to say how it plans to pay for the project.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureManchesterManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Actors, and the ‘wellbeing facilitators’ tasked with keeping them safe, reveal the trick to acting under the influenceHannah J DaviesTue 11 Mar 2025 07.30 EDTShare“Iam not a big drinker, I don’t do drugs, I don’t smoke,” says Sagar Radia, best known as the ruthless, potty-mouthed trader Rishi Ramdani in the HBO/BBC banking sagaIndustry. “But when friends and family watch, they’re like: ‘You look like you do know what you’re doing.’”Nowhere was this more the case than in season three’s White Mischief, an episode focused entirely on the character’s grim descent into gambling addiction, inflamed by booze and cocaine. Previously described by a colleague as “the ghost of Margaret Thatcher in a handsome Asian kid”, here Rishi starts to look more like a disgraced Tory MP in the 90s, as he binges on shots and coke in a seedy casino. At first he’s euphoric – dancing like a drunk uncle at a wedding – but soon his behaviour becomes erratic, his movements shaky and impaired, his legs unsteady. Despite rising debts, he gambles away all he has, and even seems to consider pawning his wedding ring for a few, long seconds. The next morning, we see him stagger into work on a comedown – bloody cuts and bruises all over his face.Be it on film or TV, it does feel as though we are seeing more of these emotional – and occasionally absurd – rock-bottom moments, with increasingly hardcore amounts of drink and drugs swilling around in characters’ systems. Industry and the Zendaya-led dramaEuphoriaare oft-cited examples. But who could forgetMurray Bartlett’s out-of-control hotel manager Armond in thefirst seasonof The White Lotus, a recovering addict who falls off the wagon so severely that he decides to defecate in a bratty guest’s suitcase?Season twowas equally marked by the presence of powder and pills, not least when Jennifer Coolidge’s already dopey Tanya is plied with party drugs at a Sicilian villa (after that series aired, one fan wrote on Twitter/X that judging the Emmys would be “tough this year as cocaine, viagra, and molly battle it out for best supporting actor”). Cinema isn’t immune, either. A new “proper naughty” hooliganism comedy, Marching Powder, sees Danny Dyerreunite withThe Football Factory director Nick Love for what the actor has described as a film with “more violence [and] more drugs” than its predecessor, released back in 2004.View image in fullscreenTired and emotional … Sagar Radia in Industry.Photograph: Nick Strasburg/BBCOf course, we know that actors aren’t likely to be necking tequilas or snorting the devil’s dandruff on screen; on Industry, the actors sniff milk powder rather than cocaine, and once the director shouts “Cut!” someone brings over a tissue and the actors blow out as much as they can. But how do they manage to make it look so real? Ironically, a great amount of focus is required for this kind of acting. For Radia, somewhat counterintuitively, that meant concentrating hard on appearing sober. On set,Konrad Kay, one of Industry’s showrunners, advised him to steady his legs, so as not to overcompensate. “It’s that classic thing of drunk people nottryingto play drunk,” Radia says. “Drunk people are trying to be sober!”His attention was also on the personal and professional pressurebubbling under the surface that might lead someone like Rishi to misuse drugs and alcohol in the first place. “I think if you’re trying to [act these scenes] without a sense of ‘Where is this coming from?’ and ‘Why is he sabotaging himself like this?’, then you’re just a guy playing drunk, and it makes no sense,” he says. “I didn’t think too much about the substances. I was thinking more about the pressures – whether it was his wife, his kid, his debt, or how much money he was losing at work. You bring all of that into his walk, his thousand-yard stare, his longing when he’s lost the money …”It would be naive to think that great acting underpinned all depictions of drink and drug use on screen. Method acting has definitely played its part: James Gandolfini and Michael Imperioli were once so sozzled on the set ofThe Sopranosthat they chained themselves to a tree so they wouldn’t fall off a cliff. ForWithnail and I– a comedy as alcoholic as it is melancholic – Richard E Grant was encouraged by director Bruce Robinson to drink, in order to have a “chemical memory” of inebriation. Despite an intolerance to the stuff, Grant has said that Robinson sent him home during rehearsals for the film with a bottle of champagne, and told him to “work your way through that, even if you vomit in between – which I did all night long.” Meanwhile, Billy Bob Thornton’s liquor-fuelled mall meltdown in Bad Santa was powered by an actual binge (he would later tell Entertainment Weekly: “I drank about three glasses of red wine for breakfast … then I switched over to vodka and cranberry juice, and then I had a few Bud Lights”). There are also the more troubling tales of actors turning up drunk for unrelated reasons, such as Oliver Reed who – says Ridley Scott – “probably had a couple of pints [during the filming of Gladiator] … said, ‘I don’t feel good’, laid on the carpet and died.”View image in fullscreenAll smilies … Murray Bartlett (right) as The White Lotus’s Armond.Photograph: HBOThese days, unsurprisingly, drinking on set is less acceptable, though not totally unheard of – especially when a performer is struggling with an alcohol problem off screen. “There have been times when an actor has substituted their non-alcoholic drink with an alcoholic one,” says Matt Longley, who also cites what he describes as a “one-off” example of an actor who managed to get their hands on some booze at a filming location (it was, after all, a shoot at a pub).Longley is one of the founders of6ft from the Spotlight, a non-profit that aims to support cast and crew in the filming of difficult material, and whose “wellbeing facilitators” are to portrayals of drugs and alcohol – or any other potentially problematic subject matter – what an intimacy coordinator would be to a sex scene.The organisation has to date trained 40 people to go on to sets, completing risk assessments and offering support to cast and crew, “from the SAs [supporting artistes, AKA extras] to the Mark Ruffalos of the world”. Industry is one production that benefits from a wellbeing facilitator.“Our whole ethos is to be preventive, and to try to work out what the issues might be before we start, by going through the script,” says Longley. “We offer training beforehand as well, so that people can support each other through that process, and also support themselves.” On some productions, he says, directors want something to happen that the performers don’t know about, in order to capture an authentic reaction (think: a character who we suspect takes drugs, suddenly snorting a line in front of their colleagues). “Much like an intimacy coordinator, we would say, ‘No, I wouldn’t do that.’ They’re actors, they’re able toacta reaction!”View image in fullscreenDeep end … Zendaya in Euphoria.Photograph:  Landmark MediaIn the US, a similar role has also started to become more widespread. Mental health coordinators now work across all of the major networks, according to Amanda Edwards, a therapist and intimacy coordinator who has spearheaded the movement. Coordinators support actors and crew in a similar way to their UK counterparts, and also offer guidance around the acting process itself. “It’s about how to act the thing without traumatising yourself, or risking injury to yourself,” says Edwards. This can mean finding ways to adjust an actor’s breath and how they move the muscles in their face, or modifying their speech patterns, vocal intonation and posture. “There are so manytricks that we can use so that a performer doesn’t actually have to feel or even imagine that they are feeling the effects of a substance; they can just make their body do the things it would do if it was under the influence.”It is as important to think about how to get into character as it is to think about how to get out of it once production has wrapped, says Edwards. There are, she says, “documented cases of crew members who maybe have a sober journey behind them, but through participating in a project that involves substance use, have gone into a relapse or have struggled tremendously with their mental health”. In 2023, Euphoria’s Dominic Fike, who was struggling with addiction at the time,talked aboutthe impact filming the HBO series had on him: “I was a drug addict and coming on to a show that’s … mainly about drugs, is very difficult” (he was subsequently provided with a sober coach on set).If this all sounds rather heavy, then it’s a relief to know that acting drunk, high or both on screen can be a welcome challenge. In a2021 interview, Murray Bartlett told the Observer that playing Armond had been “a gift. There were moments of terror, but mostly it was pure joy.” As for Radia, he says he had a blast. “It was an amazing moment for a south Asian actor like myself to get an opportunity to carry an episode on one of the biggest networks in the world,” he says. “I know it can seem like it’s all deep and high stakes, but actually sometimes they’re the fun things to play.”Season three ofThe White Lotusis airing on Sky Atlantic & Now; Marching Powder is in cinemas7 March.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAlcoholDrugsTelevision industryThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

British audiences loved it and understood the power of a black band making such a striking visual statement, but in America it was different.“American audiences were sort of dumbstruck and flabbergasted,” says lead singer David Hinds, now 68, remembering their first US visit, in 1981. “They told us they didn’t even know there were black people in England, let alone would do a song like Ku Klux Klan. In Boston a white guy jumped out of the audience and started a struggle onstage. In the end the police came and dragged him off. Our elderly African American T-shirt seller said he was scared for us every time we went onstage. He’d say ‘You don’t know America. This place is something else.’”When the tour reached Birmingham, Alabama, where a black man had recently been lynched in nearby Mobile, they wore the hoods in front of a visibly segregated audience. “We could see the divide from the stage,” Hinds remembers. Founding guitarist Basil Gabbidon, 69, is no longer with the band but still marvels at what he now puts down to youthful bravery and naivety. “Looking back, we could have been shot or anything,” he says, “but I suppose if I saw a band doing something like that, I’d think, ‘These guys are serious.’”View image in fullscreenSerious guys … (l-r) David Hinds, Steve Nisbett, Mykaell Riley, Selwyn Brown, Alphonso Martin, Basil Gabbidon.Photograph: Echoes/RedfernsThe song – and the hoods – certainly made an impression on Bob Marley, when they toured together. “The expression on his face was simply ‘What the …. ?’!” Hinds chuckles. “He’d never seen anything like it. Nobody had, but after a while we didn’t need to wear them any more because the song had done its job.”Today, ahead of their 50th anniversary celebration tour, Steel Pulse can look back on many such milestones. They were the first British reggae band to score a Top 10 album, with their debutHandsworth Revolutionin 1978, and one of the first on Top of the Pops. “The first non-Jamaican act to win a best reggae album Grammy [for 1985’sBabylon the Bandit],” says Hinds. “The first – maybe only – reggae act to perform at a Presidential inauguration” – for Bill Clinton, in 1993. “There are a lot of firsts with Steel Pulse, but sometimes I feel we’re overlooked.”Still, none of it could have seemed remotely possible when they started rehearsing in various parents’ houses with, as Gabbidon remembers: “My brother Colin playing the sofa with sticks, like a drum kit.”A group of former Handsworth Wood Boys schoolfriends, they started the band in 1975 as teenagers wanting to play a British take on reggae. “We lived in an industrial area, so the music had a kind of metallic edge,” the guitarist explains. “Plus, we listened to everything from jazz-funk to Elton John. We didn’t want to sound Jamaican.” With Ronnie “Stepper” McQueen on bass, the songs reflected the British Black experience, not the Caribbean one informing most reggae at the time.View image in fullscreenDavid Hinds in 2010.Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Drăgoi/The Guardian“We sang about our lives,” explains keyboard player Selwyn Brown, 66. “Institutionalised racism in the police and education, civil rights, injustice – and the treatment of our parents, the Windrush generation, who’d been invited to the UK to rebuild the country after the second world war. We wanted to be a voice for people who didn’t have a voice.”Initially, gigs were hard to come by. Black clubs felt they were too militant or rebellious. “Or they’d say we were ‘too interesting’, musically,” chuckles Gabbidon. “They’d ask, ‘Can’t you just play someDennis Brown?’” Things changed after the band’s management had the radical but inspired idea of putting them in punk clubs. “We were like: what?!” Brown chuckles. “In those days punks would spit and throw things if they liked an artist … so we thought, what happens if they don’t like you? But we took the chance.”Thus, in the punk summer of 1977, the young Brummie reggae band nervously found themselves sandwiched between the Lurkers and Generation X at the Vortex club on London’s Wardour Street. “I was dreading going on,” Brown admits. “But before we played a note we introduced ourselves as a reggae band, not punk, and said, ‘You’re welcome to pogo or whatever but can you please not spit at us?’ To our surprise, nobody did. Instead, they listened. We stayed and watched all the other bands and the following week we were all over the music press.”View image in fullscreen‘We stuck to our guns’ …. David Hinds and Selwyn Brown.Photograph: Patrick NiddrieThis was the beginning of a deep kinship and tours with the likes of the Adverts and the Stranglers. “The punks empathised with us because they went through similar experiences,” says Brown. “Thesus laws[‘suspected person’ stop and search] and such. We were all rebelling against the system.” As Hinds puts it: “We became part of the punk family.”After they signed to Bob Marley and the Wailers’ label, Island, Ku Klux Klan became Steel Pulse’s first single for the label. At school Hinds had achieved a poor grade in English, but discovering the poetry of William Blake and Alfred Tennyson inspired him to write lyrics. He penned the words to his band’s most controversial song in response to reading that Klan grand wizard David Duke was about to visit the UK to advise the National Front, but also drawing on his own experiences of being chased by older white men. “I used to kick a stone all the way to school in Handsworth,” he says. “So I wrote: ‘Walking around kicking stones, just minding my own business / I go face to face with my foe, disguised in violence from head to toe.’”Released in April 1978, the single coincided with a huge march from Trafalgar Square to Victoria Park, where Steel Pulse, the Clash and others performed forRock Against Racism. “The organisers expected 20,000 people, but over 80,000 turned up,” remembers Brown. “It was overwhelming.” The Labour politician Peter Hain – an RAR organiser then – has since said that the scale of that show was “decisive in running the NF out of town and helping to create a climate in which being racist was not acceptable”.Ku Klux Klan was denied airplay and reached No 41, but the band’s momentum was unstoppable. The Handsworth Revolution album landed in the Top 10 and Marley asked them to support the Wailers in the UK and in Europe. “That was the first time I saw a crowd hold lighters in the air,” remembers Gabbidon. “Bob’s audience was so eclectic. Black, white, brown. I’m sure I saw some Martians there as well.”Hinds, who fondly remembers playing football with Marley, still bitterly regrets turning down an offer to visit the singer in hospital in New York in 1981, when he had cancer. “I knew he’d lost his hair with the chemotherapy so I didn’t want to see this great man like that,” he sighs. “We spoke on the phone instead but there was no suggestion in his voice that he was ill. He talked about having us on his label and had all these plans. I didn’t know he’d been told he had a month to live. I said, ‘You know what? All I want you to do is get well soon so we can chant down Babylon together.’ That was the last time we spoke.”It hasn’t been plain sailing for Steel Pulse. Hinds talks of being dropped by labels, business rip-offs and at one point having to record in “what was virtually a shack”. Today, only the singer and Brown remain from the Handsworth Revolution era, but they’ve navigated the ship through decades of personal, musical and political upheaval and still record and tour around the world.“I think that’s been a combination of trying to stay current, creating an affinity with our fans and also a bit of luck and timing as well,” considers Brown. At times they’ve also had to hold their nerve, just as they did on that first trip to America. “When we told Island we wanted to call the first album Handsworth Revolution, [label boss] Chris Blackwell said ‘Nobody knows where Handsworth is. Can’t you call it Birmingham Revolution or something?’” remembers Gabbidon. “But we stuck to our guns. I like to think we put Handsworth on the map.”Steel Pulse’s 50th Anniversary Celebration tour is at the Roundhouse in London tonight, then touringExplore more on these topicsReggaePunkBlack British culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Has Reform reached its breaking point?Marina HydeIt’s great for those who enjoy a punch-up on the right, but as the zealots duke it out, think of the voters who trusted themTue 11 Mar 2025 09.53 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 14.02 EDTShareHow soon before one of Reform’s MPs starts touting himself as the reform Reform candidate? A negative amount of time, it seems, with Great Yarmouth MPRupert Lowealready relieved of the whip for saying that Reform is currently “a protest party led by the Messiah”. Yep: Jesus Christ Superkings.Anyway, Nigel Farage has taken all this as well as you might expect. In terms of what’s happened since, with even Nigel judging that “things have got a little bit out of control”, I’m finding it quite hard to immerse myself fully in every angle. Mainly because I’m worried it’s going to be one of those stories that demeans men – and I’m a passionate supporter of their involvement in politics, whatever people are saying about DEI nowadays.But the broad brush of it is: a party leader who wants to be PM is too much of an egomaniac to even handle having some MPs; some of his people who hate lawyers have called in the lawyers; some of his people who love free speech have been upset by some words; and some of his people who hate snowflakes have gone to the actual police about what they say is a bit of verbal. Then again, there is an alternative broad brush: Lowe is an old Radleian who admires Tommy Robinson; meanwhile, Elon Musk – a man who owns X but apparently has no access to Google – now thinks Rupert is the fairest of them all and that Nigel “doesn’t have what it takes”. In fact, according to a report in Tuesday’s Financial Times, Elon Musk’s allies suggest he wouldfinancially back a credible alternativeparty to Reform.All this has outraged Farage, because he badly needs donations and isn’t currently getting them at anything like the rate he needs (hepicked up £280,000in the last three months of 2024, versus £2m for the Tories and £1m for Labour. Also, because he’s Nigel Farage. As so often in seeking the perfect commentator on contemporary British politics, I am drawn to Legend from Gladiators, who once remarked: “There is no I in team. But there are five in individual brilliance.”Hang on – there have been even more developments in Nigel v Rupert. On Tuesday morning, Lowe’s Westminster staff countered alleged bullying allegations against the MP by putting out anadorably weird statementsaying they love working for him. For his part, Lowe has issued an invitation to Farage that feels somewhat hilarious in these particular circumstances: “Please, let’s have dinner and resolve this in a manner that our members and the country would expect.” Half-cut in an ultra-metro-elite restaurant on someone else’s dime? You’re right, I would expect that.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage in front of his notorious, widely denounced Brexit poster, June 2016.Photograph: Phil Toscano/PAMeanwhile, a senior Reform figure last weekendconfided darkly: “[Rupert] has crossed Nigel, and the political world is littered with the bodies of people who have done that.” Mm. Not sure that’s the boast they think it is. Yet we do have to accept that violence, both figurative and literal, has occasionally been a feature of the 37 parties which Nigel has at one point or another led / founded / been associated with / been CEO of. But for the benefit of the lawyers, I want to be very clear that I agree entirely with his senior Reform ally: Nigel Farage is only ametaphoricalpsychopathic killer who cannot handle colleagues disagreeing with him.Or, as Farageprefers to characterisethe deterioration of relations with Lowe: “I have been surprised and saddened at this behaviour. Certainly, I never saw anything like it in the European parliament in 2019 when I was the leader of the Brexit party and Mr Lowe was an MEP colleague.” And yet, is Nigel quite such an innocent? In terms of vignettes that all this has exhumed from the memory hole, do you remember theUkip punch-upin the Strasbourg parliament? This was during the Brexit years, and saw poetry-writing MEP Steven Woolfe flat-out collapse, shortly after a reported altercation with the party’s defence spokesman, Mike Hookem. Initial chronicler of the bust-up was fellow Ukip MEP Neil Hamilton, who rushed towards the cameras to play thechuckling man-of-the-world, declaring: “Steven picked a fight … and came off worse”. (Sorry Neil, but you simply CAN’T carry off talk like that when you wear a bow tie and sit on your wife’s knee.) Farage’s own dismissive comment on the incident was that this was just “something that happens between men”.A big thank you to Reform for the comic relief in dark times | John CraceRead moreMuch more to the present point, however, we now have to ask how the Lowe-Farage kumite will play out in Runcorn and Helsby. There is, of course, going to be a byelection there, after Labour MP Mike Amesbury was convicted of punching one of his constituents on a night out, which I believe started with himposing upwith his good friend the local police commissioner. (There is nothing – NOTHING – wrong with our country right now.) Reform is in second place in Runcorn and Helsby, so the question is whether this public meltdown will derail the momentum it has enjoyed since the election. Lowe is certainly trying to make sure it does, taking to social media to announce: “I feel so sorry for millions of decent British men and women from all over the country who put their faith in Reform.” Tell you what, it’s great to find themuch-loved former Southampton FC chairmanon the side of the fans again.Having said that … if you’d had a political Tardis in recent years, you could have taken someone from the not-too-distant past on any number of mind-blowing journeys into the batshit present. But I almost think you’d get the most poleaxed reaction of all if you piloted it back to Southampton’s Westquay shopping centre in 2009, and gave any random Saints fan a quick look at the future. Consider what you’d be revealing: “In 16 years’ time, the richest man in the world – who’s the unofficial vice-president to Donald Trump, yes, the one off the US Apprentice – will say that Rupert Lowe should be prime minister of the United Kingdom.” Rupert Lowe?! RUPERT LOWE?!?!?! I honestly think the resultant psychiatric eruption would blow the roof off the mall.Yet here we all are. Listen, I’m not against the idea of personal growth, but it is some distance beyond wild that a guy who took Southampton football club into administration now reckons he’d do a better job with an entire country. And, it must be acknowledged, it says even more about the utter failure of the political mainstream that guys like Lowe now seem a possible throw of the dice for people who don’t feel their lives have been remotely improved in getting on for two decades.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageRupert LowecommentShareReuse this content"

So why menace Labour members who actually believe that?Polly ToynbeeTwo party activists in Sussex who worked with the Lib Dems last year to kick out the Tories have been expelled. This is horribly short-sightedTue 11 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 11.50 EDTShareOn a picturesque bridge beside Harvey’s brewery in Lewes, Steve Coogan, local resident and lifelong Labour man, stood surrounded by Liberal Democrat campaigners and many Labour supporters. It was the middle of last year’s general election campaign, and supporters of both parties cheeredCoogan’s message: “Where the main contenders against the Tories are the Liberal Democrats, that’s what people should vote. Vote tactically to get the Tories out!” Around the country, millions did. John Curtice, still working on the estimates, says he reckons tactical voting may have delivered Labour up to 100 extra seats, and stacks of Lib Dem gains. The spirit of the election was a country determined to punish the Conservatives.On the bridge that day was Lewes Labour member and film-maker Tony Dowmunt, filming Coogan to put his message on social media, urging progressive voters everywhere to vote tactically to oust the Tories. But Dowmunt and fellow Lewes Labour member Paul Wafer, who was holding the microphone that day, have both beenexpelled from Labour. “Your membership of the party stands terminated. You are no longer entitled to attend any party meetings or to exercise any other rights associated with membership of the party,” said their letters from Labour HQ, unsigned – merely from the “Disputes Team”.The claim is that the two ousted members “demonstrated the type of support for the Liberal Democrats that is incompatible with chapter 2, clause I.5.B.vi of theLabour party rule book”. In principle, that’s a necessary rule: members can’t back parties standing against Labour, or the multitude of prohibited anti-Labour groupuscules. But, as Wafer wrote to party officials in his defence, many had “worked together during the election campaign to do everything we could locally to help secure a Labour government, by ridding the country of as many sitting Tory MPs as possible. In Lewes, Labour couldn’t win, but the Tories could lose. Getting the Tories defeated in Lewes made a direct contribution to Labour’s victory in July.”Labour HQ had rightly written off Lewes anyway. In an unspoken electoral alliance, Labour and the Lib Dems laser-focused their respective campaigning on plausibly winnable seats. Lewes Labour people like Dowmunt went canvassing in Crawley and Worthing West, where they helped eject Tories from both seats. Labour’s selective targeting was so overt that LabourListpublished a listof 211 “non-battleground” constituencies: of which Lewes was one. When the results werecounted, Labour came in fourth behind Reform with just 6.7%. But someone snitched on these two members to Labour HQ for breaching the rules; Labour even contemplatedthrowing outNeal Lawson, the director of Compass, for his organisation’s tactical voting campaign. What madness is this? Keir Starmer often says, “Country first, party second”. But this puts party tribalism well ahead of everything, as does his rejection of electoral reform.What happened in Lewes is a small local matter, you may think, but its implications for progressive government are profound. With the right in power most of my lifetime, despite the left and centre-left clocking up most votes in virtually every election, Labour’s high command sticks to bone-headed tribal obduracy on electoral reform. In doing so, it is responsible for preventing British politics from matching that of its citizens. That’s despite the party at large voting in favour ofelectoral reformin 2022, and despite the dozens of new Labour MPs whosupport it. The latest polling shows votersbacking proportional representation(PR) over first past the post (FPTP) by 49% to 26%. Frequently cheated itself in the past, in 2024 it was Labour that benefited grotesquely from FPTP, winning more than 60% of seats on a third of the vote. The Electoral Reform Society chief executive, Darren Hughes, called it one of the mostdisproportional election resultsthe world had ever seen.As the youngest peer in the House of Lords, I have a bold plan for this place. Abolish it – me included | Carmen SmithRead moreIt is all the more frustrating that Labour could be using its ill-gotten stonking majority to bring in reform – at least for one election initially, with another confirming vote in parliament afterwards. A system devised for two parties has become dangerously fragile and unpredictable with four to five parties competing. The smallest voting shift causes seismic shocks. “A breath of wind can change everything,” Prof Rob Ford tells me. “Just one in 50 voters changing their minds can make the difference between triumph and disaster.” Between the 2019 and 2024 elections, Labour gained only1.7% more votes, but that gave it 32% more of the total seats. That same dysfunction could blow Reform into power on a small increase: FPTP now causes fickle precarity, not stability and certainty. With such fine margins,Elon Musk’s millionsreally may swing an election, says Ford – another good reason to clear big money out of politics at the same time.Turbulence at home and abroad makes election predictions pointless: Starmer got a bounce this week fromYouGov, with 48% thinking he is handling the Ukraine crisis well, against 32% who don’t. But in a few days Labour’s standing may plummet again, if its benefit cuts are too harsh. The crunch spending review later this month will define Labour: iron-fisted fiscal rigour with severe cuts could alienate progressive voters, without attracting the right.Voting systems profoundly influence everyday politics. FPTP focuses all effort on wooing a few mercurial swing voters, who are likely to be more tax-averse. “Under PR, politics becomes more progressive,” Ford tells me. “PR prevents extremes; you’d never get a Thatcher government again. Coalitions moderate policies.” Then why didn’t Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems moderate the ferocious austerity of David Cameron and George Osborne in the2010 parliament? “They got run over: they’ve learned their lesson.”Next timeLabourmay well be in coalition, and electoral reform will be the price. As Ford warns them: “Be nice to people when you’re on top, as you’ll need them on your way down.” Treating near-allies as the enemy looks arrogant. Lewes’s sensible tactical voters are not Labour traitors.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerFirst past the postProportional representationcommentShareReuse this content"

These terms all describe what has happened with theTrump administration’s first arrest for thought crimes, something that should never happen in a democracy.But it has, to Mahmoud Khalil, a recently graduated master’s student from Columbia University’s school of international and public affairs. And for each minute that Khalil is held in detention, every one of us should feel like our own individual rights in this country are being shredded. The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil is a barefaced attempt by theTrump administrationto destroy free thinking while murdering due process and free speech along the way. This is an ominous development.On the evening of Saturday 8 March, Khalil, who is a lawful permanent resident of the US (a green card holder), and his US-citizen wife, who is eight months pregnant, were returning home to their Columbia University apartment in upper Manhattan. According toreports, the couple had just unlocked the door to the building when plainclothes agents from the Department of Homeland Security pushed their way in like thugs and demanded Khalil surrender himself for arrest.The lead agent told Khalil’s lawyer, whom Khalil had immediately called, that his student visa was being revoked. But Khalil doesn’t have a student visa for the very simple reason that he is alawful permanent resident! Apparentlyconfused, the agent next responded that Khalil’s green card was being revoked – which, by US law, cannot be done without a lot of due process. When pressed by Khalil’s lawyer to show a warrant for arrest, the agent simply hung up on the lawyer, shoved Khalil into handcuffs, and carted him away. As of this writing, Khalil is in a detention facility in Louisiana.[Democracy] takes a lot of people to support it, but it gives quickly when faced with pressure from the other sideLet’s be clear. If you grew up in Egypt or Nicaragua or Russia, you would recognize this behavior. If you have read the work of Milan Kundera or Ariel Dorfman or Breyten Breytenbach, you will recognize this behavior. This is how the authoritarian regimes always operate, seeking to demonize their critics and neutralize their opposition by lies, exaggerations and the blunt force of state power. This despicable and dangerous conduct has now come to the land of the free and the home of the brave as official policy.The Trump administration doesn’t even bother to disguise the ideological assault that characterizes Khalil’s arrest. Khalil was an active member of Columbia University’s protests againstIsrael’s war on Gaza, a war that has been characterized as a genocide by Israel byexpertsandmultiplehuman rightsorganizationsaround the world. Khalil also served as a negotiator between the university administration and student activists who had set up an encampment on campus.It was in that role that Khalil’s profile grew, particularly among extreme rightwing organizations supporting Israel that begansendinglists of students to the Trump administration who, they said, should be deported from the US because of their views. This blatant attempt to shut down free speech picked up afterDonald Trumpissued two executive orders in late January that called for deporting “perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment”. (It shouldn’t be lost on anyone that the Trump administration is activelycancelingevery form of protection for other minority populations, while appearing deeplyconcernedabout antisemitism, as it also tacitlysupportsantisemitic behavior.)Khalil had already suffered so much harassment by these pro-Israel groups that the day before his arrest, hewroteto the interim president of Columbia University, telling her that he was afraid that government officials or private actors would target him or his family, urging her to provide him legal support and protection. After his arrest, the official White House account on X issued apostthat said: “Shalom, Mahmoud,” using a Hebrew word that can mean goodbye. Haha. Whoever wrote the post must think this very clever. But in a court of law, the post will only buttress the argument that Trump is on a rampage to shut down any types of speech he doesn’t like.Exactly which crime has Mahmoud Khalil committed? Which activities has he engaged in to warrant arrest and deportation? The best theDepartment of Homeland Securitycan come up with are the same flimsy innuendo that we hear over and over again. Any show of concern for Palestinians is, presto, turned into “activities aligned to Hamas”.That “aligned to Hamas” is not a legal standard is hardly surprising. It comes after all from the Trump administration, which operates almost definitionally as the opposite of a legal standard. Expecting something reasonable from this administration is like eating a razor-blade sandwich and thinking you won’t come out all bloodied, which is of course why the Trump administration is repeatedly offering you such aromatic and enticing fresh bread.I expect as much from Trump, but I demand more from Columbia University, my own alma mater. After Trump withdrew some $400m of federal funding over an unproven and completely ideologically driven allegation that Columbia was a hotbed of antisemitism, the interim president didn’t bother to defend her institution. Instead, she immediately sent us Columbia affiliates an email to “assure the entire Columbia community that we are committed to working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns”. I’m educated enough to know that the word “appeasement” has a specific history. I also know that cowards run away from Palestine, even if they too will be the ones who suffer in the end.Threaten campuses, shut down debate: that’s what free speech looks like under Trump | Owen JonesRead moreI also demand more from my local officials. This federal assault on protected speech from a New Yorker should raise huge alarms from the mayor of New York, but all we’ve heard fromEric Adamsthus far is … well, what sound would crickets make if they were flyingbusiness class on Turkish Airlines? If it’s any sound at all, I imagine the jet engine hums louder than the lack of objection he’s made. His silence is matched only by Andrew Cuomo, Adams’s new competition for the next New York mayoral race. Together, they might have enough courage to lose a game of chicken to the lion in the Wizard of Oz.But mostly, I demand a whole lot more from the Democratic party. Where is Hakeem Jeffries? Where is Chuck Schumer? They seem to believe the best way to defend free speech in this country is not to speak at all. Irrelevance has never been so recognizable.Democracy has always been a fragile, improvised, teetering wall of bricks that extends high in the air. It takes a lot of people to support it, but it gives quickly when faced with pressure from the other side. The thing is, even if you’re not supporting it, you’ll still get crushed when the wall falls. Too many people seem ready to be crushed. That’s only the tiniest reason to support Mahmoud Khalil. We all need to rush to the wall and do what we can to free him from his unjust imprisonment. For him and also for us. Because, you know what?

The times demand no lessTue 11 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 11.49 EDTShare“Keep calm and carry on.” We all know that famous second world war poster, don’t we? But it’s illusory: the poster was never publicly displayed during the war and only discovered by chance decades later.Illusions bedevil our readiness to cope with the crises we might face. Reviewing the state of UK civil food resilience for aNational Preparedness Commission report, I found that there is, in fact, scant preparedness going on, and little attention given to involving the public.The official government resilience framework has three sound principles: first, take a “whole of society” approach; second, prevention is better than the cure; and third, build a shared understanding of the risks. But what does this mean in practice? Not nearly enough. I found the further away from Whitehall I looked, the less people were being engaged.On the morning of 22 May last year, hours before the general election was called, the Conservative MP Oliver Dowden, then deputy prime minister, told a defence industries conference that he wanted everyone in the UK to storethree days’ worth of food and water.But this is scarcely realistic. For individuals juggling competing financial demands, food is the flexible item in their budget. Fixed costs come first. There are other problems too. The Food Foundation’s 2025Broken Platereport states: “Healthier foods are more than twice as expensive per calorie than less healthy foods and less available. The most deprived fifth of the population would need to spend 45% of their disposable income on food to afford the government-recommended healthy diet – rising to 70% for households with children.” So with rampant diet and health gaps caused by income inequalities, any notion of a “whole of society” solution evaporates.The national risk register, the UK’s official list of 89 risks facing us, barely acknowledges food. It points to just one risk:food supply contamination, and that’s on page 122 in the 2025 document. Yet almost all the expert opinion I canvassed predicted enormous short- and long-term food security challenges ahead. Think energy outages, ransomware attacks, AI/bot attacks, internet failure, chokepoints and trade disruption. Think geopolitical downturn, the spread of war and overt conflicts, and disinformation-led public panics. In addition, there are all the impacts of climate heating: biodiversity loss, too much or too little water, and soil erosion.It may salve the consciences of central government planners to putemergency preparedness adviceon to a website, but it is clearly not enough. Two countries I examined, Latvia and Sweden, have developed practical advice. Last year Sweden produced a major reorientation of its food policy and intends to build more diversity into its food system, including creating dispersed national food stores. Sweden is also passing new legislation making it a responsibility of mayors to ensure that all are fed in a crisis. Storage has been central to crisis preparedness throughout human history, but in the modern world only Switzerland retains anational food store.So what should we do? Myreportargues that public protection depends on action at national, regional, community and household levels. Just telling the public to store food is ridiculous. As interviewees told me, it’s a fantasy to think that everyone can look after themselves. Resilience isn’t a bolt-on feature. It emerges from how the food system operates, how we relate with each other.For more than half a century, food companies have pursued lean efficiency. The only storage, as the logistics industry told me, is what’s on the motorway in delivery lorries.“Just in time” managementhates storage. That’s why I propose that we switch to a“just in case” approach.This needs community action, not just top-down advice. Already there are UK communities, towns and some cities that see the need for this. In Yorkshire, theFixOurFood coalitionof communities, suppliers and academics has created a network of advice and knowledge about who can do what now. InFlintshireandEdinburghcommunity gardeners have trialled alternatives to our dependency on the big retailers. Building community solidarity is a process.Latvians I spoke to said: “We tell our people that if Russia invades, government will collapse.” This advice is given not to scare people but to focus the public’s attention so people know how to help themselves and each other if shocks do come. Every household has a pack of cards containing this information.Rule number one in resilience planning is to try to prevent crises in the first place via a sustainable food system. But rule number two is to help build capacities to bounce back after shocks hit. Things won’t be the same. A country that expects food to be on shelves 364 days a year (Christmas Day excepted) just isn’t prepared for shocks. TheFair Food Futures Projecthas been asking communities in Bradford and London’s Tower Hamlets to assess what emergency food systems they have by mapping “community food assets”. I think this is essential. Your local cafe or pub might be where simple meals can be cooked after a shock.Biohazards, Putin, extremism… we’ll need more than a few tins of beans | Martha GillRead moreAt a restricted official meeting I attended last year, we were all asked how many of us had a “grab bag” – a carrier you can sling over your shoulder to escape when danger strikes, with essentials such as passport, bank details, phone, charger, keys, glasses, medication, child essentials, cash, contact details and food. We were also asked how many of us kept a store for emergencies. Most kept the bag; fewer had an emergency store of food.But then it’s easier to prepare a grab bag than it is to lay down heavy and costly stores of food, much less water, which is what you most need in the short term. The Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protectionreminds its citizensthat they can go without food for 30 days but without water for only three. The truth is that we UK citizens live in a fantasy world – a legacy of the British empire – that someone far away will always feed us. At the same time, business knows that there are shocks ahead too big for even them to handle. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says 2025 is the year itaddresses food security and resilience. It must. Only the government can provide the direction that is sorely needed. The public must hold it to account, hopefully before calamity strikes.Tim Lang is professor emeritus of food policy at the Centre forFoodPolicy, City St George’s, University of LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionEmergency planningcommentShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, its fast-fashion brands – not just Boohoo itself but also Pretty Little Thing and MAN – haven’t gone away. All are struggling badly.Since the latter collection still represents three-quarters of group revenues, new chief executive Dan Finley’s upbeat talk about an exciting future feels more than a little premature. The main market-moving news in the strategy rejig and trading update was another downgrade to the City’s profit expectations alongside a thumping £40m charge for writing down surplus stock at what are now badged as the “youth brands”. The shares fell 4%.The resuscitation operation onDebenhams, now in online-only form obviously, also seems to be more a work-in-progress rather than a definitive “we’re back” moment. Pushing a “marketplace” platform model – selling other retailers’ brands, in other words – was an obvious move since all the big names in clothing, from Next to Marks & Spencer to John Lewis, have ramped up activity in that arena. The stock-lite and capital-lite features obviously also hold appeal for a group that still has too much debt.But 10% growth for Debenhams is not a shoot-the-lights-out performance and the open question is the true size of the outside third-party “marketplace” element. How much of the turnover is coming from in-house labels Wallis, Coast, Oasis, Dorothy Perkins and Warehouse? Jefferies’ analyst Andrew Wade reckons the pure platform contribution is “diminutive” – strip out internal brands and beauty products from Debs’ revenues of £205m and he thinks it could be as little as £50m-£60m. Fair point: the partners may be enjoying “strong growth” on the platform, as the group says, but from what level?Meanwhile, revenues at the fast-fashion brands were down by almost a quarter to £947m and it’s hard to escape the impression thatBoohoohas simply had its day in the sun. From one direction, industry giants Shein and Temu intrude; from the other, websites for secondhand goods such as Vinted are a coming force.The group’s solution, again, is to adopt a marketplace model for its “youth brands” but it hasn’t happened yet. In any case, Shein itself is talking about adding a marketplace and it clearly has more dollars to throw at its project. If a quick sale of Boohoo etc is possible, it looks like an easier option. The views of Mike Ashley, 27% shareholder andpresumably still grumpy, are awaited.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An unneeded US warehouse has been closed, the Manchester-based group has sold its London office, and there’s been an attack on costs. It all helps.

I honestly don’t get it – it’s like having one football match a year. All that lost skill, all those fans, the empty stadiums, the vast reservoir of interest gathered and then left to stagnate. Where is an average person supposed to watch heelwork to music for the rest of the year? Do they expect us to teach our own dogs to do it?I have nothing against whippets, but upon thecoronation of Miuccia– gracious congratulations to Italy for its first best in show in 134 years of Crufts – I need to point out that these are not full‑fat dogs. I don’t mean they are too lean – I would never body shame an animal. I mean they are too self-possessed, too standoffish, too independent. They are cat-dogs. If you are going to crown one of those in a dog show, you need to split the top award into categories: best dog in show, best cat-dog in show … hell, throw in a best cat if you are bent on ruining everything.Just as I would never make a personal remark about a dog or a cat-dog, so I would never criticise a six-year-old, least of all Freddie Osborne, the youngest person ever to win a prize at Crufts. Except to say: if you are from Staffordshire, lad, you don’t arrive with a fox terrier. You arrive with a staffy.I regretfully point to evidence of bias – not among the judges, but from Clare Balding, the long-term presenter of the competition. She manifestly loves spaniels, to the extent that she let one on her presenter’s sofa and then rolled around with it. The only way to rectify this is for Balding to let all the dogs on her sofa next year and roll around with them.Other than that, excellent work, everyone.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His dad, who issued him anunconditional pardonas one of his last acts as US president, saved him from the justice system – but it’s quite apparent no one is coming to save his art career.You may have had other things on your mind lately, so let me remind you about the trajectory of one of the US’s most controversial artists. Just a few years ago, Joe Biden’s troubled son, who had previouslyearned megabuckssitting on various boards doing mysterious board things, was enjoying remarkable success as an “emerging” artist. His paintings were being exhibited in a fancy New York gallery and selling for large sums. Kevin Morris, a Hollywood lawyer and friend of Biden, reportedly bought 11 works fora total of $875,000(£690,000). Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali, a Democratic donor, bought two paintings, for $42,000 and $52,000. All in all, Hunter sold art for about $1.5m between 2021 and 2024. Not too shabby for someoneconsidered an amateur.Now, however, Biden’s creative career appears to be cratering. In court filings last week, Hunter said he was seeking to dismiss a lawsuit concerning his abandoned laptop hard drive because he doesn’t have the money to continue litigation. “My income has decreased significantly,”read the documents. “In the 2 to 3 years prior to December 2023, I sold 27 pieces of art at an average price of $54,481.48, but since then I have only sold 1 piece of art for $36,000 … I was expecting to obtain paid speaking engagements and paid appearances, but that has not happened.”The good news is that Biden now has the opportunity to prove himselfGolly, I wonder why? Has the art market shifted, do you reckon? Or had his dad’s political power started to wane?To be clear, I am not here to mock the fact no one is buying Biden’s terrible paintings (or reading his self-indulgent memoir, sales of which have plummeted) now that his dad isn’t president. That would be mean. I am here to say: cheer up, mate. There is a silver lining to almost everything and the good news is that Biden now has the opportunity to prove himself. His father spent nearly 50 years in political office and Biden has spent his entire life dogged by accusations of nepotism. Now that his dad is irrelevant, Biden has a chance to see if he can make it based on his talents alone.No doubt every nepo baby out there is squirming with jealousy at Biden’s situation. With a handful of exceptions – includingMaya Hawke, who has acknowledged her head start in life – famous spawn seem to bang on about how unfair it is that people assume they have been handed opportunities. Certain female celebrities, such as Lily Allen, have also declared bizarrely that the labelnepo babyis sexist. This is truly delusional considering the fact that the nepo baby lament has become a gender-inclusive fixture of the news cycle: every couple of weeks, a new famous kid makes headlines for going:waaah waaah waaah, I’m terribly misunderstood.Recently, for example, Patrick Schwarzenegger, 31, was lamenting the fact that people were saying he got his role in the third season ofThe White Lotusbecause of his dad. (I don’t need to tell you who his dad is.) “They’re not seeing that I’ve had 10 years of acting classes, put on school plays every week, worked on my characters for hours on end or the hundreds of rejected auditions I’ve been on,”Schwarzenegger complained to the Sunday Times.Good job on all the school plays, my friend. However, the thing that Schwarzenegger isn’t seeing is that the reason people get so het up by nepo babies is that they are an obvious example of a greater rot in the system. Inequality has been rising for decades andsocial mobility has been declining. Even before Donald Trump made it clear that money was the only thing that mattered, it had become almost impossible for anyone “normal” to afford to break into a creative career. The system is rigged, and people are justifiably furious about it. I could go on and on, but they say a picture is worth a thousand words; maybe Biden can paint us a more poignant image of where things stand.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Rightly recognising how much is at stake politically, particularly with regard toyounger voters frustrated by high housing costs, ministers have made up their minds to help them. Decision-making will be streamlined and development corporations empowered. Once the law is changed, councils and landowners will find it harder to stand in the way of what ministers regard as progress.How this scheme pans out will be one of the big tests of Sir Keir Starmer’s government. It is right that compulsory land purchases will be made easier and cheaper, and steps taken to speed up clean energy projects.Reforms of the leasehold systemmust soon follow, to ensure that buyers of new homes are notripped off by freeholders.But the target of 1.5m new homes within five years is unlikely to be delivered. Even were it achievable, an expansion of housing on this scale might not suit property developers – whose interests are only partly aligned with those of their customers. While first-time buyers want prices to come down, sellers want to maximise profits. Aninvestigation by the Competition and Markets Authorityinto suspected anti-competitive conduct by housebuilders continues.Critics of Labour’s approach are also concerned about the build-to-rent sector. A report from the Common Wealth thinktank warned that a small number of private equity-backed businesses could end upin charge of a large chunkof any new housing. While private rentals will inevitably form part of the mix in new neighbourhoods, Angela Rayner’s department must ensure that councils and housing associations are able to offer decent numbers of desperately needed tenancies. The single most damaging effect of the UK’s perpetually overheated property market is the chronic shortage of homes for people on low incomes. Ms Rayner recently secured anadditional £350min funding for social homes. More will be needed.Once the framework is in place, much will depend on the plans that local areas come up with, and the decisions taken by development corporations. Ministers as well as mayors and councils should encourage them to be bold, drawing inspiration from other times and places. Builders must not be permitted endlessly to repeat the same unimaginative templates. Sir Keir and Ms Rayner should go on more visits, after their recent trip to a newDuchy of Cornwall projectin Cornwall.By emphasising green infrastructure, the bill portrays planning reform as an environmental cause as well as a social and economic one. But housebuilders have a poor record on deliveringnature-friendly features. And while increased support for renewables is welcome, there can be no denying the strain placed on net zero plans by carbon-intensive construction. The UK’s housing affordability crisis is the result of rightwing policy choices, above all the decision to cut back on publicly owned housing and a right-to-buy policy that ended up benefiting landlords. It must not become an excuse for an environmentally damaging property boom in which developers are the winners.Planning reforms do have the potential to boost social mobility and relieve overstressed households. But this will not happen naturally. Political skill and determination will be necessary to ensure that people, not profit, are at the heart of plans fornew towns– and that nature is protected as far as possible.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A petition was unsuccessfully filed to his country’s supreme court to stay his extradition, aslawyers challenged the ICC’s jurisdiction, and pleas were made for any trial to take place in a Philippine court.The relatives of those butchered during Mr Duterte’s brutal and lawless “war on drugs” will struggle to sympathise. Notoriously, many of its victims never got near a courtroom of any description. In 2016, months into a presidency in which thousands of Filipinos suffered summary executions, Mr Duterte readily acknowledged an indiscriminate dimension to the lawless carnage he had unleashed. The deaths of innocents and children,he told reporters, amounted to inevitable “collateral damage” in his mission to clean up the streets.Given a green light from the top,vigilante gangsand hired hitmen turned the poorer parts of Manila and his home city of Davao into killing zones. Corrupt police were allegedly financiallyincentivised to shoot suspectsrather than arrest them. Only a handful of officers were ever convicted of a crime. Testifying to the Philippine senate last October, the former presidentoffered “no apologies, no excuses”for this reign of terror, during which foreign criticism was dismissed with swaggering contempt and internal opponentsthreatened and imprisoned.The ICC was expressly established as a tribunal of last resort to deal with such catastrophic abuses of power, especially in cases where leaders appeared to enjoy domestic impunity. Enforcing its writ has been a slow, seldom straightforward and frequently unsuccessful process. Thearrest of Mr Duterteat Manila airport, on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity between 2016 and 2019, is therefore a moment of signal importance.For thousands of Filipino families, Mr Duterte’sextraditionto the Netherlands at last offers the possibility of accountability and a reckoning. The vast majority of the victims of the “war on drugs” were poor, urban males whose relatives lacked the resources to fight for justice on their behalf. Until recently, a political understanding with the current president, Ferdinand R Marcos Jr – and the election of Mr Duterte’s daughter, Sara, as vice‑president – appeared to have ensured his immunity from prosecution. It took a falling out between the country’s two most powerful clans to give the ICC judges their opportunity, and bereaved relatives their chance of closure.Mr Duterte’s savage brand of authoritarianism was popular among a majority of voters, and the evidence and testimony to be heard at The Hague may make for uncomfortable hearing. Still an influential political figure, until Tuesday the former president planned to run once again to become mayor in Davao.Instead he finds himself the central figure in proceedings which are a vindication of the patient, dogged persistence of ICC investigators. At a time when the notion of a rules-based world order is being treated withroutine disdainin Washington as well as Moscow, Mr Duterte’s arrest on Philippine soil sends a salutary warning to would-be strongmen around the world: investigations launched in The Hague carry a greater threat than mere reputational damage to rogue leaders.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I never thought I would find myself in full agreement with that woolly liberal Rowan Williams, but I do now (When politicians tell us to focus on growth we need to ask: ‘Why, and for whom?’, 8 March). As a green social democrat, I am appalled by the intellectual vacuity of our neoliberal growth orthodoxy, so enthusiastically pursued by Labour. We seem to be oblivious to how the neoliberal revolution since the 1970s has immiserated most of our population. It has led to inequality and soaring rates of poverty and illness; a largely non-unionised, exploited workforce; impoverished public services; knackered infrastructure and an environment in crisis.Instead of the trickle down of wealth created by rentier capitalism, to be taxed and invested in better infrastructure, public services and general wellbeing, we have had this wealth from growth sucked up into the top 1%. Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah (Opinion, 7 March) outlines how 38% of all turnover of non-financial businesses in Britain went through foreign companies, especially US businesses. He quotes Angus Hanton as rightly saying that we have become a “vassal” state, with our assets being destructively exploited by US economic predators. We need Labour to begin a counter-revolution, not further servility to this economic madness, by taking back into full public ownership our precious infrastructure, public services and strategic industries such as steel-making and green power generation and distribution.Furthermore, we need to demand that firms such as Amazon allow unionisation andpay taxes fully. After all, it has contributed to the hollowing out of once-thriving high streets. Turbo-boosted online consumerism has not created more public wellbeing, just abject dependency. Algorithm-driven lives have enslaved the under-40s, with no real upsides of personal and communal thriving or resilience.Philip WoodKidlington, OxfordshireThe government’s definition of what growth is for has been to fill the Treasury coffers to pay for public goods. And the measure of growth has been gross domestic product (GDP). With few exceptions, the media conspire to reinforce this measure of success. The most likely way of changing the government’s single-minded focus on GDP, and instead focus on Rowan Williams’ wishlist of cleaner skies, dependable public services and affordable housing – leading to a sense of belonging, dignity and stability – would be a recession.Only if GDP were to fall for a number of accounting periods would the government be persuaded to move the goalposts. If the new goals were those more closely related to individual, societal and environmental wellbeing, then economic recession could be regarded as a good thing.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, OxfordshireGrowth demands increased burning of fossil fuels and neocolonial extraction of minerals and natural resources. Our depleted planet can no longer cope. This is the root of the climate crisis, which is the biggest threat to humankind. We need to focus on reducing our use of the world’s scarce resources in excessive consumption in the global north, so that basic living standards and social wellbeing can be distributed more equitably. Rowan Williams talks of “stable, successful, confident and positive societies”. I would add cooperative and caring to that list. We are talking about transforming society.Sheila TriggsOrpington, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In what is a legitimate story on a crisis in the TV industry, the opening sentence of the article points out that senior TV executives are working as high street shelf‑stackers, car park attendants and in pubs. The clear implication, regardless of intention, is that the jobs taken are somehow “lesser”.Undoubtedly, the drop in wages for executives working in the creative industries is real and keenly felt, but the comparison drawn between the roles they previously held and the less‑well‑paid jobs they currently hold is a gross act of pretension.People including my own mother have made careers working in high street shops to feed their families. It is dignified and important work, and not long ago was considered a key worker job. Many of your readers also do similar work and don’t need to be made to feel inferior for the jobs they do compared with those who earned a lot more doing arguably less important work.Dr Richard LewisChief constable, Dyfed-Powys policeSenior TV producers are taking shelf-stacking jobs? Oh, the poor dears. I’m an engineering graduate with years of experience in research, and I’m working in retail and not whining about it. I recognise the frustration of not being able to get the job you would like, but when that job isn’t there, you do the jobs you can get. It’s not a scandal that people should have to do that. I’m disappointed to see the Guardian of all papers dismiss shelf-stacking as some sort of humiliation. Retail is honest, hard work.

The reaction of someone who knows that one of the biggest obstacles to PSG’s designs on a first Champions League title is out of the way.Liverpool suffered a role reversal in an epic last 16 second-leg tie at Anfield and their hopes of a seventh European crown are gone as a consequence. The home side were superior, profligate and lost 1-0, just as PSG didat Parc des Princes last week. The visiting goalkeeper again emerged the hero with Gianluigi Donnarumma, not Alisson, taking the acclaim after saving from Darwin Núñez and Curtis Jones in a penalty shootout. Ousmane Dembélé had levelled the tie on aggregate with an early goal but Liverpool had numerous chances to advance before the necessary spot-kicks.Slot sanguine after Liverpool exit in ‘best game of football I’ve ever been involved in’Read morePSG’s spot-kicks were flawless. Vitinha, brilliant all night, Gonçalo Ramos, Dembélé and finally Doué made no mistake at the Anfield Road end housing their own boisterous supporters. Mohamed Salah was the onlyLiverpoolplayer to convert in the shootout but his performance over 120 minutes was wasteful in the extreme. The penalty for failing to make home superiority count in the two legs was ultimately paid by Liverpool. Donnarumma, the man who broke English hearts in the 2020 European Championship final, proved the big man for the big penalty occasion once again.“Whoever wins tomorrow will go through to the final, I’ve no doubt,” Enrique had said on the eve of the tie. Hence the exuberance with which he greeted the outcome. The billing as a collision of the finest two teams in Europe was not an exaggeration. It was gripping, high-octane, high-calibre football from the start. Arne Slot claimed it was the best game of football he had been involved in. It will also rank among the most painful.The opening 12 minutes were the first leg in reverse. The dominator became the dominated as Liverpool started with an intensity and threat that was almost entirely absent at Parc des Princes. Alexis Mac Allister presented Salah with a glorious chance to open the scoring and double Liverpool’s aggregate lead with four minutes gone. Bursting onto Dominik Szoboszlai’s intelligent lay-off and into the box the midfielder squared to the better-placed forward rather than shooting himself. Salah seemed certain to score from close range but his shot struck Nuno Mendes and deflected over. Moments later Salah left the PSG left-back in a heap near the half-way line, surged into the area and curled wide. Such are the world class standards the Egypt international has set for himself, you expected him to score. The miscue, however, set the tone for his night.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé races away to celebrate PSG’s early goal at Anfield.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APThe contrast with the first leg not only extended to Liverpool’s performance. PSG, so assured and composed until running into Alisson last week, were rattled initially. Willian Pacho, Achraf Hakimi and Donnarumma all poured oil on a fiery atmosphere by playing routine passes straight into touch. And having failed to score from 27 attempts in the first leg, PSG promptly scored from their opening attempt of the second leg.Quick GuideChampions League: Inter power past FeyenoordShowMarcus Thuram (pictured) and Hakan Calhanoglu were on target as Inter defeated Feyenoord 2-1 in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie to advance comfortably into the quarter-finals with a 4-1 aggregate win.Inter, the Serie A leaders, will face the Bundesliga table toppers Bayern Munich, whodefeated Bayer Leverkusen 5-0 on aggregate, in the quarter-finals next month. The three-time winners Inter last lifted the trophy in 2010, beating Bayern in the final in a treble-winning season, and Inzaghi's side are still on course to repeat that feat, with a Coppa Italia semi-final also to come in April.Feyenoord came into the game with an uphill task after losing 2-0 at home last week, and by the eighth minute they were left with a mountain to climb following Thuram's superb solo goal. Thuram, who also opened the scoring at De Kuip in the first leg, collected the ball on the left wing before cutting inside with some clever footwork before curling a shot into the far top corner.Mehdi Taremi sent a shot straight at the keeper as Inter looked to put the tie even further out of reach but Feyenoord pulled one back three minutes before the break from the penalty spot.Calhanoglu was penalised for a foul on Jakub Moder who picked himself up and sent his spot kick into the bottom corner to beat Yann Sommer, just the second goal Inter have conceded in this season's competition, and the first at  San Siro.Any hope of a Feyenoord comeback all but ended when Calhanoglu made up for his mistake by converting his own penalty six minutes into the second half after Thomas Beelen fouled Taremi.With Feyenoord taking risks in an effort to get something from the game, Inter were always dangerous on the counter and looked like they had another penalty but after a VAR check, Thuram was booked for simulation instead.Thuram still received a standing ovation from the home crowd when replaced, having just struck a thunderous shot which bounced back off the underside of the crossbar, and Inter had little trouble seeing the game out.ReutersPhotograph: Marcel van Dorst/Rex FeaturesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Liverpool were badly exposed the first time the visitors broke their relentless press. Mendes played a low diagonal ball from left back that caught out the entire Liverpool midfield. Dembélé collected in space and released Bradley Barcola down the right, who attempted to return a cross to the in-form striker as he sprinted into the area. Ibrahima Konaté got there first but succeeded only in nudging Barcola’s delivery around Alisson and towards his own goal. Dembélé was left with a simple tap-in.Alisson made important saves from Barcola and Dembélé in the first half. The France international picked out Khvicha Kvaratskhelia unmarked inside the Liverpool area from the byline. The Georgia international’s blistering effort was destined for the top corner until a Ryan Gravenberch toe diverted it over. A Dembélé strike, curled from the edge of the box, was also deflected just wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Donnarumma produced a fine save to claw away Luis Díaz’s glancing header from a Mac Allister corner. Mendes blocked a goalbound drive from Szoboszlai and both Salah and Díaz failed to capitalise from a promising counterattack.Alexander-Arnold was forced out of the tie and probably Sunday’s Carabao Cup final when injuring himself in a challenge on Vitinha. His replacement, Jarell Quansah, twice came close to heading Liverpool into the quarter-finals. Quansah’s first attempt from another Mac Allister corner sailed just over. His second, from an Andy Robertson free-kick, beat Donnarumma but struck the inside of a post.Donnarumma was forced to take evasive action repeatedly as Liverpool exerted constant pressure in the closing stages of normal time. The PSG threat had been virtually non-existent in the second half but they were the more dangerous side in extra time. Doué, a potent replacement for Barcola, was centimetres away from a crucial second goal. Alisson saved brilliantly when Dembélé aimed for his bottom corner. PSG swarmed over Liverpool in the final stages but reserved their punishment until the shootout. As Enrique cavorted on the Anfield pitch, Slot was left to ponder what might have been.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolParis Saint-Germainmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Matrix structures are by definition amorphous, confusing, and create places for people to hide.Hmm. That does sound bad, Sir Jim. Talk me through it one more time, these frustrating corporate shields, these blame-avoidance tactics you’re so worried about. But first could you please just come out from behind the table. And stop doing that admittedly very good Donald Duck voice.Taking in the full text of this year’s annual SirJim Ratcliffelecture, conveyed on this occasion via newspapers, TV and a gruelling 40 minutes with Gary Neville, is a genuinely confusing exercise. Not just because Ratcliffe has once again come armed with a script, key lines, boilerplate defences, which he repeats with impressive accuracy but also subtle variations. But because almost everything he says, despite being delivered in a hammy, straight-talking gunslinger style, needs to be stared at with hawk-like focus just to work out what he’s actually saying.‘Eiffel Tower of the north’? Manchester United unveil 100,000-seat new stadium projectRead moreTwo obvious points leap out. The most obvious, one that should concern not only supporters ofManchester Unitedbut frankly everyone, given we are all now stakeholders in this regeneration project, is the extreme and visceral levels of BS involved.The phrase “BS” is used advisedly here. This is, like the quote above on matrix structures, another borrowing from the famedIneos corporate “Compass”. Both are listed under theWords we don’t likesection. Except it seems that sometimes we do like these things, given the sheer density of double-speak, evasion and vagueness contained in the latest Ratcliffe instalment. Compasses. John Donne was right. These are treacherous things.As ever there is something galling in the idea Ratcliffe should be given credit simply for answering questions and “fronting up” in this way. This is essentially his job. What is he anyway? A slash‑and-burn merchant, a cost‑cutter, a purchaser and repackager of distressed assets. This is how he reached this stage. As such he is a handy frontman for the Manchester United leisure project; and above all an investor with a very keen eye on his own stake.Spend money like it’s your own.So we get this now-familiar tableau, Ratcliffe sitting there looking like Guido Fawkes is in charge of a recruitment consultancy and wants to talk to you about opportunities in conference management, spouting things that are, at best, a little questionable.It is hard to say which was the most jaw-dropping moment. The implication that low-paid people whose perks include a plate of food are essentially freeloaders. Or the ability to list every element of financial peril, but not his fellow owners the Glazer family, who have created and overseen almost all of these problems.As ever it is hard to avoid marvelling at the Glazers’ efficiency, the incredible job they’ve done by bringing in the perfect front. Ratcliffe is ruthless enough to act as a kind of anti‑Rashford, here not to give you your lunch but to take it away, all the while presenting himself as the local boy, financial Gandalf, a picture of reassuring Ducal Englishness. Plus he’s prepared to say whatever it takes to gloss that cognitive dissonance. Maybe the problem with Sheikh Jassim, who may or may not have been a stock photograph, was that he was just too reasonable. Guys, I’m not saying all that. Sack who?View image in fullscreenThe Glazers remain the focus of fan discontent at Old TraffordPhotograph: Phil Noble/ReutersHiding. Wafflers. Wasting time.More from theWords we don’t likesection. Or do we? It is worth itemising the more obviously questionable statements. The top line in Ratcliffe’s address is the assertion the clubwould have gone bustby Christmas without his penny-saving exercise. No evidence was produced to support this. In reality Manchester United are not going bust if you don’t sack the tea lady. Forget the guaranteed income and the scale of the business. It’s also owned by one of the richest men in Britain, who keeps saying he’s a fan, but who now seems to be saying: I would not bail this club out and would instead watch it die. In the end this is basically a threat. Go bust or do it my way. Which one do you want?So it went on. Ratcliffe said the club’s true state of financial peril was hidden in a “forest of numbers”. Hang on. Here we have a famously shrewd tycoon who spent a billion pounds on his share, apparently without doing full due diligence because there were just too many numbers and it was “overwhelming”.Meanwhile everyone knows the numbers are terrible. This is a club that owes £300m in transfer fees and has paid a billion in debt repayments, where the only certainty in any dealing is you’re owed a lot, whose current defensive left side is literally Yoro-Dalot. Which option is more alarming here? Not actually knowing the numbers? Or pretending not to?We learned that the real problem is that the club lost “£254m” over three years due to inherited financial bungling. But since Ratcliffe began running the football side United have spent £200m on players who have made almost zero impression. Millions more have gone on fiddling about with managers. This is not a forest of numbers. It’s an orderly olive grove. Everyone can see it. What Ratcliffe is saying with these numbers is: the choices we have made mean the club would have gone bust. Losing money. Arrogance. Entitlement. You said it, Compass.The Compass also tells us politics and turf wars “erode efficiency”. But thedeparture of Dan Ashworthwas still about “chemistry”, a clash of personality that “I wasn’t prepared to live with”. As for blame culture, well, this is apparently fine when it comes tolisting players who are letting you down, those who are still being paid for, out on loan or not in the team. How is this supposed to help the dressing room or the sell-on process? Don’t do dumb shit. Also the Compass there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFinally, of course, there was the blame-avoidance stuff. Time and again Ratcliffe sought refuge in his own matrix structures. “It’s not just me. It’s Omar and Dave and lots of the other guys you don’t see.” Hmm. Those other guys, eh? A decision on a player “isn’t just for one person, it’s a group”. Who actually runs the club? “At the end of the day its the management team that operates Manchester United.” OK, OK. So who appointed Ruben? “All of us.”Usseems a key word in this context, as in: us and them and us and you. It isn’t hard to see what Ratcliffe’s real interests are. Essentially this boils down to two things. His investment in the club makes no sense without some idea of a return. At which point, enter the Old Trafford regional regeneration project. This was unveiled on Tuesday morning, complete with drawings of Norman Foster’s proposed new stadium, which looks like a Pac-Man ghost, or like someone threw a massive handkerchief over Dubai.Ratcliffe is of course a shield and enabler for the real owners, a far more palatable face for any regeneration money“We’re not going to ask the government for any money to build the ground,” Ratcliffe said, but this is also mild double-speak as the ground and its surrounds are inextricably linked. The transport, the infrastructure, the piazza twice as big as Trafalgar Square are all key to making the stadium profitable on the desired scale.So the stadium announcement is essentially a pitch for public money. “Manchester United has thrown its support behind the government’s growth agenda,” was a very funny, passive-aggressive way of putting this. Jobs, homes, growth and very large random sums of money are all promised. The regeneration is vital to the area. It will make a substantial difference to many people’s lives. But who is it going to enrich along the way? This is what Ineos does with its assets, with a public handout a very handy addition. This is of course the same billionaire who announced that “nobody ever gave me a free lunch”, while taking away someone else’s.Banter. This is also on the Compass.Plus Ratcliffe is of course a shield and enabler for the real owners, and a far more palatable face for any regeneration money. Gary Neville was pretty good at holding his feet to the fire over acting as “an umbrella” for the Glazers, who have taken £166m out in dividends, and who remain the chief cause and beneficiaries of all this cost-cutting.View image in fullscreenLike someone threw a massive handkerchief over Dubai: a design of the proposed new Old Trafford stadium.Photograph: ReutersThis brought forth from Ratcliffe a reel of nauseating excuses about being thousands of miles away and about the incompetence of previous placemen regimes. But then the job here for Ratcliffe is to keep the wheels turning, to offer a distracting plausibility at a club so bound up in its narrative of crises even the current unhappiness has become a kind of brand-fuel, something to be retailed. Wait. Do we have an official protest partner? And where are you getting those bulk black shirts?Meanwhile football is once again giving us a lesson in how the world works, the post-truth dynamic where money moves, power goes to work, and in the foreground people make noise and say distracting things.Mainly the feeling with Ratcliffe is a kind of sadness. Here we have perhaps the richest person in the country. This is our guy. This is England, all cost-cutting and double‑speak, too small to sustain its own parts, out there still selling off the family vinyl. Watching Ratcliffe trawl through this waffle is like realising dad doesn’t actually know what he’s doing. Or, even worse, that he’s not actually here to help.At least the Ineos Compass has a few more words of wisdom. Among the most recent high‑level departures announced at Old Trafford is the head of human resources. Let’s just get that straight. Ineos is now making the person who oversaw its redundancies redundant. Does this come under out‑of‑the‑box thinking?Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffeanalysisShareReuse this content"

But his proud, perfect record was gone in an instant a few seconds later, as the favourite clipped the top of the hurdle and tipped over.His exit left Brighterdaysahead as the hot favourite in running, but she was already being ridden by Jack Kennedy as State Man, the defending champion, loomed up on her outside around the home turn.State Man was clearly travelling much better than Brighterdaysahead and surged into an apparently decisive five-length lead on the run to the last, with Golden Ace moving into second. Just as it had for Constitution Hill, though, a clip of the hurdle was enough to send him crashing out, leaving Golden Ace – who was running in the Champion Hurdle only at the insistence of her owner, Ian Gosden – to pick up the spoils.Both Constitution Hill and State Man emerged from their falls unscathed, while Lorcan Williams, Golden Ace’s jockey, summed up the general mood as he waited to pick up his prize afterwards.“I’m shell-shocked,” Williams said. “Literally, I cannot believe it. She wasn’t travelling as well as I wanted in the latter part of the race, all I was thinking was that we could do with a bit further. Then I thought, ‘we’re staying on well for second’, and things started to happen.”Williams admitted he and Scott had been “pushing [to run Golden Ace in] the Mares’ Hurdle massively”, earlier on the card, before being overruled by Gosden. “Massive call,” he said. “I’m just glad he did it.”For Scott – a former dairy farmer and point-to-point trainer who sold off his herd to pursue a full-time career as a trainer – paid tribute to Camilla, his wife, and the rest of the team at his yard as he celebrated only the second festival success of his career, following Golden Ace’s defeat of Brighterdaysahead in the Mares’ Novice Hurdle last year.View image in fullscreenState Man falls at the final hurdle and hampers Brighterdaysahead as Golden Ace, second right, goes clear to win the Champion Hurdle.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I couldn’t even dream it,” Scott said. “Thump me, because I must be fast asleep at the moment. I think my team at home will be as flabbergasted as I am. Camilla does a lot of the work at home and she has the patience of a saint. She’s the genius, rather than me.“My owner and I were not at loggerheads, because ultimately he pays the bills [and] he was very keen to have a runner here today. We thought we could nick a little bit of prize money and we didn’t feel we could possibly beat Lossiemouth [in the Mares’ Hurdle] so it’s extraordinary how things work out.”Nicky Henderson, Constitution Hill’s trainer, reported afterwards that his eight-year-old was “very bright and breezy” after his fall. “He seems fine,” Henderson said.“He has been in terrific form [at home], but poor old State Man as well. You couldn’t believe those two silly old fools have gone and done what they have done today.“When you are jumping as fast as they jump you have got to get it deadly accurate. It is tough, and we have to live with it, as we know what we are playing with. You have to live with these things, but it is cruel as we waited two years to get back here.”All the focus was on four hot favourites for the Grade One races as the meeting opened here on Tuesday, and as it transpired only two managed to justify their short odds.Kopek Des Bordes drew a blood-curdling roar from the crowd as he came up the hill to win the opening Supreme Novice Hurdle, while Lossiemouth – as Scott had anticipated – took the Mares’ Hurdle for the second year running.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowHuntingdon:12.28 Early Morning Dew 12.58 Dark Mix 1.38 Not So Sobers 2.18 Imperial Jade 2.58 Greenways 3.38 Cloudy Wednesday 4.18 Naval Tribute.Cheltenham:1.20 Final Demand 2.00 Ballyburn 2.40 Beat The Bat (nap) 3.20 Stumptown (nb) 4.00 Jonbon 4.40 Unexpected Party 5.20 Bambino Fever.Wolverhampton:4.55 Rhythm N Hooves 5.30 Shamardia 6.00 Marhaba Ghaiyyath 6.30 Init Together 7.00 Kaaranah 7.30 Light Up Our Stars 8.00 Bungle Bay 8.30 Zooks.Newcastle:5.05 Show No Fear 5.45 Too Much 6.15 Dc Cogent 6.45 Wondrous Ways 7.15 Broken Spear 7.45 Henery Hawk 8.15 Tasever.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Majborough, however, the 1‑2 favourite, was only third in a thrilling four-way conclusion to the Arkle Trophy, as Henderson’s Jango Baie finished fast and late to grab the spoils from Only By Night, with L’Eau Du Sud, who had jumped the last in front, back in fourth.“It was a brilliant ride [by Nico de Boinville] as he had to sit and suffer,” Henderson said. “We thought we were going to make the running but he had no chance because he couldn’t go fast enough, simple as that. Luckily he flew the last and landed full of running, and suddenly the gap was going down. I didn’t know he could go that fast, I must admit.”Explore more on these topicsChampion HurdleCheltenham festival 2025Cheltenham festivalHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

It was 3-1 by then,4-1 on aggregate, and Bruno Lage’s team were flattered by the one. And, in fact, by the three. The shot count read 12-1.The hope now less that they could find a way back into it as that it might be over, and so it was. There was little need for more, Barcelona easing their way to the finish, managing the remaining 45 minutes.From the first minute, when Frenkie de Jong had driven at them, there was a sense of mission about Barcelona, the game taking shape then one of speed, open spaces, and skill. Especially when Lamine Yamal had the ball, which was often.View image in fullscreenRaphinha scores Barça’s third goal.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersNot that it was just him. Pedri, once so physically vulnerable, now seems invincible, a steel to go with the smoothness. Dani Olmo detected gaps no one else did, somehow always seeming to have room. From further back, Alex Balde repeatedly came bombing forward. Raphinha was, again, decisive.How Benfica must be sick of the man who took his total against them to five in three games here. Only Robert Lewandowski was not at his best. Twice he received near the penalty spot, the first provided by Lamine Yamal, the second by Olmo; both times he would have expected to score, neither time did he.The other two forwards did. Barcelona took the lead on 11 minutes and lost it again two minutes later but it didn’t matter. Lamine Yamal had made that first chance for Lewandowski, now he made the opener for Raphinha. Cutting one way then back again, twisting Florentino Luís’s hips, he seemed to be opening up his body to bend the ball towards the far corner but the shot, scuffed slightly, faded rightwards, accidentally turning into the perfect cross for Raphinha instead. The Brazilian volleyed in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The three-time winners Inter last lifted the trophy in 2010, beating Bayern in the final in a treble-winning season, and Inzaghi's side are still on course to repeat that feat, with a Coppa Italia semi-final also to come in April.Feyenoord came into the game with an uphill task after losing 2-0 at home last week, and by the eighth minute they were left with a mountain to climb following Thuram's superb solo goal. Thuram, who also opened the scoring at De Kuip in the first leg, collected the ball on the left wing before cutting inside with some clever footwork before curling a shot into the far top corner.Mehdi Taremi sent a shot straight at the keeper as Inter looked to put the tie even further out of reach but Feyenoord pulled one back three minutes before the break from the penalty spot.Calhanoglu was penalised for a foul on Jakub Moder who picked himself up and sent his spot kick into the bottom corner to beat Yann Sommer, just the second goal Inter have conceded in this season's competition, and the first at  San Siro.Any hope of a Feyenoord comeback all but ended when Calhanoglu made up for his mistake by converting his own penalty six minutes into the second half after Thomas Beelen fouled Taremi.With Feyenoord taking risks in an effort to get something from the game, Inter were always dangerous on the counter and looked like they had another penalty but after a VAR check, Thuram was booked for simulation instead.Thuram still received a standing ovation from the home crowd when replaced, having just struck a thunderous shot which bounced back off the underside of the crossbar, and Inter had little trouble seeing the game out.ReutersPhotograph: Marcel van Dorst/Rex FeaturesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They had barely finished celebrating whenNicolás Otamendiheaded in from Andreas Schjelderup’s corner at the other end, the ball reaching him off Lewandowski. So Barcelona just did it all over again, the chances still coming. As for Lamine Yamal, he didthat.The 17-year-old was by the corner flag when he started to move. There was a shift of the hips and he escaped Tomás Araújo, entering the penalty area at the side and exiting it at the top, literally cutting off the corner, space now to shoot. Only “shot” is not really the word for what he did next, even “kick” is not. Instead, he nudged the ball, little more than the flip of an ankle, yet enough to somehow send it 20 yards into the far corner. It curled and floated and drifted, entirely deliberately, travelling almost teasingly, as if it was waving on its way past Anatoliy Trubin: you can look but you can’t touch.View image in fullscreenRaphinha polishes the boot of Yamal after the 17-year-old’s goal.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersRaphinha came over and polished Lamine Yamal’s boot, then added the third when Balde burst up the middle of the pitch and rolled the ball into his path. The finish was hard, low and unstoppable, even for the linesman whose flag was raised and then overruled by the VAR, allowing him to stand atop the advertising boards, arms wide, the moment shared with this stadium.All that prevented Barcelona adding more was the fact that they did not need to, this was done. It was not that there were no chances in the second half – it began with Ronald Araújo heading into the side-netting and a flick from Lamine Yamal almost releasing Olmo – but the pace dropped, the urgency gone.Benfica tried, of course, Vangelis Pavlidis striking straight at Wojciech Szczesny and Iñigo Martínez diving in to block Samuel Dahl’s shot, the ball coming back off his elbow. There was a brief VAR check but no real belief that it would lead to anything, those few seconds a portrait of the second period.Other than Zeki Amdouni’s header being stopped on the line by Jules Koundé with five minutes left, mostly Benfica had played with little real faith of another goal. Not least because they were not truly allowed any. Barcelona’s control remained intact, this no longer feeling like a contest. Instead, it was a homage, just as they had hoped it would be, dedicated to the doctor.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBarcelonaBenficamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it has in the Champions League, too, given Bayern Munich are in the quarter-finals for a sixth successive year. If Inter are treated with the same brutality they inflicted uponBayer Leverkusen, whose brief spell as domestic kryptonite appears comprehensively over, they may move closer to lifting the trophy on home soil in May.This may not have been as sedate as the walking pace at which Harry Kane nudged the opener but, in truth, it was not far off. Bayern never looked like losing even a fraction of the three-goal leadamassed in the first legand could count once again on the England captain, whose presence on their scoresheet does not seem such a luxury any more.PSG beat Liverpool on penalties in Champions League last-16, second leg – live reactionRead moreSomething feels different this season and, in setting up Alphonso Davies for an emphatic second, he proved again that his efforts form part of a coherent whole nowadays. Vincent Kompany’s side are purring and any predictions that this tie would confirm a longer-term shift in the Bundesliga’s traditional power balance have been made to look absurd.Might Xabi Alonso come to wish he had quit while he was ahead? That may be a dramatic reading but Leverkusen, having performed spectacularly to overhaul Bayern last year, may find it harder to check their momentum again now. The sweet spot appears to have long gone, although it would be remiss to ignore the fact Leverkusen outplayed Bayern here in the league a month ago. They did not score that day either, though, and have an eight-point gap to bridge domestically. Over the past week the gulf has looked startlingly vast.This time Leverkusen could point to the absence of Florian Wirtz, whose next action in this competition will come wearing Bayern’s colours if his suitors have their way. The playmaker’s weekend injury meant that, to all intents and purposes, dreams of a comeback were over before they had taken hold. Leverkusen needed to show that the sum of their parts was bigger than the awesome talent watching from the stands, but Alonso always seemed hard pushed to devise a formula that could compensate.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane was able to walk his goal in against Bayer Leverkusen.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APInstead Kane could look towards a last-eight clash whose winners may be favoured to go the distance. “We showed what type of team we are,” he said, referring to their progress since grisly league phase results against Barcelona and Feyenoord. “We pressed high and with intensity. That’s what we wanted to come here and do. It’s never easy when you have a three-goal lead.”It remains to be seen whether that aphorism catches on. Perhaps Kane could sympathise with the importance Leverkusen ascribe to Wirtz: after all, Pep Guardiolaonce named an entire Spurs teamafter him. Here Bayern looked much more like a collective even though, as usual, he was poised at the sharp end. Within 15 minutes of the start he could have scored twice, Lukas Hradecky clawing away from near the line and beating away a meatier strike from distance. The openings never quite dried up despite Leverkusen’s hyperactivity.Quick GuideChampions League: Inter power past FeyenoordShowMarcus Thuram (pictured) and Hakan Calhanoglu were on target as Inter defeated Feyenoord 2-1 in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie to advance comfortably into the quarter-finals with a 4-1 aggregate win.Inter, the Serie A leaders, will face the Bundesliga table toppers Bayern Munich, whodefeated Bayer Leverkusen 5-0 on aggregate, in the quarter-finals next month.

Alonso had admitted that a dose of chaos, rather than the control he prefers, might be required but the effect was a jumpiness that wrought little. Passes pinged off knees and toes; footings were lost and bodies opened up prematurely. A formidable Bayern press, of the kind that had smothered them in Bavaria, abetted the confusion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At one stage Alonso gestured for his players to compose themselves; to dispense with the one-touch stuff and make the ball work. They mustered squalls of pressure but the only poise on display oozed from Bayern’s cream jerseys, who marauded regularly and came close again through Michael Olise and Kingsley Coman.At the break Alonso may have hung on to memories of Istanbul; of the heady, swirling, Technicolor night 20 years ago when he and Liverpool took victory from Milan’s clenched jaws. But soon enough Leverkusen needed four goals, not three. Kane’s 33rd of the season may have been his strangest, a straight Joshua Kimmich free-kick evading Schick and Kim Min-jae with Hradecky rooted. Kane could control and stroll it home; so much for fretting about the outcome.Leverkusen flickered, Jonas Urbig saving from Jeremie Frimpong and Schick. But Bayern were long gone, Kane helping the ball on at the end of a slick right-sided move for Davies to sidefoot crisply on the bounce. There was plenty of time for Kane to miss when through and Jamal Musiala to strike the woodwork twice, but the statement had long since been made.“I think the boys showed again today how hungry they are for what they want to achieve,” a clearly satisfied Vincent Kompany said. “We’ve won now, and I don’t want to get too carried away.” If the most dangerous foe is the one you know best, then others may be tempted to do that.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichBayer Leverkusenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However, Woods all but ruled that out with a surprising social media post on Tuesday.“As I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured,” Woods wrote on X. “This morning, Dr Charlton Stucken of Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida performed a minimally invasive achilles tendon repair for a ruptured tendon.“I am back home now and plan to focus on my recovery and rehab, thank you for all the support.” Woods added that Stucken had said “the surgery went smoothly and we expect a full recovery”.Woods has been beset by injury problems in recent times but also tore his right achilles in 2008. Knee and back problems were subsequently encountered by the most successful golfer of his generation. Woods partnered his son, Charlie, in the PNC Championship last December and has been a regular participant in the tech-infused golf league he launched with Rory McIlroy.“My heart is really not into practising right now,” Woods said in March. “Once I start probably feeling a little bit better and start getting into it, I’ll start looking at the schedule.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lock Ollie Chessum has not forgotten some of the abuse directed at England’s ­players by Welsh fans two years ago and he suggests it will “rev up” the visitors for the game at the Principality Stadium on Saturday.Chessum, who was named player of the match after his side’sseven‑try win against Italyon ­Sunday, says ­England are determined to finish their campaign on a high note and are fully prepared for the “special” reception they receive before Six Nations games in Cardiff, most recently in 2023.The Breakdown | France buy-in to monster pack blueprint threatens reimagined futureRead more“We were there for two days prior to the game and everywhere the bus goes abuse seems to follow,” said ­Chessum, who is now back fit and firing after an injury-hit year.“On the day of the game that last half-mile stretch [to the stadium] is just packed with fans. There are a few English dotted around and you can hear them but the abuse from the Welsh fans is something that will live long in the memory. Everywhere else is out in the sticks [but] the Princi­pality [Stadium] is slap bang in the mixer and they all want to bite at you.“One that sticks out – it wasn’t even game day – was the day before. We’re driving through, we pull up at a roundabout and a car pulls up next to us. Mum and grandma are in the front seat and there’s a kid who can’t have been more than five. His grandma winds down the back window, and the kid just gives us the middle finger.“It’s things like that – and the rivalry – that make this fixture so special. I enjoy it. It does rev you up a little bit. For me it is probably the best away day as a player that you can have. And with the nature of the fixture, being in the final round, we are champing at the bit to get down there.”England are particularly keen to build on the momentum of three consecutive home wins – against France, Scotland and Italy – regardless of the outcome of France’s home game against Scotland later the same ­evening. “They would love ­nothing more than to put a stop to our title hopes and beat us in Cardiff,” ­Chessum said. “So, first of all, we’ve got a mammoth task on our hands to go down there and win.View image in fullscreenOllie Chessum was England’s player of the match against Italy.Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters“The nature of rugby is that one game can change everything. ­Beating us, I imagine, rights the wrongs of the last 15 or 16 games for them. Us not winning at the weekend would do the complete opposite for us. The mag­nitude of this game can’t be overlooked and that’s why, from our perspective, we’re not looking past 4.45pm on Saturday in Cardiff.”England are set to bring forward their team announcement by 24 hours and have been weighing up the best way to replace the injured Ollie Lawrence, who nowfaces ­missing the rest of the season. Retaining Elliot Daly at 13 would be the simplest ­solution with Chessum adamant that England want to attack Wales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can’t predict the score and we don’t know what’s going to happen but I do know that we’re going to bring bags of intent to go out there and put points on them.”A group of MPs, meanwhile, have made renewed calls for an indepen­dent review into the Rugby Football Union’s stewardship of English rugby after the financial collapse of several top clubs andcontroversy over executive payand bonuses. “It is incredibly important that the government step in and start looking at the governance of the game otherwise there will not be a game to govern,” said Edward Morello, MP for West Dorset.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Six NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

A search for a missing crew member was called off overnight.As investigations stepped up, Downing Street said no evidence of foul play had been found. The owner of the Solong, the German maritime firm Ernst Russ, said the vessel was not carrying any containers “ladened with sodium cyanide”, contrary to reports.HM Coastguard said the Solong had separated from the Stena Immaculate, which was carrying jet fuel for the US military, at 11.20pm on Monday – about 13 hours after the collision – and had begun to drift southwards. A spokesperson said it was monitoring the development and that a 1km exclusion zone was in place.View image in fullscreenSmoke billowing from a vessel in flames.Photograph: Bartek Śmiałek/APEnvironmental experts warned that the jet fuel leaking from the 183-metre-long Stena Immaculate was toxic for humans and wildlife.Dr Simon Boxall, an academic in oceanography at the University of Southampton, said the Jet A-1 fuel had a “much higher toxicity” than crude oil and that “the impact of that on life in the oceans would be devastating”.The ships collided close near a known breeding ground for harbour porpoises as well as a number of other marine and wildlife protected areas, which could now be under threat from any contaminants leaking from the wrecks, environmental NGOs warned.Map showing location of collision off Yorkshire coastJust west of the collision site is the Humber estuary and the Wash, one of the UK’s most important ecosystems which is home to hundreds of thousands of seabirds, said Sandy Luk, the chief executive of the Marine Conservation Society.“Thousands of seals and their pups call this stretch of coast home at this time of year, and there are protected areas nearby for harbour porpoises and special marine habitats,” she added.“Our biggest concern to the environment right now is the degree to which these chemicals accumulate or disperse, both into the water column and the distance they travel. This all depends on the weather, the currents and the extent of the spill.”Dr Paul Johnston, a senior scientist at the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at Exeter University, said: “The jet fuel that entered the water close to a breeding ground for harbour porpoises is toxic to fish and other sea creatures”View image in fullscreenA screengrab from a video showing damaged parts of the Stena Immaculate.Photograph: Sky/APA US sailor onboard the Stena Immaculate told CBS News that the Solong “came out of the blue”, giving those onboard “only seconds to react”.The crew member described how flames were lapping at the sailors as they evacuated the burning vessel, leaving some with singed hair.The whole incident from impact to evacuation lasted about 30 minutes, they said.The crew member said the Stena Immaculate had anchored at that spot and relayed its coordinates on Sunday, meaning all other vessels should have known where it was.Dr Seyedvahid Vakili, a maritime expert at the University of Southampton, said it was difficult to determine the main cause of the collision but that in most cases “human factors play a significant role”.“This is particularly relevant for container vessels where high workloads and fatigue can be major contributing factors. At this stage it needs further comprehensive investigation,” he said.Matthew Pennycook, a government minister, said coastguard aircraft were monitoring the site of the incident. He said: “We are working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to assess the impact on water pollution. The fire is obviously still raging.”He added: “The Maritime and Coastguard Agency are well equipped to contain and disperse any oil spills. We don’t think air quality impacts are outside of normal levels, but we will keep the situation under review.”According to Crowley, the shipping company that manages the MV Stena Immaculate, the vessel was holding 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks.Explore more on these topicsNorth of EnglandShipping industryYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, in part at the behest of Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, hundreds of US Fish andWildlifestaff have been laid off, and hiring freezes implemented on hundreds more seasonal workers whom advocates say are critical to ensuring some species’ survival.Trump purge raises extinction threat for endangered species, fired workers warnRead moreIn theUS House,Republicansrecently held a hearing on the ESA and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, claiming the legislation needs to be revised to allow industry projects to be approved more quickly.Wildlife advocates are girding for a fight in which species’ existence hangs in the balance.“Scientists warn that we’re in an extinction crisis, and we ignore that at our own peril,” said Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “As America’s wildlife dwindles,Elon Muskis swinging his wrecking ball at the skilled and dedicated people fighting to save our plants and animals from extinction. It’s beyond idiotic.”Congress passed the ESA in 1973, and it has saved bald eagles, grizzly bears and American alligators from extinction, among other species. Some environmentalists say it’s among the nation’s strongest environmental laws because it’s explicit, and sets clear deadlines for federal agencies to act to protect species. The law also requires most federal initiatives to ensure the action or project doesn’t threaten protected species.Nearly 99% of species listed as endangered under the law have survived, Greenwald said, and the law rarely derails energy or development projects.Still, the ESA’s robust provisions “drive industry bananas” and the law has long been a GOP target, said Drew Caputo, an attorney with the Earthjustice non-profit who has litigated on issues involving endangered species.“Industry cannot stand that their ability to profit is sometimes limited by the need to protect wildlife that has been on earth for millions of years,” Caputo said. GOP and industry attacks, including bills that attempted repeals and revisions in recent years, have “failed spectacularly”, he added.But the “God squad” could present the biggest threat so far.“It can behave as god and decide what species exist and which don’t,” Caputo said.The squad, officially called the Endangered Species Committee, includes seven federal agency leaders, who, in the rare instances in which a federal action of significant public or economic interest comes into irresolvable conflict with the ESA, each vote on whether the project’s benefits outweigh the protected species’ wellbeing. If five of the seven votes are in favor of a project proceeding, it moves forward, which could drive species to extinction.The “God squad” has only been convened three times, and the only project on which it overrode the ESA was a dam, but the plans included meaningful provisions that helped at-risk cranes survive.However, Trump seems to be proceeding without regard to the law’s protocols, and ordering action outside the squad’s scope, advocates say. In one executive order, he directed the squad to meet quarterly instead of after the petitioning process had played out, as the law requires. When there are no projects to consider, the squad should “identify obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure” related to the ESA, another order states.“He can’t just say: ‘I hereby undo the Endangered Species Act,’” Greenwald said. “There are really specific processes for how that works.”The president may use the squad to divert water from northern to southern California at the expense of endangered salmon, Caputo said.Meanwhile, Doge’s cuts to the federal workforce, and Trump funding freezes, are already directly affecting staffing and the solvency of projects to preserve red wolves in North Carolina, ‘akikiki birds in Hawaii, and black-footed ferrets. Greenwald said staff at the fish and wildlife service have learned that the initial cuts that affected hundreds of jobs are just the beginning, and that Trump is planning to cut 40% of the staff.“What Doge is doing will result in species going extinct,” Greenwald said.On Thursday, the GOP representatives on the US House Committee on Natural Resources attempted to chart a new course of attack in which they claimed that the US supreme court’s June reversal of the Chevron doctrine that stripped power from regulators also required the ESA to be reformed and made clearer.“There is no denying that, after half a century, both laws need improvement, and the committee intends to do just that,” Harriet Hageman, the committee chair and Wyoming US representative, said. “Changes to the statutes will significantly improve the regulatory process.”A ‘recipe for extinction’: can the US’s envied nature protections survive Trump and his ‘God squad’?Read moreBut Caputo called the rightwing Chevron claim “legal nonsense”. He said the GOP is specifically targeting the ESA’s deadlines for federal agencies to act to protect species, as well as a provision that only allows science and the species’ survival to guide decisions.Republicansalso want economic impact on industry to be factored in to the equation, Caputo said.There’s a chance some reforms could get through with Democratic support. Congress last year passed two out of eight bills that would have weakened the law, but Joe Biden vetoed them.But the act remains popular among the nation’s public, and that could pressure lawmakers, Caputo said.“The industry agenda is unpopular, but the right still keeps trying,” Caputo said. “The harsh reality is that extinction means forever. People understand that.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationEndangered speciesWildlifeElon MuskAnimalsConservationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those are designed to break down into even smaller pieces of plastic once spread in fields.The tiny bits of plastic can end up in water and soil at alarming levels, the paper’s lead author said, and the substance is likely taken up by crops. Until now, controlled-release fertilizers have been thought to be safe, said Maryam Salehi, a lead author and researcher with the University of Missouri.Microplastics hinder plant photosynthesis, study finds, threatening millions with starvationRead more“We need to inform farmers,” Salehi said. “When they choose their products, they need to know that these have some potential risks.Microplastics are tiny bits ofplasticeither intentionally added to consumer goods, or which are products of larger plastics breaking down. The particles contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals, of which thousands, such as BPA, phthalates and Pfas,present serious health risks.The substance has been found throughout the human body, and is linked to an increased risk of heart attack andcancer. It’s also considered to be a neurotoxicant that can cause multiple forms of brain dysfunction, such as Parkinson’s disease.Salehi said it is unclear which other chemicals are in the fertilizer plastic.Testing has found microplastics in a wide range of foods,including produce.Some of the controlled-release fertilizer pieces are less than five millimeters in size, which makes them microplastics by definition. But once they are in the soil, they “break down into tiny, tiny particles” when a tractor runs over them, or someone walks on ground where they’ve been spread, Salehi said.That is worrying because smaller bits can more easily move through the environment than larger pieces of plastic, Salehi said. The study found most of the microplastics stayed in the soil, but some were washed into nearby water sources by rain or irrigation processes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There are many types of controlled-release fertilizers, including those that are encapsulated with biodegradable materials, Salehi said.

It comes as the English and Welsh governments announced £1m in funding to investigate the devastating pollution of the River Wye, where about 23m chickens are being produced in the river catchment at any one time.The health of the river, which flows for 155 miles from mid-Wales to the Severn estuary in England, has been downgraded by Natural England from “unfavourable-improving” to “unfavourable-declining”, meaning its condition is poor and worsening. Its decline has been linked to intensive chicken farming in the catchment from the spreading of poultry manure, which contains high levels of phosphate, on to fields, which then leaches into the river.Studies have shown 70% of the phosphate in the River Wye catchment comes from agriculture, although not all is chicken-related.One studyrecommended an 80% reduction in poultry manure in the Wye catchment to protect the river and called for a cut in the overall number of birds and for the exporting of manure out of the area.The high court judgment defining chicken manure as industrial waste came after the National Farmers’ Union challenged waste rules set by Herefordshire council.The NFU said poultry manure should be treated as an agricultural byproduct, not as waste under the waste framework directive.But Mrs Justice Lieven in her ruling said it cannot be assumed that manure will be used in an environmentally safe way. Given the environmental problems caused by chicken manure in the Wye catchment area, she rejected the NFU challenge and said poultry manure amounted to “waste” in law up to the point it was sold or transferred to a third party.The ruling means that new chicken units in Herefordshire will have to provide a detailed plan at the planning application stage to ensure chicken manure can be disposed of safely, including full transparency on the manure’s destination and application.The campaign group River Action, which intervened in the case, said the ruling was a landmark decision that had implications for all new industrial chicken units.Charles Watson, the chair of River Action, said: “We believe the ruling clarifies once and for all that the intensive factory production of livestock is clearly an industrial manufacturing process, whereby the often-toxic waste that it produces must be treated as such.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The judgment should also now mean that proper environmental controls are put in place across the country to oversee the production and handling of manure from animals on farms.”Rachel Hallos, the NFU vice-president, said: “We are extremely disappointed by the high court’s ruling and are currently reviewing the judgment carefully to examine its potential implications for our members in Herefordshire. The NFU is considering whether to seek permission to appeal [against] today’s ruling.“Britain’s farmers recognise their businesses have a major role to play, alongside producing food, in improving water quality. Much progress has already been made through regulation and voluntary measures such as carefully managing how much manure and fertiliser is applied to fields.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingPollutionAnimalsHerefordshirenewsShareReuse this content"

More than 1 million people are likely to be affected.Across the city there have been reports of overflowing bins and bags of rubbish piled high in the streets, with rat infestations increasing as a result.Craig Cooper, the strategic director of city operations at the council, told BBC Radio WM that the authority was “looking for this to stop as quickly as possible but the trade unions don’t seem to want to negotiate”.“I feel that they are holding us and our residents hostage,” he said. “I understand the frustration of residents and we recognise we need to create a modern, sustainable and reliable service.” He added that the service had “not acted effectively for a very long time”.View image in fullscreenThe picket line at Birmingham city council’s Atlas depot in Tyseley on Tuesday.Photograph: Matthew Cooper/PAZoe Mayou, from the unionUnite, said it wanted “to meet with Birmingham city council and have productive talks”.“They know what we want. They are the ones holding the city to ransom – certainly not us,” she said.Police were called in on Tuesday morning to allow agency bin workers drafted in by the council to leave the depot. Cooper said 90 crews, compared with the usual 200, went out on collection rounds.Mayou said the number of police officers brought in was “overkill”. “We’re doing a legitimate picket line and the amount of police here is just unbelievable, I just don’t understand why there are so many here,” she said.Residents have been urged to leave rubbish out as normal, although they have been warned it may take longer for it to be collected.Unite said the industrial action had been stepped up, and could last into the summer because of the council’s use of temporary labour to replace striking crews.“The disgraceful use of unlawful labour to try and break the strike has just resulted in industrial action escalating. The only way this dispute will end is by halting the brutal and unnecessary attacks on our members’ pay,” said the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham.The action was triggered by the council’s decision to remove the role of waste recycling and collection officer, responsible for safety at the back of a refuse collection lorry, from its fleets.The union claims this is a “safety-critical role” and will lead to affected workers losing £8,000 in their salary, as well as cutting off a “fair path for pay progression”.The council disputes this. Cooper said the role was “not critical to health and safety” as all workers shared responsibility for this. He added that the role was not available nationally.The council said 170 staff members were affected by the move, and about 130 of these had accepted roles in other parts of the council on the same pay grade, while others have opted to train for more advanced roles. It claimed 17 staff members could lose the maximum amount from their salary, and that this was £6,000, not £8,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s based on fair and balanced, reciprocal trade and we’re engaging closely with the US administration to make the case for the UK to be exempt from proposed tariffs.“And, more broadly, we’ve been very clear that when it comes to the UK steel industry we remain prepared to defend the UK’s national interest where it’s right to do so. But we will continue to take a cool-headed approach to any speculation around tariffs.”He added: “We’ve got a £2.5bn commitment to invest to rebuild the UK steel industry and support communities now and for generations to come.”When Starmer visited the White House in February, Trump suggested a “real trade deal” between the US and the UK could mean tariffs were not necessary..Jonathan Reynolds, the trade and business secretary, also made the case for a UK exemption from the tariffs to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, in a phone call on Sunday. Unlike other countries, the UK does not have a big trade surplus with the US.According to government figures, 5% of Britain’s steel exports and 6% of aluminium exports by volume go to the US.Political leaders and industry bodies have warned the tariffs risk damaging the UK and global market. Gareth Stace, the director general of the industry group UK Steel, has described them as a “sledgehammer to free trade, with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world”.Japan and the EU have also made last-minute pleas for a U-turn, and Brussels has made clear it is ready to hit back with retaliatory measures. The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, said he spoke to Trump’s trade team when he visited Washington last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the end, one hand cannot clap,” Šefčovič told reporters in Brussels on Monday.Japan’s trade minister, Yoji Muto, headed to Washington this week for last-ditch negotiations on a range of Japanese exports including cars, steel and aluminium, but failed to win an exemption for his country, a key US ally.UK Steel has criticised the tariffs for primarily targeting US allies, such as the UK, as most other countries were already subject to 25% steel tariffs, while aluminium levies were previously 10%.The presidential executive order announcing the tariffs cited rising global excess capacity, forecast to hit 630m tonnes in 2026, and concerns over cheap steel shipments from China. The proclamation claimed that steel imports from Australia, the EU, Japan and the UK had risen from 18.6% in 2020 to 20.7% last year, proving that quotas had been ineffective.However, UK Steel pointed out that demand in 2020 was at a historical low because of the pandemic, and UK steel exports to the US last year were 14% lower than in 2018 when tariffs were first introduced.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryTrump tariffsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerInternational tradeEconomicsTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

Last yearonly 224 farmersin England received payments under SFI.The National Farmers’ Union said the news was disastrous and would badly affect farmers’ trust in the government.Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president, said: “What we have now is the haves and the have nots.“A large chunk of the industry cannot access any money until next year.“They’ve just hit the reset button again today and it’s disastrous. Farmers now have a lack of trust in the department and in the government and we don’t know how we are going to move on from here.”Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents rural business owners including farmers, said: “Of all the betrayals so far, this is the most cruel. It actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief.”Asked about the angry reaction, Zeichner said: “I understand there will be people will be disappointed, and that’s why we’ll be coming forward after spending review with a revised scheme which people can apply for.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

NHS England has also set up a helpline.The mistake occurred when the GP registration process of the patients was “not completed correctly, meaning their details were not passed to NHS screening system”, Dalton said.“Records indicate that up to 10 patients have been diagnosed with a relevant cancer and were not invited for certain screening,” she added.“The impact on these patients is not yet known and a clinical harm assessment process will be undertaken, based on expert clinical advice.“It is with deep sadness that I must report that records also indicate that around 10 people who were not invited for screening may have died from a relevant cancer.”The Guardian understands NHS England was first warned about the issue last summer when people contacted the health service to say they had not been invited for screening.NHS England commissioned an investigation but only identified an issue within GP registration in late December.“Since then, work has been undertaken to identify the individuals affected,” Dalton said. “Where relevant, work is ongoing to assess any clinical implications of their delayed screening.”The blunder was related to when patients register at a new GP practice.GP registrations returned to some practices by Primary Care Support England for further information or review had not been completed, or the GP practice had not sent a message to complete the patient’s registration.Incomplete registrations were not passed to the NHS screening programme IT systems and, therefore, some people were not been invited to their routine screening, the Guardian understands.Processes have now been put in place to ensure that new GP registrations will be closely monitored and updated on systems as necessary, health officials said.Steve Russell, NHS England’s director for vaccinations and screening, said the NHS was contacting 5,261 people who had not been invited for screening.“This issue has now been fixed and everyone affected will be offered support and any catch-up screening as soon as possible, including where they may now be above screening age.“We would like to extend our sincere apologies to those affected for this error and any additional worry this may have caused – anyone who is concerned they may have missed an invitation to screening can call our dedicated helpline for support and further information.“Around 15 million people are invited to NHS screening every year and it is important that everyone eligible can access these life-saving programmes.“The NHS has issued guidance to GP practices and integrated care boards to ensure all patient registrations are fully completed and has put in place new measures to make sure all eligible people are invited for screening.”Dr Ian Walker,CancerResearch UK’s executive director of policy, said: “Bowel, breast and cervical screening programmes are in place to help diagnose cancer early or prevent it developing in people without symptoms, and everyone who’s eligible should be invited to take part.“It’s unacceptable that some people haven’t received an invitation, and we welcome NHS England’s announcement that there will be a full review to understand how this happened.“This news will be extremely worrying for anyone who’s eligible to take part in screening so, if you think you are eligible but haven’t been invited, you can check with your GP.”Explore more on these topicsNHSCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Dollimore called on Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, not to accept any more donations from Chernukhin unless the grant were returned.Chernukhin, a businesswoman who has given more than £2m to theConservativessince 2014 and is married to a former Russian finance minister, co-founded the Owens entertainment centre in the East Sussex seaside town in October 2022.View image in fullscreenOwens closed in September 2023.Photograph: Helena DollimoreThe centre received £150,000 from Boris Johnson’s town deal funds after a tender process. At its launch, Chernukhin claimed the venture would help rejuvenate the town by bringing more than 45 jobs and lots of visitors to Hastings. It included several restaurants, a bowling alley, immersive experiences, virtual reality rides, an oddity museum and amusement arcade.Despite this and her £4m investment, the centre abruptly shut its doors in September 2023.Dollimore told the Commons on Monday that Hastings council was trying to recover the £150,000 grant given to Chernukhin’s venture but that it had not so far been successful, and the company behind it was now in administration.“The reason I am here speaking about this is that Owens has come to symbolise for our community much more than a mere eyesore,” she said.“Did Ms Chernukhin, a millionaire owner, really need a top-up from the taxpayer to fund such a venture? Was that truly the best use of the money given to Hastings to improve our town? None of that makes any sense to my constituents.“Owens closed shortly after opening, and the deserted, boarded-up building now dominates our town centre in Hastings. The staff were laid off with no notice, and many people who supplied the business and helped with the building work have said that they have not been paid for their work. The closure of Owens, which is now covered in wooden boarding, leaves a stain on our community.”Dollimore said that in the time the project had been closed, Chernukhin had donated more than £150,000 to the Conservatives.She added: “Ms Chernukhin should donate the money she received from the taxpayer back to the people of Hastings. Used well, it could go a very long way to fixing our broken paving stones and bus shelters. Lubov Chernukhin, we want our money back. Until that money is repaid in full to our community, the Conservative party should not take a penny in donations from her.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They do not have to vote, speak or do any work beyond entering the building in order to be able to claim this money. They can also claim back money for certain travel expenses.Fifteen peers claimed a total of £585,985 in allowances and expenses during the last parliament despite not speaking or doing other committee work. Only three of the 15 sent a written question to the government over the period. All but one voted during the parliament, on average taking part in a third of voting days.The figures cover the 2019 parliament, which sat until the summer of last year, and exclude peers who had been appointed for fewer than 50 sitting days by the end of the parliament.Just 10% of lords made more than half of all debate contributions. Removing the quietest half of peers would have had little impact on the numbers contributing to debates but would have reduced the allowances and expenses bill by 28%, the analysis suggests.Khalid Hameed, a former private wealth company chief executive who became a peer in 2007,appears to have done nothing at all beyond turning up. He did not speak, send a written question, sit on a committee, hold a government post or vote in the house between the 2019 and 2024 elections, while claiming £27,628 in allowances for turning up 98 times.View image in fullscreenSwraj Paul in 2015.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianThe non-affiliated peer Swraj Paul claimed £100,946 in allowances over the same period. He did not speak, write or hold a committee or government post, and voted only once. The 93-year-old business magnate is the seventh-oldest peer (the oldest, Tony Christopher, turns 100 in April).Among the other less heard from peers was Elizabeth Smith, Lady Smith of Gilmorehill, whostepped down from the chamberin February. The widow of the former Labour leader John Smith took part in 38% of votes in the last parliament, but had not spoken in the Lords since 1999. She had submitted five written questions since the 2019 general election, most recently in 2020, and claimed £31,224.90 in allowances and travel.Llin Golding claimed the most in allowances and travel of the 15 peers over the period: £129,143. Like Smith, she voted relatively often (on 81% of voting days), but did not contribute to any debates.A further 31 peers also never said a word or held a committee or government post but did not claim an allowance over the period.The Electoral Reform Society has described those who vote but do not otherwise participate as “lobby fodder lords” who are used to help push a party’s agenda through parliament but otherwise contribute very little.A 2017 report by the campaign group said many peers simply turned up to claim their allowance and vote, without taking part in the essential scrutiny of government.Jess Garland, the society’s director of policy and research, described the upper chamber as “ludicrously bloated”. She said: “Despite many peers working hard, the vast size of the House of Lords means it lacks accountability and too many peers get away with not contributing.Elizabeth Smith.Photograph: David Cheskin/PA“Those who sit in parliament shaping our laws should be chosen by, and accountable to, the British people who live under those laws. That way, all peers will be accountable for fulfilling their roles, not just those who choose to play an active role.”Peers can claim a formal leave of absence if they are unable to contribute. The process, which has no fixed rules, is designed to help those with medical or family issues, or who are taking up diplomatic or other roles. None of the peers claiming allowances were on leave of absence.Many peers – including Lord Hameed and Lord Paul – hardly ever voted. They were among 49 peers (excluding bishops, the speaker and the lord chamberlain, who either do not vote or have irregular voting patterns as a rule) who voted fewer than 10 times. Twenty-three peers did not vote once between 2019 and 2024.A Lords spokesperson said: “Members contribute to parliamentary work in a variety of ways which are by no means limited to considering amendments to legislation. Not all parliamentary work leaves a record in Hansard. Members of the Lords are not paid a salary and can only claim attendance allowance for days they attend the House and undertake parliamentary work.”High-cost hereditariesLabour has set out plans toremove the remaining 92 hereditary peersfrom the chamber. Since 2019, hereditary peers have claimed more in allowances and expenses on average than non-hereditary peers (£95,800 per hereditary peer, compared with £92,300 for non-hereditaries).Hereditary peers also spoke less often (155 times on average, compared with 191 for other peers) and were less likely to pose written questions to the government (18 letters on average, compared with 45 for other peers).The Conservative peer Lord Crathorne was the most expensive hereditary member of the Lords when compared with his debate contributions, speaking just once while claiming £118,162 in allowances. He wrote 12 questions to the government over the period.Crathorne, 85, said he was still a committed member of the Lords, actively engaging in debates, late-night sessions and votes. He also pointed to his involvement in several all-party parliamentary groups and his extra-parliamentary work with charities as evidence of his public service.“I would make the point that while speaking is an important part of our parliamentary democracy, so too are listening, participating and voting,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateLords reformnewsShareReuse this content"

The inability to support artists in politically charged moments is, in itself, a form of silencing.”They added that the events at the Royal Exchange were part of a “wider pattern of institutions failing to stand firm in the face of political and ethical discomfort”.The criticism from SDUK follows similar statements from the arts union Equity, which said the review “fell short” of addressing issues and should have been accompanied by a full apology.Astatement from the unionread: “We are disappointed that the review appears to fall short of addressing some of these issues, and that it does not include a public apology to the workforce for the failings of leadership. The review seemingly does not include a clear statement confirming that no culpability for the cancellation sits with the theatre workers engaged to create and work on the show, and this is a significant misstep.”The fallout from the review has been swift. The Royal Exchange’s CEO, Stephen Freeman, resigned in the aftermath, citing “personal reasons linked to the impact of the last few months”, adding he was “comforted that the report has concluded that censorship was not at play”.But the organisation is under pressure to go further as critics argue the handling of the cancellation and review has damaged trust betweenthe theatre and its audience.The issue dates back to September last year when the play, a modern retelling of the Shakespeare classic set in contemporary Manchester, was abruptly put on pause.The first few performances of the play were pulled, with ticket holders told that the shows had been axed due to “technical issues” and cast injury.However, the entire run was later cancelled, with the theatre, one of Manchester’s most important cultural venues, saying the decision came after a “number of issues with the production”.TheManchester Evening Newsreported at the time that the source of the dispute was a song in the play.According to the newspaper the theatre had asked for the song, which involved the audience, to be removed, but the director, Stef O’Driscoll, with the support of the cast, insisted it should stay. Other reports suggested that there was friction over a spray-painted “free Palestine” slogan, which formed part of the set.Explore more on these topicsRoyal ExchangeTheatreA Midsummer Night's DreamTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

You mean God took care … after you used the miracle spring water?”The licensee that operates the channel, Word Network Operating Company Inc, initially said its audience was predominantly in the US and it had a “limited understanding” of Ofcom’s concerns, which it attributed to a “matter of cultural or market difference”.The parent company subsequently said it had taken the decision to change the contract relating to the Peter Popoff Ministries so that it would no longer air on its channel in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My lawyers have not yet received any contact from the police.“It is highly unusual for the police to disclose anything to the media at this stage of an investigation. I remain unaware of the specific allegations, but in any event, I deny any wrongdoing. The allegations are entirely untrue.”Earlier on Tuesday, another senior ex-Reform figure, the former deputy leader Ben Habib, suggestedLowe could join forces with himin a breakaway rightwing party.Habib, an outspoken critic of Farage, said he was “constantly in touch” with Lowe. Habib told theTelegraphthat he and Lowe were “in politics for the same reason”.Asked whether he would consider a joint-venture, he told the paper: “Ultimately the reason I joined Reform, and the reason I stood for Reform in Wellingborough, is because the only way you can make a difference is electorally.“You’ve got to be at the ballot box and hold the electoral system to account … so the answer is yes, I think.”Explore more on these topicsRupert LoweReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

However it has warned that the effect will not be felt by the end of this decade and accused ministers of failing to set out an action plan for reducing household bills.Last month, Starmer reiterated his commitment to the £300 cut, and said he wanted “bills to be low for a prolonged period of time”.The average gas and electricity bill for a typical household in Great Britain willrise by £111 from April to £1,849 a yearunder the price cap from energy regulator Ofgem, after a period when colder weather and limited renewables have drained gas storage in Europe, pushing gas market prices higher.Although bills have fallen since the peak that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, they remain 34% higher than before the crisis and customer debt stands at a record near £4bn, the research showed.Energy UK made a series of proposals for how to lower energy bills, including encouraging households to change their behaviour and act more flexibly, including using appliances at times of lower demand, or using electricity at times of excess wind and solar energy.Reducing reliance on imported gas is the only long-term solution to bringing down energy bills because of the volatility of wholesale gas prices as a result of geopolitical events such asRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Energy UK.Households with “flexibility equipment” – including a battery, heat pump or electric vehicle – could save £115 a year, the report found, by using energy at non-peak times, while others could save smaller amounts of money by altering habits, and running their dishwasher at night, for example.It is also calling on government to invest public money to significantly reduce bills, and explore how to benefit from the evolving energy system.“Clean power is the only way to permanently deliver both energy security and stable, affordable bills, but the benefits are some way off,” said Dhara Vyas, Energy UK’s chief executive.“Successive governments have failed to tackle the dual challenge of how we fairly pay for the crucial investments in our energy system and bring prices down for bill payers,” she said, adding that more funding was required to meet clean power targets.Removing policy costs from electricity bills – where successive governments have chosen to finance building infrastructure through energy bills rather than through general taxation – would lead to the biggest possible reduction in bills, the report found.Energy UK recommended moving policy costs from electricity to gas, and funding a small amount from general taxation, which it said could cut bills by £400 a year for homes with electric heating, while guaranteeing that no households would face increased costs.On Tuesday, the government said up to 170,000 homes in England would get energy-saving upgrades, including insulation, double glazing, solar panels and heat pumps as part of its warm homes plan.Local authorities and social housing providers began allocating £1.8bn in government support, with the funding targeted at low-income households and tenants in social housing.Energy UK’s research came after the publication of a report that the lobby group had accused Ofgem of “unreasonable and unprofessional behaviour”, including contacting workers at energy companies outside working hours, such as at 6pm on Fridays.The body complained in a letter to the regulator that its approach to compliance was discouraging innovation, according to the Financial Times, highlighting disagreements within the energy industry at a critical time for the sector.The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “The government has a plan to make Britain a clean energy superpower so we can end our energy insecurity, which Energy UK recognises is the only way to protect households.“We are already making many supporting changes raised by the sector such as reforming grid connections, proposing improvements to the flagship contracts for difference scheme and exploring further options.“As shown by National Energy System Operator’s independent report, clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsGasHousehold billsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Amid the huge turmoil that has gripped the US government as the Musk-led Doge carries out its activities, USAid has been among the worst-hit government agencies.The huge cuts at USAid have affected projects across the globe as vast numbers of projects are paused, shuttered or have their funding slashed. There has been widespread outcry at the move from USAid workers but also across the international development sector as they warn of the detrimental impact it will have on some of the world’s most vulnerable populations.When federal agencies are dissolved or restructured, their records are typically transferred to successor agencies or the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) in accordance withthe Federal Records Act(FRA). During the US’s hasty exit out of Afghanistan in 2021, Narasent a reminderto safely and lawfully discard sensitive documents.But compliance with the FRA in this situation is deeply in question, since the law explicitly prohibits the destruction of government records before their designated retention period – typically a minimum of three years. There’s also lingering concern that it risks permanently eliminating evidence needed for ongoing Freedom of Information Act (Foia) requests and future oversight investigations.USAid’s office of the inspector generallast year announcedthat it had initiated an investigation on agency oversight of Musk’s Starlink terminals being sent to and used by the government of Ukraine.Democratic members of the Senate foreign relations committeesent a letterto the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in February demanding answers about Doge’s access to USAid headquarters and agency records, though they did not specifically address potential document destruction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not only has there a crackdown on entries into the US, but the increase in cases has reportedly meant a bureaucratic backlog leading to delays in decisions on cases of those who have been detained.Brösche’s mother, Birgit, confirmed to German media on Tuesday that her daughter was on her way home. Brösche’s friend Nikita Lofving, whom the Berliner had intended to visit in Los Angeles, confirmed to the LA Times she had spoken to her friend.Speaking to a journalist from ABC 10News San Diego in a phone interview on 1 March,Brösche said she had spent eight days in solitary confinement. She said: “It was horrible. Like, it’s really horrible. I just want to get home, you know? I’m really desperate.”Lofving, who had been in constant contact with her friend, said: “[Brösche] says it was like a horror movie. They were screaming in all different rooms. After nine days, she said she went so insane that she started punching the walls and then she’s got blood on her knuckles.”The staff at the prison had called a psychologist who wanted to prescribe anti-psychotic medicine to calm her down, but Brösche had refused to take anything, Lofving said.Brösche’s mother told the Berlin tabloid BZ: “I will believe it [her release] only when I am able to take her in my arms.”CoreCivic, the company that owns the Otay Mesa Detention Center, denied Brösche’s claims that she had been in solitary confinement, according to ABC 10News.Brösche and Lofving had attempted to enter the US from Tijuana inMexicoon 25 January. The two were traveling with tattoo equipment. Lofving said that Brösche was arrested and taken away by officers on the border. The US immigration authorities, Ice, assumed Brösche was intending to work illegally in the US, Lofving said. Her friend was in possession of an Esta travel permit.According to Brösche’s Instagram profile, she had only intended to stay in LA until mid-February. Germany’s foreign ministry confirmed it had worked together with its consulate general in LA to resolve the issue.Sielaff returned to Germany last week after spending two weeks in detention, after his entry permit was cancelled at the Mexican border, amid suspicions by the US authorities that he had remained in the US longer than he was allowed.He was arrested at the border point at San Ysidro on 18 February. He had entered the US on a tourist visa and had subsequently visited Mexico with his girlfriend, Lennon Tyler, where they had taken her dog to the vet. According to Tyler, on their return to the US, Sielaff had incorrectly answered a question as to where he lived, due to his poor grasp of English. He had said Las Vegas, where he was staying with Tyler, his fiancee, when he should have said Germany, where he permanently resides, she said.After two weeks in detention, Sielaff was allowed to leave. His girlfriend said she booked him a flight from San Diego to Munich on 6 March. In an interview with the Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger, Tyler warned people against travelling to the US. “Don’t come here,” she said. “Especially not if you’re on a tourist visa, and especially not over the Mexican border.”US authorities have yet to issue a statement on the German cases.Rebecca Burke’s father said on Monday that he was trying to get his daughter out of the detention centre, and had been in touch with the British consulate in San Francisco. He described the conditions in which she was being held as “horrendous”. She had been travelling on a tourist visa, but was told she should have applied for a working visa as she planned to stay with a family receiving accommodation in exchange for carrying out domestic chores.Explore more on these topicsGermanyUS immigrationMexicoDonald TrumpAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

An overwhelming majority of opposition lawmakers had vowed to vote against it.The government asked for the confidence vote, saying it was needed to “dispel uncertainty” about its own future amid a simmering political crisis that has focused on Social Democrat prime minister Luís Montenegro and distracted attention from policy.The controversy has revolved around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Montenegro’s family law firm.A new election is likely in May.Montenegro, who had said he would stand for reelection if the government fell, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became PSD leader in 2022, and has not been involved in its running.It recently emerged that the firm is receiving monthly payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government, among other sources of revenue.An election would pitch the country of 10.6 million people into months of political uncertainty just as it is in the process of investing more than €22bn ($24bn) in EU development funds.Portugal has also been caught up in a rising European tide of populism, with a radical-right party surging into third place in last year’s election. Voter discontent with a return to the polls could play into the hands of the Chega (Enough) party, which has fed off frustration with mainstream parties.The Social Democrats are hoping that economic growth estimated at 1.9% last year, compared with the EU’s 0.8% average, and a jobless rate of 6.4%, roughly the EU average, will keep their support firm.The next general election in Portugal was previously scheduled for January 2028.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The team behind the discoveries had previously identified 62 Saturnian moons using the Canada France Hawaii telescope and, having seen faint hints that there were more out there, made further observations in 2023.“Sure enough, we found 128 new moons,” said the lead researcher, Dr Edward Ashton, a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute forAstronomyand Astrophysics at the Academia Sincia in Taiwan. “Based on our projections, I don’t think Jupiter will ever catch up.”There are 95 moons of Jupiter with confirmed orbits as of 5 February 2024.Total lunar eclipse to mesmerise skywatchers in MarchRead moreThe moons have been formally recognised by the International Astronomical Union this week and, for now, have been assigned strings of numbers and letters. They will eventually be given names based on Gallic, Norse and Canadian Inuit gods, in keeping with convention for Saturn’s moons. Most of the new moons fall in the Norse cluster, meaning astronomers are now on the hunt for dozens of obscure Viking deities. “Eventually the criteria may have to be relaxed a bit,” Ashton said.The moons were identified using the “shift and stack” technique, in which astronomers acquire sequential images that trace the moon’s path across the sky and combine them to make the moon bright enough to detect. All of the 128 new moons are “irregular moons”, potato-shaped objects that are just a few kilometres across. The escalating number of these objects highlights potential future disagreements over what actually counts as a moon.“I don’t think there’s a proper definition for what is classed as a moon. There should be,” said Ashton. However, he added that the team may have reached a limit for moon detection – for now.“With current technology, I don’t think we can do much better than what has already been done for moons around Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,” said Ashton.Closer observations of the bonanza of tiny moons could give scientists a window into a turbulent period in the early solar system, in which the planets migrated around in unstable orbits and collisions were common. The new moons are clumped together in groups, suggesting that many of them are the remnants of much larger objects that collided and shattered within the last 100m years. The moons all have large, elliptical orbits at an angle to those of moons closer to the planet.“[They] are likely all fragments of a smaller number of originally captured moons that were broken apart by violent collisions, either with other Saturnian moons or with passing comets,” said Prof Brett Gladman, an astronomer at the University of British Columbia.Understanding the dynamics of Saturn’s many moons could also help resolve questions about the origin of Saturn’s rings, which scientists have suggested could be the aftermath of a moon that wasripped apart by the planet’s gravity.Separately, the European Space Agency Hera spacecraftwill conduct a Mars flybyon Wednesday and come within 190 miles (300km) of its smallest and most distant moon, Deimos. The moon, which is about 7 miles across, is thought to be the product of a giant impact on Mars or an asteroid that was captured in the red planet’s orbit. Hera will also image Mars’s larger moon, Phobos, before continuingits mission to survey an asteroid, Dimorphos, that was deliberately hit with aNasaprobe three years ago.Once it reaches the asteroid, Hera will perform a detailed post-impact survey to help develop technology that could deflect dangerous asteroids that may collide with Earth in future.Explore more on these topicsSaturnSpaceAstronomyEuropean Space AgencynewsShareReuse this content"

Officers again arrived at the Educational Bookshop without a warrant on Tuesday morning, staff said.They searched stock using Google Translate, confiscated about 50 books and arrested one of the owners, 61-year-old Imad Muna, his brother Morad Muna told the Guardian.“They chose books by the cover, taking books that had a Palestinian flag, or just the word Palestine in the title,” Muna said. “They were using Google Translate and took photos to send to their bosses.”The confiscated books included titles on the work of British artist Banksy, and others by the Israeli historian Ilan Pappé and the US academic Noam Chomsky. After taking them, the police locked the shop and left with the key, taking Imad Muna to a nearby police station before releasing him without charge in the afternoon.In February, Imad’s son Ahmed Muna, 33, and another brother, Mahmoud Muna, 41, were detained for two days, then held under house arrest for five days, but have not been charged. Police cited a children’s colouring book as evidence of incitement to terrorism in the shop.Rights groups and leading authors, intellectuals and diplomats warned at the time that targeting the shop appeared designed to create a “culture of fear” among Palestinians.All prosecutions relating to freedom of speech have to be approved by the attorney general’s office. However, police had not sought permission to open an investigation, search the Educational Bookstore or detain its staff.After the February arrests, prosecutors met police officers to ensure “such incidents don’t happen again”, the office of the deputy state attorney said in a letter to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel about the case.Police said they made the second raid after getting a complaint from a man who visited the bookstore on Tuesday morning. The man “stated that he had observed books containing inciting content”, a police spokesperson said in a statement.Officers detained Imad Muna “to verify his identity and details of the store”, the statement said, and are now reviewing three books seized at the store.“Based on the findings, a determination will be made on whether to refer the matter to the state attorney’s office for further investigation into the suspected sale of inciting materials,” the statement said.After Muna was freed on Tuesday afternoon, most books were returned and the shop reopened. The family-owned Educational Bookshop has been at the heart of cultural life in Jerusalem for more than four decades.Its broad collection of books by Palestinian, Israeli and international authors is popular with residents and tourists, and its cafe hosts regular literary events, including recently the launch of the Pulitzer prize-winning nonfiction book A Day in the Life of Abed Salama by Nathan Thrall.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “This is an additional signal to Putin that he should also be interested in a ceasefire in the air.”Map showing location of Ukrainian drone strikes in Moscow suburbsRussia’s health ministry reported that 18 people were injured in the Moscow region.The Russian aviation watchdog said flights were suspended at all four of Moscow’s airports. Two other airports, in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions east of Moscow, were also closed.Russian Telegram channels shared images showing the aftermath of drone strikes on a car park outside Miratorg, one of Russia’s biggest meat producers, in the Moscow southern suburb of Domodedovo, which killed three security guards and damaged about 40 vehicles.Tatyana, a shopkeeper from Domodedovo, said: “I’ve been up since 3am. The sound of drones woke us first, then came the explosions. It was the loudest night in three years, absolutely terrifying.”There was some anger in Moscow over the apparent lack of warning from Russia’s emergency services about the drone attack.“How did such a large number of drones cross the border from Ukraine unnoticed? Where were the alarms?” Oksana wrote in a chat on Telegram for Domodedovo residents.Russian state media also published images of a damaged apartment in a multi-storey building in the Ramenskoye district, about 31 miles (50km) south-east of the Kremlin.View image in fullscreenA damaged apartment building in a residential complex after a drone attack in the village of Sapronovo, Moscow region.Photograph: Tatyana Makeyeva/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was not immediately clear whether Russia’s defence systems had intercepted all the drones flying toward Moscow.Shot, a Telegram channel with links to the security services, cited a former Russian serviceman who reportedly shot down one of the drones with a hunting rifle in a small village outside Moscow.Russian officials and pro-Russian outlets frequently say drones have been shot down and their debris damaged housing or facilities – regardless of whether the drones hit their intended military targets.Ukraine routinely launches drone attacks on Russia, targeting infrastructure critical to Moscow’s war effort. Tuesday’s attack was the largest on the capital this year, coming hours before US and Ukrainian teams were to meet for peace talks in Saudi Arabia. The timing appeared to send a clear signal to Moscow and Washington that Kyiv was not prepared to accept an unfavourable peace deal and remained a formidable military force.Like their Ukrainian counterparts, Russian officials and Moscow-aligned Telegram channels also linked the attack to the peace talks.“The meaning behind this largest drone attack on the Moscow region is clear – it coincides with the start of negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine will try to push for an air and naval ceasefire that is entirely unfavourable to Russia,” wrote the popular pro-Kremlin channel MIG Russia.“The raid is meant to suggest that such a decision would supposedly benefit all parties … But it won’t work,” the channel added.The Kremlin has yet to comment on Ukraine’s latest proposal for a partial ceasefire, though Russia has previously dismissed such proposals as attempts to buy time and allow Kyiv to rebuild its military.On Monday the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, travelled to Saudi Arabia hoping to mend his strained relationship with the US and secure better terms to end the war. Ukraine also aims to persuade the Trump administration to reverse its decision to halt intelligence-sharing and military aid.Without American military aid, Ukraine is leaning heavily on its fast-growing drone industry and the production of domestically made artillery systems to sustain its defence efforts.Russian forces threaten border in effort to push Ukrainian army out of KurskRead moreUkraine and Russia have developed innovative and increasingly sophisticated UAV programmes. Kyiv has established its own drone command and has improved the range of its systems, with attacks hundreds of kilometres into Russia. It has hit weapons storage units, oil processing facilities and enemy airstrips near the Arctic Circle, as well as naval vessels in the Caspian Sea.Kommersant, a Russian news outlet, said Ukraine primarily used its new An-126 Liutyi (Fierce) drones for Tuesday’s strikes on Moscow.Map of territory controlled by Russia and Ukraine in Kursk and Sumy oblastsSeparate from its attack on the Russian capital, Ukraine also launched more than 100 drones at Russia’s Kursk region, near the Ukrainian border, where Moscow has been reclaiming territory lost after Kyiv’s surprise incursion last summer.Since the US halted military and intelligence aid to Ukraine, Russia has intensified its offensive in the Kursk region, threatening to encircle thousands of Ukrainian troops.On Tuesday, Maria Zakharova, from the Russian ministry of foreign affairs, claimed that the large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow was a sign that Russian forces were gaining the upper hand on the battlefield.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the victims were men in poor, urban areas who were gunned down in the streets.Who is Rodrigo Duterte? Populist architect of Philippines’ bloody ‘war on drugs’Read moreDuterte was arrested on Tuesday morning at Manila’s main airport after flying back from Hong Kong. “Early in the morning, Interpol Manila received the official copy of the warrant of the arrest from the ICC,” the presidential palace said in a statement. “As of now, he is under the custody of authorities.”Video shared online had earlier showed the former leader walking with a stick and being helped to board the stairs of a plane, surrounded by security. His lawyer, Martin Delgra, told local media it was bound for The Hague, where the ICC is based, although this has not been confirmed by officials until Marcos spoke after its departure.View image in fullscreenPeople in Quezon City celebrate Duterte’s arrest.Photograph: Kenosis Yap/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockMarcos, who was previously allied with Duterte’s elder daughter Sara, the country’s vice-president, had in the past refused to cooperate with the ICC investigation. However, his stance shifted after the two families became embroiled in a feud.Marcos said the arrest came at the request of the ICC. “I am confident the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures,” he said after Duterte’s departure. “We did not help the International Criminal Court in any way. The arrest was made in compliance with Interpol.”Sara Duterte said she had “no message” for her former ally. “If you are a Filipino, you will never obey the foreigners inside your own country,” she said. “I don’t have any message for [Marcos]. I don’t think there’s any point talking to a person who will allow a citizen to be turned over to foreigners.”A video shared by the broadcaster GMA had shown the moment of arrest as Duterte was stopped onboard a plane as he arrived in Manila. “You will just have to kill me. I won’t allow you to take the side of the white foreigners,” he said in the footage.Philippine police said 379 police personnel had been deployed to the airport and other key locations. Duterte told police after he was taken into cusody he should be put on trial in a court in thePhilippines. “If I committed a sin, prosecute me in Philippine courts,” he said in a video shared on social media by a relative.Leila de Lima, one of the fiercest critics of Duterte and the “war on drugs” who was jailed for more than six years on baseless charges under his former government, said: “Today, Duterte is being made to answer – not to me, but to the victims, to their families, to a world that refuses to forget. This is not about vengeance. This is about justice finally taking its course.”Josalee S Deinla, the secretary general of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, which represents the victims of the war on drugs, said justice was “finally catching up” with the former leader.Much of the day’s events were relayed on social media and Veronica Duterte posted updates throughout Tuesday. In one clip, an official said Duterte’s family could select three people to accompany him to a charter flight. “Tell where he will be brought. You son of a bitch,” a voice shouted. In another update, Veronica Duterte warned about her father’s health, posting a photograph of him resting and receiving oxygen.Duterte’s supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the ICC has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.Rights groups had urged the government to swiftly surrender him to the ICC.Duterte became president in 2016 after promising a merciless, bloody crackdown that would rid the country of drugs. On the campaign trail he once said there would beso many bodies dumped in Manila Baythat fish would grow fat from feeding on them. After taking office, he publicly stated he wouldkill suspected drug dealers and urged the public to kill addicts.View image in fullscreenSecurity forces stand guard outside a military airbase to where former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was allegedly brought upon arrival at Manila’s international airportPhotograph: Francis R Malasig/EPASince his election, between 12,000 and 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed in connection with anti-drugs operations, according to data cited by the ICC.Even as his crackdowns provoked international horror, he remained highly popular at home throughout his presidency.Police reports often sought to justify killings, saying officers had acted in self-defence, despite witnesses stating otherwise. Rights groups documenting the crackdowns allege police routinely planted evidence, including guns, spent ammunition and drugs. An independent forensic pathologist investigating the killings has alsouncovered serious irregularitiesin how postmortems were performed, including death certificates that wrongly attributed fatalities to natural causes.Duterte, who appeared before asenate inquiry into the drugs war killingsin 2024, said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.” During the same hearing, he told senators he had ordered officers to encourage criminals to fight back and resist arrest, so that police could then justify killing them – but also denied authorising police to kill suspects.Duterte also told the hearing that he kept a “death squad” of criminals to kill other criminals while serving as a mayor of Davao, before becoming president.The ICC’s investigation into the anti-drugs killings covers alleged crimes committed from November 2011 to June 2016, including extrajudicial killings in Davao City, as well as across the country during his presidency up until 16 March 2019, when the Philippines withdrew from the court.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But, amid a slump in car sales, one of its more obscure products that has nothing to do with automobiles is experiencing a boom: the VW currywurst.Described as the fuel of the carmaker’s own factory workers and served up daily in its numerous works canteens and nearby supermarkets, the snack has officially become the company’s most popular product.“More than 8 million Volkswagen original currywursts marks a new sales record for us,” VW’s chief human resources officer, Gunnar Kilian, said on social media this week.Currywurst – sliced sausage slathered in tomato sauce and sprinkled with curry powder and sometimes paprika – is one of Germany’s favourite dishes. The car manufacturer sold 8.5m of their own brand last year, a rise of 200,000 on 2023, a company spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenThe currywurst are all marked with their own official VW branding.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesVW, long one of the most iconic brands in an economy that for decades was Europe’s powerhouse butwhich has contracted for the past two years, has had little else to celebrate this week.The company’s annual report, released on Tuesday, showed net profit down 30.6% compared with the previous year owing to high production costs and decreased sales in China.The 10-brand group, whose models include Audi, Seat and Skoda alongside VW, had a challenging 2024, marked by along and bitter disputewith German unions that ended with a deal in December to cut 35,000 jobs by 2030.On Tuesday,the company’s finance chief, Arno Antlitz, said that “consistently reducing costs and increasing profitability” was VW’s goal, and that the company expected revenue this year to exceed the 2024 figure by “up to 5%”.But VW also acknowledged that challenges remained “arising from an environment characterised by political uncertainty, increasing trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions”. This includes a lack of clarity over Donald Trump’s threat to impose 25% tariffs on manufacturers in the EU.Volkswagen cuts plan sends shock through the ‘Detroit of east Germany’Read moreAway from the global turbulence, however, the company can rely on its sausages.The VW currywurst – which is available in the company’s 30 canteens and work site kiosks as well as local supermarkets near to its factories – is prepared according to a secret recipe known only to a handful of employees.Introduced in 1973, it is produced by the company’s own on-site butchers in its so-called service factory, considered so important to the running of the business it is branded as aVolkswagen Originalteil– an original part – and boasts its own parts number: 199 398 500 A.In 2021, VW bosses’ decision to strike the currywurst off the menu at the company’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, northern Germany, led to an outcry among workers.It also provoked the ire of the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder, one of the dish’s most famous fans and a former leader of the state of Lower Saxony where VW is based.He waded into the row, calling currywurst the “power bar of the skilled factory worker”. It was reinstated, with apologies, from company managers, who had said they had been responding to employees’ increasing calls for healthy vegetarian and vegan options.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeVolkswagen (VW)Automotive industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It would publish its reasoning at a later date, the court added.Several hundred protesters gathered outside the courthouse waving Romanian flags and chanting “freedom” and “thieves”. Ana Florescu, 57, said Romania was “not a democracy any more … There is no justice. They have stolen it.”Florescu, an economist, said the mainstream political parties that have run the country since the collapse of communism in 1989 had “made so many mistakes. No one trusts them any more. And now they have just cancelled a candidate.”Gabriel Feraru, 63, an engineer, said the entire political class was “afraid of Georgescu because he is anti-system, and they will lose all their corrupt privileges”. He said he would boycott the rerun unless Georgescu endorsed a new far-right candidate.The deadline for candidacies is 15 March, giving Romania’s far-right parties, including the Alliance for the Union of Romanians party (AUR) and the party of Young People (POT), which had united behind Georgescu’s run, little time to agree on a replacement.The former government official told his supporters after the ruling to “follow your conscience” when casting their ballot. “Today, the masters have decided: no equality, no freedom, no fraternity for Romanians,” Georgescu posted on social media.“Long live France and Brussels, long live their colony named Romania,” he added in English and French. “While America is becoming great again,Europeand Romania have become petty, corrupt, and under dictatorship.”George Simion, chairman of the AUR and of the far-right bloc that holds about a third of seats in parliament, said the court’s decision was “a disgrace … Once again, it is mocking the Romanian people, is attacking our democracy and our essential rights.”Many protesters said they would either boycott the new ballot or vote for an anti-establishment candidate. “I’ll vote for anyone new who isn’t a part of this system. People are fed up with these same politicians,” said Ionel Popa, a 52-year-old taxi driver.The decisions to annul the elections and disqualify Georgescu have drawn sharp criticism from Washington. Billionaire Elon Musk posted on social media on Monday, asking: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”The US vice-president,JD Vance, had previously said the annulment of the first-round vote showed Romania did not share American values. Georgescu, 62, was leading in the polls and was projected to win about 40% of votes in May.Georgescu had been polling in single digits before the November election and had declared zero campaign spending. He has lauded Russia’s president,Vladimir Putin, as “a man who loves his country” and praised Romania’s 1930s fascist leaders.He has also denied the existence of Covid-19, declared Jesus Christ to be “the only true science”, claimed Nato would never help Romania and said Bucharest was not very good at foreign affairs and should rely on “Russian wisdom”.Moscow has denied any link with Georgescu but said on Tuesday any presidential election without him would be “illegitimate”. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described Romanian authorities’ decisions as a “violation of all democratic norms”.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

A similar blockade was organised in the country’s second-largest city, Novi Sad.University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down at a railway station in Novi Sad last November, killing 15 people. The protests have rocked populist rule of the president, Aleksandar Vučić, and his firm grip on power.View image in fullscreenProtesters accuse the state broadcaster of biased reporting that sides with the government.Photograph: Đorđe Kojadinović/ReutersDuring the blockade on Monday evening, riot police briefly used batons against the crowd, which tried to block one of the entrances to the TV building with metal security fences.The students blame the public broadcaster for biased reporting and siding with Vučić and the government during the demonstrations. The Serbian president was the guest of the main TV news bulletin on Monday evening.During the interview, Vučić insulted the student-led protests, warning that security officers would use force against people at the rally planned for Saturday. He added that the nationwide demonstrations would never cause him to step down.“You will have to kill me if you want to replace me,” he said.The TV reporter who interviewed Vučić called the protesting students “a mob”, which the president appeared to approve of.The interview followed a spat between Vučić and the station, RTS, in which the president described a reporter covering the protests as “an imbecile”. He later apologised for the remark, but said RTS reporters were a “disgrace to their profession”.View image in fullscreenAleksandar Vučić, the Serbian president, said: ‘You will have to kill me if you want to replace me.’Photograph: Andrej Čukić/EPAThe station issued a statement denouncing the blockade on Tuesday. “Forcibly preventing RTS employees from coming to their workplaces represents a dangerous step into open conflicts with unpredictable consequences,” it said.On the same day, Vučić met Donald Trump Jr, the US president’s eldest son, who had just arrived in Belgrade. The purpose of his visit was not immediately known. Vučić is a vocal supporter of the US president.Many in Serbia believe that the roof collapse in Novi Sad last November was caused by poor renovation work fuelled by government corruption. Authorities have indicted 16 people over the disaster.The students have insisted on full accountability for the tragedy, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions.‘We are done with corruption’: how the students of Serbia rose up against the systemRead moreStudent-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in the Balkan country, which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vučić has described the rallies as a western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.Vučić has claimed that protesters “will try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end” this Saturday. Many demonstrators “will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts,” he added.Student-led protests in the past months have mostly been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.Vučić and his rightwing Serbian Progressive party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for more than a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking EU entry for Serbia.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaProtestEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But his song Europapa eclipsed the winner’s – and he’s about to tour the world in his gigantic shoulder padsTue 11 Mar 2025 12.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 12.50 EDTShareJoost Klein is arguably the first artist to triumph at theEurovisionsong contest without actually performing in the final. In May last year, the 27-year-old Dutch wild child “gabber pop” rapper was disqualified from the world’s largest live music event just hours before he was due to perform Europapa to 170 million TV viewers around the globe.This song – a chaotic but catchy ode to the father he lost as a teenager, and to the free movement of people ethos his father instilled in him – was touted as a favourite. But instead of gearing up for his big moment, Klein spent seven hours that day sitting in his changing room in a reflex-blue, Ursula-von-der-Leyen-meets-Vivienne-Westwood suit with gigantic shoulder pads, fearing he was about to be arrested – on live TV – over a “backstage incident” after the semi-final the previous evening. Swedish host broadcaster SVTfiled a police complaintaccusing Klein of “threatening behaviour” by pushing a female camera operator’s equipment. Entertainment careers have been cancelled for less.When my father died, the first thing I did was make 20,000 videos for YouTube with silly dance movesYet now, in the spring of 2025, Klein is celebrating the release of his new album Unity with an 18-stop, 35,000-tickettourthat doesn’t just loop in Friesland and Wallonia but also includes sold-out shows in London and LA – a historic first for someone “yapping in Dutch”, as he puts it. Europapa is diamond-certified in the Netherlands and has racked up 170m streams on Spotify – almost twice as many as the song that officially won Eurovision, Swiss singer Nemo’s The Code.“People tell me, ‘Oh, this disqualification was actually really good for you, because your career got so big,’” Klein says in a mocking voice, in his first English-language interview since Eurovision came crashing down around him. “But if all I cared about was a career, I would actually make listenable music. I would make music that the masses want to hear. Yet I make what I want to hear. And sometimes that’s what the masses want after all, because zeitgeist works in that way.”“Unlistenable” is an overstatement, but it’s true that the paradox of Klein’s appeal is that much of his musical output sounds like utter trash at first listen. Gabber is the Dutch variant of hardcore dance music that grew out of Amsterdam and Rotterdam nightclubs in the early 1990s. It means “friend” in Amsterdam slang, but it was never the kind of friend your parents would have considered a good influence. On most of the songs on Unity, a relentless kickdrum beat is distorted and pitched at a breakneck speed of 140-190bpm (Klein says he started to listen to gabber on his one-hour cycle ride to school “because it makes you pedal faster”). The vocals are either sped up to sound like Mickey Mouse, or involve Klein spitting child-like rhyming couplets – “Evil corporations ruling all the nations” – sometimes in English or German but mostly in guttural, rasping Dutch. Unity features a collaboration with German eurodance titans Scooter that is about as aesthetically refined as a wet T-shirt competition in Magaluf.Yet Klein’s version of happy hardcore is infused with deep sadness: where you expect euphoria, there is melancholy. “I feel like a trampoline, I feel powerless and seething,” Klein mumbled on his first hit single, 2022’s Wachtmuziek. “I feel so, so alone, but I’ve felt that way since I was a child,” he raps on Unity’s Discozwemmen, an unlikely collaboration with 64-year-old Dutch lo-fi rocker Spinvis.Growing up in the village of Britsum in the Frisian flatlands, Klein started making YouTube videos inspired byBo Burnhamand “Weird Al” Yankovic when he was nine, though his father disapproved and made him delete them. When his father died of cancer when he was 12, “the first thing I did was make 20,000 videos for YouTube with silly dance moves,” Klein recalls. “The internet was the only way out.”View image in fullscreenCharged atmosphere … a pro-Palestinian demonstrator holds a ‘12 Points to Joost Klein’ sign in Malmö.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesHis mother passed away after a cardiac arrest a year later and he was raised by his older siblings, whose dates of birth he has tattooed on his knuckles. “If you lose your parents at a young age there’s not a lot that you remember,” he says. “And the things you do remember become bigger and more powerful in your heart or brain.”Which is where Eurovision comes in. One of Klein’s formative childhood memories was of lying on the couch with his parents and watching Finnish heavy metal band Lordi win Eurovision in 2006. “I saw the impact Eurovision had on me on that couch. And I thought, for some reason, ‘That’s maybe how I can use my life.’” Friends warned him about the complicated politics of the event. “But I was just blind with a melancholy and love for the old Eurovision.”The reality of taking part in Eurovision was sobering. Some of the international broadcasters’ delegations that accompany the artists backstage were acting in a bullying manner, he alleges, with one journalist whipping out his smartphone to film him at the urinals.“There was no privacy,” he says. “It was not a safe environment.” Ireland’s entry, Bambie Thug,accused Israeli broadcaster Kan of intimidating behaviour. So which delegation filmed Klein at the gents? All he will says is: “I think everybody knows.” The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) later said it regretted that some delegations “didn’t respect the spirit of the rules”. It has announced new codes of conduct for this year’s contest in the Swiss city of Basel, including no-filming zones.I think stubbornness is necessary in art. You gotta feel your fuel – or there’s no purpose to it allEuropapa ends with an outro in which Klein directly addresses his late father. So he says he was in an emotionally vulnerable state as he exited the stage after the semi-final. “For me, that’s not really a nice moment to, I don’t know, film somebody.” Sweden’s public prosecution service initially said Klein made a movement that hit a female camera operator’s equipment, though it closed its investigation last August afterconcluding that there was no proofthe singer had intended to cause “serious fear”.What exactly happened? Was there a shove? Klein denies he ever touched the camerawoman, or that he damaged her equipment. “If that was the case,” he says, “then there would be a case to be dismissed in the first place.” Klein says he has the footage of the incident filmed by the operator on his phone and might upload it to his YouTube channel one day, insisting it will show “exactly nothing happened”.If nothing happened, why was he suspended? He says the EBU has still not explained it to him. Did the geopolitical backdrop of the war in Gaza play a part? In Malmö, there had been protests calling for Israel to be excluded from the event, and at the semi-final press conference, there was a tense moment when a Polish journalist asked the Israeli contestant Eden Golan if her presence at the contest was endangering other acts. The host intervened to say she did not have to answer the question if she did not want to. But Klein, sitting next to Golan with a Dutch flag over his head, piped up: “Why not?”Unlike some of the other contestants, Klein says he had not felt an urge to make a statement about the Gaza war. “I signed up for an apolitical event.” I suggest that the press conference incident still made him come across as a bit of a bully. “I just said that as the most Dutch person that I am,” he says. “So someone gets a cookie. Someone else gets a cookie. Someone else – not. Why not? Equality is very important, especially in a competition.” There’s a Dutch word for that kind of attitude: astijfkopor “stiffhead”. Is Klein stubborn? “I think stubbornness is necessary in art,” he says. “You gotta feel your fuel, or else there’s no purpose to it all.”As he describes his experience of Malmö, I am struck by a double bind: Klein is still visibly hurt by what happened, his specs fogging up as he describes his anxiety in the dressing room. But he’s also allowing himself to be dragged back, and I am not sure how much he wants to move on.Indeed, the gabber-fuelled pop-punk opening track of his album is called Why Not, revisiting that press conference. And earlier this month he released a single called United by Music, which was Eurovision’s 2024 motto. In it, he and Estonian singer Tommy Cash chant: “Fuck the EBU, I don’t wanna go to court.” He’s still smarting from having his privacy invaded, but he also expresses concern that someone is trying to wipe footage filmed off-stage from the internet.That double bind might be the most zeitgeist-y thing about Klein, and what makes his music resonate so much with Gen-Z’s digital natives: memories can never drift off into the distance but always remain a click away in some online archive. Raw and unrefined, gabber-pop may be the Netherland’s own version of punk, but for Klein, No Future is not a cry of protest but an admission that the past is all-consuming.He seems happy to admit it. “For me,” he says, “reminiscing is almost a 24/7 thing, and that’s not always good. I try to be more in the moment, and I think it’s getting better.” He pauses, and adds: “At least I hope so.”Joost Klein plays Electric Brixton, London, on 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsPop and rockEurovisionDance musicElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you’re paying enough attention, and you have your spirit tuned to the frequencies of the planet, then you’ll be able to sense that the old Avatar machinery is starting to crank up again. The third instalment of the series, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is set for release in December. And this means thatJames Cameronfinds himself saddled with a familiar task; in just nine months he has to try and motivate people to see a film from a franchise that they’ve already forgotten about twice before now.The bad news is that these are incredibly expensive films to make. So expensive, in fact, that Cameron previously stated that the second film needed to be the third highest grossing movie of all time just to break even. And, just to compound things, that film was such an incomprehensible mishmash of confused mythology, nondescript motivation and vague characterisation that this one needs to be something really special to get bums on seats.View image in fullscreenBoy, is it going to get wetter … Avatar 2 (2022.Photograph: Album/AlamyBut the better news is that James Cameron has been here before. He knows exactly how to get people excited forAvatarmovies now, and by God he’s going to pull out the big guns. So, how is Cameron going to make you want to watch Avatar: Fire and Ash? Simple, by promising you a sustained emotional breakdown.So far, one of the only people to have watched Fire and Ash in its entirety is Cameron’s wife Suzy Amis Cameron. According to an interview in Empire, Suzy watched the film just before Christmas. There is a chance she might not yet be over it.“My wife watched the whole thing from end to end. She had kept herself away from it and I wasn’t showing her bits and pieces as we went along. This was 22 December,” Cameron said. “She bawled for four hours. She kept trying to get her shit back together so she could tell me specific reactions, and then she’d just tear up and start crying again. Finally, I’m like, ‘Honey, I’ve got to go to bed. Sorry, we’ll talk about it some other time.’”Now, Fire and Ash is thought to be a long film – Cameron has already said it will be longer than Avatar 2, which had a three hours and 12 minutes runtime – but even so, a four-hour bawling fit seems excessive. This is a film that will make you cry so hard and for so long that even James Cameron will eventually get bored. That’s really saying something.View image in fullscreenAll smiles … James Cameron with Suzy Amis Cameron at the London world premiere of the first Avatar movie in 2009.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockLet’s do the maths here. If Suzy Amis Cameron’s reaction is any indication then, come December, you’re going to have to put aside seven-and-a-half hours aside to experience Avatar: Fire and Ash; three-and-a-half to watch it and then another four to lie on the floor weeping and wailing as you process what you just saw. That’s a big chunk of time. It means that realistically you can only watch a matinee performance, or else you risk losing a full night’s sleep to sobbing uncontrollably about the fate of some blue smurf thing whose name you will never be able to remember. Surely that will affect box office grosses.But let’s look at this as an opportunity. If Fire and Ash is really as emotionally pulverising as Cameron makes out, then the marketing possibilities are endless. Perhaps audiences could be handed a sachet of rehydration salts with their tickets, or maybe fleets of therapists could be waiting in the lobby to soothe the exploded nervous systems of everyone who sees it.Also, it’s worth pointing out that the third Avatar film isn’t even going to be the most hysterically brutal Avatar film of the series. No, that honour goes to the fourth instalment. In 2022, Cameron revealed that, while studio executives sent him three pages of notes after reading the script for Avatar 2, and just one for Avatar 3,the sum total of the response to the fourth film’s script was an email reading “Holy fuck”.Now, bear in mind that Avatar 3 managed to ruin Suzy Amis Cameron for four hours, with the implication being that the same will happen to you. What on earth is going to happen after the fourth film? Will you bawl for five hours? Six? Will your hair spontaneously burst into flames? Will your heart explode inside your ribcage and kill you instantly? Better start pre-booking your ambulances for December 2029.Explore more on these topicsFilmAvatarJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about menopause, mastectomy and her bizarre failure to crack her native AmericaTue 11 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 11.15 EDTShareAfter Anastacia had a double mastectomy in 2013, she began to joke about it. “It was wild to look at myself. I said: ‘My boobs look like this!’” She peers at me with her eyes screwed shut. We are sharing a sofa in a photographic studio in London. I’m not sure what she means, but she belts out, “No eyeballs!” (Typically, nipples come towards the end of reconstructive surgery.) Even in hospital, “I would make jokes and be funny,” she says. “I’m lucky.” Lucky isn’t how many people would feel after getting breast cancer for the second time, but preventive surgery was her choice and, she says, “I can accept it when I find humour in it. Being able to take the mick out of myself and mytoxic titties!– See! There you go! – it takes the sting out of it.”Anastacia has always been like this, she says. Back when she used to break her older sister Shawn’s dolls, “cos the arms didn’t go in a certain direction”, her mum tried to punish her. She gaveShawnbrand new dolls, and Anastacia the broken ones. But Anastacia was in her element. “I played hospital. I was like ‘Whee! Whee!’” she says, bouncing her hands, busily working imaginary dolls. She made them have a great time despite their mutilations, scribbled-on faces and brutally cut hair. “Which is constantly how my life is. I was born with that in me, and it amplified as I got older and realised: ‘Oh yeah, that’s a better way to live than worrying about things.’”By her own admission, Anastacia can come across as “a little much”. Apparently, there’s an “isolator” in her: an introvert who shuts the door and decompresses so the extrovert – who has shown up today – can go out to “do my job, sing what I need to sing”. Her voice and vocal range are huge just when she’s talking; she seems always about to burst into laughter or song. Even her yawns are musical, her chatter peppered with klaxons, trumpets and squealing brakes. Her energy and playfulness make it easy to picture her as a sort of doll in her own hands – she has certainly seen her share of hospitals – bouncing about, trying to find joy in the hard things and come up with the story that makes sense of all the breakages.View image in fullscreen‘I was a white girl but I had this soul in me’... performing in 2005.Photograph: Paul Bergen/RedfernsAt 56, Anastacia has flown into London before aEuropean tourto mark the 25th anniversary of her debut album, Not That Kind. Here she will play the megastar that she is in Europe. Back home in the US, she has never toured. Albums that have gone platinum in the UK, Germany or Australia have barely charted there. I’m wondering how she explains this division to herself. “I’m OK,” she says. “Because if I’d had success in the US, I might have been a different person.” As it is, she is happy to say, “I am a continual working girl in her job.”“Working girl” sounds very humble for someone who has sold more than 30m records, but it wasn’t a “fancy life”, growing up. Pinging between her home town of Chicago, New York (where her father lived and the family later moved) and her grandpa in Florida was Anastacia’s “version of understanding the world”. In career terms, she was a late bloomer. She entered the talent show The Cut in 1998, pretending to be 24 when she was actually 30. When she signed with Sony soon after, “I told everybody [the truth],” she says, leaning forward and speaking with exaggerated secrecy out of one side of her mouth, “I’m just letting you know!They were like: ‘It doesn’t matter. You can pass! Your talent is beyond!’”But lying about her age was “real hard”. Partly because she was raised to be honest, and partly because it was impossible to keep up with the maths. She eventually came clean – with huge relief – when she turned 40.You would think that starting later would make her more worldly, but Anastacia says: “Even though I was much older than everyone thought, I had a very innocent, naive approach to the industry.” She had never travelled overseas or worn designer clothes before. While filming the video for her debut single,I’m Outta Love, she went to fetch money because “I hadno ideait would be free. I was like: ‘This is nuts!’” At the time, she points out, “I was an out-of-work receptionist collecting an unemployment cheque.” Her early riders sound like a pocket money blowout in the corner shop: “Doritos, candy, chocolate, Diet Coke.”The truth is, she says, “I never really understood what I had as a singer until much later in life. I didn’t sound like anyone, so I didn’t think [I had] the right voice. I didn’t sound like Celine [Dion] or Madonna. I sounded more like Aretha [Franklin] and Tina Turner. It doesn’t work well coming out of …” she gestures to herself. “Even though I was a white girl, I had this soul in me and I don’t know where that came from.”View image in fullscreen‘I had a very naive approach to the industry’ … on stage with LucianoPavarotti in 2001.Photograph: Daniele Venturelli/WireImageActually, she adds, “I will say, when I heard my father sing, I went: ‘That twang has to be from him.’” A singer and actor, he left the family home when Anastacia was three, and died in 2005. Their estrangement was well publicised, but now she will only say: “I’m good with it.”More broadly, she didn’t know what sort of an artist she was. Her mother, an actor, thought Anastacia should act, and took the children along to her auditions. “Mum would be in the theatre, and we’d bring the quiet toys … It always seemed easy for her. But it wasn’t easy for me. It was stressful.” She enrolled in a professional school in New York but “hated acting”. “It took me longer to find my own self.”Where she really felt at home was on the dancefloor. At 16, she was a regular at New York’s Club 1018, where she would go alone. The bouncers looked out for her; her mum gave her money for orange juice. Was she hoping to be discovered? “Oh no!” she says, horrified. “I went because I loved the music and I loved to dance. I was like: ‘Woo woo woo!’ Everyone was drunk, picking each other up.Notinterested. I would dance until the club closed. I’d be there in the corner. Creating my own moves.”One night, a man asked if she could sing. “I thought: ‘Oh God, he’s trying to pick me up.’ He was like: ‘Don’t get me wrong. I’m a real producer. You have a great look and you can move.’ And that’s how it started.”She still had years ahead of singing at weddings and birthdays, dancing on Club MTV, and backing the likes of Paula Abdul and Jamie Foxx. Even after she reached the final of The Cut, and Michael Jackson tried to sign her (she eventually picked Sony), she retained a sense of not being at ease.View image in fullscreenAs much a trademark as her powerful voice and tinted prescription glasses … Anastacia bares her midriff while performing.Photograph: United Archives/kpa/Getty ImagesIn those early days, her midriff was as much a trademark as her powerful voice and tinted prescription glasses. “My famous midriff … my courage of who I was,” she says. She won’t show it now, even on holiday. “I’m 56! A one-piece is fine with me!” Looking back, she believes she exposed her stomach to draw attention away from her breasts. “Because I had very, very large …” she says, indicating her chest, “for a little girl.” (She is 5ft 2in.) “I was very self-conscious. I didn’t like to be looked at like an object. And these are objects to whoever it is that’s objectifying you.”She decided on a breast reduction and in 2003, three years into her career as a solo artist, had a pre-operative scan – only to learn that she was in the early stages of breast cancer. She immediately had surgery and radiotherapy.She was 34 (but, of course, everyone thought she was 28). What a “positive” being uncomfortable in her body turned out to be, she says: “I would never have [gone for the scan] had I not been insecure.”She has a habit of finding the advantage in challenging situations, and I can’t help thinking of those broken dolls again. Her best albums emerged from hardship: 2004’s Anastacia confronts her feelings about her father in songs such as Left Outside Alone, while Resurrection, from 2014, was written during her second bout of breast cancer, followed byEvolution– her personal favourite, “a frickin’ great album”.View image in fullscreenIn ‘100% full menopause’ … Anastacia.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianJust as I’m thinking no lemon is too sour for her to wring lemonade from it, she says she “got a kick” out of her menopausal hot flushes. “I would just be talking – then, phew! Let me take off my jacket!” She starts to fan herself vigorously and look around shouting, impersonating herself in a restaurant, “I was like: ‘Yo dude! I’m onFIRE! Wheew!’” she says, her tongue hanging out. “I didn’t find it embarrassing. I thought, that’s hilarious … I was shocked that my body could do that. It was fascinating.”Now she is “100% full menopause” and proud. “Halle Berryis talking about it, the Oprahs of this world … we’re all going: ‘Oh my God, we’re in fucking menopause!’ We’re talking about it to take away the cloud. It’s not a terrible thing.” Recently, though, she admitted to having mistaken menopausal migraines for a brain tumour. In her own words, there is always “a health crisis one step away”. She has previously suffered from an abnormal heart rhythm, and was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease at 13. Does she fear illness?“I’veneverfeared for my life,” she says. “And I’ve never lost faith. That’s just who I am.” But faith in what? “Faith as in belief. If you believe in yourself you’re just like: ‘Hmm, well. Got cancer. That sucks.’ Yes, I cried about it. Yes, I said: ‘God, I didn’t think I was going to die this way.’ But I didn’t wallow. I didn’t throw a pity party for myself.”View image in fullscreenWith then husband Wayne Newton in 2009.Photograph: Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImageTwo years ago, she moved to Denver, Colorado, because she had been thinking of “retirement reality”. The reasoning was: “If I’m in Beverly Hills, paying a gazillion dollars to have a 90210 address, what about going somewhere you can actually save some money?” She is not currently writing an album but there is talk of a single, and a possible tour extension, so what does she mean “retirement”? “Meaning, this is where we want to live, where we want to grow old,” she says.The “we”, incidentally, is “my mum, my brother, my sister and I. It’s always them,” she says. Brian, her brother, is disabled and needs care. Shawn is Anastacia’s assistant. “My as-sister-ant!” she hoots. Even her fans are family. “I’ve seen them get married … I’ve seen their children.” She and Shawn find it hilarious when the ones in front who used to “jump and scream” all night now sit down after half a verse.So the “we” doesn’t include a partner? “I sometimes include a relationship with that, and sometimes don’t,” she replies. After divorcing her husband (and former bodyguard) of three years in 2010, she stopped discussing her personal life. However, she is wearing a pendant with the number 090622 in script. That is clearly a special anniversary. “Oh, my God!” she howls. “It’s my dog’s birthday! Broady! Broady-on-the-roadie!”Shawn is bringing the chocolate yorkshire terrier to Spain. “He’ll be on the whole tour. I told my manager, I’ve lived without these things for so long. I know it’s harder. Harder on hotels, flights. But I really dowant thatin my life. I know it’s very diva, but I’m not a mom, I don’t have a kid, I’m not married. So there’s not much that I do besides work. I’d like to feel fulfilled when I get home and see the dog and I’m like …” She puckers her lips. “Mwah, mwah, mwah!”I feel sorry for her when she says she doesn’t have much beyond work. Especially when she reflects that with Donald Trump in power, “we’re all in the Upside Down now”. What does she want from life? “I’m getting it,” she says, sounding indignant. “I’m totally getting it. I’m living itright now. I’minit.”Not That Kind 25th anniversary vinyl reissue is out on 11 April.

Then broke down sobbing’Notorious for his drug-fuelled literary experiments and the fact that he shot his partner, beat writer Burroughs also made art inspired by the climate crisisStuart JeffriesTue 11 Mar 2025 06.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 06.49 EDTShareOne day 51 years ago, out in the wilds of New Mexico,Kathelin Grayasked a question of her hero, the writer and artist William S Burroughs, whom she had just met. “William, I have read your books and I must know: what is your attitude to women?”The question had been eating away at Gray for the best part of a decade. As a teenage babysitter, she read Burroughs’ novelThe Naked Lunchand was blown away by it. “The very yuckiness of the imagery, the critique of predatory capitalism, the degrading sex and violence – all that spoke to me,” she says.A few years later she invited her hero to give a lecture at a ranch near Santa Fe where she and some like-minded souls had established the counterculturalInstitute for Ecotechnics, and he had accepted. But how could she square this inspirational writer with the man who killed his partner Joan Vollmer during a party at a friend’s Mexico City apartment in 1951?“Put that glass on your head, Joanie,” Burroughs is reported to have said at the time. “Let me show the boys what a great shot old Bill is.” Burroughs fired one shot from a Czech-made Star .380 pistol, missed the glass and killed her. The local papers wrote up the tragedy as a William Tell prank gone wrong. He was never prosecuted.View image in fullscreenWilliam S Burroughs Burn Unit, 1987.Photograph: Jonathan Greet/© Estate of William S BurroughsAnd yet, even today, at a time when the late writer and artist is coming to the attention of a new generation thanks to the film adaptation of his storyQueerstarring Daniel Craig, the suggestion that he was a lowlife heroin- and-booze addicted woman-hater who intended to shoot his common-law wife (the pair were not married) won’t go away. Arecent profile, for instance, described him as Joan Vollmer’s murderer. “It was an accident,” counters Gray. “Of course he didn’t intend to kill her.”How did Burroughs answer your question, I ask Gray? “He stood stock still, looked into my eyes and said ‘I killed the only woman I ever loved’. Then he broke down sobbing.” That evening, Burroughs entranced Gray and her compadres with a lecture given inside the Institute’sgeodesic domeon the theme oflingua-technis.Gray is recalling her meeting with Burroughs to me over coffee at theOctober Galleryin London, where she has curated an exhibition of rarely seen Burroughs artworks, made in the last decade of his life, from spray paint, acrylics – and gunshot. Until hisdeath in 1997, she and Burroughs were close friends and she has spent much of her life since curating his art. “There was nothing misogynistic about him at all,” he says. “As a straight woman” – Burroughs was gay – “I felt nothing but comfortable with him. He was a very sensitive soul, and that comes out in all his art, literary and visual.”View image in fullscreenBlast first: William S Burroughs and his 'shotgun' paintings in a gallery in London circa 1989.Photograph: Steve Speller/AlamyIndeed, in a catalogue essay, Gray wrote. “Burroughs could not bear the idea that anyone would suffer pain. He identified with patients of burn units, he identified with the endangered lemurs of Madagascar.” On the walls above us as we chat is his 1987 painting Burn Unit, a howl of red paint overlaid with crudely daubed human faces evidently in pain; above my head is his photomontage of lemurs in a flaming hellscape, expressing Burroughs’s outrage at how slash-and-burn agriculture was destroying the animals’ Malagasy habitat and driving them to extinction.Gray reminds me that in his 1991 novellaGhost of Chance, Burroughs meditated on whether our species could ever live in harmony with other life forms. For Gray, this compassionate late text poses a question that obsessed him: “What is a human destiny that would be life-enhancing, not destructive to other beings? Perhaps,” Gray reflects, “clues to that destiny will be found in dreams, in what’s called subconscious, in altered states.”What Gray loves about Burroughs’ art is how it always involves an element of chance, which she recognises as one of his manifold tactics for exploring the subconscious, entering transcendental realms or simply overcoming societal conditioning and egotistical control. That’s why, she explains, when his artist friendBrion Gysinshowed Burroughs his textual cut-up method in the late 1950s, he decided to adopt the practice in his writing – in turn inspiring David Bowie to randomise his lyrics.It’s why too that, far from eschewing guns after Vollmer’s death, Burroughs turned his studio into something akin to a rifle range, peppering paper, wood and canvases with bullets. Here at the October Gallery, several artworks betray his continued fascination with firepower. There is a free-standing plexiglass vitrine holding the bullet-ridden wreckage of a piece of painted wood. “The shotgun blast,” wrote one critic, “releases the little spirits compacted into the layers of wood, releases the colours of the paints to splash out in unforeseeable and unpredictable images and patterns.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marker and gunshots on sketchbook paper.Photograph: Jonathan Greet/© Estate of William S Burroughs. Courtesy October Gallery, LondonI tell Gray this reminds me of theauto-destructive artofGustav Metzgerwho in 1959 launched this art movement by throwinghydrochloric acid at a nylon sheet on London’s South Bank, thus creating voids in the surface akin to Burroughs’ bullet holes. Metzger and Burroughs were friends, Gray tells me, and no wonder: the former was a Holocaust survivor, CND activist and lifelong foe of human destructive power; the latter, Gray reckons, was deranged into artistic expression by the advent of the atomic age, whereby humans finally had the power finally destroy themselves and their planet, fulfilling the logic of what Burroughs once called “the death trap of the industrial revolution”.“In thrall to the world market,” wrote Gray in a catalogue essay, “humanity accelerates its rapacious behaviour using rationalisation … to justify the ravages of predatory capitalism. In his life and work, Burroughs deconstructed logic and rationalism to pursue other strategies of thought.”Fair enough, but the gun thing still troubles me. A 1992 work hanging nearby is called Brion’s Birthday and consists of a marker sketch of his friend, his midriff riddled with bullet holes. Nearby, Warhol: A Portrait in TV Dots from the same year looks like a perforated rifle range target that, by happenstance, depicts the eponymous artist nearly shot dead in 1968 by Valerie Solanas. “Europeans,” says Gray, “always have a trouble with Americans and their guns. William was a very ordinary American in that sense.”Why is she putting on this show of Burroughs right now? “Because he was on the money,” she replies. “As someone else said of him, he was a Nostradamus – certainly when it came to climate catastrophe, which he foresaw clearly. He imagined, too, that anyone could achieve inner and outer liberation from the ravages being inflicted on the world. That’s why his art matters to me – and why it’s worth seeing right now.”William S Burroughs is at theOctober Gallery, London, until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designWilliam BurroughsExhibitionsPaintingArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or, as my colleague Jess Cartner-Morley called it last month, theLittle Boxy Jacket.Soft and untailored, Chanel’s original boucle jackets were a rejection of the corseted silhouettes that were fashionable at the time. A century later, the brand continues to riff on the style – most recently with pastel-coloured and pearl-adorned versions down its couture catwalk.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, with prices starting from £2,000, they are a wardrobe staple most of us can only dream of. However, there is some good news: this spring, the high street has several iterations that couldalmostbe the real thing, at more affordable prices. Here is my pick of the best.The best Chanel-style jacketsBlue boucle crew neck jacketView image in fullscreen£49.99 at New LookNew Look’s baby blue offering is the most affordable of my selection and would look chic styled with a slim polo neck and white tapered jeans. Add a thin gold chain belt through your loops for a fun but wearable Y2K update, or go full-on Cher from Clueless and invest in thematching skirtas well.Hounds tooth box jacketView image in fullscreen£350 at Me + EmAt first glance, the ochre tone of this jacket from Me + Em may seem tricksy to incorporate into your wardrobe, but trust me when I say it will elevate all your basic jeans and T-shirts. I’m a fan of the chunky military-style white buttons, which balance out the neatness of the round collar and boxy shape. Style it with a classic white shirt, blue jeans and heeled courts: very soft power.Auguste jacketView image in fullscreen£185 at SézaneThis style from the cult French brand Sézane is made from wool rather than boucle or tweed and is more like a substantial cardigan than a jacket, perfect for those of us who prefer something a bit roomier and less restrictive. I love its retro-inspired trim and crochet buttons. Its softer lines will work well with loose-fitting dresses, laid-back trousers and classic jeans. One of my favourites.Cappuccino nails, boho blouses and pilates pumps: Jess Cartner-Morley’s March style essentialsRead moreGreen, black and white tweed jacketView image in fullscreen£360 at Essentiel AntwerpFor something with real personality, invest in this velvet-trimmed Essentiel Antwerp jacket. Embellished with pearls and four patch pockets, it has hook-and-eye fastenings, so it is less structured and more like a blazer than some other styles. Perfect for the weekend over a thin, soft knit and relaxed jeans.Navy cotton blend boucle knit jacketView image in fullscreen£130 at Mint VelvetThis navy double-breasted jacket from Mint Velvet has a bit of a military feel. I’m a fan of the high collar and extended cuff, details that make it feel quite tough and practical. You could throw it on with any outfit, from jeans to a jumpsuit. Wear it to the pub or the park – it has versatility in spades.Maya tweed jacketView image in fullscreen£99 at MonsoonYellow is having a bit of afashion momentso tick two trend boxes at once and invest in this lemon jacket from Monsoon. It doesn’t have to be all about afternoon tea and petit fours: pair it with blue denim, wide-leg beige chinos or a camel-knit skirt and it will work for the office as well as for the weekend. Just add some chunky metallic jewellery for a final style flourish.Cream collarless textured boucle jacketView image in fullscreen£62 at NextWith sizes going up to a UK 26 in its tall range and a UK 20 in its petite, this jacket from Next works for all shapes and sizes. Its longer cut will give more coverage over the hips and, unlike cropped styles, will flow perfectly over dresses – ideal for a wedding. Equally, its length invites you to add a belt and cinch it in at the waist for pairing with wide-leg trousers. A really smart buy.Tweed jacket with frayed endsView image in fullscreen£89.99 at MangoLooking for a jacket that’s a bit more fashion forward? Try this blue and creamy yellow frayed-edge style from Mango. The colour combination requires a bit more thought if you’re going to wear it with more than a white T-shirt, but its pastel lightness actually works well with darker colours. I would opt for a navy stripe shirt or maybe a coffee brown collared knit underneath. With sizes going up to a 4XL (UK 26) it’s among the high street’s more inclusive styles.Tweed checked fringed jacketView image in fullscreen£69 at Marks & SpencerThis navy and white tweed jacket from Marks & Spencer has a fringe trim, modern silver buttons – and is lined. You could pair it with jeans and metallic ballet pumps, as pictured, for a relaxed, but smart look. But I’d also wear it with wide-leg linen trousers and slingbacks for spring garden parties. Runs from UK size 6 to 24.Charlie black and ivory tweed trim jacketView image in fullscreen£349 at LK BennettIt doesn’t get more classic than this offering from LK Bennett. Made from black-and-ivory Italian tweed with four patch pockets and a contrast trim, you can even buy a matching tweedcorsagein a nod to the famous camellia that Chanel has often added to its own boucle jackets. It comes in an array of colours (mint green! Pink!), but I’m a fan of this salt-and-pepper style: pair it with black, or lighter neutrals like cream or putty pink.Melanie Wilkinson is the Guardian’s styling editorExplore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterChanelWomen's coats and jacketsWomen's topsbest ofShareReuse this content"

However, it is also a good alternative tourda, a Balkan cheese made from leftover whey that, whenIrina Janakievskamoved to the UK 20 years ago, was impossible to find here. “I started using cottage cheese instead,” says the author ofThe Balkan Kitchen. “And while it isn’t a direct substitute, it is versatile.” For a riff on a Balkan-style filo or hand-stretched savoury pastry (“such asgibanica,banitsaorburek”), Janakievska combines cottage cheese, fried leeks and blanched and roughly chopped greens (spinach, chard, sorrel, nettles, say), then binds them with an egg before swaddling in filo and baking.Gustavo Giallonardo, chef director ofOriolein London, meanwhile, suggests adding it to huevos rancheros: “Cottage cheese provides a tangy, creamy contrast. Blend it first, or mix it with lime and queso fresco to enhance that tanginess.” Otherwise, Giallonardo adds, cottage cheese would make a fine alternative to soured cream in a burrito, or get some into that perennial brunch favourite, shakshuka: “Mix some into the sauce, spoon it over just before serving or simply serve it on the side.” Any cottage-cheese cravings could also be sated with Janakievska’s mum’s savoury bread pudding, which she has “unfairly called old bread bake”: “It’s an amazing dish, though, using odds and ends of bread with cottage cheese to make an almost-strata,” she says. “That makes a very nice breakfast or brunch.”Now on to dessert, where cherries, be they frozen, fresh (when the time comes) or sour, make a superb filling combined with cottage cheese and a bit of semolina for a strudel, Janakievska says. Alternatively, go for a kind-of deconstructedkadaifbaklava bowl. This involves layering cottage cheese mixed with honey, lemon or orange zest, and ground cinnamon, followed by a mix of toasted and roughly chopped nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, for example). “You could add fruit [apples, pears, frozen cherries] stewed with citrus juice, then top with kadaif pastry brushed with butter and toasted in the oven until light brown,” Janakievska says. She then finishes off proceedings with a drizzle of honey and an extra sprinkle of toasted nuts. “That’s also a good way to use up any leftover kadaif pastry, which is itself having a moment with everyone trying to make a Dubai chocolate bar at home,” she adds. It just so happens that the Guardian’s ownRavneet Gillwill be sharing her own take on that bar very soon, so keep an eye out in the run-up to Easter.Got a culinary dilemma?

At home, we were to call him dad.Frank was my mother’s lover and the sexual predator to each of her five children, two girls and three boys. As well as being a pedophile, Frank was a thief and an arsonist. He lived outlandishly, spending money he stole from the church or, later, from an insurance company.His wrath had no bounds. Over a decade, we were subjected to physical violence and forced to witness the heartbreaking abuse of animals, deepening our sense of helplessness. He was unstoppable, allowed to commit atrocious crimes without losing his livelihood or his liberty.Like so many others before and after him, Frank had beenable to usethe Catholic church as a cover. This is why, on Valentine’s Day in 2019, decades after I’d last seen Frank, my husband, Todd, and I found ourselves crammed in the tiny reception area of the Bull and Moose Club in Albany, New York. The room was lively, bursting with anticipation. We were there to attend a press conference heralding the Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of child sexual abuse to pursue civil damages against their abusers and their enablers, no matter how long ago the abuse occurred.Finally, we knew, truths would be unburied, secrets would be told.The very next day, my four siblings and I retained Martin Smalline and JoAnn Harri, a husband and wife lawyer team. A few days after that, we filed suit against the Roman Catholic diocese of Albany. We were the first survivors in the diocese to do so. My siblings and I weren’t after money; we’d never want the church to think any sum could provide penance for their crimes. Taking on the diocese was about one thing only: stopping them.You don’t have to hold your breath – we won. But this isn’t a piece about the church, or Frank. This is a piece about my mother.View image in fullscreenJoAnn Stevelos at home in Albany in February.Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The GuardianAmong hundreds of instances of clergy abuse, my family’s situation had been the worst. This is howThomas Doyle, a world-renowned expert in clergy abuse deposed by our lawyers, testified in court when asked to review our case.By worst, Doyle meant: the length of time we spent captive, navigating Frank’s sadism; the number of people inside the diocese who knew about Frank’s abuse yet never intervened; and the staggering number of crimes he committed in plain view without any consequences.Even with those facts at hand, it would have been reasonable to believe that my siblings and I didn’t stand a chance against the church. The Albany diocese is over 150 years old, extremely wealthy and powerful. It stretches across 14 New York state counties, has approximately 325,000 parishioners, and was served by nearly 200 priests. MOre than half of those priests were credibly accused of sexually abusing children.One hundred and six of them. Father Francis Melfe was just one among many.As our lawyers submitted evidence and depositions, the church argued that because my mother’s role in the abuse was undeniable, they’d only pay for half of the damages. Everything we knew to be true about her would become public as well. Could we maintain our dignity under the burden of Mom’s shame?As soon as we filed suit, local media picked up our story. Splattered across the front pages was an Easter photo of the five of us, flanked by Frank and Mom.In the picture, taken when I was 15,Mom stands by him, her arm snug around his waist. She’s smiling, the kind of smile that says everything’s fine, the kind that fits the Easter outfit, the manicured lawn, the dream house. She looks like any suburban mom posing for a holiday photo. Blessed with the innocence of being the youngest, Frank’s son, five years old, is the only one smiling.Eventually, a reporter got Mom to chat on the phone. At first, she denied her complicity and claimed she didn’t know anything about it. But the reporter kept pressing, until Mom finally said: “Believe whatever they say. It’s all true.”Mom died a few months after that, on 1 February 2020. She left this world having offered no deathbed explanations or expressions of regrets. Her obituary ran in the local paper, just three sad lines, with no mention of us.View image in fullscreenA family portrait with a nine-year-old JoAnn.Photograph: Sarah Blesener for the GuardianThough we hadn’t spoken for nearly 30 years, I inherited Mom’s personal effects, including boxes of vinyl-covered photo albums capturing the 10 years my siblings and I spent trapped with Frank.One stormy April evening, a few months after her death, I opened them for the first time. Lying on my bed, I flipped through them under the light of my bedside lamp, choosing one at random, then another.Everything depicted in the pictures hurt me.Back then, we had watched as Mom acted as the caretaker of Frank’s life. She cooked and cleaned while managing our family secrets, including the money Frank stole from bingo games, collection baskets and the church budget. She would find creative places to store the stolen bills: in the freezer, or a dusty filing cabinet.A master archivist of lies, she kept herself busy late into the evenings, labeling photos and editing films of our birthday parties, Easter egg hunts and Christmases, all while Frank had undisturbed access to our bedrooms. In the morning, she would deftly cover her children’s hickeys with Band-Aids before sending them off to school.That April night, as I flipped through hundreds of photographs, I lifted one of the Polaroid’s edges from the album’s paper, peeled it up, and held it to the light. I knew it was impossible, but the musty smell of Frank’s Old Spice seemed to float up from the lustrous plastic of the finish.It showed me wearing an orange and red flowered string bikini, Frank’s arms wrapped low around my hips. His wristwatch cuts into my pubic bone.C’mon closer, Jo! You look so pretty in that thing.We posed in front of the white rose bushes Mom had planted alongside the fence surrounding our “Olympic-size” pool, an exaggeration frequently spouted by Frank. Look closely, and you will see my sister diving into shimmering water in the photo’s top left corner. On the photo’s yellowed matting, Mom wrote: “Frank and Jo (age 9) Summer ’73”.When exactly did Mom know about what Frank was doing to me? Why had she documented his crimes? Now that I had the photo albums, their transgressions were once again made flesh: his body wrongly pressed against mine, the brazenness of it all, the delusion, the pure greed.side by side photos: a hazy portrait of a woman and an old polaroid of a pregnant woman dressed in pinkLeft: JoAnn at home in February 2025. Right: JoAnn’s mother during her pregnancy with JoAnn, near her childhood home in downtown Albany (West Hills). Sarah Blesener for the GuardianThere were beach vacations, Christmas stockings stuffed with crisp $100 bills, cashmere coats worn in upscale Quebec hotels, and lobster bibs donned in high-end restaurants. In one photo, Frank drapes his arm around Mom’s neck. His cheek presses into hers. Frank’s hand lies atop her green satin blouse; the other holds an empty martini glass. Mom’s coy smile, her flirty gaze, her easy happiness – she stands by Frank like someone from an alternate life, just a single woman with her date, out for a good time.It’s obvious, if you think about it: the pictures were Mom’s way of realizing her fantasy. In it, she and Frank weren’t criminals; they were normal middle-class parents living an ideal suburban life.Before Mom met Frank, we occupied a two-bedroom flat with yellowed linoleum, tin cupboards, a sputtering icebox, and mismatched chairs set around a plastic table. We were living hand to mouth.Mom knew poverty well, the daughter of a Welsh immigrant who clung to old-world traditions. At 18, she married my father, a boy from an even poorer Albanian family, their marriage hurried by an unplanned pregnancy.They broke up when I was four years old. “The guy’s got gambling problems. He’ll never amount to anything,” Mom often said, as if to seal the past away. Child support wasn’t needed. Alimony wasn’t pursued. Freed of obligation, my father visited us once after we moved, took a look at the life we seemed to be living, and never came back. Still, I hoped. I remember praying that my father would rescue me from Frank – not that I ever said it out loud. Even as a child, I knew better.In 1969, one spring night at Valley’s Steak House, my newly single mother waited on Frank. To her delight, they flirted during his meal. After he left, Mom opened the folder with the bill in it, and found $200 in tip money tucked inside.Mom had celebrated her 29th birthday just four months earlier. One heart-tugging photo from Mom’s albums shows her cradling a birthday cake, smiling. I stand on a chair, wide-eyed, with my arms wrapped around her shoulders. Our navy blue dresses match. She looks happy, I look happy. But Frank’s tip changed everything, sealing our fate to his.Like most highly skilled predators, Frank’s motivation to hunt was strong: he had another secret family on the side.Mom knew about them: siblings headed by a single mother from the Philippines. Frank told us the poor Filipinos needed his help; he was called to duty.Frank and Mom visited them, and Mom pretended she did not know who they really were. The youngest, the boy, I suspected may have been Frank’s. In one botched visit, Mom and one of my brothers caught the other mom and Frank together in bed.Still, Mom stayed with Frank.View image in fullscreenA ‘beauty photo’ of JoAnn’s mother, in her early 30s.Photograph: Sarah Blesener for the GuardianMeanwhile, my attempts to escape started early. First there was drinking, then drugs, and attempts to run away. I finally left home for good at 15.At 22, after I had my son, Mom seemed to think we finally shared something in common. By then, Frank had a position at the New York state division for youth, counseling institutionalized children – a fact that added a chilling layer to the twisted bonds that still held us all together. Mom was not disturbed by him taking a job in which he could hurt more children. All that mattered was that she had a decent household budget again.My role was to keep her company. In many ways, she was still a beguiled teen. She’d reminisce about the time she had planned my whole prom out, painting me as a virginal teen, desirable and deserving of the gaze of a prince.Despite everything, I loved her. I needed to believe that she had not forsaken me.In 1992, five years after I became a mother myself, I lost my stronghold on moving forward.I sought treatment with a therapist specializing in trauma. Forgiveness was not even on the table at that point in my life; my only priority was pure survival. Would I choose to live until my next appointment?Week after week, Elizabeth listened to my story. Learning to trust her deeply was, in and of itself, a long process. Finally, she said: “I’ve read the literature and consulted with my peers. I have never given a client the following advice in 30 years of practice. This advice goes against the history of psychotherapy, which encourages people to reconcile their past, and especially their relationship with their mother. In your case, I recommend you cut all ties with your mother. You should never see her again.”Never see Mom. Cut all ties. How could I do such a thing? Keeping her in my life fed an endless hope that she really had meant to love me. That she hadn’t forsaken me. If I cut all ties, she could never become the mother I wanted, a mother who does not abandon her children’s welfare in exchange for money, comfort and male attention.When I finally walked away after many attempts, Elizabeth gently led me through the process of grieving the mother I wanted and accepting the one I was born to. I stopped denying that Mom had hurt me in ways no mother should ever hurt a child. I began to see her just as she was.Eventually, I was able to create a comfortable life for myself. I studied at prestigious universities, built a career as an international children’s health adviser, and raised a family of my own. But complex feelings of shame, betrayal and vulnerability deformed my accomplishments. The question continued to haunt me: what if I’d been raised in a loving, protected environment by caring, responsible adults? Who wouldthatgirl have become? Where would that girl be now?When we were living with Frank, my survival hinged on my ability to lie – confidently and without pause. I was an expert in a particular kind of balance, constantly weighing the consequences of saying the wrong thing to the wrong person. Because we lived entirely on Frank’s largesse, revealing even an innocent-seeming detail might cause my family to become homeless. That, or he might hurt me utterly, even end me.side by side photos: an old photo of a teenager and a man on sunloungers on a boat. treesLeft: A 12-year-old JoAnn and Frank on a cruise in the Caribbean. Right: Winter trees in Albany. Sarah Blesener for the GuardianFrank decided to put me and my younger brother John in charge of counting the money he’d stolen from the parish. Typically, my brother and I helped count and hide the money; we were young enough to fall for Frank making it a game. We loved stacking the coins, rolling them into holders, and filling the money sacks. Tossing the sacks over our shoulders, we’d strut around the basement pretending we were robbers. “Mental reservation,” Frank taught us, “is when lying is not a sin, because it protects the church.” He frequently quoted this convenient theology born in the Middle Ages.In my case, that theory held. I stayed quiet and loyal until, when I was eight years old, I didn’t. Mom was first in line to hear my truth – the truth she already knew.One day, after a fight with Mom about chores, I said: “I hate it here.” My boldness surprised me.“What’d you say?” I’d caught Mom off guard; I’d never talked back before.“I hate it here,” I answered matter-of-factly. “And I’m leaving. Never coming back.”“You think it’s better somewhere else?” Mom gave me a sideways look, laughed. “Go on then! Leave, you spoiled rotten brat.”I ran to my room. I closed the door hard and screamed, the loudest scream, high pitched and long, like a train’s whistle. I rummaged through my closet, looking for an overnight bag.Mom entered the room dramatically, as if she were on stage and had prepared her whole life for this moment. She held me by the shoulders and shook me until I was silent.I sat frozen on the bed, my overnight bag still empty. I had wanted her to say: “We’ll make him leave, not you.” Instead, she instructed my siblings to wait until she returned. She was taking me to her cousin’s house.I sat in the back seat of the Cadillac, with a small cloth pocketbook packed with a toothbrush, a comb, a purple headband, extra socks, and a dog-eared copy of Harriet the Spy wedged between my knees.We drove in silence, the road stretching ahead, empty and endless. The light turned red. Mom stared at me in the rearview mirror. Her look, like a slap, delivered a caustic sting. “Tell me he didn’t!” she said, and then whispered: “Did he?” Mom’s question hung in the air like a noose. I nodded yes.“Goddammit!” Mom yelled.Of course, Mom had already known the answer. Hadn’t she heard Frank leaving my room? Pretending she didn’t know hurt me more than anything Frank had ever done to me.View image in fullscreen‘I needed to believe that she had not forsaken me.’Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The GuardianThe light was still red, and I nodded yes again. Yes.The light turned green. We drove on to her cousin’s house. Mom’s punishment was sending me away to live with her.It was peaceful at Rosemary’s house. I went mute. Rosemary begged Mom to get me some help, so it was decided I would see a counselor, a psychiatrist that Frank knew – Dr Q, the same friend who had signed the loan for our house (I am withholding his name to spare his family). All our bills were in his name. Mom said I could tell him anything I wanted; I could even tell him about what Frank had done. He was our friend.Dr Q, who is long dead, was a handsome man who wore a smart tweed jacket with elbow patches. He sat next to me on his office’s couch. Sometimes, he said, men make mistakes.Looking back, I wonder why Dr Q didn’t report Frank’s “mistakes”.Week after week, we sat next to each other, me saying nothing. After six months of silent visits, I didn’t have to go any more. On the way home from my last session, Mom said I did well not cracking under pressure.In 2017, after three decades of silence, Mom suddenly began stalking me on Facebook, sending me prayer memes and cute pet videos. I’d heard from relatives that she lived with a new man and had recently been arrested for stealing from a casino she frequented.Social media is a lifeline for my work; I post updates about my writing, my funded projects, and the public health programming I work on. Many colleagues have become friends, and Facebook is where I socialize. Mom’s invasion infuriated me. I promptly blocked her.One day, while I was working on a deadline, my laptop wouldn’t save my work. I made the dreaded trip to the nearest Apple Store. “Wait there until your name is called,” said the greeter, pointing to a wooden cube at the back of the store. I sat and scrolled through my phone, squinting; I had forgotten my glasses in the rush.I heard a woman talking. “My phone won’t sync my photos.” The timbre of her voice made me look up. An old woman stood at one of the worktables. She had her back to me, her hand swaying by her thigh. She wore black sweatpants, socks and plastic beach sandals; her sweater was blue. She was stooped, frail, her hair dyed a burnt orange. I immediately rejected the notion that this could be Mom.I told myself: “Jo, you’re stressed. Take a deep breath – four in, four out.” When that didn’t work, I took six breaths in and four breaths out, as I learned to do in therapy.View image in fullscreenAn album made for JoAnn by her mother – one of the many boxes of photos and documentation she left behind.Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The GuardianMy name was called, and I followed the Apple guy to the Genius Bar.The tech glanced over my shoulder. The woman behind me was too close.Then – a touch. Not a tap, not a nudge. A claiming.“Are you Jo?” Mom asked.“Who are you,” I stated, not a question.“It’s me, Edie.” She looked directly at me, her faded blue eyes searching mine.“OK,” I said and turned back to the tech.And that was it.Mom turned away and walked right out of the store; my only chance to forgive her was gone. The softness I imagined I might feel towards mom was a childish wish. In reality, we were two women standing in the Apple Store, one still broken, and one partially mended.During the legal proceedings, we’d learned that Frank was frail, hard of hearing, and living in a nursing home. After divorcing Mom, he’d remarried a woman with an adult daughter who had a disability. I gasped audibly at that news; men like Frank never stop.What kind of frail was he, I wondered. By then, he was 91 years old. Yet I couldn’t stop imagining him outside of my house with a can of gasoline and a lighter.The next morning, our lawyer called. The processor confirmed Frank had been served at the nursing home. The next day, another call: Frank was dead. I only remember feeling relief for his stepdaughter.In November 2022, three years after my siblings and I filed suit against the church, our lawyers called with startling news. The church had agreed to a settlement. We’d won. I heard what the lawyers said, but I couldn’t believe it.Although I had been in the fight for nearly three decades and my main goal was accomplished, my unanswered questions about Mom drowned any feelings of satisfaction or, could I even dare say, pride.Survivor’s guilt has also made me question my estrangement. Should I have done more to save Mom from Frank?View image in fullscreen‘Trauma cannot be buried, even with our dead.’Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The GuardianOver the years, I have schooled myself in feminist literature, the history of atrocities within the Catholic church, and the effects of generational trauma. I have been trained at the best schools in the country, and I remain committed to a spiritual and public practice of compassion and kindness. Yet I still struggle to apply all I learned to her. Something keeps me back. But what?When I first cut ties with her, she’d held on like a scorned lover. She begged me to talk with her, left long, exhausting voicemails, and filled my mailbox with Hallmark greeting cards.After she died, it was her quest to win me back that haunted me. I reread her texts, replayed the scene at the Apple Store, and Googled her. I regretted not giving her a chance to speak to me, to hear her out one last time. What could she have said to make things better? Could I have forgiven her if she asked? Could she have ever been my mom again?Any psychologist will tell you trauma cannot be buried, even with our dead. It didn’t matter how far I had come or what I had achieved. Mom was still there in my doubts, confusion, shame and unrelenting suicidal ideation.Later, the lawyers asked my siblings and me what we wished to do with our mother’s family photos, which they’d collected for our trial. My brothers wanted nothing to do with the pictures. My sister wanted to build a bonfire and “burn them all”. I had to have them. All of our mother’s photos were about our life with Frank. But they were also about my life with Mom, the only scattered fragments that remained of her.The albums, and my past, have a room of their own in my home. Tucked away in a small closet, they still beckon me to open them and discover what is inside, what I might have missed.In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

The ribbon was made of steel, not silk. It was the width of a city street and 368 metres long, soaring skywards beside the long catwalk like very pretty scaffolding. The message: the house of Chanel is as tough as it is chic.New designer Matthieu Blazy is expected to take up his role next month, by which timeChanelwill have been without a creative lead for almost a year. This design vacuum poses a challenge for the house, but Chanel still has a star designer – albeit one who has been dead for 54 years.Coco herself, in suit and pearls and with a black ribbon trim on her shallow boater hat, is still the image that springs to mind first at the mention of the name Chanel, and this gives the house unrivalled staying power. The collections that have been produced by the leaderless design studio for the past year stay close to her codes. Like a good cheeseburger, the clothes are nonetheless satisfying for being predictable. Consumers never get bored of cheeseburgers.A celebrity crowd that included the actor Dakota Fanning, gathered to admire grenadine silk tweed suits in cream, lipstick red and classic black, that came matched with ribboned hats.There were crystal bows as jewellery, silk bows as blouse buttons, and a trompe l’œil ribbon snaking across a knitted dress. Pearls were supersized, with a single pearl the size of a tennis ball as the heel of a boot, and a string of pearls scaled up to be slung cross-body, with a hollow central pearl as a tiny bag.Sock boots, with shiny black patent toes sewn on to bow-trimmed lace socks, brought Chanel’s two-tone pump up to date, leaning into fashion’s current obsession with posh socks. The handbags that drive Chanel’s profits were an integral part of the show with a style for every look – from miniature versions the size of postage stamps to oversized laptop sacks.Prestige in fashion is about Oscar dresses and dazzling catwalk shows, but profits are dictated by sales of handbags, totes, wallets and sunglasses.Louis Vuittonis the biggest luxury house in the world, with a brand value estimated at $130bn (£100bn) last year, because it never forgets that the real point of dressing Emma Stone for the Oscars last week was to have her front row in Paris this week.The vibe at Louis Vuitton was the cinematic romance of train travel, in films from Casablanca to Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. Designer Nicolas Ghesquière has a way of wearing his references lightly, fusing imagination and nostalgia to create something entirely new.Devore velvet gowns with silk turbans spoke to the era of the Orient Express; slouchy knits and handkerchief hem skirts with chunky boots were more Interrail. Curvy dresses winked at Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot. There was a mini collaboration with Kraftwerk, with the album art for 1977’s TransEuropeExpress on the back of a pinstripe jumpsuit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Charity Rachelle/The GuardianAs mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, Randall Woodfin is trying to tackle a  murder epidemic.  He’s all too familiar with the pain of losing a loved one to violenceByOliver LaughlandTue 11 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 08.02 EDTShareIt was past midnight on 27 May 2012 when Randall Woodfin, an early-career public prosecutor, received a call about his older brother. “Ralph’s been shot,” he was told, abruptly. “You need to come.”He jumped in a car, and raced across the city of Birmingham,Alabama, running every red light along the way. He made it to the police perimeter. It was a block and a half from his grandmother’s old home, at a public-housing project in the city’s south, where the two brothers – eight years apart – had spent much of their childhood.Randall had idolised Ralph growing up. His older sibling had taught him about classic cars, hi-fi sound systems and early 90s hip-hop. But their lives had taken radically different paths. Randall had moved away from Birmingham for college, studying political science at Morehouse in Atlanta. He held longstanding political aspirations, and returned to their childhood city with a view to climbing the local power ladder. Ralph, on the other hand, had never left. He’d dropped out of high school and started dealing drugs. “A neighbourhood superstar,” as Randall refers to him. While their trajectories had taken different directions, they had remained close.The night before the shooting, they had sat together and watched Ralph’s daughter graduate from high school. The morning after, Randall told his brother he loved him over the phone. It was the last conversation they had.View image in fullscreenWoodfin with his older brother, Ralph.Standing at the police line, as flashing blue lights illuminated the dark, Randall could see his brother’s body underneath a sheet. As he rushed forward, a group of police officers held him back. “I was trying to get to him,” he recalls. “And I ended up breaking down, crying in one of their arms. I knew then that he was dead.”Ralph had been shot multiple times after a brief dispute over a botched drug deal. It was one of 72 murders in the city that year, part of a rise thatpropelledBirmingham towards a crisis that has left it withone of the highest homicide rates in the US.Woodfin called his father as he regained composure, and the family congregated at the crime scene. His mother collapsed in shock. “I had never seen her in a state like that before. She was overwhelmed,” he remembers. “And I was oscillating … somewhere between disbelief, grief and anger.”It was the anger that lingered longest. The grief was largely locked inside, Woodfin says. He looked away as Ralph’s coffin was lowered into the ground. He returned to work soon after and tried to bury the pain, expressing his anger in fiery exchanges in court. When the murder came to trial two years later, Woodfin sat in the benches watching his brother’s killer exhibit little remorse.“I looked at him,” he recalls, taking a long pause as he relives the memory over Zoom from his office in Birmingham. “And it took restraint not to jump over the table and punch him in his face.” When the guilty verdict came, he felt “small relief” but it also underscored the futility of it all. “In the scheme of things it doesn’t repair the big-ass hole in your heart,” he says.It was around this time that Woodfin entered electoral politics, successfully running for the Birmingham city school board shortly after the trial concluded. He had not viewed his brother’s murder in the context of gun control or public policy. “I couldn’t connect any work or politics to it,” he says. “It was just the unfortunate feeling of, ‘Damn. This is how it feels when somebody takes your loved one away.’ There is so much grief in this city from loved ones being snatched by gun violence.”Two years later, Woodfin’s ambitions moved to the city’s top job and he announced his candidacy for mayor, aiming to unseat a long-term incumbent named William Bell. It was a bruising campaign season and Woodfin leaned into his progressive values, his youth (he was 36 years old) and his personal experience.In 2017, the year of the election, homicides in Birmingham continued to surge: 117 people were killed in a city of 200,000 residents. Woodfin found himself speaking about the loss of his brother as he campaigned, pledging to revitalise the city and reduce the bloodshed. He targeted younger and first-time voters.In August of that year, as the election loomed and he drove towards Atlanta for a fundraising event, Woodfin received another frantic phone call. His nephew, Ralph’s son, Ralph Jr, had been shot. He veered off the highway and headed back towards the crime scene. On the way, he received a second call: Ralph Jr was dead.His nephew had only just turned 18. His life had followed a similar trajectory to his father’s. He had dropped out of school early, got involved in street crime, and developed an obsession with firearms – regularly posting photographs of himself holding guns on social media.Woodfin arrived at the police perimeter and walked towards the attending detective, who presented him with a photograph taken on a mobile phone. “Is this your nephew?” the detective asked. Woodfin recalls the identification image with haunting clarity. “I see a bullet hole in his head. His eyes are closed. It was at that moment I thought: ‘Shit, here we go again.’”It was less than two weeks from the election, and Woodfin felt the need to bury his grief once more. “I literally got right back into the campaign thing,” he says. “I faked it. That’s just the truth. I didn’t show my anger, my hurt, my disbelief to anybody. I kept working. I kept campaigning.”It was partly the public pressure, but around family, too, he shut down and felt his late brother’s absence acutely. “I second-guessed myself,” he says. “Was there something I was supposed to do in lieu of my brother not being here, something that I could have done better, where my nephew didn’t end up getting killed?”The election went to a runoff and Woodfin won comfortably. He is now the youngest mayor in this historic, Deep South city in more than a century. His campaign had drawn significant funding from progressives outside Birmingham, and endorsements from household names such as Bernie Sanders. He entered office witha growing national profileand vowed to push reform to lower the city’s murder epidemic.In 2019, Birmingham was among thefirst cities in the USto declaregun violence a public health crisis, a strategy that encourages a holistic approach to tackling the issue by integrating community and public campaigning alongside traditional law enforcement efforts. At a press conference announcing the move, Woodfin appeared with a group of mothers who had lost children during shootings.Privately, Woodfin was enduring a crisis of his own. As he approached his 39th birthday, the age of his brother when he was killed, the new mayor remained preoccupied by the loss. “I started freaking out,” he recalls. “I got genuinely scared of where I was in my life, where I was supposed to be. WillIlive past 39?”Ralph appeared to him vividly in dreams. “I’d see how crazy his hair looked. I would hear his voice. I would see him smile.” In one dream, after he and his brother hugged, Woodfin was jolted awake by his wife as he wept uncontrollably. “It was so real seeing him.”It was around then, seven years after Ralph’s murder, that that Woodfin sought therapy for the first time. He began to realise that he had not properly grieved – he had been suppressing and ignoring the profound sorrow in a bid to appear strong. He visited his brother’s grave for the first time. “I never properly said goodbye,” he says. “I told him I loved him. I gave him the proper respect as my big brother. It was hard as hell.”The gun violence epidemic has continued to intensify in Birmingham. Last year the city saw 151 homicides,its deadliest on record. The figure bucks adownward national murder rate, and is inseparable from the persistentlyhigh poverty rateand struggling school system in the city.View image in fullscreenWoodfin with Kamala Harris at the White House in 2024, during an event on gun violence.Photograph: Susan Walsh/APWoodfin has lost track of the number of grieving mothers he has tried to console since assuming office. The conversations are often excruciating. “I only have to think of my own mom,” he says. “I’m the other son that lived, andIdon’t even know what to say to my own mother sometimes.” Often he just asks for stories. “Tell me more about your child,” he says. “It doesn’t matter how old they are when they’re snatched from them. That grief is unbearable.”He recently became a father himself. The experience has given his gun-safety advocacy an even sharper focus, he says. His administration, which haslimited municipal power, has pushed the Republican state government for commonsense gun reform, includingcurbing the saleof assault rifles andoutlawingrapid-fire modifications to handguns. But little has come of it so far.In 2024, he launched a program named Project Safe Streets, whichincluded the placement of concrete roadblocksin certain neighbourhoods in an attempt to deter drive-by shootings. He has faced criticism from political opponents over staff shortages in the police department.In a recentvideo addressto the city, Woodfin recalled the story of his brother appearing to him in dreams, as he sat at a table surrounded by dozens of guns seized by police after shooting incidents. “Laws, policing, can’t stop all of this,” he said. “No superman is coming to save Birmingham.” In the same address, he implored those who witness gun crime to come forward and help authorities: “We shouldn’t have to beg the community when an innocent child is killed.”Woodfin is frank about the cultural and historic forces he sees exacerbating the crisis in his city. “America promotes and celebrates violence,” he says. “It’s in our video games. It’s in our music. It’s on our TV. It’s in our conversations. It’s on social media.” But he argues that Birmingham, oncethe focal point of the civil rights movementand the centre ofbombings and lynchings during Jim Crow, has endured a unique history that should not be viewed separately from its contemporary struggles.“I think lynchings became a part of Birmingham’s culture, and it was tolerated,” he says. “People wore two uniforms: police in the daytime and [Ku Klux Klan] robes over their heads at night. I thinkbombingsbecame a part of the culture in Birmingham, and, as bad as it was, the police didn’t investigate.“When you get granular and deeper into Birmingham’s culture, violence is so embedded. We’ve got to break it up.”We are speaking just weeks into the second Trump administration, which has already signalled its intent to legally target Democratic jurisdictions it decides are out of compliance with its political agenda. Last month, Trump’s new attorney general, Pam Bondi,announced a lawsuitagainst the state of New York over its immigration policies. Throughout his political career Trump,firmly backed by the National Rifle Association, has lambasted Democratic cities enduring gun violence.Woodfin – who faces re-election this year – argues that now, of all times, leaders in the Democratic party, at all levels of government, should be pushing back vocally. “We are living in a time where some want people to be cowards and afraid, but that is the most opportune time to stand up,” he says. “What’s the point of having the job if you don’t speak up for the people you represent?”Woodfin’s life experiences have given him that courage to stand up, it could be said, but part of that process has also been learning to articulate his vulnerability, he says. He acknowledges the conversation we are having today would not have been possible only a few years before.“Those who are comfortable with their vulnerability can be a better version of themselves.”Explore more on these topicsHow we surviveUS gun controlAlabamafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The iPhone 16e costs £599 (€699/$599/A$999) and is the spiritual successor to theiPhone SE line. Where the iPhone SE still had the old-school chunky design with home button, the 16e has the body of the iPhone 14 with the chips of the £799 iPhone 16.That means the 16e has an all-screen design and aluminium body. It was great forthe iPhone 14and still is good today. The phone is light and relatively compact. The 6.1in OLED screen is good and big enough for most uses, but isn’t as bright as that on thestandard iPhone 16.View image in fullscreenThe 16e has the old-style Face ID notch at the top of the screen rather than the newer “Dynamic Island” used in the rest of the recent iPhone line up.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 16e is only available in black or white, and while it has the handy action button that replaced the mute switch of older iPhones, it doesn’t have the camera control button from therest of the iPhone 16 line.The whole of the 16e has these little compromises from the standard iPhone 16 experience. It has a new more power-efficient Apple 5G modem – a first for an iPhone – but only has wifi 6 not the latest wifi 7. The 16e also lacksThreadand Ultra Wideband radios, the latter of which is used for Apple’sprecision finding of lost itemsand other systems.View image in fullscreenThe action button replaces the mute switch from older iPhones and can be used to turn on the torch, launch the camera or various other features.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianEven the 16e’s A18 chip is slightly inferior to that used in the regular iPhone 16, lacking some graphics power and performing a little slower overall. It is still a very snappy chip, however.The phone has wireless charging, but lacks Apple’s excellent MagSafe magnetic attachment technology on the back that has been aniPhone staple since 2020. MagSafe enables a range of magnetic accessories, from wallets and phone grips to car phone mounts and chargers, none of which work with the 16e, making it a very odd omission.Whether all these small minuses matter depends on your usage, whether your family has accessories that use MagSafe, wifi 7 at home or a bunch of Apple’s AirTags. But at least the 16e has great battery life lasting a solid 52 hours of general usage between charges across a range of conditions – four hours longer than the regular iPhone 16. That means needing to plug it in every two days or every other day with heavy usage.View image in fullscreenThe 16e has a range of Apple Intelligence features, including the new visual intelligence system using the camera to identify objects, but most of them are not terribly compelling.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (460ppi)Processor:Apple A18RAM:8GBStorage:128, 256 or 512GBOperating system:iOS 18Camera:48MP rear; 12MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Satellite and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)Dimensions:146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8mmWeight:167gSustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16e charges to 50% in 26 minutes and hits full power in 96 minutes using a 20W or higher USB-C power adapter (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the batteryshould last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can bereplaced for £95. Out-of-warrantyscreen repairs cost £225. The 16e has repair guides available and was awardedseven out of 10 for repairabilityby specialists iFixit.It contains more than 30% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is the same as other iPhones, but lacks a 0.5x zoom, macrophotography and some more advanced features.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne feature that has been cut which makes more of a difference is in the camera department: the 16e only has one 48MP camera on the back, not the two or three present on other iPhones.The single main camera can manage a 2x in sensor zoom for a form of telephoto shots, but there is no ultrawide camera. Most of the time I didn’t miss it terribly as the main camera shoots great images across a range of lighting conditions. But on occasions where you can’t step back, you can no longer get the shot.Its portrait mode is slightly less effective, while a lack of a macrophotography mode and the new advanced photographic styles from the main iPhone 16 is a shame. It has the same 12-megapixel selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone line up.Overall the camera is solid, but if you’re at all interested in photography the 16e isn’t the model for you.PriceThe iPhone 16e costs from£599(€699/$599/A$999) with 128GB of storage.For comparison, theiPhone 16costs£799, theiPhone 16 Pluscosts£899,iPhone 16 Procosts£999, theiPhone 16 Pro Maxcosts£1,199, theGoogle Pixel 8acosts£499and the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE costs£549.VerdictThe iPhone 16e is a solid phone that offers most of the core iPhone experience with a few things left out for a lower cost.Many of these things, such as slower wifi, a slightly less powerful chip, no camera control button and an older-style notch probably don’t matter much to most people. But the lack of MagSafe and only a single camera on the back may be deal breakers for some.The advantage the 16e has over the iPhone 15 and older, cheaper models still available from third-party retailers is the Apple Intelligence features, some of which are useful but many are underwhelming or bettered by third-party apps.The biggest problem with the 16e is its price. Though it costs about 25% less than a regular iPhone 16, £599 is still very much at the premium end of the market. That makes the 16e only a sensible choice for someone who wants the absolute cheapest new iPhone available and won’t settle for anything else. For everyone else there are better models to be had either new from third-party retailers or refurbished.Pros:fast, decent screen, great size, action button, USB-C, great battery life, long software support, Face ID, Apple Intelligence.Cons:single camera only and no macro mode, no camera control button, old-style screen design, no MagSafe, no wifi 7, no Thread or UWB, AI features hit and miss, still expensive.Explore more on these topicsiPhoneAppleSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

However, groups documenting the killings have challenged this claim, alleging the police regularly falsified evidence, including by planting drugs and guns at the scene. Witnesses frequently stated that victims were unarmed and did not pose a threat. The type of wounds sustained by victims also contradicted police claims:many were shot multiple times,and in some cases in their backs or the back of their heads.Duterte has been arrested on a warrant issued by the international criminal court, after being investigated for crimes against humanity over the killings. He has been accused of encouraging and even incentivising the killings, and allowing police to act with impunity.After taking office, Duterte publicly stated that he wouldkill suspected drug dealers and urged the public to kill addicts. Even as the killings prompted international alarm, Duterte remained committed to the campaign, saying “many will die, plenty will be killed until the last pusher is out of the streets”.It has been alleged in parliamentary committee hearings in November thatDuterte’s office paid officers up to 1m pesos (£13,200) per killingduring the crackdowns, depending upon the target.He has denied that such payments were made, or that he authorised extrajudicial killings. However, he has admitted to maintaining adeath squad of criminalsto kill other criminals while serving as a mayor.Duterte told a senate hearing in October that he took “full legal responsibility” for the crackdown.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesIn 30 secondsRodrigo DuterteAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

Trump could end that legacyTrump is expected to privatize the USPS, where Black people make up 29% of the staff, and cut down on the number of jobsGloria OladipoTue 11 Mar 2025 09.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 13.37 EDTShareIn recent weeks, the fate of theUnited States Postal Service (USPS), a revered and vital public institution, has beenuncertain. Since the start of his second presidency,Donald Trumphas launched major changes to the federal government. Along with billionaireElon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), the president has carried out widespread layoffs at agencies such as the Small Business Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with the purported goal of cutting costs and boosting efficiency. Now, Trump is turning his focus to the post office, an agency he has long been critical of and one thathe may be privatizing.In addition to delivering upwards of 343.5m pieces of mail and packages a day, the post office is responsible for administering official government forms such as passport applications, and providing banking services, such as money orders. As of 2025, it employs 640,000 people. Black people, in particular, make up 29% of its staff,while making up just 12% of the national workforceoverall.The Washington Postfirst reportedthat Trump is expected to take control of the USPS, likely signing an executive order in the coming weeks to place the independent agency under the Commerce department. With privatization, Trump would probably curtail postal services, said Arrion Brown, the national support services director for the American Postal Workers Union. “The privatization definitely would require less employees,” he said. “That would cut down on the number of postal jobs.”Trump’s potential plans for the USPS could threaten the agency’s rich legacy of Black employment, from which generations of Black families have secured wealth and benefits through service. “The postal service workforce is more diverse racially [and] ethnically than the labor force in this country as a whole,” said Brian Renfroe, the national president of the National Association of Letter Carriers.The gains in the post office with regards to diversity aren’t accidental. One reason for the high rate of Black employment at the postal office is because the USPS recruits veterans, a large percentage of whom are Black, said Monique Morrissey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “They’re vetted and they’re trustworthy,” said Morrissey of veterans. “You don’t want somebody messing with mail. The consequences are harsh if somebody does that.”Because of federal protections, the post office, like other federal agencies, also has less discrimination in hiring compared to private sector employment. Anti-discrimination language in USPS’s collective bargaining agreements promotes employee diversity, said Renfroe. “Hundreds of thousands of good middle-class jobs have been offered to people all over the country, without regard to race or any other demographic [information]”.View image in fullscreenA postal worker sorts mail circa 1955.Photograph: FPG/Getty ImagesIncreased access to postal service employment means that Black families can access solid benefits, especially as generations have been “blocked from other ways of creating wealth”, said Morrissey. “The benefits matter a lot to African American communities because of historical barriers to wealth creation and access to financial security through health benefits,” she said. USPS also pays relatively well compared to other jobs that do not require a college degree, Morrissey added, given training and trust required for the job. USPS also has union-protected pay increases based on how long a person has been employed with the post office, Renfroe noted. “It’s a place to really make a solid middle class career,” he said. “When we talk about collective bargaining rights being attacked, we’re talking about people’s ability to have a middle class career.”Diversity in the postal service is also a direct result of “geographic diversity”, said Renfroe. Many of the more than 33,000 post offices in the US are “heavily concentrated in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other urban areas”, regions where Black people are more likely to live and be employed from.The wealth building relationship between Black Americans and the postal service dates back to the 19th century, says Phillip Rubio, a history professor at North Carolina A&T State University. In 1865, Congress passed a law allowing Black people to be employed as postal workers, reversing an 1802 bill that previously declared that mail carriers could only be “free white persons”. Formerly enslaved people then started “taking advantage of what was a patronage job”, said Rubio, who’s an expert on Black postal workers. “The way the postal service opens up to African Americans is [that] they open the door,” he said, adding: “The post office [was] attractive when so many private sector jobs were closed to [Black people].”Black people who were already employed by the post office began helping other Black folks obtain jobs, including studying with them for the postal exam. In 1872, Congress revoked the Freedman’s Bureau Act, which provided labor contracts between freed Black people and landowners. With those opportunities gone, “[the postal office] becomes a means of wealth accumulation and transfer,” said Rubio, particularly for Black people in the south. “It becomes a means of higher education for them and their families, also for their children, [and] becomes an avenue to home ownership,” he said. Black people moving north during the great migration also found work at northern post offices in urban cities.View image in fullscreenA postal worker delivers mail on Chicago’s South side in 1973.Photograph: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesIn the 1940s, 14% of middle-class Black people were employed by the post office, according to research by the economists Leah Boustan and Robert Margo. Even still, Black employees were largely denied workplace advancement, including for clerk positions and other higher-ranking roles. Black postal workers, particularly in the south, fought to get into local unions and keep local branches from being segregated.The civil rights movement of the 1960s contributed to improved conditions for Black people in the postal service. President John F Kennedy’s Executive Order 10925 prohibited discrimination in the hiring of federal employees, with USPS offices across the country posting Equal Employment Opportunity posters and notices where employees could submit complaints. Black postal employees were also promoted to higher ranking jobs and elected to local and national leadership positions. From 1960 to 1966, USPS was thelargest employer of Black peoplein the US, and by 1970, Black people were 2.5 times more likely to work for the post office than white people (the rate is higher in especially segregated cities). By the year 2000, Black postal employees workers were also in the top 25% of earners of Black workers in the US.US Postal Service faces murky future as Trump mulls dismantling institutionRead moreToday, the postal office’s legacy of diversity and equity are under threat. The tradition of career-long employment, where postal workers remain in service for several decades, could be eliminated as jobs across the board are slashed under privatisation. A reduction in jobs would mean “less middle, good paying, benefit jobs in Black communities”, said Brown, where several distribution centers are concentrated. Trump’s plans could rollback achievements for workers, specifically hard-fought benefits. “Lower wage, non-career employees” could be drafted into service, said Morrissey, versus workers with a long-term interest in postal service.The ability to negotiate a contract is also a critical feature of the post office employment that could be eliminated, especially given Trump’santi-union actions. The current postmaster general Louis DeJoy recently announced that he would be stepping down, which could result in Trump appointing a postmaster general who “refuses to recognize collective bargaining rights, either in part or in whole”, said Renfroe. The agreement was a direct result of the 1970 postal strike, an eight-day, nationwide demonstration involving 200,000 workers who fought against low wages. Referring to a rollback of union protections, Renfroe warned: “We have to be prepared for any attacks.”Ultimately, such changes would not only affect the practicality and efficiency of the post office, and its benefits to millions of Americans, but specifically Black families, who’ve long depended on the institution for upward financial mobility. With privatization a likely outcome, Brown said, “We couldn’t make the argument in the Black community that postal jobs are safe, good, reliable jobs in the future.”Explore more on these topicsUS Postal ServiceRaceDonald TrumpBlack US cultureTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jessie Hoffman. Aaron Gunches. Wendell Grissom. Edward Thomas James. Moises Sandoval Mendoza.So many names. So many dead men walking. Ten days, five states, six death row prisoners scheduled for execution.For a decade now,capital punishmentin the US has been on the wane. Last year, for the10th year running, there were fewer than 30 executions in America, and the number of new death sentences is also tracking at historic lows.And yet. Among the rump of death penalty states – “killing states”, as detractors call them – the desire to keep on going seems to burn stronger every year.Some state corrections departments are firing up their death chambers after decades of leaving them mothballed. Others are turning to new experimental execution methods such as nitrogen gas, or reviving long-discarded techniques – on Friday, South Carolina carried out the firstfiring squadexecution in the US for 15 years.View image in fullscreenViewing chairs in the witness room of the execution chamber in the Broad River correctional institute in Columbia, South Carolina.Photograph: APThe result is a landscape of capital punishment that is as riven as is the country as a whole. Across vast swathes, the practice is officially, or in effect, moribund. In pockets of the country, there is a frenzied scramble to get back into the death business.The syndrome was on dramatic display last September, when oversix days of horrorfive different states ended a life in the name of justice.On Thursday, the desolate spectacle begins again with another flurry of scheduled executions packed into 10 short days. Texas,Louisiana, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida, then Texas again.“These states will go to any length – pass secrecy laws, introduce new execution methods, bypass public scrutiny,” said Samantha Kennedy of the Promise of Justice Initiative, a New Orleans-based group that fights the inequities of the criminal justice system. Louisiana is preparing to carry out its first execution in 15 years.“By hook or by crook,” she said, “they are determined to kill people.”The latest killing spree begins, as it ends, inTexas. The Lone Star state has traditionally been the death penalty capital of the US, its fondness for judicial killings reaching a peak in 2000 when it put to death 40 people that year alone.By last year that number had fallen to five. But as Kristin Houlé Cuellar, executive director of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty,TCADP, explained, the will is still there.“Texas stubbornly remains among the handful of states that is still regularly executing, and doing so in cases where grave concerns persist,” she said.Barring last-minute legal challenges, David Leonard Wood will be killed by lethal injection in the Huntsville Unit after 5pm local time on Thursday. The crimes he has been found guilty of are numerous and profoundly shocking.View image in fullscreenDavid Leonard Wood on death row in Huntsville, Texas.Photograph: Mike Graczyk/APSix teenaged girls and young women were murdered and buried in shallow graves in the desert around El Paso by a serial killer who came to be known as the “desert killer”. Wood has always insisted he is innocent, claiming the state got the wrong man.Wood’s lawyers have pressed for DNA evidence to be tested on more than 100 items of crime-scene evidence, but the Texas attorney general has for over a decade consistently rebuffed the request. As a result, the prisoner will be executed on the basis of circumstantial evidence alone.TheTexas Observerhas reported evidence that one of the key witnesses at his trial was encouraged to testify against Wood with promises of a $25,000 reward. The witness was, according to a cellmate, fed incriminating details about Wood from detectives’ own files.For Cuellar, the questions surrounding Wood’s prosecution point to a wider ongoing crisis in capital punishment in Texas. Like most of the 178 people on Texas’s death row, Wood was put there for crimes committed decades ago at the height of the moral panic around drugs and violent crime.The issues raised in Wood’s case, including convictions rammed through despite the lack of forensic evidence, massaging of witnesses, and other dubious prosecutorial actions, were commonplace in the 1980s and 1990s. Elected officials competed with each other to convince voters that they were the toughest on crime.An Innocence Project study of Texas in the early 2000s found91 casesof prosecutorial misconduct, ranging from hiding evidence to misleading the jury. Not one of the prosecutors involved had been disciplined.“In that rush to judgment, that rush to fill death row, corners were cut. Fast forward decades later, when people are set for execution, the flaws and failures in their cases are on stark display,” she said.In Wood’s case, the murders for which he was convicted occurred in 1987, almost 40 years ago. Should he die on Thursday, it will be more than 32 years after he landed on death row.The other five men facing execution tell a similar story. Their crimes were committed, in order of their execution dates, 29, 23, 20, 30, and 19 years ago.Such an agonisingly prolonged process takes its toll on many people: the death row inmates themselves living under the shadow of execution, the guards who secure and care for them, the American taxpayers who pay for what is by far the most expensive part of the US criminal justice system. And then there are the families of the victims.“What I hate most is the way that victims’ families are used to justify it,” said Sister Helen Prejean. “I’ve watched too many families wait all these years, and at the end of it all they are given a front row seat as the state kills the one who killed their loved one. They watch that violence, and it’s supposed to give them peace. That’s morally bankrupt. It’s rotten to the core.”Prejean, a Catholic nun, is the most celebrated face of the death penalty abolitionist movement. Her memoir about being spiritual adviser to two death row inmates, Dead Man Walking, was made into the 1995 movie of the same name.Prejean told the Guardian that in her analysis the upcoming spate of six executions in 10 days could be explained by three pillars of the death penalty. The first was slavery.View image in fullscreenSister Helen Prejean comforts one of the death row inmates she is accompanying to his execution in 1996 in Angola, Louisiana.Photograph: Brooks Kraft/Sygma/Getty ImagesOf the five states about to carry out executions, all were part of the confederacy (in Arizona’s case as a then territory). “Under the black codes in the deep south states, a Black man could steal an apple and be hanged, and that attitude is still very much present in the death penalty.”Prejean’s two other pillars propping up the system are the variety of evangelical religion prevalent in death penalty states – “deep south Christianity is a John Wayne Jesus who believes in solving things with violence” – and endemic poverty. She believes those three factors – slavery, religion, poverty – have recently all combined to generate a fourth pillar that is coming to capital punishment’s rescue.“They set up a culture in which a strong man, a politician, can come along and say, ‘We’re going to execute people to show we’re really tough on crime’.”Is she saying there is a connection between the rump revival of the death penalty andDonald Trump?“Absolutely. There’s a mood. Look at the mood in the country. Violence solves social problems – that’s Trump all the way. And other politicians look at him and realize, hey, he got elected, and they start to ape him. And so far, they’re getting away with it.”Kennedy also sees Trump as a player behind the partial resurgence of executions. She points to the13 federal death-row prisonerskilled under Trump at the end of his first administration – the most intense burst of judicial killings under any president in 120 years.“That killing spree in Trump’s first term set a tone for the acceptability of gratuitous violence,” she said.Kennedy and Prejean are both from Louisiana, the state which is scheduled to carry out the second execution in the upcoming 10-day spate. If it goes ahead, it will be Louisiana’s first use of the death chamber since 2010.Jessie Hoffman, who is Black, is set to die on 18 March for the rape and murder of Mary Elliott in 1996. The chronology behind the scheduled execution is interesting.On 20 January, on Trump’s first day back in the Oval Office, he issued an executive order titled “Restoring the death penalty”. Three weeks later, Trump attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans where hesat besideJeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana.The next day, 10 February, Landry announced his decision to restart executions after a hiatus of 15 years.View image in fullscreenPrison cells inside the Louisiana state penitentiary, also known as Angola.Photograph: Giles Clarke/Getty ImagesThere are several other striking aspects to Hoffman’s pending execution. He was 18 and two months old when he committed his gruesome crime.He was found guilty of first-degree murder at trial and sent to death row. Had he been 60 days younger he would have been shielded from a death sentence as a juvenile.“He harmed people in ways that are probably everlasting,” Kennedy said. “And what he did with his time since then is that he grew up. He has spent decades reflecting, has been a devout Buddhist for many years, has expressed deep remorse. He’s transformed.”Should the execution go ahead, Hoffman, 47, will be forcibly gassed with nitrogen, an experimental process that has only previously been used four times, all in the state of Alabama. Witnesses to those nitrogen deaths reporteddistressing scenesof prisoners shaking and convulsing on the gurney.“These gassing executions are suffocations. The person suffocates, so they struggle, they panic. It is arduous and cruel,” Kennedy said.The Trump-infused wave of renewed activity is not confined to deep red states like Louisiana. The third execution in the upcoming 10-day spree is in the purple state of Arizona, under the auspices of the Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs.View image in fullscreenAaron Gunches, who was convicted of murder in the 2002 killing of Ted Price in Arizona.Photograph: APAaron Gunches is a “volunteer”, meaning that he is not resisting execution and in effect wants the state to kill him. He was sentenced to death for the 2003 murder of his girlfriend’s former husband, Ted Price.Arizona has a pained relationship with the death penalty. In 2011 it was exposed as having procured lethal injection drugs from a pharma company operating out of adriving schoolin west London; four years later it was revealed to have gone even further, to India where it spent $27,000 on vials of sodium thiopental.In 2023 Hobbs halted all executions andordered a reviewof the entire death process following a spate of three horribly botched killings the year before. She commissioned a retired federal magistrate judge, David Duncan, to carry out the probe in a rare instance of a death penalty state allowing an independent outside inspection of its methods.Duncan said that in the course of his investigation he came across some alarming findings. “I saw things such as, on the eve of an execution, a superior telling a member of the execution team to use Wikipedia to check the dosage of the lethal drugs.”He also looked into the refrigerator where eight vials of pentobarbital were being stored. “The jars were completely unmarked, not a single letter on any of them. It could have been my mother’s minestrone soup. I said to the official, ‘Do you think your high-school chemistry teacher would have allowed you back in the chem lab ever again if you left things unlabelled like that?’”Duncan pored over thousands of documents and confirmed the fact, first reported bythe Guardian, that in 2021 the state spent $1.5m obtaining supplies of lethal injection drugs. He also discovered that the physician and assistant who had been present at the three botched executions in 2022 were each paid $60,000 in cash for the privilege.With all that under his belt, it might have been assumed that Duncan would have been encouraged to complete his report, so that Arizona’s troubled system could be cleaned up.

Will this incoherent coalition hold?Carter ShermanTue 11 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 13.58 EDTShareIn his first address to the United States after becoming vice-president,JD Vancestood on stage and proclaimed: “I want more babies in the United States of America.” Weeks later,Donald Trump signed an executive orderpledging support for in vitro fertilization, recognizing “the importance of family formation and that our nation’s public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children”.In late January, aDepartment of Transportation memodirected the agency to prioritize projects that “give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average”. And last week, it was reported thatElon Musk, the unelected head of the government-demolishing “department of governmental efficiency” and a man who has said that the “collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far”, hadbecome a father of 14.Republicans have long heralded the importance of “family values”. But in these developments, many see mountingsigns of a controversial ideology at work: pronatalism.America’s premier pronatalists on having ‘tons of kids’ to save the world: ‘There are going to be countries of old people starving to death’Read morePronatalism is so contentious that people often struggle to agree on a definition. Pronatalism could be defined as the belief that having children is good. It could also be defined as the belief that having children is important to thegreatergood and that people should have babies on behalf of the state, because declining birth rates are a threat to its future. Perhaps most importantly, pronatalism could be defined as the belief that government policy should incentivize people to give birth.While people on the left might agree with some pronatalist priorities, pronatalism in the US istodayascendant on the right. It has become a key ideological plank in the bridge between tech bro rightwingers like Musk and more traditional, religious conservatives, like the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson – whoonce said in a House hearingthat abortions were harming the economy by eliminating would-be workers.But there are plenty of widening cracks in that bridge and, by extension, Trump’s incoherent coalition.‘Hipster eugenicists’In the US, interest in pronatalism has historically coincided with growing anxiety over changing gender norms and demographics, according to Laura Lovett, a University of Pittsburgh history professor and the author of the book Conceiving the Future: Pronatalism,Reproduction, and the Family in the United States, 1890-1930. In the 1920s, pronatalism’s prominence grew after women gained the right to vote, as people worried about women working and wielding power outside the home.“When Theodore Roosevelt uses the term ‘race suicide’, he actually blames women who are going to college for the first time for that eventual suicide of the right, white race. There’s this linkage between women’s educational and aspirational futures and the declining birth rate,” Lovett said. “There was this anxiety that white, native-born, middle-class women were having smaller families.”Historically, US pronatalism was also tied to an interest in eugenics – andsome of the more tech-minded, modern-day pronatalists do want to use breeding to fashion a better human race.Malcolm and Simone Collins, parents of four who have become standard-bearers for the burgeoning popularity of pronatalism among Silicon Valley venture capitalists, havechampioned “no-holds-barred” medical researchto engineer the “mass production of genetically selected humans”. They havejoked to Business Insiderabout making business cards declaring themselves “hipster eugenicists” – although they have also rejected the idea that they are performing eugenics, stressing thatthey think racism is “so dumb”and that the only bloodlines they are altering are their own.The Collinses, who support Trump, have spenthundreds of thousands of dollarson in vitro fertilization (IVF) and screening their embryos for IQ, risk of depression and other markers. (Scientists aren’t convinced that it is possible to screen embryos for IQ.) These kinds of practices – which the Collins have called “polygenics” – draw a wedge between the Silicon Valley pronatalists who back Trump and his more traditional pronatalist supporters. The anti-abortion movement, which was critical to getting Trump elected in 2016, has long opposed IVF, largely because it can lead to unused or discarded embryos.In signing his pro-IVF executive order, Trump appears to be siding with the “tech right” (and the broader electorate, among which IVF remains extremely popular). When Musk recently brought his son X Æ A-Xii to the Oval Office, Trump called the four-year-old a “high-IQ individual”.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and his son X Æ A-Xii with Trump.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/Shutterstock‘Restructuring society’While the Collinses are avatars for the emerging pronatalist tech right, Lyman Stone is one of the highest-profile pronatalists from a more traditionally conservative background.“Pronatalism has to be disciplined by a commitment to human liberty and human flourishing – and this is coming out of work on reproductive justice, basically. People have a right to have the families they want to have, and for some people, that means no family,” said Stone, a demographer who in 2024 established the Pronatalism Initiative at the right-leaning Institute for Family Studies. “The focus of pronatalism, in my view, generally is not and certainly should not be on family gigantism, and instead should be on helping young people overcome the barriers and obstacles to romantic and family success in their life.”In practice, Stone said, pronatalists should help people get married earlier in life so that they can start having children younger. That could mean, he said, everything from improving mental health services to creating better childcare programs. Stone’s frequent collaborator, Brad Wilcox – a University of Virginia sociology professor and author of the book Get Married: Why Americans Should Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families and Save Civilization – pointed to several policies that he thinks would help strengthen “family formation”, such as expanding the child tax credit and converting federal land into affordable housing.“Pronatalism is not just a fiscal program. It’s a program of restructuring society in a way that treats family goals as worthy, worth supporting and socially important,” Stone said.Asked if he supports abortion rights, Stone clarified: “No, I would draw the line at destruction of human life.”Many of these policy proposals could comfortably fit into a left-leaning political platform – in fact, they may be more at home on such a platform than within today’s Republican party. Although Vance said on the campaign trail that he would like toexpand the child tax credit, a move that could cost trillions of dollars in federal spending, Republicans have instead committed toslashing the government budgetby at least $1.5tn.Instead, elected Republicans have tended to invoke pronatalist rhetoric in support of their top culture-war causes.They have repeatedly condemned gender-affirming healthcare forallegedly “sterilizing” people; in 2022, as Idaho weighed whether to ban kids from accessing the care,one Republican state legislator said: “We are not talking about the life of the child, but we are talking about the potential to give life to another generation.” When a Republican lawmaker from Michigan introduced a resolution to condemn same-sex marriage,he told reporters: “This is a biological necessity to preserve and grow our human race.” And last year, in a lawsuit to cut access to a common abortion pill, the Republican attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri argued that access to the pill had “lowered birth rates for teen mothers”, leading to a falling state populations, “diminishment of political representation and loss of federal funds”.In practice, pronatalism – especially when paired with anti-abortion policy – often overlooks the disproportionate effect that having more babies has on women, according to Elizabeth Gregory, director of women’s gender and sexuality studies at the University of Houston. Childbearing can reshape a woman’s entire future.“This idea that the child is the only person in the dyad loses a real understanding of how embedded and dependent children are on their mothers,” Gregory said. “Fertility affects many, many parts of culture and talking about it can’t be reduced to just a few soundbites.”Falling birth ratesBirth rates are, indeed, on the decline. To remain stable, populations must reproduce at a “replacement rate” of 2.1; in other words, each mother must have 2.1 babies. The US currently averages closer to 1.6. (South Korea, which maintains the world’s lowest fertility rate,had a rate of just 0.75 in 2024.)Experts are split over how to address this problem. The world’s population is at a record high, and immigration to rich countries could offset declines in fertility – but, as the medical journalthe Lancet warned in a 2024 issue, “this approach will only work if there is a shift in current public and political attitudes towards immigration in many lower-fertility countries”. If countries remain hostile to immigration while their birth rates fall, they will probably end up with a shrunken labor force that is unable to support an ageing population.There is evidence that Americans wouldlike to have more children.A 2023 Gallup pollfound that 47% of Americans think an ideal family has one or two children, while only 2% said families should have zero. At the same time,a Pew poll that same yearfound that 47% of American adults under 50 say they are unlikely to ever have children. Of those, nearly 60% say they just don’t want kids. Nearly 40% said they couldn’t afford to have kids or that the “state of the world” had convinced them not to.“We’re living in a moment where – I would say, unfortunately – marriage and parenthood have become ideologically polarized,” Wilcox said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsReproductionReproductive rightsElon MuskDonald TrumpRepublicansChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They really need a lot of energy to get them through that brooding process.”Male octopuses have a specialised arm for mating – known as the hectocotylus – which transfers a sperm capsule into the female’s oviduct.Males have developed distinct strategies to avoid falling prey to their mates during copulation: the argonauts, for example, sacrifice their mating arm and let it drop off after mating. Other species have an elongated hectocotylus.“The blue-lined octopus’s mating arm is much shorter,” Chung said. “Unable to do long-distance mating, they need to do a mounting mating strategy.”The researchers observed male octopuses immobilising females during mating sessions that lasted between 40 and 75 minutes. As the tetrodotoxin took effect, the females stopped breathing after about eight minutes, turning pale and their pupils no longer responding to light.“Mating ended when the females regained control of their arms and pushed the males off,” the scientists noted.None of the females died during copulation, and they fed normally the following day, suggesting resistance to tetrodotoxin, Chung said.Envenomation by blue-lined octopuses can be deadly to humans;fatal caseshave also been documented in green sea turtles in Moreton Bay, who accidentally ingested the octopuses while eating seagrass.‘Superpod’ of more than 2,000 dolphins frolic off California coast: ‘Like flying eyebrows’Read moreBlue-lined octopuses, like most octopus species, exhibit semelparity, a breeding strategy in which an organism dies after it reproduces once. The males die soon after copulation, while the females die after their larvae hatch.Chung called the unusual mating technique in blue-lined octopuses an evolutionary “arms race” between the two sexes.“Because the females became much bigger and stronger … the male eventually needed to have a specific strategy to make sure his genes can be transferred to the next generation.”The research was published in the journalCurrent Biology.Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Illustration: Calum Heath/The GuardianEach year, hundreds of potentially world-changing treatments are discarded because scientists run out of cash. But where big pharma or altruists fear to tread, my friend and I have a solution. It’s repugnant, but it will workByAlexander MastersTue 11 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 11.16 EDTShareTwenty miles outside Geneva, beneath the towering magnificence of a mountain called the Rock of Hell, is a long, pleasant road that runs past the Brocher mansion. Set in acres of gentle lawns and specimen trees, on the edge of the medieval village of Hermance, it is a blissful place. My friend Dominic Nutt and I have been trying to break in for years.La Fondation Brocher is the world’s leading institute for research into “the ethical, social and legal implications of new medical developments”. It’s the bioethics equivalent of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton: only the admin staff and the cleaners are permanently employed here; academic fellowships last a maximum of four months. Billions of pounds’ worth of pharmaceuticals are influenced by the scholarly judgments that emerge from this idyllic lakeside building. Dom and I want to force entry because we’re advocates for patients, and we think we’ve solved a small corner of a major problem that’s holding back the discovery of new medicines. The trouble is, neither of us has a PhD – and in the rarefied world of academic medical ethics, that matters.We’ve never been to the Fondation Brocher, but we’ve cased the joint on Google Maps. Between the bars of the security gates, you can see the glittering waters of Lake Geneva, beside which professors and postgraduates stroll about debating what is best for the world’s sick. Misty in the distance are the northern Alps and the vineyards of the Jura.The problem we’ve solved is this: every year hundreds (perhaps thousands; nobody knows the real figure) of new, lab-tested drugs are abandoned. There’s often nothing obviously wrong with these potential medical treatments. In the laboratory, they have been shown to melt away tumours, make brain plaques disappear, puff up weakened bones with calcium, help mice and dogs live twice as long as usual. Of course, most of these treatments are likely to turn out to be useless (or even dangerous) in humans, but a few could save lives and ease the suffering of millions. We won’t know unless we do further research. But that research is not happening.The trouble is financial. According to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, the leading reason for drugs to fail human safety tests (the earliest phase of human experimentation) has nothing to do with whether or not the drugs are safe; it’s because the scientists run out of cash and so cannot complete the early tests and move on to the next phase. Of the few drugs that get through to later experiments, in which researchers are starting to look for efficacy, almost a further third are dropped for financial reasons, not because they’re ineffective. In the brutal language of the pharmaceutical industry, this gap between lab discovery and the start of the large-scale, late-phase human experiments is called the “valley of death”.The valley of death doesn’t cost much to cross. In many cases, between £2m and £5m is ample; without that money, no discovery stands a chance. £2m is the price of an Aston Martin Valiant. It’s what it costs to rent Richard Branson’s Necker Island for two and a half weeks. Thesolid gold toilet that those criminals stole from Blenheim Palacecould pay for it twice over.Industry and government policymakers are flummoxed by how to bridge the valley of death. There are only two broad ways to fund clinical trials: profit-making (venture capitalists, biotech, big pharma) or altruism (charities, government finance). For venture capitalists, the pressures of the market exclude ideas that require patience to investigate, or seem too risky because they’re unconventional. For the altruistic crowd – statutory and benevolent funders – money is tight; the focus must be on drugs that will benefit the most patients with the least risk of failure. Many brilliant potential medications are daring, crazily unfashionable, require decades of dull, careful nurture, or are out of patent and cheap as chips. Products like these don’t appeal to greed or cash-strapped benevolence.Nobody knows what to do. Except (think Dom and I) me and Dom.We’re not academics. I’m a biographer and illustrator. Dom’s a type 1 diabetic and a cancer patient in remission who does “comms” – communications. I’m still not sure what that is. (One day, he’s working for a fumbling university, trying to stop them imploding because they’ve got their sums wrong; the next, telling a London borough council how to publicise its garbage truck rota.)If we’re correct, our idea could generate billions of pounds of money for research. It won’t get drugs all the way to market – the full process can cost anywhere from £50m to hundreds of millions of pounds – but it will help to pick out the products worth a punt. The list of drugs rescued from the valley of death by public intervention is already long: Kalydeco for cystic fibrosis; Gleevec for leukemia; Herceptin for breast cancer. As one researcher once said: “We’ve discovered the cure for cancer twice, but threw it away.”We want to introduce a third financial force into drug development, alongside profit-making and benevolence – a wild force that everyone in medical research whispers about behind closed doors, but ignores in public with a rictus grin. As a motive to open up your wallet, there’s nothing to beat this force. It’s more powerful than greed and saintliness multiplied. It is desperation.Our idea is to charge desperate sick people to take part in clinical research. In particular, desperate sick people who are very rich – and their loved ones.It’s a repugnant suggestion.Medical ethicists rightly howl at schemes in which participants have to pay to take part in clinical experiments. They’re called “pay to play” trials and, outside poorly regulated countries, they are expressly forbidden. Wretched and desolate patients drain their pension funds, bankrupt their families and sell their houses to join studies based on flimsy research for drugs that don’t work, and could kill. Charging patients to participate is the preferred finance technique for deluded zealots and quacks, because no respectable funding body will touch their sloppy research. The cost to the patient can be anywhere between £7,000 and £250,000. Ironically (as every con artist knows) this prohibitive cost is part of the appeal of pay to play. Something so valuable must be good, thinks the patient. (A few years ago, in the weirdness of Florida, the“young blood project”saw wealthy old people hooked up to blood extracted from teenagers, at a cost of $285,000 each.)But there are several assumptions in this grim picture of pay-to-play clinical research, whereby desperate patients are fleeced by substandard operators. What if, thought Dom and I, you remove some of them? Take the assumption that pay-to-play trials chargeallparticipants. Why not instead bill only one? Everyone else participates for free (as is usually the case in a respectable study), but this one patient is charged the most absurd sum of all: the cost of the entire caboodle, that £2m to £5m. If such a funding tactic were run by a well-regulated body, on peer-reviewed research, and it is impressed on all participants that new drugs carry huge risks as well as possible benefits, then the usual ethical objections to pay to play disappear. It would work best for small studies, for rare (and frequently underfunded) diseases.But what sap is going to agree to pay the full cost of a clinical study just to ensure that nobody else has to pay a penny? Anyone who can afford it, say Dom and I. Approximately half a million people in the world are worth more than £10m. They don’t want to die. They have people they love, just like the rest of us; they don’t want them to die either. If these rich people could spend a measly 20% of their wealth to rescue a piece of quality research that may give them an outside chance to save their own lives, or the life of their mother, husband or daughter, they’d do it like a shot.As for the poorer patients? That’s a quid pro quo: without them there could be no clinical study, because the research would have only one participant, which is statistically useless. To rescue lost drugs, the mega-rich and the poor have to work together, for the weal of all. The rich patient is shackled to benevolence.I’ve called this idea the Plutocratic Proposal, after Jonathan Swift’s satirical essay A Modest Proposal, in which he suggested solving Ireland’s famine and overpopulation by allowing the poor to sell their children to the rich to be eaten. Dom the Comms doesn’t like the name. Plutocrats turn out not to like it either, especially if they know where it comes from. They think it objectifies them. But I think it’s important to be honest.In Swift’s essay, he suggested using the desperation of the poor to feed the rich; Dom and I want to use the desperation of the super-rich in order to treat the 99.5% of the world that is poorer.We know the Plutocratic Proposal works, because we’ve tried it.More than a decade ago, my best friend, editor and co-writer, Dido Davies, was dying from pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer (the same disease that killed Steve Jobs). I heard about a potential treatment in Sweden, flew out to meet the astonishingly open-minded and supportive Prof Magnus Essand, and got him to agree to a deal: if I secured the money that he needed to run a trial, he’d make Dido a participant. I didn’t have £200 to spare, let alone £2m, but I hunted it down. I found an oilman with the disease (living, as it happened, in a mansion just down the road from the Brocher, in Geneva) and got him to give  more than two-thirds of the money, also in return for participation. The rest was raised, with considerably more effort and much more skill, by crowdfunding, through the tireless work of Dom and a third campaigner, Liz Scarff. We had successfully rescued a drug and started it on its precarious journey to market.Dido died on the day our campaign announced it had secured the money. The oilman – a lovely person, called Vince Hamilton – also died before the study could begin. I lost interest in fundraising for stupid, boring life-saving ideas that don’t save lives in time. That was in 2013.In the 12 years since, several researchers, trawling through the outer reaches of bioethics literature, have come acrossa paper about the Plutocratic Proposalthat Dom and I published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, and got in touch to see if PP (as we initiates call it) could save their underfunded drug. These fleeting collaborations with expertise – sometimes no more than a Zoom call long – have enriched the idea. What began as one counterexample to the idea that all pay-to-play schemes are inherently unethical is now a set of five different proposals, covering early- and late-stage clinical studies, developed in cooperation with bioethicists, medical scientists and the odd biotech executive.It’s all been done in our spare time. Dom and I are lousy at fundraising for ourselves. That’s because we want different things. Dom is keen to set up a business (“Not-for-profit, of course,” he says determinedly) that will promote high-quality, participant-funded studies and bring in vast sums of new research money. I can’t think of anything worse. I’m terrible at business. I long for a sharp-clawed medical entrepreneur to step in and exploit us, as long they’ll also pay us to go on working on these previously overlooked funding mechanisms.One collaboration almost led to money. An Oxford don got in touch. He had a potential treatment for Stoneman syndrome, also known as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disease in which muscle and connective tissue are gradually replaced by bone, causing the patient to grow a rigid second skeleton. A neglected treatment, a small proposed study, a heart-wrenching story that would make it easy to run a publicity campaign: perfect for the Plutocratic Proposal.“But only 800 people in the world have it,” warned the scientist.I did a back of the envelope calculation: 8 billion people on earth, 800 people ... so, one in 10 million ... Trial needs £2.5m … Donor needs assets of, say, £5m-plus … About 2.5 million people in the world are worth more than £5m. So, if you take the chance of having the condition (ie 1/10m) and multiply it by that number of eligible plutocrats, you get … one quarter of one plutocrat.“More than enough!” I pronounced, delighted.One of the advantages of PP’s use of desperation as a funding force is that you don’t have to worry too much about calculations like this. The super-rich don’t need to suffer from Stoneman syndrome themselves to feel desperate to finance research. It’s enough that a friend or family member has it, or a friend of a friend. Plutocrats have hearts, and the fact widens the catchment area considerably. A quarter of a plutocrat is as good as a whole.Our most recent variant of PP is what made me finally get in touch with the Brocher and demand to be let in. It is the most demotic and captivating of our ideas so far and dispatches yet another assumption made by critics of pay-to-play schemes.A few years ago, a second group of Oxford researchers from the university’s musculoskeletal department got in touch. They’d discovered a potential anti-ageing compound. “Analysis of data from decades of clinical research has shown that, with this drug, diabetes II, colon cancer, bowel cancer, dementia – all the comorbidities of ageing – go into statistical retreat,” Emeritus Prof Graham Russell told me in a disconcertingly matter-of-fact tone from his 17th-century farmhouse outside Sheffield. A recipient of the William F Neuman award for his outstanding contribution to science, Russell is considerably over 80, looks in his 70s, and wants the drug on the market yesterday.View image in fullscreenBisphosphonate … looks a bit like a person out gardening.Illustration: Alexander MastersThe compound is a bisphosphonate – a small, simple molecule that (when I draw it as a cartoon) looks a bit like a person out gardening. Bisphosphonates have been used as industrial anti-corrosion agents for more than 100 years. If you’ve got an 18-metre cooling tower curdled with metal deposits, pour in a couple barrels of bisphosphonate and it’s clean by Tuesday. In the 1960s, Russell – then a young postdoc – was studying bisphosphonates when he made his first astonishing breakthrough. In that unsettling way nature has of connecting things that have no business being connected, he discovered that certain of these anti-corrosion agents also help with osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are now one of the leading treatments for bone depletion, and millions of people have benefited from Russell’s work. Sixty years later, he and fellow researchers are proposing that at least one of these bisphosphonates – it goes by the splendid Thunderbirds-esque name of Zoledronate – may reduce the incidence of the diseases of old age.“But no one will fund us,” says Russell.Astonishing as that sounds, it isn’t unexpected. Metformin, usually used to treat diabetes, is another well-known drug that evidence suggests can prolong healthy life; it has also struggled for years to get the finance to test the evidence properly. Part of the trouble is that Zoledronate (like Metformin) is out of patent: anyone can make it. It’s difficult to see how big pharma could invest the hundreds of millions of pounds necessary to test its value as a longevity drug, and make money back on the investment.A more serious difficulty, explains Russell, is the trial itself. Clinical trials are the keystone of medical research – because of them, and only because of them, we have a scientific way to determine whether a new intervention really works or is a delusion. But trials are also very limited. It’s hard to prise meaningful statistics out of the chaotic noise of a human being. Compare it to looking down a road in a thick snowstorm: is that dark shape in the distance a bush? A car? A deer? A stage 4 “comorbidity of ageing” being defeated by a barrel of my specially adapted anti-corrosion agent?To help get round this problem of noise and complexity, trials operate under artificial conditions. They have to focus on one disease at time, using patients who don’t have a lot of other troubles that might confuse the data: no pregnant women, no children, no people with complex medical histories. But because Russell and his team believe that the comorbidities of ageing are in fact symptoms of underlying cell senescence, not independent conditions, they want to test Zoledronate on a huge clutch of illnesses, all at once, using the most physiologically muddled patients of all: the elderly. It’s an unorthodox idea and funders are orthodox; they have slammed the door in his face.The first reaction of Dom and I was to think there is no way PP can help either. The Plutocratic Proposal is designed to rescue small-scale studies into treatments for rare diseases, not massive trials investigating the only universal human condition, ageing. But Prof Heather Draper, a bioethicist at the University of Warwick who has taken an invaluable, kindly interest in PP, had a better suggestion. She is an expert in clinical ethics,has writtenabout the Plutocratic Proposalin the British Medical Journal, and still pops up now and then to see how we’re getting on.“Why not invert the original idea?” she said. “Instead of one patient paying a huge amount to join the study, suggest that everyone pay a tiny sum to participate – say, £5 or £10. It’s like crowdfunding but with an additional perk – participation – and it’s less than the cost of a hospital car park. This approach won’t fund the whole thing, but if the proposed experiment is big enough, and the drug cheap enough, it could help to get it started.”It is a brilliant solution. Once again, this variety of PP dodges the obvious objections of the critics of participant-funded schemes.Within the reach of all? Tick.Beneficial to science? Tick.Beneficial to society? Tick.It will have to go through the usual quality checks and peer review, and if it needs to be a placebo-controlled trial, then half the participants will be getting an empty pill. But with proper public engagement (Dom the Comms’ department) I believe most people would still be prepared to take part in such a mass experiment, for a fiver, if in the end we can know whether the drug will help us in our old age or not.“What shall we call this latest wonderful development in our growing family of ideas,” I say, “where instead of just one person paying a vast sum, we have everyone paying a tiny sum? I know! The Penurious Proposal.”“No!” Dom and Heather cry out together.There will be other worries to carefully address, such as data privacy; exploitation of people who think paying anything for a drug means it must be going to do them good; the fact that, in fact, not all people can afford £5.That’s why we want the Fondation Brocher to drop its requirement that only academics be allowed to run workshops. Patients and advocates need to step in where scholars haven’t dared to go, so that we can polish up our proposed ways to help rescue possibly useless but perhaps world-changing drugs.“There is one other problem with this potentially amazing pill,” says Prof Russell.“What’s that?”“It doesn’t exist.”Stuck among the mess of blandly functionalist and Edwardian architecture of east Oxford is Britain’s leading research centre for musculoskeletal sciences, the Botnar Institute. Prof James Edwards is the man here in charge of Zoledronate research. A short, boisterous Welshman with a broad chest and his top shirt button undone, he believes that the trouble Zoledronate faces is that not only is it old news as a compound, it’s also inaccessible. At the moment it is available only as an intravenous drip for patients suffering from bone depletion, and costs about £500 a dose.The evidence for Zoledronate diminishing major illnesses of old age that have nothing to do with bone mass has come in whispers – secondary observations in research papers that are primarily about osteoporosis or patients whose tumours have metastasised to the skeleton. To investigate its potential as a treatment for the “comorbidities of old age”, it needs first to be made cheap. It’s not a difficult or expensive process to turn the drug into pills costing a few pounds each, but the world is a busy place.View image in fullscreenWhite blood cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen as part of vaccine research.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHowever, it is also a communal place and, like Profs Magnus Essand and Heather Draper, Edwards sits down to listen. Also like them, he is quick to make up his mind. He likes it. He enjoys the thought of patients and advocates working shoulder-to-shoulder with researchers to crack this irritating problem of the lack of small amounts of money holding up potentially huge discoveries.“We can use the first version of the Plutocratic Proposal, to pay for the pill conversion and trial,” I say wildly, “then the Penurious Proposal could come in to kickstart the comorbidities trial: hundreds of thousands of participants paying a fiver each for a pill they’d take with their yearly flu jab.”Anything he can do to help, count him in, says James. Then he needs to get back to work. In a room nearby, a researcher is watching a wall of TVs showing a live feed from the International Space Station: she is investigating the effects of zero gravity on joint tissues. In another room, a man is peering into a microscope: he has made drug-loaded bubbles, 500 times thinner than a human hair, that can repair bone fractures.“How about an office between those two?” I call out to James. “And something better than my btinternet email address?” But he has gone.Ihave written angry, pompous emails to the Brocher. I demand that “the extraordinary privilege and valuable environment the foundation offers be open to all who have important ideas to develop”, not just people with PhDs. I accuse them of valuing “acronyms” above “merits”.I’m insufferable.“Was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the discoverer of microbes, one of the greatest microbiologists of all time, an academic? No: a linen draper who never went to university. Mary Anning, discoverer of the first complete Ichthyosaurus skeleton, a guiding light of palaeontology? No, a schoolgirl. Henri Dunant, founder of the Red Cross, a giant in the history of bioethics, a man born in Geneva, in sight of your lakeside windows – an academic? Nope: a businessman who later went bankrupt.”In the mornings, if we’re between jobs and have enough savings to keep us going, Dom and I start tinkering with our ideas again. At the moment, Zoledronate and the Penurious Proposal take up our spare time.It is really important to make this clear: we are dealing with real science, not Hollywood stories, which means it is uncertain, unproven, quite possibly wrong. Zoledronate could extend patients’ healthy lives, saving them years of suffering (and the NHS billions of pounds) but equally it could not – and may, for at least a few people, because all drugs carry risks, do more harm than good. It’s precisely because its effects aren’t obvious that we need to stop it disappearing into the biohazard disposal bin and get it rigorously tested in a peer-reviewed trial.Not everyone is convinced by our suggestions. I once got thrown off a campus in North America because the bioethics department hated the Plutocratic Proposal so much, on the grounds that it gave the rich one break too many. The security guards were called on me; I was escorted from the premises. It was delightful.This is why Dom and I need to get to the tables of the Brocher and plonk down our grubby finds. We need the professional ethicists and patient advocates and biotech experts to clean these ideas up. “Why is it academics find it so hard to get out of their silos and do proper public engagement?” I pronounce grandiosely. “If we could only work together for the weal of all …”“Hey,” interrupts Dom, who’s been checking his email, not listening. “They’ve accepted us.”“Who has?”“The Brocher. We got in!”And it is true. On our third attempt, the Brocher convened a meeting of their scientific advisers and had the grace to change their minds – rather more grace than I’ve shown in my emails to them. They have decided to let us run a workshop at their institution this November. It is, as far as we’re aware, the first time non-academics have been allowed to do this.Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific publishing bad for science?Read moreI don’t blame academic institutions for trying to run from us: two middle-aged men with spare-bedroom email addresses. I’d run from us too. People like Dom and me demand patient guidance and time. We don’t keep to deadlines; we misspell the technical jargon, if we understand it at all; we are prone to fits of petulance, tub-thumping and undergraduate overstatement. In my experience, with certain wonderful exceptions such as Magnus, Heather and James, we have about a three-month shelf life with academics who agree to listen to us. After that, they stop answering emails. They are too busy on their own projects; they have ghastly teaching hours and those constant, robotic demands from their university management.But Dom and I are not put off. That they open the door even slightly when we come calling – with our comically named funding ideas, and our talk of desperation as a financial force that they’ve all overlooked – is astonishing. But now we have a new fundraising problem: how do we find the money to fly our professors and patient advocates out to Geneva to debate these issues at our shiny three-day workshop by the lake?Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readMedical researchDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How could the mere possibility of a new national park stir up so much ill will?Kate McCuskerTue 11 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 11.21 EDTShareAs soon as the green fields of Galloway, in south-west Scotland, were selected as the preferred site forBritain’s first new national park in 15 years, Denise Brownlee sprang into action. The 64-year-old retired civil servant had served two seasons as a park ranger in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, and knew a thing or two about the chaos brought by thoughtless day-trippers and campers. “The detritus!” she says. “I’ve seen a two-man tent used as a human litter tray. You think dog poo on the pavement is bad? Try wandering up any remote little area in a national park. Your faith in humankind gets lost.”In July, Galloway was chosen as the frontrunner from a shortlist of five areas as part of the Scottish government’s pledge to designate at least one new national park – the country’s third – by 2026. The park’s creation, however, is by no means assured. The other areas in the running had faced varying degrees of opposition (especially Lochaber in the west Highlands), but no one could have predicted the ugly fight that was to tear through one of Scotland’s most picturesque regions, rip apart friendships and turn neighbours against each other.“It’s been more divisive than the Scottish referendum vote,” says Brownlee, who co-founded the No Galloway National Park (NGNP) campaign, a Facebook page that has mushroomed into a slick, PR-oiled machine. The campaign has sparked warring missives in the press, and has led to community relations so fraught that one supporter of the park tells me she now seldom leaves the house for fear of an awkward run-in with the opposition. “I’ve had someone who I thought was my friend compare me to Donald Trump,” says Liz Hitschmann, 73, Brownlee’s neighbour and co-founder.NatureScot, the Scottish government’s nature agency, has just concluded its consultation into the prospective park, the results of which will be released next month in a report to MSPs. Concerned about everything from poor road infrastructure toLake District-style overtourism, local opposition to the park has been rife – and means that this proposal, eight years in the making, might not even make it to the next consultation stage.View image in fullscreenGatehouse of Fleet, near the coast in Dumfries and Galloway.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe no campaign has accused those in favour of the park of employing “dirty tricks” – namely, removing its banners and blocking it on social media – to bring it down. The yes side, meanwhile, has said the no side is bankrolled by wealthy landowners, including James Jack, the owner ofseven estatesin Scotland – three of which are in Dumfries and Galloway, including the 916-hectare Hensol estate near Castle Douglas. (The NGNP denies this.) Local meetings have been fraught, Facebook groups are ablaze with vitriol and, during one particularly unneighbourly altercation, the police had to be called to defuse a shouting match in the street.Most moderates don’t dare to wade in, for fear of being caught in the crossfire. “I just don’t bring it up with people,” says Fiona Hesketh, a cafe owner in Gatehouse of Fleet, the pretty town where Brownlee and Hitschman also live. “It’s difficult for us because a lot of the people that are very anti-park are friends, good customers. But, like the Brexit referendum, suddenly you’re on a different side to people you’re very fond of, and have known for a long time.”Why is the ostensibly inoffensive issue of a national park ripping apart the genteel towns of Galloway?Scotland’s national parks are relatively new compared with many of those in England and Wales, the first of which were set up soon after Clement Attlee’s Labour government passed the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act in 1949 to address fears of urbanisation. Loch Lomond and the Trossachs was established in 2002; the Cairngorms followed a year later, and was extended in 2010. Unlike those in England and Wales, whereGuardian analysis from last yearfound that less than half of the land is “open access”, Scotland’s national parks are fully open to everyone because of its “right to roam” law.View image in fullscreen‘If we don’t get a national park, I will be disappointed’ … Rob Lucas.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe word “unspoiled” is overused but it is probably the most apt description of Galloway, where green fields bleed into the grey sea and sky. Rob Lucas, a 67-year-old retired environmental education worker, has been a member of the Galloway National Park Association (GNPA) for the past eight years. “Galloway needs a lift – it’s a really special place,” he tells me at his house, near the village of Borgue. Before I arrive, he has been watching the barnacle geese cavort in an adjacent field – their last hurrah before they head back to the Svalbard archipelago for spring. “We need putting on the map. Having a national park would provide a kind of blueprint for the future of the area. Very few people know about Galloway.” It doesn’t help, he says, that most people think it’s on the west coast of Ireland.Bringing a national park to the region has been a passion project of Lucas’s: last time he checked, he and the 11 other trustees on the GNPA’s board had spent about 25,000 hours campaigning for Galloway to be selected for consultation. “It’s a wonderful place, but in the decade that we’ve been here, we’ve seen how the number of businesses has reduced,” he says. “The council is effectively getting an ever-reduced budget – that’spartly based on population, and they’recurrently looking at a proposalto close several schools with less than 25 pupils.” (According toanalysis from the Scottish Labour party, £329m has been cut from Dumfries and Galloway council in the past 12 years. The region was one of seven local authorities in Scotland to see its population fall in the 2023 census.)There are three conditionsthat an area proposed as a national park in Scotland must meet: that the area is of outstanding national importance; that it has a distinctive character and cohesion; and that designating the area a national park would meet its special needs. It is perhaps the last of these criteria that makes the strongest case for Dumfries and Galloway.One in fivepeople in the region live in poverty.Just 15% of its populationare under 15 – one of the lowest percentages in the country. One teenager tells me that her home town is like a “ghost town”: the primary school has closed, and everyone her age is leaving. Phoebe Allan, a 28-year-old hospitality worker who moved to Gatehouse of Fleet from Australia, says there are very few job opportunities. “I really love it here, it’s a beautiful place, but there’s nothing really jobs-wise other than hospitality. Most people tend to go and stay away.” A 2023 study by the council’s youth work service found thatmore than halfof the region’s young people aged 16-25 planned to leave when they got older.View image in fullscreenBenedict Please, his partner Beth and their children Emmy (left) and Holly, at their home in Wigtown.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAll the aspects of the area that are a boon for retirees and young families – hushed streets, small communities, open spaces – aren’t exactly a draw for listless teenagers and twentysomethings. “I do worry that when our kids are teenagers there will be a lack of things to do,” says Benedict Please, a musician who lives in Wigtown with his wife, Beth, and daughters Molly, seven, and Emmy, two. The town has been bolstered by its designation as Scotland’s National Book Town, and its 10-day book festival has grown to attract more than10,000 visitors(10 times its population) a year. Still, says Please, in the off season it’s all too quiet. “A park, which would open up not only places to go and activities for them to do, but also opportunities for them in the future to work, seems like a really positive thing.” Why, the yes camp ask, wouldn’twe welcome it?Supporters of the no campaign are not hard to spot. On their car windscreens, pasted in the front windows of their homes and printed on their T-shirts is the white-on-red NGNP logo. The roads that run through the region’s small towns are bracketed with campaign banners – every few junctions there is another one, staked in a field or tacked to a trailer.They want to call it the Kingdom of Galloway, which is ludicrousI meet the no campaign in Hitschmann’s airy kitchen in Gatehouse of Fleet, two days after the government’s consultation closed. In forms dispatched to houses across the region, NatureScot asked local people for their thoughts on details ranging from the park’s proposed boundary (they were given a choice of three) to what kind of people they’d like to see on its board. Everything about the form – from its lack of freepost return envelope to the mooted park name – rankled. “They want to call it the Kingdom of Galloway,” says Hitschmann drily, “which is ludicrous.”Aside from fears of litter, overtourism and the very role of NatureScot within the consultation process – “It’s like they’re marking their own homework,” says Brownlee – the no campaign’s main bone of contention is that local people don’t yet know the full details of the park.“You wouldn’t buy a house without knowing how many bedrooms you’ve got, how much land comes with it, and how much it will cost to run,” says Hitschmann. The NGNP thinks the issue can only be fairly resolved with a referendum.But it’sthe question of how this scrappy campaign won friends in high places that has raised eyebrows. An investigation published by the Ferretin December found that the NGNP website listed the email address ofJames Pringle Jack– a landowner and businessman who is the brother of Alister Jack, a former Scottish Conservative MP and ex-secretary of state for Scotland – as the contact on its privacy policy page. (This was changed once the Ferret began making inquiries.) The website itself was made by Corona IT Solutions, a companyowned byAlister Jack’s daughter, Emily Ann, and her husband, Baron Sweerts De Landas Wyborgh. The campaign is also backed by Media House International, a public affairs firm run by Jack Irvine, the launch editor of the Scottish Sun and aformer director of campaign communicationsfor the Brexit party. (Other high-profile PR campaigns led by Irvine include businessman Brian Souter’s campaign against the repeal of section 28, the 1988 law that banned the “promotion” of homosexuality in schools as a “normal family relationship”, and the campaign against the introduction of low emissions zones in Scotland.)“It is a real open question as to where on earth all this money is coming from,” says Kat Jones, the director of Action to Protect Rural Scotland. Hitschmann is indignant when asked. “This is a grassroots organisation. We will keep leading it. We want it to be community-led. We don’t want it to be farmer-led. People are saying that we are being paid for – bankrolled, basically – by these people in the background. It’s just not true.”View image in fullscreen‘The term “national park authority” probably sends shivers down farmers’ spines’ … Michael McCreath, Garlieston.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIsn’t providing services such as a website and PR a form of bankrolling? “It’s a donation – the same as any other donation. We’re being sponsored by hairdressers, housewives, pensioners. Highlighting one aspect of it is justwrong.” She estimates that the campaign has received £20,000 in donations so far. As for the banners that line the roads of Galloway, most of the farmers who own the land have printed them themselves, she says. The NGNP insists that there is no single major donor.Farmers have been against the park from the off, with Scotland’sNational Farmers Union describing it as “unacceptable”, given existing parks’ failure to “make a positive contribution to farming”. According to internal polling,76% of its membersagree. Michael McCreath, a dairy farmer in the coastal village of Garlieston, is in the 24% minority. “Farmers are great,” he says. “They just don’t like being told what to do. The term ‘national park authority’ probably sends shivers down their spines.”Farmers aren’t the only ones with questions about national parks’ governance. A Campaign for National Parks (CNP)health check reportfrom last year found that there were “too few people” on national park boards and “in dedicated roles on the staff body, with expertise in nature recovery or related fields”. In the Galloway national park consultation, respondents were given the option of a park board of 13 or 15 – divided equally between directly elected representatives, appointments from the local authority and from the Scottish government.“I understand that GNPA and other proponents of a new park have developed a narrative that our campaign is a front for landowners and the rightwing media to undermine an ethical environmental initiative,” says NGNP member Ann Purvis, 62, a retired social researcher. “From my perspective it feels our campaign is deemed reactionary and unethical, as it questions an environmentalist orthodoxy that national parks are a good thing.” She says she has legitimate environmental concerns, pointing to research from the same CNP report which found that just 26% of sites of special scientific interest in England’s national parks were found to be in “favourable condition”.The UK’s national parks do not meet the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) definition of protected areas, which are largely wilderness areas with limited human activity. Rather than prioritise nature, the UK’s parks walk a tightrope between conservation and cultural significance, people and planet. “National parks in Scotland are never going to be like a North American refuge for nature, because in Scotland, we’ve got people who live and work in our landscapes,” says Jones.View image in fullscreenThe countryside near Gatehouse of Fleet.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianCampaigners have accused the UK’s national parks of beingdesigned for a different era, such is their ineffectiveness at protecting nature in an era of intensive agriculture. “By and large, national parks are agricultural landscapes that don’t actually deliver much for nature conservation,” says Thomas Starnes, an expert on protected areas with the IUCN. He says that the agricultural uses of national parks are the main hamper to conservation. Should we be designating new ones, given the state we’re in? “I think what would be far more useful would be to make the national parks that we’ve got more effective,” he says. “That’s not an outright no, but protected areas only mean so much if they’re not well managed.”At this stage, it’s not clear whether the Scottish government will move forward with the park. A report will follow this initial consultation, which will set out how – if at all – the Scottish government will proceed with designation. MSPs will then vote on the draft legislation.“I don’t know if the government will come up with a proposal now – I think it’s at risk because of the backlash,” says Colin Smyth, a Labour MSP for South Scotland.The GNPA’s Rob Lucas, though, is optimistic that his years of toil might yet pay off. “If we don’t get a national park, I will be disappointed,” he says. “If we don’t get a national park because of the fact that the no campaign has disrupted the process in a way that is not, in my view, ethical, then I should be very annoyed. I have no doubt that if we get to the next stage of this process, things will get even more vitriolic.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Jon Henley reportsOn Thursday, after the US decided to halt military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, European leaders in Brussels agreed to a massive and unprecedented increase in defence spending.The Guardian’s Europe correspondent, Jon Henley, explains to Michael Safi that this €800bn fund marks a new era for the union and will mean tearing up fiscal rules to loosen borrowing.For some member states, such asGermany, achieving this defensive autonomy will require profound constitutional changes. For other states, such as France, preparations have been under way for years.Despite opposition from states such as Hungary, Henley explains that public sentiment across Europe is now broadly behind these changes. And yet the question remains – with long-term US support now in question, will all this arming up be enough to deter Russia?Photograph: Omar Havana/APExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionToday in FocusEuropeFranceGermanyForeign policyNuclear weaponsUS foreign policy"

Called Go-for-Gold, it offers a fast-track path to citizenship in 90 days for investors willing to pay $140,000 (£108,000). The traditional route to naturalisation involves eight years’ residence.Leijdekkers has a passport from Turkey, where he previously resided after going on the run from Dutch authorities. It is unknown if he has Sierra Leonean documentation too.At a press conference in January, Sierra Leonean police said their own investigations had established that the church service footage depicted a man called Omar Sheriff. The country’s police chief, William Fayia Sellu, declined to say at the time whether Sheriff and Leijdekkers were the same person.Leijdekkers, who has assumed numerous aliases and nicknames, including Bolle Jos, was sentenced in absentia by a Rotterdam court last June to 24 years in prison for six drug transports totalling 7,000kg of cocaine, an armed robbery in Finland, and ordering the murder of an associate. He received a 10-year sentence in absentia by a court in Belgium in September over an attempt to smuggle drugs via the port of Antwerp in 2020.Organised criminal groups have long used west African countries as a staging post for cocaine shipments from South America to Europe. The revelations about Leijdekkers come at an awkward moment for the authorities in Sierra Leone, which earlier this year recalled its ambassador from neighbouring Guinea after seven suitcases containing suspected cocaine were found in an embassy vehicle.Dutch officials are still in discussions to extradite Leijdekkers, even though Sierra Leone does not have a formal extradition treaty with theNetherlands.Sources in Freetown told the Guardian that Sierra Leone’s government wanted to swap Leijdekkers for the Netherlands-based influential social commentator Abdul Will Kamara,AKAAdebayor, whose videos and long WhatsApp voice notes are popular among older people and those in rural areas.Officials and ruling party supporters claim he incited deadly riots in 2022 in the capital and north of the country that left at least 26 civilians and six police officers dead.In February, the information minister, Chernor Bah,saidtwo attempts to extradite Adebayor had been unsuccessful. Bah was approached for comment on Monday.Explore more on these topicsSierra LeoneDrugs tradeNetherlandsAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Fear of reprisals from her husband and family forced her to leave her home in the capital, Juba, and go into hiding.View image in fullscreenDeborah Kuir Yach: ‘Now that Athiak is pregnant, I can’t do anything about the marriage.’Photograph: Florence Miettaux/The GuardianAfter eight months living in a shelter under the protection of a local NGO, the 41-year-old mother of seven has travelled to Nairobi where Athiak is believed to be staying with relatives.Despite the threats she faced after her stance became widely known, Yach said she is determined to be with her daughter – who is due to give birth this month – in keeping with the cultural tradition of the Dinka, one of the largest ethnic groups in South Sudan.“Now that Athiak is pregnant, I can’t do anything about the marriage. Let her be with her husband. They will decide together whether she can go back to school later on,” said Yach. “[But] according to our Dinka tradition, a daughter must give birth to her first child in her mother’s home – that’s why I am going to Kenya.”Yach does not know if Athiak will be allowed to stay with her but said she would visit her to guide her daughter into motherhood, and help take care of the baby.Although she was perceived as a victim of child marriage by those who condemned the wedding, Athiak sided with family members who orchestrated it.View image in fullscreenAthiak Dau Riak and her husband, Chol Marol Deng.Photograph: Florence Miettaux/The Guardian“Athiak disagrees with what I have done. She says that I brought shame to the family,” Yach told the Guardian before she left South Sudan. “But I explained to her that I didn’t want to stay where I am mistreated. Athiak wants to protect the image of the family but I will not go back, I am following my truth and my right,” she said, adding that she wants a divorce. “I just found out that he brought another wife home.”In June 2024 Athiak travelled to Nairobi shortly after her traditional wedding to Chol Marol Deng, a South Sudanese man in his 40s who lives in Canada. A court case opened the same month by South Sudanese lawyer Josephine Adhet Deng against Yach’s husband, Dau Riak Magany, accusing him of arranging the marriage of a minor – a crime under South Sudan’s laws – failed to progress. Attempts by Deng to have Athiak brought back from Kenya were rejected by South Sudan’s public prosecution office in October 2024.Yach has travelled to Kenya with her three younger daughters in the hope that she can protect them from a similar fate to Athiak. Her brother, Athiak’s uncle, who also publicly opposed the marriage, is supporting her.View image in fullscreenDeborah Kuir Yach and her younger daughters Akoi (left), 12, Anger (right), 9, and Yar, 7. She hopes she can prevent them being married at a young age.Photograph: Florence Miettaux/The Guardian“My niece is now pregnant and I’m not seeing this case going anywhere,” said Daniel Chol Yach, who lives in Canada. “I’ve tried tirelessly to alert the Canadian authorities but nothing has happened so far.Chol has been travelling freely and he impregnated Athiak, even though the marriage is not complete, and although he had said he would let her go back to school.” While the customary part of the wedding was celebrated in Juba, the marriage is not legally finalised.“Now I want to make sure that my sister, Deborah, and my nieces have a better future. I’m renting a place for them in Nairobi. The kids will go to school there, and that will protect them from what happened to Athiak. With good education, they’ll be able to know what is best for their future.”Yach hopes to put her daughters in school in Kenya and, eventually, to join her brother in Canada to build a better life for herself and her family. “The reason I leave my country is the future of my children. If I stayed in South Sudan, maybe they will be married young, too.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentChild marriageSouth SudanAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He also threatened more tariffs on 2 April on the car industry that would “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada”.Asking rhetorically why the US received electricity from another country, he accused Canada of using energy, “that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat” and said “they will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come”.Mark Carney, Canada’s incoming prime minister,calledTrump’s latest move “an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses” and promised to “keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade”.TheTrump administrationwas also reportedly preparing on Tuesday to institute a new rule that would require some Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register personal information andagree to fingerprinting, according to Bloomberg. Currently there is largely frictionless travel for citizens between the two countries.The fractious economic battle between the US and Canada has developed even graver undertones as Trump makes increasingly aggressive threats for the US to absorb its northern neighbour. Although at first claiming that he wanted Canada to crack down on fentanyl, Trump has now accused the US ally of underpaying for military protection and incorrectly described the trade imbalance with Canada as a $200bn subsidy from the US.Trump coupled his tariff declaration with openly aggressive language about making Canada “our cherished Fifty First State”, repeating a constant refrain over the last few months. He claimed American statehood for Canada would make “all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear”, called the border “an artificial line of separation drawn many years ago” and suggested the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, would become a state anthem.The rhetoric has inspired a rare unity among Canadian politicians, with Carney campaigning for Liberal leader on standing up to Trump, and saying to a standing ovation in his acceptance speech on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America”.Trump’s moves are just the latest in the chaos around the president’s trade policy, amid tumbling stock markets and fears it could trigger a possible US recession.The White House’s strategy so far has been toplay downthe anxiety on Wall Street, even as stocks waver. After Trumprefusedto rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News over the weekend, the Nasdaq had itsworst dayon Monday since September 2022, dropping 4%.Shares in US automakers also fell after the announcement, as traders bet that high metal tariffs would drive up costs for the American industrial sector, eating into their profits. Ford Motor dropped nearly 4%, while General Motors dipped by 1.3%. Shares in the carmaker Stellantis – which has several manufacturing facilities in Canada – fell by more than 5%.Price premiums for aluminum on US physical market soared to a record high above $990 a metric ton, Reuters reported.The Ontario premier Ford has said that Trump must take the blame if there is a recession in the US,tellingMSNBC on Tuesday: “If we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.”Ford has said in the past that he would be willing to cut off US energy supply from Canada completely in response to Trump’s tariffs.A chart of countries that export steel to the US“We will be relentless,” Ford said, adding he would not “hesitate” to shut off electricity exports to the US if Trump continues the trade war.“That’s the last thing I want to do. I want to send more electricity down to the US, to our closest allies or our best neighbors in the world. I want to send more electricity.” But, he said, “Is it a tool in our toolkit? One hundred per cent, and as he continues to hurt Canadian families, Ontario families, I won’t hesitate to do that.”Ford also encouraged American CEOs, who have been largely silent on the trade war and threats to Canadian sovereignty, to speak up. On Tuesday Trump is set to meet with the Business Roundtable, an influential group of business leaders that includes the CEOs of Google, Amazon and JPMorgan.Ford said: “We need those CEOs to actually get a backbone and stand in front of him and tell him, ‘This is going to be a disaster. It’s mass chaos right now.’”The group said in astatementlast week that while it supported trade policies that “open markets to US exports, revitalize the domestic manufacturing base and de-risk supply chains”, it called on the White House to “preserve the benefits” of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump himself signed in 2020 but has since apparently violated by suddenly imposing steep tariffs on both countries.Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports were already slated to apply to all countries globally on Wednesday, after Trump announced them last month.Global stock markets register heavy falls as White House tries to talk up Trump tariffsRead moreBoth consumer and business confidence has dropped in the US since Trump entered office.Asurveypublished on Monday in Chief Executive magazine found that CEOs’ rating of the current business climate fell 20% in January, from 6.3 out of 10 – with 1 being “poor” and 10 being “excellent” – to 5, the lowest since spring 2020.Meanwhile, consumer confidence measured by the Conference Board found that confidencedroppedover 6% in February, its biggest month-to-month drop since August 2021.Trump had not yet spoken with Carney, said the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, arguing that the tariffs on Canadian metals “was a retaliatory statement due to the escalation of rhetoric that we’ve seen out of Ontario, Canada”.“I think Canada is a neighbor. They are a partner. They have always been an ally,” she said, adding: “Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS politicsCanadaDonald TrumpAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Not only has there a crackdown on entries into the US, but the increase in cases has reportedly meant a bureaucratic backlog leading to delays in decisions on cases of those who have been detained.Brösche’s mother, Birgit, confirmed to German media on Tuesday that her daughter was on her way home. Brösche’s friend Nikita Lofving, whom the Berliner had intended to visit in Los Angeles, confirmed to the LA Times she had spoken to her friend.Speaking to a journalist from ABC 10News San Diego in a phone interview on 1 March,Brösche said she had spent eight days in solitary confinement. She said: “It was horrible. Like, it’s really horrible. I just want to get home, you know? I’m really desperate.”Lofving, who had been in constant contact with her friend, said: “[Brösche] says it was like a horror movie. They were screaming in all different rooms. After nine days, she said she went so insane that she started punching the walls and then she’s got blood on her knuckles.”The staff at the prison had called a psychologist who wanted to prescribe anti-psychotic medicine to calm her down, but Brösche had refused to take anything, Lofving said.Brösche’s mother told the Berlin tabloid BZ: “I will believe it [her release] only when I am able to take her in my arms.”CoreCivic, the company that owns the Otay Mesa Detention Center, denied Brösche’s claims that she had been in solitary confinement, according to ABC 10News.Brösche and Lofving had attempted to enter the US from Tijuana inMexicoon 25 January. The two were traveling with tattoo equipment. Lofving said that Brösche was arrested and taken away by officers on the border. The US immigration authorities, Ice, assumed Brösche was intending to work illegally in the US, Lofving said. Her friend was in possession of an Esta travel permit.According to Brösche’s Instagram profile, she had only intended to stay in LA until mid-February. Germany’s foreign ministry confirmed it had worked together with its consulate general in LA to resolve the issue.Sielaff returned to Germany last week after spending two weeks in detention, after his entry permit was cancelled at the Mexican border, amid suspicions by the US authorities that he had remained in the US longer than he was allowed.He was arrested at the border point at San Ysidro on 18 February. He had entered the US on a tourist visa and had subsequently visited Mexico with his girlfriend, Lennon Tyler, where they had taken her dog to the vet. According to Tyler, on their return to the US, Sielaff had incorrectly answered a question as to where he lived, due to his poor grasp of English. He had said Las Vegas, where he was staying with Tyler, his fiancee, when he should have said Germany, where he permanently resides, she said.After two weeks in detention, Sielaff was allowed to leave. His girlfriend said she booked him a flight from San Diego to Munich on 6 March. In an interview with the Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger, Tyler warned people against travelling to the US. “Don’t come here,” she said. “Especially not if you’re on a tourist visa, and especially not over the Mexican border.”US authorities have yet to issue a statement on the German cases.Rebecca Burke’s father said on Monday that he was trying to get his daughter out of the detention centre, and had been in touch with the British consulate in San Francisco. He described the conditions in which she was being held as “horrendous”. She had been travelling on a tourist visa, but was told she should have applied for a working visa as she planned to stay with a family receiving accommodation in exchange for carrying out domestic chores.Explore more on these topicsGermanyUS immigrationMexicoDonald TrumpAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Murderer!” as one of the seven defendants entered the building on Tuesday morning with her lawyer at the start of what is expected to be an emotionally charged four-month trial. Other demonstrators carried posters that called for “Justice for God!”As he arrived for the opening session, Fernando Burlando, a lawyer representing Maradona’s daughters, told journalists the court would hear evidence that would make it “shudder”. “The most important thing is to understand that they killed Diego … What they did was a murder,” Burlando said.Diego Maradona obituaryRead moreMaradona wasfound dead at his homenear the Argentinian capital on 25 November 2020 having suffered a heart attack while he recovered from surgery he had undergone earlier that month to treat bleeding around the brain.The death of the footballer, considered a national treasure inArgentina, prompted a massive outpouring of grief. Thousands flocked to the Casa Rosada presidential palace to attend the wake of a player who was famed for his sporting genius and a 1986 “hand of God” goal against England but spent decades battling cocaine and alcohol addiction. “Olé, olé olé olé, Die-go, Die-go!” mourners chanted as they stood in line.Celebration of Maradona’s life and achievements quickly turned to anger, recriminations and claims that medical negligence may have played a role in his death.Prosecutors accused Maradona’s eight-member medical team – seven of whom are going on trial this week – of failing to provide adequate care that might have kept him alive as he recovered from surgery.They claim those medics pushed for Maradona to receive home care, a decision that proved “reckless” and “totally deficient”. Prosecutors allege the footballer was abandoned to his fate for a “prolonged, agonising period” before his death.The defendants, who include the neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luciano Luque, 44, and the 36-year-old psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov – have all denied the charges. Vadim Mischanchuk, a lawyer for Cosachov, said he was “very optimistic” of an acquittal, arguing his client was in charge of Maradona’s mental, not physical health.Mario Baudry, a lawyer for Maradona’s ex-wife, Verónica Ojeda, said of Luque and Cosachov: “The main responsibility is theirs.”Each defendant could face between eight and 25 years in prison if convicted of “homicide with possible intent”, allegedly for pursuing a course of action despite knowing it could lead to the footballer’s death.More than 100 witnesses, including members of Maradona’s family and doctors who tended to him over the years, are expected to take the stand in the long-delayed trial, which has revived painful memories of the player’s demise.In La Paternal neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, where the player nicknamed “El Pibe de Oro” (the Golden Boy) revealed his prodigious talent as a player for Argentinos Juniors in the 1970s, graffiti urging “Justice for Diego!” was daubed on walls before the trial.“All society needs to know … what really happened, who abandoned him … and whoever is responsible must pay the price,” Hilda Pereira, a pensioner, said. Maradona “did not deserve to die as he died, alone”, she added.Explore more on these topicsDiego MaradonaArgentinaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

And this past December, the US Fish and Wildlife Serviceproposed protectingmonarch butterflies as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in response to years of advocacy by conservation groups.A statement from Jorge Rickards, the director general of Mexico’s WorldWildlifeFund branch, acknowledged the need to convert the short-term gains into long-term ones for monarch butterflies to stop being considered endangered.“It’s now time to turn this year’s increase into a lasting trend with an all-hands approach where governments, landowners, conservationists, and citizens continue to safeguard critical habitats along the monarch’s North American migratory route,” the statement said.The statement said Rickards’ organization recognized “the key role of local communities, as well as the support of the government ofMexico, in … providing this iconic species with the opportunity to thrive”.The survey, titled Forest Area Occupied by MonarchButterfliesColonies in Mexico During the 2024-2025 Hibernation Season, serves as a crucial indicator of the overall health of the butterfly population. It is part of a series of annual reports by WWF Mexico and Mexico’s National Commission of Protected Natural Areas, in collaboration with local communities.Monarch butterfly numbers plummet in US west coast winter habitatsRead moreThe report found that monarchs that migrated to central Mexico’s forests occupied 4.42 acres (1.78 hectares), which was up from 2.22 acres during the previous winter.Nonetheless, though these butterflies occupied nearly twice as much forest habitat compared with previous years, the number of monarchs remains far below the long-term average.Scientists say that better weather conditions in 2024 – which saw less severe droughts compared with previous years along the butterflies’ migration route – probably contributed to the population growth.At the end of summer, eastern monarchs fly together from the northern US and southernCanadato high-elevation fir forests in Mexico. The population size is determined by measuring the area of trees turned a vibrant orange by the clusters of bright butterflies.Explore more on these topicsButterfliesMexicoCanadaAmericasInsectsWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

They were tears of sadness, and of relief.The former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte, who had just landed in the capital, was surrounded by officials andbeing taken into custody. The international criminal court had issued an arrest warrant over his bloody “war on drugs”, in which her two sons were among the tens of thousands of people killed in deprived urban areas.A man who for years had seemed untouchable wasfinally facing justice. “I was really shocked. It was as if a bomb had suddenly exploded,” Celiz said. “I cried because of so much joy and sadness. Sadness because we lost our loved ones … joy because he [Duterte] is now where he belongs.”But, she added: “For me, it’s not enough. What I want is for what happened to my sons to happen to him as well … His family will feel what we felt.”Celiz’s sons Almon and Dicklie were killed in 2017, six months apart, during Duterte’s deadly crackdowns. Her area, Bagong Silang, in Caloocan, a poor district of Metro Manila, was one of the worst affected.Almon, 32, a father of five, was killed on 6 February that year when a police taskforce arrived at a wake he was attending.Celiz was at home when she heard the news from her daughter-in-law. She recalls racing outside: “I felt like I was running on air, like my feet weren’t touching the ground.”She rushed to the spot where her son had been shot, just 10 minutes from their home, but his body was no longer there – friends had taken him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. He had been shot in his chest and an arm.Between 12,000 and 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed in connection with anti-drugs operations, between July 2016 – when Duterte took office – and March 2019, according to data cited by the ICC. Most were young men, targeted in the streets of deprived urban areas.At the height of the killings, dozens of people were killed in a single night.Six months after Almon’s killing, Dicklie, his 31-year-old younger brother, a father of seven, was also killed. He had been out on a tricycle. Celiz was told a bag was placed over his head and he was taken to a police station. She found his body only the following day, at a funeral parlour.The police said he had fought back against their officer, a claim frequently made by authorities to justify the killings. He had been shot multiple times, including four times in the chest, and once in his head. His body was abandoned in the streets, she was told.Duterte and his supporters have argued that allegations of wrongdoing should be dealt with by the Philippine justice system. Yet in the years that have passed since Celiz’s sons were killed, there has never been any investigation. She says police at a local station told her that even if she tried to file a complaint, there was no evidence.Today, Celiz cares for her 12 fatherless grandchildren. “Even though it is hard, I told them the truth [about what happened],” she said. The family struggles financially, she added. Her granddaughter cried recently because she could not afford to buy a special robe to mark her high school graduation.“If their fathers hadn’t been killed, they wouldn’t have lost their parent. Now, I can’t do anything [to financially support them],” she said.Duterte, who appeared before asenate inquiry into the drugs war killingsin 2024, said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his drugs crackdown, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.”Celiz feels only relief that he will finally face the courts. At 11.03pm a plane carrying the former president set off for The Hague, in the Netherlands, the home of the ICC. “I am sorry to say this,” she adds: “That demon doesn’t know how to say sorry.”Explore more on these topicsRodrigo DutertePhilippinesInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the victims were men in poor, urban areas who were gunned down in the streets.Who is Rodrigo Duterte? Populist architect of Philippines’ bloody ‘war on drugs’Read moreDuterte was arrested on Tuesday morning at Manila’s main airport after flying back from Hong Kong. “Early in the morning, Interpol Manila received the official copy of the warrant of the arrest from the ICC,” the presidential palace said in a statement. “As of now, he is under the custody of authorities.”Video shared online had earlier showed the former leader walking with a stick and being helped to board the stairs of a plane, surrounded by security. His lawyer, Martin Delgra, told local media it was bound for The Hague, where the ICC is based, although this has not been confirmed by officials until Marcos spoke after its departure.View image in fullscreenPeople in Quezon City celebrate Duterte’s arrest.Photograph: Kenosis Yap/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockMarcos, who was previously allied with Duterte’s elder daughter Sara, the country’s vice-president, had in the past refused to cooperate with the ICC investigation. However, his stance shifted after the two families became embroiled in a feud.Marcos said the arrest came at the request of the ICC. “I am confident the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures,” he said after Duterte’s departure. “We did not help the International Criminal Court in any way. The arrest was made in compliance with Interpol.”Sara Duterte said she had “no message” for her former ally. “If you are a Filipino, you will never obey the foreigners inside your own country,” she said. “I don’t have any message for [Marcos]. I don’t think there’s any point talking to a person who will allow a citizen to be turned over to foreigners.”A video shared by the broadcaster GMA had shown the moment of arrest as Duterte was stopped onboard a plane as he arrived in Manila. “You will just have to kill me. I won’t allow you to take the side of the white foreigners,” he said in the footage.Philippine police said 379 police personnel had been deployed to the airport and other key locations. Duterte told police after he was taken into cusody he should be put on trial in a court in thePhilippines. “If I committed a sin, prosecute me in Philippine courts,” he said in a video shared on social media by a relative.Leila de Lima, one of the fiercest critics of Duterte and the “war on drugs” who was jailed for more than six years on baseless charges under his former government, said: “Today, Duterte is being made to answer – not to me, but to the victims, to their families, to a world that refuses to forget. This is not about vengeance. This is about justice finally taking its course.”Josalee S Deinla, the secretary general of the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, which represents the victims of the war on drugs, said justice was “finally catching up” with the former leader.Much of the day’s events were relayed on social media and Veronica Duterte posted updates throughout Tuesday. In one clip, an official said Duterte’s family could select three people to accompany him to a charter flight. “Tell where he will be brought. You son of a bitch,” a voice shouted. In another update, Veronica Duterte warned about her father’s health, posting a photograph of him resting and receiving oxygen.Duterte’s supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the ICC has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.Rights groups had urged the government to swiftly surrender him to the ICC.Duterte became president in 2016 after promising a merciless, bloody crackdown that would rid the country of drugs. On the campaign trail he once said there would beso many bodies dumped in Manila Baythat fish would grow fat from feeding on them. After taking office, he publicly stated he wouldkill suspected drug dealers and urged the public to kill addicts.View image in fullscreenSecurity forces stand guard outside a military airbase to where former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was allegedly brought upon arrival at Manila’s international airportPhotograph: Francis R Malasig/EPASince his election, between 12,000 and 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed in connection with anti-drugs operations, according to data cited by the ICC.Even as his crackdowns provoked international horror, he remained highly popular at home throughout his presidency.Police reports often sought to justify killings, saying officers had acted in self-defence, despite witnesses stating otherwise. Rights groups documenting the crackdowns allege police routinely planted evidence, including guns, spent ammunition and drugs. An independent forensic pathologist investigating the killings has alsouncovered serious irregularitiesin how postmortems were performed, including death certificates that wrongly attributed fatalities to natural causes.Duterte, who appeared before asenate inquiry into the drugs war killingsin 2024, said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.” During the same hearing, he told senators he had ordered officers to encourage criminals to fight back and resist arrest, so that police could then justify killing them – but also denied authorising police to kill suspects.Duterte also told the hearing that he kept a “death squad” of criminals to kill other criminals while serving as a mayor of Davao, before becoming president.The ICC’s investigation into the anti-drugs killings covers alleged crimes committed from November 2011 to June 2016, including extrajudicial killings in Davao City, as well as across the country during his presidency up until 16 March 2019, when the Philippines withdrew from the court.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

See you on March 15.”Since his singing debut in 2002, Wheesung had been popular in South Korea with numerous hit songs, including chart-topping With Me, and was well regarded for his soulful performances.But his music career took a hit in 2021 when he was convicted and handed a suspended jail sentence for use of propofol – a surgical anaesthetic that is sometimes abused recreationally.An overdose of the drug was cited as the cause of pop star Michael Jackson’s death in 2009.The South Korean rapper Verbal Jint paid tribute on Instagram, saying: “Every moment we spent together was an honour and I’m thankful. You’ve worked so hard. Rest in peace, Wheesung.”Another rapper, Paloalto, thanked the veteran singer for fond memories, mentioning he went to see his first concert.“It’s shocking and sad. I’m thankful for the music that accompanied me through the good memories of my youth,” he wrote on Instagram.Deaths of K-pop stars put focus on mental health taboos in South KoreaRead moreSouth Korea’s entertainment industry has been under scrutiny for years due to the sheer number of stars of stage and screen dying at young ages.K-popstars are picked up by agencies at a young age – usually in their early or mid-teens – and live under tight control, with their days taken over by gruelling musical and dance training.Just last month, the South Korean actorKim Sae-ronwas found dead at her home aged 24. A former child star, her career came to a sudden halt after a drunk-driving accident in 2022, after which she struggled to land new roles.Last year, the South Korean actorSong Jae-limwas found dead at home aged 39, while Moonbin, the K-pop star and member of boyband Astro,was found dead in his apartment in 2023, aged just 25.Several other young K-pop stars who have died in recent years includeGoo Hara and Sulli in 2019,Minwoo of boyband 100%in 2018 andSHINee’s lead singer, Jonghyun, in 2017.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsK-popSouth KoreaPop and rockAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He has previously said only that he could reincarnate outside Tibet, possibly in India where he lives in exile.“Since the purpose of a reincarnation is to carry on the work of the predecessor, the new Dalai Lama will be born in the free world so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama – that is, to be the voice for universal compassion, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, and the symbol of Tibet embodying the aspirations of the Tibetan people – will continue,” the Dalai Lama writes.Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, fled at the age of 23 to India with thousands of other Tibetans in 1959 after a failed uprising against the rule of Mao Zedong’s Communists. Beijing insists it will choose his successor, but the Dalai Lama has said any successor named by China would not be respected.China brands the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for keeping alive the Tibetan cause, a “separatist”.When asked about the book at a press briefing on Monday, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said the Dalai Lama “is a political exile who is engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion.“On the Tibet issue, China’s position is consistent and clear. What the Dalai Lama says and does cannot change the objective fact of Tibet’s prosperity and development.”Beijing said in February it hoped the Dalai Lama would “return to the right path” and that it was open to discussing his future if he met such conditions as recognising that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People’s Republic of China. That proposal has been rejected by the Tibetan parliament-in-exile in India.In his book, the Dalai Lama says he has received numerous petitions for more than a decade from a wide spectrum of Tibetan people, including senior monks and Tibetans living in Tibet and outside, “uniformly asking me to ensure that the Dalai Lama lineage be continued”.Tibetan tradition holds that the soul of a senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated in the body of a child on his death. The current Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor when he was two.The book, which the Dalai Lama calls an account of his dealings with Chinese leaders over seven decades, is being published on Tuesday in the US by William Morrow and in Britain by HarperNonFiction, with HarperCollins publications to follow in India and other countries.The Dalai Lama, who has said he will release details about his succession around his 90th birthday in July, writes that his homeland remains “in the grip of repressive Communist Chinese rule” and that the campaign for the freedom of the Tibetan people will continue “no matter what”, even after his death.Explore more on these topicsDalai LamaChinaTibetAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Where Trump is rude and abusive, he’ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent.”For countries considering a choice between “China on the one hand, and Trump on the other”, many would “find China a more attractive partner”.Since Trump’s post, Turnbull has reiterated the comments in several interviews, arguing that a “conga line of sycophants creeping through the White House, paying homage” to Trump was ludicrous.“The reality is, if you suck up to bullies, whether it is [in] ... global affairs, or in the playground, you just get more bullying.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He really doesn’t like the word ‘exemption’. If I walk in and offer an exemption, then I’ll probably get kicked out of the office. We’ll see how it goes. So maybe there’ll be some: I doubt it.”Last week, Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro accused Australia of dumping subsidised, below-cost aluminium into the US market, comparing Australia to Russia and China in exploiting the US.“The era of unchecked imports undermining American industry is over. The United States will no longer be a dumping ground for heavily subsidised and unfairly traded aluminum,” he wrote in USA Today.“Nations considered US allies also have been a big part of the problem. Consider Australia. Its heavily subsidised smelters operate below cost, giving them an unfair dumping advantage, while Australia’s close ties to China further distort global aluminum trade.”The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told media this week he was engaging with companies including Rio Tinto and BlueScope “to seek a positive outcome”, and said the government was engaging “constructively” to achieve a carve-out for the tariffs.The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, flew to Washington in February to make the case for an Australian carve-out: “Australia has a different case to make than other countries,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyDonald TrumpMalcolm TurnbullAustralian politicsAustralian economyUS foreign policyBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

A donor heart became available to be transplanted in March.Jansz said it was a privilege to be part of such an historic and pioneering Australian medical milestone.“We’ve worked towards this moment for years and we’re enormously proud to have been the first team in Australia to carry out this procedure,” Jansz said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionProf Chris Hayward, a cardiologist at St Vincent’s who led the observation of the man in after a few weeks in the intensive care unit, said the BiVACOR heart would transform heart failure treatment internationally.“The BiVACOR Total Artificial Heart ushers in a whole new ball game for heart transplants, both in Australia and internationally,” he said. “Within the next decade we will see the artificial heart becoming the alternative for patients who are unable to wait for a donor heart or when a donor heart is simply not available.”Prof David Colquhoun from the University of Queensland and board member of the Heart Foundation, who was not involved in the trial, said the success was a “great technological step forward for artificial hearts – bridging hearts – before transplant”.But Colquhoun cautioned that the functioning time span of the artificial heart – more than 100 days – was still significantly less than that of a donor heart, which is more than 10 years (or 3,000 days).Colquhoun said for that reason it was still “a long way to go” before the artificial heart could be considered a replacement for a heart transplant.He emphasised however the numbers per population experiencing heart failure are far less because of the heart medications now available – the peak of death rate from heart disease was around 1967-68 with 47,000 Australians dying from heart disease out of a then population of 11 million, compared with 45,000 of 22 million Australians in 2022.The implant is the first in a series of procedures planned in Australia as part of the Monash University-led Artificial Heart Frontiers Program, which is developingthree key devicesto treat the most common forms of heart failure.Explore more on these topicsHealthNew South WalesHeart diseaseDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Albanese stressed in his press conference that no nation, including Australia, had received a carve-out.“[Trump] considered it and considered against it. There will be no exemptions,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told Australian media in Washington overnight.“American-first steel. And if they want to be exempted, they should consider moving steel manufacturing here.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe deputy press secretary Kush Desai later confirmed the tariff regime would be comprehensive, and that no country had been granted an exception.Trump had said he would give “great consideration” to an exemption for Australian metals after a phone call with Albanese in February.Australian officials have lobbied Washington in the weeks since Trump announced the new tariff regime, repeatedly stressing Australia’s trade surplus with the US, and its longstanding economic and security cooperation. Senior government members including the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the trade minister, Don Farrell, had travelled to Washington DC to join ambassador Kevin Rudd in making the case.Hours after the confirmation that no nation would get special treatment, Albanese was strongly critical of Trump’s decision.“It is disappointing. Australia has a close relationship with the United States. Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends. This is not a friendly act,” he said.“But it is imposed on every country, that is important.”Asked if Australia should have proposed “a deal” to Trump to avoid the trade barriers, Albanese claimed Australian officials had put forward “a range of propositions” to the US which were not successful, but would not elaborate.He said Australia would not impose reciprocal tariffs on America, as other nations have done, but that the upcoming federal budget would contain new funding for a “Buy Australian” campaign to promote local products, and that government officials would continue pushing for a deal even after the tariffs come into force.“Our government will continue to put forward a very strong case for an exemption, noting that the last time this occurred it took months for that exemption to be granted … Australia will work hard for a different outcome and discussions with the Trump administration are ongoing,” he said.“Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States. Such a course of action would only push up prices for Australian consumers and increase inflation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said Trump’s call would harm local steel and aluminium exporters, as well as consumers; theBusinessCouncil said the outcome was “not unexpected” and said the government should continue with diplomacy.“It’s important to remember that it took eight months for the Australian government to secure tariff exemptions under the last Trump administration – what this tells us is that these discussions are complex and that patience and persistence are key,” said BCA chief executive Bran Black.The levies are part of a broader suite of tariffs Trump has vowed to pursue to level what he regards as an unfair global trading regime.He said this week the tariffs would enrich the US: “We’re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we’re going to become so rich, you’re not going to know where to spend all that money.”Overnight Trump threatened to raise the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium to 50% from 25%. There are also forecast tariffs on pharmaceuticals and agricultural products that could have an even greater impact on Australian exporters.In Trump’s first term as president, Australia won an exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs, arguing than it was an ally with which the US had a trade surplus (the US exported more goods to Australia than it imported from Australia).ButMalcolm Turnbull, the former prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption has since argued that the chances of a second reprieve were low because Trump regretted concessions granted in his first term.Australia’s record gold exports to US set back its case for tariff relief as Trump trade war loomsRead moreThe “surplus” argument was also undermined by the fact that in January 2025, for the first time since the US census bureau published records, Australia recorded a trade surplus with the US. This was driven, almost wholly, by a run on gold in the US. Australiashipped a record amount of gold to the USin January – worth US$2.9bn – according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the highest figure in records dating back to 1995.Investors in the US, fearful of the impact of an uncertain and potentially punitive tariff regime, have taken refuge in the safe-haven asset, drivingprices to new recordslast month.Australia’s fight for tariff relief exists within a chaotic and deepening trade war globally.US stocks had their worst day of the year on Monday amid fears of a recession.Asked if he was expecting a recession this year on the back of his rollout of a global tariff regime, Trump replied: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyTrump tariffsAustralian foreign policyDonald TrumpSteel industryBusiness (Australia news)CanadanewsShareReuse this content"

Here are all the reasons you can't – videoChoice, along with several other consumer groups, hadlong advocated for Australia to introduce a scheme to compensate passengerson delayed or cancelled flights for their lost time, on top of additional expenses incurred by the disruption.Having accepted the omission of a cash compensation scheme, Choice’s senior campaign and policy adviser, Bea Sherwood, said even the provisions that had been included in the draft needed strengthening.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“The draft charter may be weaker than existing consumer protections under the Australian consumer law, such as consumer guarantees,” Sherwood said.As an example, Sherwood identified how the draft charter appeared to be less prescriptive about a passenger’s rights if a flight was cancelled or delayed due to bad weather as opposed to an operational decision made by the airline.Under Australian consumer law, passengers have the same rights if the flight disruption is not their fault.“Consumers are entitled to a refund or replacement where flights are delayed or cancelled due to weather events under [existing] consumer guarantee rights, but may not be under the draft charter,” Sherwood said.Australian airlines more delayed than foreign competitors, but government decides not to nudge lawsRead moreIn its submission, Choice urged the draft charter be strengthened to include the right to a replacement flight or a refund when a flight was cancelled or significantly delayed through no fault of the consumer.“The charter should include the right to rebook or receive a refund, regardless of whether the reason for the delay or cancellation is inside or outside the airline’s control,” Sherwood said.Choice’s submission also called for minimum reimbursement amounts that airlines must pay.“The charter should set minimum amounts … for meals, accommodation and airport transfers for significant delays and cancellations,” Sherwood said. “These measures will ensure that a consumer knows what to expect regardless of the airline they fly with, and ensure that the charter has all of the information a consumer needs in the event their flight is delayed or cancelled.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionChoice criticised the draft charter’s wording about a passenger’s rights when luggage was lost, and called for “specific standards for claim times and compensation for damaged, delayed or lost baggage”.“The charter does not outline any specific timing for both making claims and receiving compensation from the airline when a bag is damaged, delayed or lost,” Sherwood said. “We strongly recommend the charter includes specific standards to ensure consumers have one source of information and that all airlines treat consumers the same.”She was also disappointed that the draft charter used terms such as “target” instead of “deadline” when outlining fair timeframes to expect refunds, responses to complaints or luggage claims.“Let’s be real; we need deadlines. Because if it’s a target, what happens if it’s not met? …“What happens if a passenger’s rights are breached? We were hoping for concrete penalties to be applied … but we’re not sure how these rights will be enforced.”More broadly, Sherwood said the “vague” wording surrounding rights outlined in the charter could be confusing for customers.The Australian Services Union, whose members include some sections of flight crews, called for the charter to require a minimum staff presence at airports to deal with displaced passengers after disruptions.Too often, airlines rely on apps or call centres to handle rebooking, reimbursements and passenger needs, without any airline representatives to deal with in person, the union said.“Aviation staff do their best, but when there aren’t enough staff on the floor, passengers get frustrated, and that frustration is directed at them,” the union submission said, adding: “Our members are committed to providing quality service, but the increasing reliance on digital platforms and staff shortages typically infuriates passengers, creating difficult workplace conditions for our members and a poor experience for air travellers.”Explore more on these topicsTransportAustralian politicsLabor partyAir transportAirline industryAustralian trade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

A government spokesperson said on Wednesday morning it would have “more to say” on the issue.Industry groups in Australia are preparing to be hit with tariffs, the first of which will be imposed from 12.01am Wednesday, Washington DC time. Still, some analysts have argued, the greatest impact could be beyond the tariffs themselves but rather the potential depressive impact of US tariffs on global trade.In a note to investors, Shane Oliver, the chief economist at AMP, said it was “hard to see” how Australia could avoid some direct tariffs on exports to the US.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“Even if we avoid the 25% tariff on our steel and aluminium exports – which is looking questionable – we likely face tariffs on our pharmaceutical exports, which are more than double the value of our steel and aluminium exports to the US, or meat, which is our biggest export,” he wrote.“The main threat to Australia by far comes from Trump’s trade war leading to a hit to global trade and growth leading to less demand for our exports.”The Australian stock market shed more than $45bn on Tuesday after US markets fell dramatically overnight on fears of a recession.“The market’s reacting at the moment to a number of factors, but things like concerns of Trump’s tariffs, that this could trigger an economic slowdown,” said a CommSec market analyst, Steven Daghlian.“The unpredictability of the trade war was something that really weighed on markets last week.”Trump has argued that his administration needs to introduce tariffs to remedy large US trade deficits with major trading partners including China, the EU, Vietnam, Mexico and Canada. He has argued that unfair trade practices had exploited the US for generations.On Air Force One this week, he told reporters tariffs would restore US wealth: “We’re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we’re going to become so rich, you’re not going to know where to spend all that money.”One of Australia’s oft-made arguments to the new US administration in advocating for exemption from the tariff regime is that Australia is one of the few countries which runs a trade deficit with the US (because the US exports more to Australia than it imports from Australia).“The United States enjoys a trade surplus with Australia, and has done so since the Truman presidency,” Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the only deficit in records dating back to 1985.Trump’s trade adviser says Australia is waging a ‘frontal assault’ on US aluminium markets. What’s really going on?Read moreAustraliashipped a record amount of gold to the USin January – worth US$2.9bn – according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the highest figure in records dating back to 1995. Investors in the US, fearful of the impact of an uncertain and potentially punitive tariff regime, have taken refuge in the safe-haven asset, drivingprices to new recordslast month.Historically, Australian imports of expensive manufactured goods – aeroplanes, machinery, vehicles and computers have given the US a dominant surplus over Australia. Those imports are only partially offset by Australian exports, led by meat and pharmaceuticals.Both agricultural products and pharmaceuticals have been flagged by Trump as targets for a new round of tariffsIn February Trump said pharmaceuticals would attract a tariff “25% or higher … it’ll go very substantially higher over the course of a year” but that he would delay their introduction to give pharmaceutical companies time to move their production operations inside the US to avoid the levy.Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said while the government should continue to advocate on behalf of Australian exporters, “it is very clear we are dealing with a very different situation to the last time we faced US tariffs”.“Parts of the administration are emboldened and the geopolitical situation is different so escaping their impact this time is much more difficult.”Willox said the new US administration was acutely sensitive to criticism: “Any perceived slight or antagonism will not help our cause,” he told Guardian Australia.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsDonald TrumpBusiness (Australia news)Steel industryTrump tariffsInternational tradeGoldnewsShareReuse this content"

It also showed a new electric model under its premium Lexus brand, with two more to come this year.The manufacturer was one of theleaders in making hybrid carsthat combine a petrol or diesel engine with a small battery, but it has been much slower to switch production over to pure battery electric vehicles than rivals.That cautious approach has paid off financially in recent months as the pace of growth in battery car sales hasslowed in some markets, including Europe. The company upgraded its profit forecasts last month after selling 10.8m cars in 2024.Matt Harrison, the chief corporate officer at Toyota Motor Europe, said the company would try to retain its eight European factories but that it would make the move to electric production gradually “over the next decade”. Toyotaopened its UK plantsin 1992 and they employ about 3,000 people.Toyota is aiming to keep European sales at about the 1.2m it achieved in 2024, a market share of 7%. Speaking at a launch event in Brussels last week, Harrison said car companies were facing “encouragement to localise supply chains” because of increasing trade barriers. Global trade frictions andtariffs are expected by most experts to increaseas Donald Trump continues his trade war against erstwhile allies.Toyota makes theCorolla hatchback at Burnaston, Derbyshire, and has other car plants in France, the Czech Republic, Portugal and Turkey.Asked if the Burnaston plant had a future making battery cars, Harrison said: “Ultimately that’s our goal, yes. We see that we want to keep all of our manufacturing assets and particularly with the geopolitical […] trends that we see now.”View image in fullscreenThe Toyota C-HR+ SUV is an electric version of its existing petrol C-HR.Photograph: ToyotaThe new electric models were an updated version of the bZ4X, the C-HR+ SUV, which is an electric version of itsexisting petrol C-HR, and the Lexus RZ.Toyota’s confidence in the future of its UK plants will be welcomed by the government, amid repeated criticisms from the industry of rules that force carmakers to sell an increasing number of electric cars every year. The UK government has pledged to relax the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate – despite the concerns of environmental campaigners – arguing the industry needed respite.On a trip to Japan last week, the UK business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told Toyota and its smaller Japanese rival Nissan that the government would “do everything possible to ensure automotive manufacturing remains in the UK”, including loosening the ZEV mandate.Toyota was also particularly concerned with the UK including some hybrids in a ban on new petrol and diesel cars between 2030 and 2035. A ban on models not capable of running on zero-emissions power could have ruled out models such as the Prius. However, the government is nowexpected to allow Prius-style hybrids, in part because ofToyota’s lobbying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that there was “no direct connection between Burnaston’s future and the ZEV mandate” because of its focus on exporting vehicles to Europe.“It’s the speed of transition in mainland Europe, not the UK, which will have the biggest bearing on sustainability of TMUK,” he said, referring to the UK factory. “Our strategy in Europe is we don’t believe we need to change our manufacturing footprint very much … we’re not looking to downsize, consolidate, or build a new plant.”That plan also applies to plants making engines, including sites in Deeside, north Wales, and Poland. Harrison emphasised that the company would not rush to make the switch because it is not certain over how quickly demand for electric cars will increase over the next decade.“We have to pick the moment of transition very carefully,” Harrison said. “We have to have critical mass and volume, otherwise we can’t have a competitive supply chain.”View image in fullscreenThe Toyota FT-Me concept car at a launch event in Brussels, Belgium.

It is continuing development for six types of propulsion technology: battery cars, hybrids, and plug-in hybrids capable of being charged with a plug, plus technologies not seen to have a significant future for mass-market cars, including hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen combustion and “carbon-neutral” petrol.Toyota also revealed plans to build an electric “microcar” to rivalStellantis’s Citroën Ami, the Swiss-made Microlinoand a series of Chinese competitors. Toyota’s FT-Me concept car will, if brought to full production, qualify as a quadricycle, meaning it could be driven by 14-year-olds in countries including France without a full licence.Explore more on these topicsToyotaAutomotive industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

An overwhelming majority of opposition lawmakers had vowed to vote against it.The government asked for the confidence vote, saying it was needed to “dispel uncertainty” about its own future amid a simmering political crisis that has focused on Social Democrat prime minister Luís Montenegro and distracted attention from policy.The controversy has revolved around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Montenegro’s family law firm.A new election is likely in May.Montenegro, who had said he would stand for reelection if the government fell, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became PSD leader in 2022, and has not been involved in its running.It recently emerged that the firm is receiving monthly payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government, among other sources of revenue.An election would pitch the country of 10.6 million people into months of political uncertainty just as it is in the process of investing more than €22bn ($24bn) in EU development funds.Portugal has also been caught up in a rising European tide of populism, with a radical-right party surging into third place in last year’s election. Voter discontent with a return to the polls could play into the hands of the Chega (Enough) party, which has fed off frustration with mainstream parties.The Social Democrats are hoping that economic growth estimated at 1.9% last year, compared with the EU’s 0.8% average, and a jobless rate of 6.4%, roughly the EU average, will keep their support firm.The next general election in Portugal was previously scheduled for January 2028.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The flow of US intelligence and military aid toUkraineis to resume – and the Kremlin is being asked to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Kyiv has already told the Americans it will sign up to.It is a dizzying turnaround fromthe Oval Office row between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trumpand the apparent abandonment of the White House’s strategy to simply pressurise Ukraine into agreeing to a peace deal. Now, for the first time, Russia is being asked to make a commitment, though it is unclear what will follow if it does sign up.Ukraine agrees to 30-day ceasefire as US prepares to lift military aid restrictionsRead moreAnnouncing the peace proposal in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said that he hoped Russia would accept a peace agreement “so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations”.That may leave plenty of room for interpretation. Russia has also been pushing for a ceasefire, though the Kremlin had wanted that to be followed by elections in Ukraine, before any full negotiation about territory and Kyiv’s future security.Ukraine, meanwhile, will want strong security guarantees to avoid a resumption of the war, involving European peacekeepers on the ground, which Russia has so far said it is against. An open question, perhaps, is whether peacekeepers could enter Ukraine during a ceasefire period, but this is speculative.Until Tuesday’s discussions between US and Ukrainian delegations bore fruit, the battlefield dynamics did not appear to favour a ceasefire. Ukraine’s decision to launch a drone attack into Russia on Monday night was a clear demonstration that its military capacity had not yet been significantly dented by the pause in supply of US military intelligence. It was also an aggressive effort to put pressure on Moscow to agree a peace.1:57'Ball is in Russia's court', says Rubio after Ukraine accepts 30-day ceasefire – videoRussia’s defence ministry said Ukraine hadattacked with 337 drones, 91 of which were aimed at Moscow and the surrounding region. Three people were reported to have been killed, all four of the Russian capital’s airports had to be closed, and local air defences were not entirely effective in repelling the assault.A handful of residential buildings were visibly damaged, though not too seriously. Moscow’s regional governor said that two people had been killed at a car park near a meat processing plant in Domodedovo, 5 miles from an airport. Fragments of a drone hit the ground, setting fire to cars shortly after 5am, Andrei Vorobyov wrote on his Telegram channel. Later, it was reported that a third man had died.Striking at civilian targets is never attractive, though the images were not dissimilar to those of Ukrainian cities hit nightly by Russian bombing over the past three years. Russia has also been increasing the scale of its drone attacks recently – on Monday it launched 126 Shahed drones, as well as other, decoy drones, into Ukraine, alongside a ballistic missile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday last week, a day after the US confirmed its decision to halt the flow of intelligence, Russia launched an effort, with the help of North Korean troops, to recapture the remainder of the Kursk area held by Ukraine.That has forced the defenders back by between 4 and 8 miles (6.5km and 13km) and into the outskirts of Sudhza, a village that Ukraine has occupied since August. But its success may well be a function of a concerted attack, rather than a beginnings of a rout caused by the temporary absence of targeting data. That means Russian progress in the Kursk sector, for example, is very likely to continue if no ceasefire is agreed.Nevertheless, the diplomatic momentum is suddenly with Ukraine, though with the mercurialDonald Trumpinvolved, it is unclear for how long. Around $1bn (£772m) of US military aid is now potentially unblocked, while key functions for totemic weapons such as F-16s are presumably being restored – and the Kremlin’s immediate hopes of grinding down Kyiv on the frontline are set back.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyMarco RubioVladimir PutinanalysisShareReuse this content"

It would publish its reasoning at a later date, the court added.Several hundred protesters gathered outside the courthouse waving Romanian flags and chanting “freedom” and “thieves”. Ana Florescu, 57, said Romania was “not a democracy any more … There is no justice. They have stolen it.”Florescu, an economist, said the mainstream political parties that have run the country since the collapse of communism in 1989 had “made so many mistakes. No one trusts them any more. And now they have just cancelled a candidate.”Gabriel Feraru, 63, an engineer, said the entire political class was “afraid of Georgescu because he is anti-system, and they will lose all their corrupt privileges”. He said he would boycott the rerun unless Georgescu endorsed a new far-right candidate.The deadline for candidacies is 15 March, giving Romania’s far-right parties, including the Alliance for the Union of Romanians party (AUR) and the party of Young People (POT), which had united behind Georgescu’s run, little time to agree on a replacement.The former government official told his supporters after the ruling to “follow your conscience” when casting their ballot. “Today, the masters have decided: no equality, no freedom, no fraternity for Romanians,” Georgescu posted on social media.“Long live France and Brussels, long live their colony named Romania,” he added in English and French. “While America is becoming great again,Europeand Romania have become petty, corrupt, and under dictatorship.”George Simion, chairman of the AUR and of the far-right bloc that holds about a third of seats in parliament, said the court’s decision was “a disgrace … Once again, it is mocking the Romanian people, is attacking our democracy and our essential rights.”Many protesters said they would either boycott the new ballot or vote for an anti-establishment candidate. “I’ll vote for anyone new who isn’t a part of this system. People are fed up with these same politicians,” said Ionel Popa, a 52-year-old taxi driver.The decisions to annul the elections and disqualify Georgescu have drawn sharp criticism from Washington. Billionaire Elon Musk posted on social media on Monday, asking: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”The US vice-president,JD Vance, had previously said the annulment of the first-round vote showed Romania did not share American values. Georgescu, 62, was leading in the polls and was projected to win about 40% of votes in May.Georgescu had been polling in single digits before the November election and had declared zero campaign spending. He has lauded Russia’s president,Vladimir Putin, as “a man who loves his country” and praised Romania’s 1930s fascist leaders.He has also denied the existence of Covid-19, declared Jesus Christ to be “the only true science”, claimed Nato would never help Romania and said Bucharest was not very good at foreign affairs and should rely on “Russian wisdom”.Moscow has denied any link with Georgescu but said on Tuesday any presidential election without him would be “illegitimate”. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described Romanian authorities’ decisions as a “violation of all democratic norms”.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaRussiaVladimir PutinEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Officers again arrived at the Educational Bookshop without a warrant on Tuesday morning, staff said.They searched stock using Google Translate, confiscated about 50 books and arrested one of the owners, 61-year-old Imad Muna, his brother Morad Muna told the Guardian.“They chose books by the cover, taking books that had a Palestinian flag, or just the word Palestine in the title,” Muna said. “They were using Google Translate and took photos to send to their bosses.”The confiscated books included titles on the work of British artist Banksy, and others by the Israeli historian Ilan Pappé and the US academic Noam Chomsky. After taking them, the police locked the shop and left with the key, taking Imad Muna to a nearby police station before releasing him without charge in the afternoon.In February, Imad’s son Ahmed Muna, 33, and another brother, Mahmoud Muna, 41, were detained for two days, then held under house arrest for five days, but have not been charged. Police cited a children’s colouring book as evidence of incitement to terrorism in the shop.Rights groups and leading authors, intellectuals and diplomats warned at the time that targeting the shop appeared designed to create a “culture of fear” among Palestinians.All prosecutions relating to freedom of speech have to be approved by the attorney general’s office. However, police had not sought permission to open an investigation, search the Educational Bookstore or detain its staff.After the February arrests, prosecutors met police officers to ensure “such incidents don’t happen again”, the office of the deputy state attorney said in a letter to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel about the case.Police said they made the second raid after getting a complaint from a man who visited the bookstore on Tuesday morning. The man “stated that he had observed books containing inciting content”, a police spokesperson said in a statement.Officers detained Imad Muna “to verify his identity and details of the store”, the statement said, and are now reviewing three books seized at the store.“Based on the findings, a determination will be made on whether to refer the matter to the state attorney’s office for further investigation into the suspected sale of inciting materials,” the statement said.After Muna was freed on Tuesday afternoon, most books were returned and the shop reopened. The family-owned Educational Bookshop has been at the heart of cultural life in Jerusalem for more than four decades.Its broad collection of books by Palestinian, Israeli and international authors is popular with residents and tourists, and its cafe hosts regular literary events, including recently the launch of the Pulitzer prize-winning nonfiction book A Day in the Life of Abed Salama by Nathan Thrall.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It said all civilians onboard, had been given a safe route off the train.The Balochistan government denied there had been any military officers on the train. However, official sources who did not have permission to speak on the record told the Guardian there were more than 150 security personnel on the train.By Tuesday night, the train and the hostages remained in the custody of the BLA and the terrorist group said it was engaged in an “intense confrontation” with the Pakistani military and air force. The BLA warned in a statement that “if military intervention continues, all hostages will be executed”.The group offered a prisoner exchange and said the Pakistani state had 48 hours to release Baloch political prisoners, forcibly disappeared persons and national resistance activists, otherwise all hostages would be “neutralised and the train will be completely destroyed”.A railway official confirmed there had been no communication made so far with staff onboard the train and that the driver had been severely injured in the attack.They said more trains had been sent to the site to help rescue people but added that efforts had been hampered by the rough terrain and poor network coverage.“The scale of the incident and the possibility of terrorist elements are being determined,” said a Balochistan government spokesperson, Shahid Rind. “The Balochistan government has ordered that emergency measures be taken, and all institutions remain active.”Pakistan’s interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, condemned the incident, saying: “The beasts who fire on innocent passengers do not deserve any concessions.”Balochistan, a rugged and impoverished province that is the largest in Pakistan, has grappled with violent separatist movements for over half a century. The region, which shares borders with Iran and Afghanistan, has long felt neglected and exploited by successive Pakistani governments and has faced a long-running and brutal counter-insurgency by the armed forces, which has left thousands dead or disappeared.The militancy movement has been gathering fresh momentum in recent years amid a decline in Pakistan’s security situation since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.The ranks of the BLA have swelled and Baloch militants routinely operate checkpoints and block highways in the province.The militants have recently been behind several high-profile terrorist attacks. In February, BLA militants killed seven Punjabi travellers on a bus and in November last year the group claimed responsibility for abombing at Quetta’s main railway stationthat killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Large numbers of Chinese projects being built in the region have also been targeted, including a suicide bomb attack at Karachi airport last October that killed several Chinese workers.Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Although ADHD prescriptions rose across all regions, London saw the highest annual increase of 28%, south-east England saw the second highest increase at 19.5%, and the north-east and Yorkshire had the lowest increase at 13%.The analysis also found there to be a strong association between factors such as ethnicity and deprivation and ADHD prescription rates. The researchers said that south-east England and north-west England, which have significant white populations, show higher prescription counts overall compared to more ethnically diverse regions like the Midlands and London.The researchers also said that “widespread disruption and increased psychological stress levels” could be a factor contributing to the rise in prescriptions. They added that their findings reveal that the increase in ADHD prescriptions is higher than reported in previous studies.The researchers said: “The findings of this study have significant implications for health policy and clinical practice. The significant rise in ADHD prescriptions across England highlights the urgent need for policies that address both regional and socioeconomic disparities in ADHD care access. The finding that more people are receiving ADHD treatment is encouraging, particularly given reports of long waiting times between ADHD referral and assessment, as well as variations across different regions in England.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many other mental health conditions can cause ADHD-like symptoms. For example, my own clinical work has revealed many cases where inattention problems were caused by untreated depression rather than ADHD. Also, ADHD is often accompanied by other mental disorders like autistic spectrum disorder, complex trauma, anxiety and depression.“Concerning demographic trends, lower engagement with assessment and treatment among minorities and poorer communities is nothing new and not confined to ADHD. There could be differences in the availability of ADHD services across the country and more research is required.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Sources suggested that thousands more could eventually be made redundant.Labour Together said it hopes to channel “[Javier] Milei’s energy but with a radical centre-left purpose” with project chainsaw, a reference to the libertarian agenda of the Argentinian president who gifted Musk the chainsaw.The thinktank will look at more legally risky ways to cut civil service numbers for poor performance, abolishing or merging government departments and further planning reforms, including how to get a third runway built at Heathrow within this parliament.A spokesperson for Starmer declined to say which bodies the prime minister had been referring to but said he thought the state had become “passive”. He did not respond to questions on whether ministers were planning a “bonfire of the quangos” akin to the 2010-15 reforms by David Cameron and George Osborne.“The state in Westminster has grown larger but it has not become more effective, and as [the PM] said in cabinet we have seen examples over time of government becoming more passive when it comes to decisions,” the spokesperson added.The number of non-departmental public bodies has been in decline for decades, and standing at just over 300 is down from about 700 in 2010 when Cameron took office. In the 1970s, there were as many as 2,000.Among the public bodies set up by the government since Labour won the election in July are GB Energy, Skills England, the National Jobs and Careers Service and the Office for Value of Money – though some of these are mergers of existing bodies.The Institute for Government suggested last weekend that Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, could consider compulsory redundancy rounds in the civil service. Previously, redundancies have been voluntary or by attrition.Alex Thomas, from the thinktank, said it would lead to a “mindset shift” among civil servants, saying voluntary schemes and hiring freezes often choked off talent.The government said on Tuesday that as part of steps to remove red tape for businesses, it would legislate to abolish the Payment Systems Regulator – which oversees operators such as Mastercard – and incorporate its functions into the Financial Conduct Authority.The decision follows complaints from businesses that they were wasting time and money engaging with three different regulators.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said the “regulatory system has become burdensome to the point of choking off innovation, investment and growth” and that ministers were taking steps to “free businesses from that stranglehold”.Starmer said that “for too long, the previous government hid behind regulators – deferring decisions and allowing regulations to bloat and block meaningful growth in this country. And it has been working people who pay the price of this stagnation.“This is the latest step in our efforts to kickstart economic growth, which is the only way we can fundamentally drive-up living standards and get more money in people’s pockets.”Explore more on these topicsQuangosLabourNHSKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Last yearonly 224 farmersin England received payments under SFI.The National Farmers’ Union said the news was disastrous and would badly affect farmers’ trust in the government.Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president, said: “What we have now is the haves and the have nots.“A large chunk of the industry cannot access any money until next year.“They’ve just hit the reset button again today and it’s disastrous. Farmers now have a lack of trust in the department and in the government and we don’t know how we are going to move on from here.”Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents rural business owners including farmers, said: “Of all the betrayals so far, this is the most cruel. It actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief.”Asked about the angry reaction, Zeichner said: “I understand there will be people will be disappointed, and that’s why we’ll be coming forward after spending review with a revised scheme which people can apply for.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Out of respect for the investigation and all involved we will not comment further at this time.”The investigation into the cause of the collision had been led by experts at the Marine Accident Investigation Branch but was escalated to a criminal investigation after early inquiries by Humberside police.The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel for the US air force when it was struck while stationary by the German-owned Solong on Monday morning. At least one of its tanks is leaking into the North Sea.The transport minister Mike Kane said there was “no evidence” of foul play at present but that something had clearly gone “terribly wrong”.The burning wreckage of the Solong could be seen drifting southwards off the coast of Grimsby on Tuesday. The smoking vessel was being shadowed by two tugboats to ensure it stayed away from land as it passed a nature reserve off the Humberside coast.MapThe ship is now expected to stay afloat, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said.“I am reassured to hear indications from the ship’s owners which suggest the sodium cyanide containers were empty and that efforts to confirm this by the salvors are under way,” she said in a statement on Tuesday.“I was also pleased to have been informed that early indications suggest that both vessels are now expected to stay afloat and that the Solong can be towed away from the shore, and salvage operations can get under way.“I will continue to monitor the response and have asked for regular updates, including on any potential environmental impacts, across government and our agencies.”Mike Ross, the Lib Dem leader of Hull city council, called on Keir Starmer to convene an emergency Cobra meeting to avoid “environmental catastrophe” in the region, which was described by one expert as an area of “immense biological, cultural and economic importance”.Experts welcomed the news that the Solong was not carrying the poisonous substance sodium cyanide but feared the highly potent jet fuel could be a “disaster” for local marine life.Dr Simon Boxall, an academic in oceanography at the University of Southampton, said the Jet A-1 fuel had a “much higher toxicity” than crude oil and that “the impact of that on life in the oceans would be devastating”.Specialist pollution-control vessels from Germany and Norway arrived at the scene on Tuesday to try to measure the scale of the spillage and contain any toxins.Dr Jennifer Allan, an expert in global environmental politics at Cardiff University, said it was a “disaster in every sense of the word”.“The health and environmental effects will be short- and long-term, local and regional,” she said. “The jet fuel will be harmful to local wildlife and beaches and the livelihoods that rely on them. In the long term, it could move up the food chain; for example, from fish into birds and people.”Investigators were expected to speak to many of the 36 crew members rescued from both ships in the coming days to try establish what went wrong.Maritime experts suggested human error was likely to have played a significant role in the incident but that a technical mishap or oversight could not be ruled out.Det Ch Supt Craig Nicholson of Humberside police said the force had “taken primacy for the investigation of any potential criminal offences which arise from the collision between the two vessels”.He added: “Following inquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision. This follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of the Solong.“Our thoughts are with the family of the missing crew member, and I have appointed family liaison officers to make contact and provide support to the family.“The man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst inquiries are under way, and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”The cost to repair the ships, let alone the cost of any environmental damage or cleanup, is expected to run into the tens of millions of pounds.Harj Narulla, a barrister specialising in climate and environmental justice at Doughty St Chambers, said Stena could sue the Solong’s owner if it was found to be responsible.Costs would include damage to the tanker and cargo ship, as well as loss of the value of cargo, loss of earnings and income as well as repair costs.Environmental damage costs would depend on how much was spilled, which chemicals and how much was contained after the spill.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump was responding to a question during a Tuesday press conference, in which a reporter said, “Talk to us about some of the violence that’s been going on around the country at Tesla dealerships. Some say they should be labeled domestic terrorists.”“I will do that. I’ll do that,” Trump said. “I’m going to put a stop to it. Because they’re harming a great American company.”Trump spoke on the White House driveway, alongside Musk and Musk’s young son.

We’re going to catch them, and they’re bad guys.”Tesla’s shares fell sharply on Monday as markets reacted to the threat of a recession and Trump’s tariff plans. Tesla’s slide came amid widespreadprotestsover the billionaire Musk’s influence in the federal government at Tesla dealerships, a boycott campaign, car ownersselling theirTesla vehicles, and activists pushing members of the public to sell Tesla shares.‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutesRead more“In any event, I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support forElon Musk, a truly great American.

However, two people with knowledge of thematter told the New York Timesthat the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was relying ona provision of the Immigration and Nationality Actof 1952 that gives him broad power to expel foreigners if they give him“reasonable ground to believe” their presence in the US has “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”.Zeteoalso reported that Rubio himself “personally signed off on the arrest”.As of Monday morning, Khalil was being held at an immigration detention facility near Jena, Louisiana.On Monday evening, a federal judge in Manhattan barred his deportation pending a hearing in his case set for Wednesday.The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights have joined Khalil’s legal team, led by his attorney, Amy Greer. Greer stated on Monday that she hadspoken with Khaliland that he was “healthy and his spirits are undaunted by his predicament”.On Tuesday,13 members of Congress– led by the Palestinian-American US representative Rashida Tlaib –issued a letterdemanding his immediate release.The arrest came just days afterDonald Trump’s second presidential administrationcanceled $400min funding to Columbia University over what it described as the college’s failure to protect students from antisemitic harassment on campus.On Monday, theUS educationdepartment’s civil rights office followed the cuts to Columbia with new warnings to 60 other colleges anduniversitiesindicating that they may face “enforcement actions” for allegations ofantisemiticharassment as well as discrimination on their campuses.A department statement said it sent the admonitions under the agency’s authority to enforceTitle VI of the federal Civil Rights Act, which “prohibits any institution that receives federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race, color, and national origin”.“National origin includes shared (Jewish) ancestry,” the statement said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Democrat Jared Golden of Maine joined Republicans in backing the measure.The stopgap bill, revealed by House Republican leadership over the weekend, would fund the government through September and carves $13bn from non-defense spending while adding $6bn to military budgets and preserving a $20bn IRS funding freeze – priorities embraced byDonald Trumpbut denounced by Democrats as an assault on vulnerable Americans.The vice-president, JD Vance, in a Tuesday huddle with Republicans on the Hill said the blame would fall squarely on the Republicans should they fail to pass the measure,according to Politico.The House heads to recess later this week, leaving lawmakers in the Senate with a take-it-or-leave it scenario.The bill’s priorities align closely with Trump’s agenda, particularly its provisions that could grant the administration broader authority to redirect funds between programs – a powerDemocratsfear could allow significant reshaping of federal priorities without congressional approval.House Republicans were rushing to pass the bill before Thursday, when they would then hand the measure off to the Senate before heading home for a week-and-a-half long recess.Still, the Senate presents another hurdle, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority but need 60 votes to pass the legislation. At least eight Democratic senators would need to cross party lines for the bill to advance, assuming all Republican senators except Rand Paul, from Kentucky, who is expected to oppose it, vote in favor.That’s a hard sell for the Democrats, who are facing intense pressure from within their party and constituency to resist Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s unilateral cuts to federal agencies, which have eliminated more than 100,000 jobs.And unlike their House counterparts, Senate Democrats appear divided on the measure. Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania indicated potential support, stating that a shutdown would be “chaos” and that he would “never vote for chaos”.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon also said he was reluctant to vote against it, saying: “Shutdowns are a bad idea. I’m not a shutdown guy.”However, other Democratic senators, including Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin, are not supporting the bill and are demanding assurances that “the money is spent the way Congress intends” before lending their support.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsMike JohnsonUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

A TSA officer then conducted a pat-down on the East Stroudsburg man and determined there was something concealed in the groin area of his pants.When questioned further, the man reached into his pants and pulled out the turtle, which was about 5in (12cm) long and wrapped in a small blue towel. He said it was a red-ear slider turtle, a species that is popular as a pet.The man – whose name was not released – was escorted from the checkpoint area by Port Authority police and ended up missing his flight. The turtle was confiscated, and it is not clear if the turtle was the man’s pet or why he had it in his pants.“We have seen travelers try to conceal knives and other weapons on their person, in their shoes and in their luggage, however I believe this is the first time we have come across someone who was concealing a live animal down the front of his pants,” said Thomas Carter, TSA’s federal security director for New Jersey. “As best as we could tell, the turtle was not harmed by the man’s actions.”He said the incident remains under investigation, and it was not clear if the man would face any charges or penalties.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyAnimalsReptilesnewsShareReuse this content"

He also threatened more tariffs on 2 April on the car industry that would “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada”.Asking rhetorically why the US received electricity from another country, he accused Canada of using energy, “that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat” and said “they will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come”.Mark Carney, Canada’s incoming prime minister,calledTrump’s latest move “an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses” and promised to “keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade”.TheTrump administrationwas also reportedly preparing on Tuesday to institute a new rule that would require some Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register personal information andagree to fingerprinting, according to Bloomberg. Currently there is largely frictionless travel for citizens between the two countries.The fractious economic battle between the US and Canada has developed even graver undertones as Trump makes increasingly aggressive threats for the US to absorb its northern neighbour. Although at first claiming that he wanted Canada to crack down on fentanyl, Trump has now accused the US ally of underpaying for military protection and incorrectly described the trade imbalance with Canada as a $200bn subsidy from the US.Trump coupled his tariff declaration with openly aggressive language about making Canada “our cherished Fifty First State”, repeating a constant refrain over the last few months. He claimed American statehood for Canada would make “all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear”, called the border “an artificial line of separation drawn many years ago” and suggested the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, would become a state anthem.The rhetoric has inspired a rare unity among Canadian politicians, with Carney campaigning for Liberal leader on standing up to Trump, and saying to a standing ovation in his acceptance speech on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America”.Trump’s moves are just the latest in the chaos around the president’s trade policy, amid tumbling stock markets and fears it could trigger a possible US recession.The White House’s strategy so far has been toplay downthe anxiety on Wall Street, even as stocks waver. After Trumprefusedto rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News over the weekend, the Nasdaq had itsworst dayon Monday since September 2022, dropping 4%.Shares in US automakers also fell after the announcement, as traders bet that high metal tariffs would drive up costs for the American industrial sector, eating into their profits. Ford Motor dropped nearly 4%, while General Motors dipped by 1.3%. Shares in the carmaker Stellantis – which has several manufacturing facilities in Canada – fell by more than 5%.Price premiums for aluminum on US physical market soared to a record high above $990 a metric ton, Reuters reported.The Ontario premier Ford has said that Trump must take the blame if there is a recession in the US,tellingMSNBC on Tuesday: “If we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.”Ford has said in the past that he would be willing to cut off US energy supply from Canada completely in response to Trump’s tariffs.A chart of countries that export steel to the US“We will be relentless,” Ford said, adding he would not “hesitate” to shut off electricity exports to the US if Trump continues the trade war.“That’s the last thing I want to do. I want to send more electricity down to the US, to our closest allies or our best neighbors in the world. I want to send more electricity.” But, he said, “Is it a tool in our toolkit? One hundred per cent, and as he continues to hurt Canadian families, Ontario families, I won’t hesitate to do that.”Ford also encouraged American CEOs, who have been largely silent on the trade war and threats to Canadian sovereignty, to speak up. On Tuesday Trump is set to meet with the Business Roundtable, an influential group of business leaders that includes the CEOs of Google, Amazon and JPMorgan.Ford said: “We need those CEOs to actually get a backbone and stand in front of him and tell him, ‘This is going to be a disaster. It’s mass chaos right now.’”The group said in astatementlast week that while it supported trade policies that “open markets to US exports, revitalize the domestic manufacturing base and de-risk supply chains”, it called on the White House to “preserve the benefits” of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump himself signed in 2020 but has since apparently violated by suddenly imposing steep tariffs on both countries.Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports were already slated to apply to all countries globally on Wednesday, after Trump announced them last month.Global stock markets register heavy falls as White House tries to talk up Trump tariffsRead moreBoth consumer and business confidence has dropped in the US since Trump entered office.Asurveypublished on Monday in Chief Executive magazine found that CEOs’ rating of the current business climate fell 20% in January, from 6.3 out of 10 – with 1 being “poor” and 10 being “excellent” – to 5, the lowest since spring 2020.Meanwhile, consumer confidence measured by the Conference Board found that confidencedroppedover 6% in February, its biggest month-to-month drop since August 2021.Trump had not yet spoken with Carney, said the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, arguing that the tariffs on Canadian metals “was a retaliatory statement due to the escalation of rhetoric that we’ve seen out of Ontario, Canada”.“I think Canada is a neighbor. They are a partner. They have always been an ally,” she said, adding: “Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS politicsCanadaDonald TrumpAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Barclays declared to the regulator in a letter in 2019 that the two men “did not have a close relationship”.Staley originally met Epstein in 2000 after he became head of JP Morgan’s private bank, where Epstein was a client, and continued their relationship after Staley was appointed to lead the investment bank in 2009.The FCA’s lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC presented the tribunal with a series of internal emails and notes from JP Morgan bosses, who were considering dumping Epstein as a client in 2011. The financier had been released from prison after being convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from a minor.In one, a senior boss in the compliance team said he had held a meeting with colleagues “to determine how to approach the issue withJes Staleywho is friends with Mr Epstein. He needs to understand the potential backlash to the firm given all the work done to root out clients involved in human trafficking”.The court was also showed another note produced by JP Morgan bosses which said Staley had asked the bank’s top lawyer, Stephen Cutler, to “hear [Epstein] out”.Mulcahy put to Staley that others at JP Morgan “appeared to be of the view … that you were the one pushing to retain Mr Epstein as a client”.Staley denied the allegations saying “I don’t think that’s fair”, adding that while JP Morgan knew the two men had a relationship, the decision to exit a client such as Epstein was not his to make.He admitted to putting Cutler in contact with Epstein’s lawyer, but said that if JP Morgan’s top lawyer “had wanted to let Epstein go as a client he had full latitude to do that and I would never stand in his way”.Mulcahy also accused Staley of sharing confidential information with Epstein, particularly about how JP Morgan had concerns over human trafficking allegations against the financier and suspicious cash withdrawals from his account. She pointed to an email that Epstein subsequently sent to a senior boss in the private bank in September 2011, saying “Jes told me that there was [an issue] with reg cash with drawals [sic].”Staley said that while he “was not part of managing the account” he did not deny that he told Epstein there were concerns about cash withdrawals.Epstein died in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial over charges on trafficking underage girls for sex.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is set.” Staley told the court he believed this to be a reference to former Labour business secretary Peter Mandelson – nowUK ambassador to the US– whosecontact with Epstein was detailed in court documents in 2023.Staley was part of a draft list of high-profile invitees to Epstein’s birthday celebrations in 2010. That list, put together by Epstein’s assistant, also included: the American magician David Blaine; Columbia University professor and Nobel laureate Richard Axel and his wife; as well as Rolling Stones star Mick Jagger – but only “if he is in town”.It is not clear if that list was fulfilled. Staley said he struggled to recall details about which of Epstein’s birthday events he attended.He also told the court that most of his contact with the financier “was related to business”, but that “there was a friend side to it as well”, adding: “He became a friend.”Staley will continue giving evidence until the end of the hearing, which is due to continue until Friday.Explore more on these topicsJes StaleyBarclaysBankingJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Sterling hit $1.2956, its highest since 8 November, with both currencies strengthening after the US president escalated his trade war with Canadaby lifting planned tariffs on metal imports.Trump’s move drove stocks lower on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 index was down 1.2% in early afternoon trading, following a 2.7% slump on Monday.Growth fears grip markets as US recession worries hurt the dollar – business liveRead moreThe dollar lost 0.6% against a basket of leading currencies on Tuesday and, like the US stock market, has lost all its gains since Trump’s election victory. It hit its lowest level since the middle of October on Tuesday morning.After aglobal sell-off in stock markets on Monday, there were further losses on Tuesday after Trump doubled the tariff being imposed on Canadian steel and aluminium tariffs on Wednesday to 50%.The UK’s FTSE 100 share index lost 1.2%, or 104 points, to finish at 8,495 points, the lowest closing level since 16 January. Germany’s DAX and the French CAC index both shed about 1.3%.“This latest escalation in trade tensions comes hot on the heels of a tumultuous Monday, which marked the worst day of 2025 for US markets. Investor fears were stoked by President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies targeting America’s largest trading partners, sending shockwaves through the financial landscape,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index.“The situation has left many observers questioning the broader implications of these trade policies on both theUS economyand its international relationships,” Razaqzada added.Before Trump’s announcement, there had been a mixed session in Asia-Pacific markets where Japan’s Nikkei fell by 0.6% and the South Korean market lost 1.3%, while Chinese exchanges closed moderately higher, up between 0.3% and 0.4%.Trump vowed to buy a Tesla car in support of the billionaire Elon Muskafter a slump in the electric carmaker’s share price, amid abacklash against the Tesla founderwho has become one of the US president’s biggest allies. Tesla shares have more than halved in value since hitting a peak in December.Writing on Truth Social, Trump accused “Radical Left Lunatics” of “trying to illegally and collusively boycott” the business after Tesla shares tumbled by 15% on Monday, their biggest daily decline since 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It updated its house view scenario, and now forecasts a 30% chance of a “stagflationary or cyclical downturn” in the US, up from 25% at the end of last month.Along with the Japanese yen, the euro is one of the beneficiaries as investors have dumped the US dollar.Vasileios Gkionakis, a senior economist and strategist at the UK fund manager Aviva Investors, said there were several factors propelling the European single currency higher: the unwinding of the Trump/tariff trade; the seismic shift in Germany’s fiscal stance, alongside EU-wide announcements; and the hawkish interest rate cut by theEuropean Central Bank. Weaker-than-expected US economic data and a potential ceasefire in Russia’s war against Ukraine are also playing a role.“When push comes to shove,Europegets its act together and cracks on with structural changes: in sum, this is a sentiment and confidence shift and outright currency-positive,” he said. “Assuming that any tariff impact will not be material, how high can the euro go?”Some analysts predict the euro will reach $1.15 by the end of this year and $1.20 by the end of 2026. Gkionakis said he believes the $1.15 level could be hit “much sooner” than the end of the year.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsEuroDollarCurrenciesEuropeEconomicsSterlingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s based on fair and balanced, reciprocal trade and we’re engaging closely with the US administration to make the case for the UK to be exempt from proposed tariffs.“And, more broadly, we’ve been very clear that when it comes to the UK steel industry we remain prepared to defend the UK’s national interest where it’s right to do so. But we will continue to take a cool-headed approach to any speculation around tariffs.”He added: “We’ve got a £2.5bn commitment to invest to rebuild the UK steel industry and support communities now and for generations to come.”When Starmer visited the White House in February, Trump suggested a “real trade deal” between the US and the UK could mean tariffs were not necessary..Jonathan Reynolds, the trade and business secretary, also made the case for a UK exemption from the tariffs to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, in a phone call on Sunday. Unlike other countries, the UK does not have a big trade surplus with the US.According to government figures, 5% of Britain’s steel exports and 6% of aluminium exports by volume go to the US.Political leaders and industry bodies have warned the tariffs risk damaging the UK and global market. Gareth Stace, the director general of the industry group UK Steel, has described them as a “sledgehammer to free trade, with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world”.Japan and the EU have also made last-minute pleas for a U-turn, and Brussels has made clear it is ready to hit back with retaliatory measures. The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, said he spoke to Trump’s trade team when he visited Washington last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the end, one hand cannot clap,” Šefčovič told reporters in Brussels on Monday.Japan’s trade minister, Yoji Muto, headed to Washington this week for last-ditch negotiations on a range of Japanese exports including cars, steel and aluminium, but failed to win an exemption for his country, a key US ally.UK Steel has criticised the tariffs for primarily targeting US allies, such as the UK, as most other countries were already subject to 25% steel tariffs, while aluminium levies were previously 10%.The presidential executive order announcing the tariffs cited rising global excess capacity, forecast to hit 630m tonnes in 2026, and concerns over cheap steel shipments from China. The proclamation claimed that steel imports from Australia, the EU, Japan and the UK had risen from 18.6% in 2020 to 20.7% last year, proving that quotas had been ineffective.However, UK Steel pointed out that demand in 2020 was at a historical low because of the pandemic, and UK steel exports to the US last year were 14% lower than in 2018 when tariffs were first introduced.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryTrump tariffsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerInternational tradeEconomicsTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

But, amid a slump in car sales, one of its more obscure products that has nothing to do with automobiles is experiencing a boom: the VW currywurst.Described as the fuel of the carmaker’s own factory workers and served up daily in its numerous works canteens and nearby supermarkets, the snack has officially become the company’s most popular product.“More than 8 million Volkswagen original currywursts marks a new sales record for us,” VW’s chief human resources officer, Gunnar Kilian, said on social media this week.Currywurst – sliced sausage slathered in tomato sauce and sprinkled with curry powder and sometimes paprika – is one of Germany’s favourite dishes. The car manufacturer sold 8.5m of their own brand last year, a rise of 200,000 on 2023, a company spokesperson said.View image in fullscreenThe currywurst are all marked with their own official VW branding.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesVW, long one of the most iconic brands in an economy that for decades was Europe’s powerhouse butwhich has contracted for the past two years, has had little else to celebrate this week.The company’s annual report, released on Tuesday, showed net profit down 30.6% compared with the previous year owing to high production costs and decreased sales in China.The 10-brand group, whose models include Audi, Seat and Skoda alongside VW, had a challenging 2024, marked by along and bitter disputewith German unions that ended with a deal in December to cut 35,000 jobs by 2030.On Tuesday,the company’s finance chief, Arno Antlitz, said that “consistently reducing costs and increasing profitability” was VW’s goal, and that the company expected revenue this year to exceed the 2024 figure by “up to 5%”.But VW also acknowledged that challenges remained “arising from an environment characterised by political uncertainty, increasing trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions”. This includes a lack of clarity over Donald Trump’s threat to impose 25% tariffs on manufacturers in the EU.Volkswagen cuts plan sends shock through the ‘Detroit of east Germany’Read moreAway from the global turbulence, however, the company can rely on its sausages.The VW currywurst – which is available in the company’s 30 canteens and work site kiosks as well as local supermarkets near to its factories – is prepared according to a secret recipe known only to a handful of employees.Introduced in 1973, it is produced by the company’s own on-site butchers in its so-called service factory, considered so important to the running of the business it is branded as aVolkswagen Originalteil– an original part – and boasts its own parts number: 199 398 500 A.In 2021, VW bosses’ decision to strike the currywurst off the menu at the company’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, northern Germany, led to an outcry among workers.It also provoked the ire of the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder, one of the dish’s most famous fans and a former leader of the state of Lower Saxony where VW is based.He waded into the row, calling currywurst the “power bar of the skilled factory worker”. It was reinstated, with apologies, from company managers, who had said they had been responding to employees’ increasing calls for healthy vegetarian and vegan options.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeVolkswagen (VW)Automotive industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reaction of someone who knows that one of the biggest obstacles to PSG’s designs on a first Champions League title is out of the way.Liverpool suffered a role reversal in an epic last 16 second-leg tie at Anfield and their hopes of a seventh European crown are gone as a consequence. The home side were superior, profligate and lost 1-0, just as PSG didat Parc des Princes last week. The visiting goalkeeper again emerged the hero with Gianluigi Donnarumma, not Alisson, taking the acclaim after saving from Darwin Núñez and Curtis Jones in a penalty shootout. Ousmane Dembélé had levelled the tie on aggregate with an early goal but Liverpool had numerous chances to advance before the necessary spot-kicks.Slot sanguine after Liverpool exit in ‘best game of football I’ve ever been involved in’Read morePSG’s spot-kicks were flawless. Vitinha, brilliant all night, Gonçalo Ramos, Dembélé and finally Doué made no mistake at the Anfield Road end housing their own boisterous supporters. Mohamed Salah was the onlyLiverpoolplayer to convert in the shootout but his performance over 120 minutes was wasteful in the extreme. The penalty for failing to make home superiority count in the two legs was ultimately paid by Liverpool. Donnarumma, the man who broke English hearts in the 2020 European Championship final, proved the big man for the big penalty occasion once again.“Whoever wins tomorrow will go through to the final, I’ve no doubt,” Enrique had said on the eve of the tie. Hence the exuberance with which he greeted the outcome. The billing as a collision of the finest two teams in Europe was not an exaggeration. It was gripping, high-octane, high-calibre football from the start. Arne Slot claimed it was the best game of football he had been involved in. It will also rank among the most painful.The opening 12 minutes were the first leg in reverse. The dominator became the dominated as Liverpool started with an intensity and threat that was almost entirely absent at Parc des Princes. Alexis Mac Allister presented Salah with a glorious chance to open the scoring and double Liverpool’s aggregate lead with four minutes gone. Bursting onto Dominik Szoboszlai’s intelligent lay-off and into the box the midfielder squared to the better-placed forward rather than shooting himself. Salah seemed certain to score from close range but his shot struck Nuno Mendes and deflected over. Moments later Salah left the PSG left-back in a heap near the half-way line, surged into the area and curled wide. Such are the world class standards the Egypt international has set for himself, you expected him to score. The miscue, however, set the tone for his night.View image in fullscreenOusmane Dembélé races away to celebrate PSG’s early goal at Anfield.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APThe contrast with the first leg not only extended to Liverpool’s performance. PSG, so assured and composed until running into Alisson last week, were rattled initially. Willian Pacho, Achraf Hakimi and Donnarumma all poured oil on a fiery atmosphere by playing routine passes straight into touch. And having failed to score from 27 attempts in the first leg, PSG promptly scored from their opening attempt of the second leg.Quick GuideChampions League: Inter power past FeyenoordShowMarcus Thuram (pictured) and Hakan Calhanoglu were on target as Inter defeated Feyenoord 2-1 in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie to advance comfortably into the quarter-finals with a 4-1 aggregate win.Inter, the Serie A leaders, will face the Bundesliga table toppers Bayern Munich, whodefeated Bayer Leverkusen 5-0 on aggregate, in the quarter-finals next month. The three-time winners Inter last lifted the trophy in 2010, beating Bayern in the final in a treble-winning season, and Inzaghi's side are still on course to repeat that feat, with a Coppa Italia semi-final also to come in April.Feyenoord came into the game with an uphill task after losing 2-0 at home last week, and by the eighth minute they were left with a mountain to climb following Thuram's superb solo goal. Thuram, who also opened the scoring at De Kuip in the first leg, collected the ball on the left wing before cutting inside with some clever footwork before curling a shot into the far top corner.Mehdi Taremi sent a shot straight at the keeper as Inter looked to put the tie even further out of reach but Feyenoord pulled one back three minutes before the break from the penalty spot.Calhanoglu was penalised for a foul on Jakub Moder who picked himself up and sent his spot kick into the bottom corner to beat Yann Sommer, just the second goal Inter have conceded in this season's competition, and the first at  San Siro.Any hope of a Feyenoord comeback all but ended when Calhanoglu made up for his mistake by converting his own penalty six minutes into the second half after Thomas Beelen fouled Taremi.With Feyenoord taking risks in an effort to get something from the game, Inter were always dangerous on the counter and looked like they had another penalty but after a VAR check, Thuram was booked for simulation instead.Thuram still received a standing ovation from the home crowd when replaced, having just struck a thunderous shot which bounced back off the underside of the crossbar, and Inter had little trouble seeing the game out.ReutersPhotograph: Marcel van Dorst/Rex FeaturesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Liverpool were badly exposed the first time the visitors broke their relentless press. Mendes played a low diagonal ball from left back that caught out the entire Liverpool midfield. Dembélé collected in space and released Bradley Barcola down the right, who attempted to return a cross to the in-form striker as he sprinted into the area. Ibrahima Konaté got there first but succeeded only in nudging Barcola’s delivery around Alisson and towards his own goal. Dembélé was left with a simple tap-in.Alisson made important saves from Barcola and Dembélé in the first half. The France international picked out Khvicha Kvaratskhelia unmarked inside the Liverpool area from the byline. The Georgia international’s blistering effort was destined for the top corner until a Ryan Gravenberch toe diverted it over. A Dembélé strike, curled from the edge of the box, was also deflected just wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Donnarumma produced a fine save to claw away Luis Díaz’s glancing header from a Mac Allister corner. Mendes blocked a goalbound drive from Szoboszlai and both Salah and Díaz failed to capitalise from a promising counterattack.Alexander-Arnold was forced out of the tie and probably Sunday’s Carabao Cup final when injuring himself in a challenge on Vitinha. His replacement, Jarell Quansah, twice came close to heading Liverpool into the quarter-finals. Quansah’s first attempt from another Mac Allister corner sailed just over. His second, from an Andy Robertson free-kick, beat Donnarumma but struck the inside of a post.Donnarumma was forced to take evasive action repeatedly as Liverpool exerted constant pressure in the closing stages of normal time. The PSG threat had been virtually non-existent in the second half but they were the more dangerous side in extra time. Doué, a potent replacement for Barcola, was centimetres away from a crucial second goal. Alisson saved brilliantly when Dembélé aimed for his bottom corner. PSG swarmed over Liverpool in the final stages but reserved their punishment until the shootout. As Enrique cavorted on the Anfield pitch, Slot was left to ponder what might have been.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolParis Saint-Germainmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump, then in his first term as president, had attacked players who knelt during the anthem to protest against racial inequality. At the time, Trump wrote on social media that the Eagles were in dispute “with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.”Charles Barkley calls athletes who won’t visit Trump’s White House ‘stupid’. I disagree | Etan ThomasRead moreIn the buildup to this year’sSuper Bowl, Eagles offensive lineman Lane Johnson said he would be happy to visit the White House. “I’d be honored to go, regardless of who the president is, but we’ll see. It’s ultimately a team decision. I’ll do what’s best for the team,” Johnson said. In the aftermath of the team’s victory, head coach Nick Sirianni said “we’ll see as we go” when asked about a decision on the visit.While Trump’s first term in office led to a number of athletes, such as LeBron James and Megan Rapinoe, criticizing the president,there has been little pushbackfrom the sports world so far in his second term. In February, Trump became the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl, andhis presence was welcomed by several players, including the Kansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.Teams who have won a major championship are traditionally invited to the White House to celebrate their victory with the president. However, during Trump’s first-term several teams were not invited or made it clear they would not attend if they were. Those teams included theNBA’s Golden State Warriors, and the United States Women’s National Teamafter their victoryat the 2019 Women’s World Cup.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesSuper BowlSuper Bowl LIXNFLTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

NFL Network reported the contract could be worth over $17m for the 2025 season if the 27-year-old reaches performance targets.Jones, the No 6 overall pick in 2019 by the Giants, will get a chance to compete with Anthony Richardson in Indianapolis. Richardson, the fourth pick in the 2023 draft, is 8-7 as a starter in two seasons but has been plagued by inconsistency and injuries.“I think consistency is the biggest thing,” Colts head coach Shane Steichen said in February when asked where he wanted to see Richardson improve. “We’ve had these conversations, myself and him, about being consistent. He’s played 15 games, he played 11 last year and did some really good things, but we’re just looking for the consistency, right?”NFL free agency: Darnold set for Seattle in reported $110.5m deal as Fields heads to JetsRead moreJones had been on the Vikings practice squad after leaving New York but Minnesota appear set to start JJ McCarthy, who missed his rookie season with a knee injury.

He quickly signed as a free agent with the Vikings for the rest of the season but didn’t appear in any games. Jones has 14,582 passing yards, 70 touchdown passes and 47 interceptions in 70 career games (69 starts). He has 2,179 rushing yards with 15 TDs.Elsewhere on Tuesday, Houston’s offensive line overhaul shifted gears as the Texans added to their stellar secondary in a deal with the Eagles, sending guard Kenyon Green to Philadelphia for safety CJ Gardner-Johnson, according to multiple reports.Green was traded to the NFC East one day after Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil was dealt to the Washington Commanders. Green is likely to play right guard and replace Mekhi Becton, who is an unrestricted free agent. The Eagles also will receive Houston’s fifth-round pick in 2026, and Philadelphia’s sixth-round selection will go to the Texans.Gardner-Johnson, 27, will relocate for the fourth consecutive season. A 2019 draft pick of the New Orleans Saints, he joined the Eagles in 2022, played for the Lions in 2023 and rejoined Philadelphia to help deliver a Super Bowl LIX victory last season. Gardner-Johnson had six interceptions in each of his two seasons with the Eagles and has a total of 18 in 74 career regular-season games.Green, 23, was the 15th overall pick in the 2022 draft and has 23 career starts in 27 games. He started the first nine games in 2024 before being placed on injured reserve with a dislocated left shoulder. After 14 starts at right guard as a rookie, Green missed his second season in 2023 to have surgery to repair a torn labrum.Meanwhile, defensive tackle Solomon Thomas agreed to a two-year, $8m contract with the Dallas Cowboys. Thomas, 29, spent the past three seasons with the New York Jets. He had nine total sacks as a 3-4 defensive end in New York playing for defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, a new addition to the Cowboys’ coaching staff.The third overall pick in the 2017 draft by the San Francisco 49ers, he suffered a season-ending ACL tear in Week 2 of his fourth season (2020) and joined the Jets as a free agent in 2022. He spent the 2021 season with the Las Vegas Raiders. Thomas went to high school in Coppell, Texas, which is less than 30 minutes from the Cowboys’ training facility in Frisco. He has 18.5 career sacks over 115 games.Teams can’t officially sign free agents until Wednesday, the start of the new league year.Explore more on these topicsNFLIndianapolis ColtsNew York GiantsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is a notable absentee from the Players Championship this week, with a lack of appearances in the early part of this year partly due to the death of his mother in early February.PGA Tour could name and shame slow-play offenders after player unrestRead moreThe assumption was that the 15-time major champion would tee up at Augusta National in April. However, Woods all but ruled that out with a surprising social media post on Tuesday.“As I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured,” Woods wrote on X. “This morning, Dr Charlton Stucken of Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida performed a minimally invasive achilles tendon repair for a ruptured tendon.“I am back home now and plan to focus on my recovery and rehab, thank you for all the support.” Woods added that Stucken had said “the surgery went smoothly and we expect a full recovery”.Woods has been beset by injury problems in recent times but also tore his right achilles in 2008. Knee and back problems were subsequently encountered by the most successful golfer of his generation. Woods partnered his son, Charlie, in the PNC Championship last December and has been a regular participant in the tech-infused golf league he launched with Rory McIlroy.“My heart is really not into practising right now,” Woods said in March. “Once I start probably feeling a little bit better and start getting into it, I’ll start looking at the schedule.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is absolutely no truth to those allegations. I do not know and have never met the person that filed the suit. I was not anywhere near Orinda, CA at that time.

It was 3-1 by then,4-1 on aggregate, and Bruno Lage’s team were flattered by the one. And, in fact, by the three. The shot count read 12-1.The hope now less that they could find a way back into it as that it might be over, and so it was. There was little need for more, Barcelona easing their way to the finish, managing the remaining 45 minutes.From the first minute, when Frenkie de Jong had driven at them, there was a sense of mission about Barcelona, the game taking shape then one of speed, open spaces, and skill. Especially when Lamine Yamal had the ball, which was often.View image in fullscreenRaphinha scores Barça’s third goal.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersNot that it was just him. Pedri, once so physically vulnerable, now seems invincible, a steel to go with the smoothness. Dani Olmo detected gaps no one else did, somehow always seeming to have room. From further back, Alex Balde repeatedly came bombing forward. Raphinha was, again, decisive.How Benfica must be sick of the man who took his total against them to five in three games here. Only Robert Lewandowski was not at his best. Twice he received near the penalty spot, the first provided by Lamine Yamal, the second by Olmo; both times he would have expected to score, neither time did he.The other two forwards did. Barcelona took the lead on 11 minutes and lost it again two minutes later but it didn’t matter. Lamine Yamal had made that first chance for Lewandowski, now he made the opener for Raphinha. Cutting one way then back again, twisting Florentino Luís’s hips, he seemed to be opening up his body to bend the ball towards the far corner but the shot, scuffed slightly, faded rightwards, accidentally turning into the perfect cross for Raphinha instead.

The three-time winners Inter last lifted the trophy in 2010, beating Bayern in the final in a treble-winning season, and Inzaghi's side are still on course to repeat that feat, with a Coppa Italia semi-final also to come in April.Feyenoord came into the game with an uphill task after losing 2-0 at home last week, and by the eighth minute they were left with a mountain to climb following Thuram's superb solo goal. Thuram, who also opened the scoring at De Kuip in the first leg, collected the ball on the left wing before cutting inside with some clever footwork before curling a shot into the far top corner.Mehdi Taremi sent a shot straight at the keeper as Inter looked to put the tie even further out of reach but Feyenoord pulled one back three minutes before the break from the penalty spot.Calhanoglu was penalised for a foul on Jakub Moder who picked himself up and sent his spot kick into the bottom corner to beat Yann Sommer, just the second goal Inter have conceded in this season's competition, and the first at  San Siro.Any hope of a Feyenoord comeback all but ended when Calhanoglu made up for his mistake by converting his own penalty six minutes into the second half after Thomas Beelen fouled Taremi.With Feyenoord taking risks in an effort to get something from the game, Inter were always dangerous on the counter and looked like they had another penalty but after a VAR check, Thuram was booked for simulation instead.Thuram still received a standing ovation from the home crowd when replaced, having just struck a thunderous shot which bounced back off the underside of the crossbar, and Inter had little trouble seeing the game out.ReutersPhotograph: Marcel van Dorst/Rex FeaturesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They had barely finished celebrating whenNicolás Otamendiheaded in from Andreas Schjelderup’s corner at the other end, the ball reaching him off Lewandowski. So Barcelona just did it all over again, the chances still coming. As for Lamine Yamal, he didthat.The 17-year-old was by the corner flag when he started to move. There was a shift of the hips and he escaped Tomás Araújo, entering the penalty area at the side and exiting it at the top, literally cutting off the corner, space now to shoot. Only “shot” is not really the word for what he did next, even “kick” is not. Instead, he nudged the ball, little more than the flip of an ankle, yet enough to somehow send it 20 yards into the far corner. It curled and floated and drifted, entirely deliberately, travelling almost teasingly, as if it was waving on its way past Anatoliy Trubin: you can look but you can’t touch.View image in fullscreenRaphinha polishes the boot of Yamal after the 17-year-old’s goal.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersRaphinha came over and polished Lamine Yamal’s boot, then added the third when Balde burst up the middle of the pitch and rolled the ball into his path. The finish was hard, low and unstoppable, even for the linesman whose flag was raised and then overruled by the VAR, allowing him to stand atop the advertising boards, arms wide, the moment shared with this stadium.All that prevented Barcelona adding more was the fact that they did not need to, this was done. It was not that there were no chances in the second half – it began with Ronald Araújo heading into the side-netting and a flick from Lamine Yamal almost releasing Olmo – but the pace dropped, the urgency gone.Benfica tried, of course, Vangelis Pavlidis striking straight at Wojciech Szczesny and Iñigo Martínez diving in to block Samuel Dahl’s shot, the ball coming back off his elbow. There was a brief VAR check but no real belief that it would lead to anything, those few seconds a portrait of the second period.Other than Zeki Amdouni’s header being stopped on the line by Jules Koundé with five minutes left, mostly Benfica had played with little real faith of another goal. Not least because they were not truly allowed any. Barcelona’s control remained intact, this no longer feeling like a contest. Instead, it was a homage, just as they had hoped it would be, dedicated to the doctor.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBarcelonaBenficamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Speaking ahead of the Players Championship, the Tour’s commissioner, Jay Monahan, revealed the imminent arrival of new sanctions which could include the naming and shaming of offenders.The two-time major champion Collin Morikawa had already made clear that the PGA Tour’s current pace of play policies – which only occasionally sees golfers fined – are unfit for purpose. “I think you just have to start stroking guys and giving guys actual penalties, whether it be strokes or FedExCup [points],” Morikawa said. “What I’ve learned is that monetary fines are useless. We make so much money and some guys frankly could not care less.”Golf’s peace deal is no closer – is it time for PGA Tour to end talks with LIV?Read moreMonahan, who had previously rebuffed the widespread sense that slow play was an issue worth tackling, has taken note. “We’ve committed to addressing the speed of play,” said the commissioner. “To that end, I’m excited to formally announce these recommendations from our player-led speed-of-play working group. We will begin publishing speed-of-play related statistics later this season. We will also begin testing a new speed-of-play policy on the Korn Ferry Tour and PGA Tour Americas, beginning next month, which will include assessing penalty strokes for slow play.”Strangely, Monahan would not directly address whether those punished would have their names shared with the public. However, it is understood that very plan is under consideration. Monahan added: “This is not done so from the standpoint of negativity; there’s also a really positive element to this. They’re celebrating the players that are playing faster and improving, and at the same time there’s giving players the information that they need to have to be able to improve in the eyes of not only how they’re competing but also in the eyes of our fans.“So I look at this as a very positive development and I think it’s pretty telling that when you’ve got six player directors that sit on our boards and you’ve got 16 members of our Player Advisory Council that there’s a lot of shaking of the heads and there’s an understanding that this is an area where we need to improve and we’re committed to doing so.”Justin Thomas believes posting the names of slow players in locker rooms would be sufficient. “It would obviously end up getting out,” Thomas said. “Nobody wants to be known as that. I’m the first to admit I mean I’m on the slow side of players. It bothers me. I’ve talked to many officials about it, I want to know why I’m slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they’re not slow.”Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Matrix structures are by definition amorphous, confusing, and create places for people to hide.Hmm. That does sound bad, Sir Jim. Talk me through it one more time, these frustrating corporate shields, these blame-avoidance tactics you’re so worried about. But first could you please just come out from behind the table. And stop doing that admittedly very good Donald Duck voice.Taking in the full text of this year’s annual SirJim Ratcliffelecture, conveyed on this occasion via newspapers, TV and a gruelling 40 minutes with Gary Neville, is a genuinely confusing exercise. Not just because Ratcliffe has once again come armed with a script, key lines, boilerplate defences, which he repeats with impressive accuracy but also subtle variations. But because almost everything he says, despite being delivered in a hammy, straight-talking gunslinger style, needs to be stared at with hawk-like focus just to work out what he’s actually saying.‘Eiffel Tower of the north’? Manchester United unveil 100,000-seat new stadium projectRead moreTwo obvious points leap out. The most obvious, one that should concern not only supporters ofManchester Unitedbut frankly everyone, given we are all now stakeholders in this regeneration project, is the extreme and visceral levels of BS involved.The phrase “BS” is used advisedly here. This is, like the quote above on matrix structures, another borrowing from the famedIneos corporate “Compass”. Both are listed under theWords we don’t likesection. Except it seems that sometimes we do like these things, given the sheer density of double-speak, evasion and vagueness contained in the latest Ratcliffe instalment. Compasses. John Donne was right. These are treacherous things.As ever there is something galling in the idea Ratcliffe should be given credit simply for answering questions and “fronting up” in this way. This is essentially his job. What is he anyway? A slash‑and-burn merchant, a cost‑cutter, a purchaser and repackager of distressed assets. This is how he reached this stage. As such he is a handy frontman for the Manchester United leisure project; and above all an investor with a very keen eye on his own stake.Spend money like it’s your own.So we get this now-familiar tableau, Ratcliffe sitting there looking like Guido Fawkes is in charge of a recruitment consultancy and wants to talk to you about opportunities in conference management, spouting things that are, at best, a little questionable.It is hard to say which was the most jaw-dropping moment. The implication that low-paid people whose perks include a plate of food are essentially freeloaders. Or the ability to list every element of financial peril, but not his fellow owners the Glazer family, who have created and overseen almost all of these problems.As ever it is hard to avoid marvelling at the Glazers’ efficiency, the incredible job they’ve done by bringing in the perfect front. Ratcliffe is ruthless enough to act as a kind of anti‑Rashford, here not to give you your lunch but to take it away, all the while presenting himself as the local boy, financial Gandalf, a picture of reassuring Ducal Englishness. Plus he’s prepared to say whatever it takes to gloss that cognitive dissonance. Maybe the problem with Sheikh Jassim, who may or may not have been a stock photograph, was that he was just too reasonable. Guys, I’m not saying all that. Sack who?View image in fullscreenThe Glazers remain the focus of fan discontent at Old TraffordPhotograph: Phil Noble/ReutersHiding. Wafflers. Wasting time.More from theWords we don’t likesection. Or do we? It is worth itemising the more obviously questionable statements. The top line in Ratcliffe’s address is the assertion the clubwould have gone bustby Christmas without his penny-saving exercise. No evidence was produced to support this. In reality Manchester United are not going bust if you don’t sack the tea lady. Forget the guaranteed income and the scale of the business. It’s also owned by one of the richest men in Britain, who keeps saying he’s a fan, but who now seems to be saying: I would not bail this club out and would instead watch it die. In the end this is basically a threat. Go bust or do it my way. Which one do you want?So it went on. Ratcliffe said the club’s true state of financial peril was hidden in a “forest of numbers”. Hang on. Here we have a famously shrewd tycoon who spent a billion pounds on his share, apparently without doing full due diligence because there were just too many numbers and it was “overwhelming”.Meanwhile everyone knows the numbers are terrible. This is a club that owes £300m in transfer fees and has paid a billion in debt repayments, where the only certainty in any dealing is you’re owed a lot, whose current defensive left side is literally Yoro-Dalot. Which option is more alarming here? Not actually knowing the numbers? Or pretending not to?We learned that the real problem is that the club lost “£254m” over three years due to inherited financial bungling. But since Ratcliffe began running the football side United have spent £200m on players who have made almost zero impression. Millions more have gone on fiddling about with managers. This is not a forest of numbers. It’s an orderly olive grove. Everyone can see it. What Ratcliffe is saying with these numbers is: the choices we have made mean the club would have gone bust. Losing money. Arrogance. Entitlement. You said it, Compass.The Compass also tells us politics and turf wars “erode efficiency”. But thedeparture of Dan Ashworthwas still about “chemistry”, a clash of personality that “I wasn’t prepared to live with”. As for blame culture, well, this is apparently fine when it comes tolisting players who are letting you down, those who are still being paid for, out on loan or not in the team. How is this supposed to help the dressing room or the sell-on process? Don’t do dumb shit. Also the Compass there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFinally, of course, there was the blame-avoidance stuff. Time and again Ratcliffe sought refuge in his own matrix structures. “It’s not just me. It’s Omar and Dave and lots of the other guys you don’t see.” Hmm. Those other guys, eh? A decision on a player “isn’t just for one person, it’s a group”. Who actually runs the club? “At the end of the day its the management team that operates Manchester United.” OK, OK. So who appointed Ruben? “All of us.”Usseems a key word in this context, as in: us and them and us and you. It isn’t hard to see what Ratcliffe’s real interests are. Essentially this boils down to two things. His investment in the club makes no sense without some idea of a return. At which point, enter the Old Trafford regional regeneration project. This was unveiled on Tuesday morning, complete with drawings of Norman Foster’s proposed new stadium, which looks like a Pac-Man ghost, or like someone threw a massive handkerchief over Dubai.Ratcliffe is of course a shield and enabler for the real owners, a far more palatable face for any regeneration money“We’re not going to ask the government for any money to build the ground,” Ratcliffe said, but this is also mild double-speak as the ground and its surrounds are inextricably linked. The transport, the infrastructure, the piazza twice as big as Trafalgar Square are all key to making the stadium profitable on the desired scale.So the stadium announcement is essentially a pitch for public money. “Manchester United has thrown its support behind the government’s growth agenda,” was a very funny, passive-aggressive way of putting this. Jobs, homes, growth and very large random sums of money are all promised. The regeneration is vital to the area. It will make a substantial difference to many people’s lives. But who is it going to enrich along the way? This is what Ineos does with its assets, with a public handout a very handy addition. This is of course the same billionaire who announced that “nobody ever gave me a free lunch”, while taking away someone else’s.Banter. This is also on the Compass.Plus Ratcliffe is of course a shield and enabler for the real owners, and a far more palatable face for any regeneration money. Gary Neville was pretty good at holding his feet to the fire over acting as “an umbrella” for the Glazers, who have taken £166m out in dividends, and who remain the chief cause and beneficiaries of all this cost-cutting.View image in fullscreenLike someone threw a massive handkerchief over Dubai: a design of the proposed new Old Trafford stadium.Photograph: ReutersThis brought forth from Ratcliffe a reel of nauseating excuses about being thousands of miles away and about the incompetence of previous placemen regimes. But then the job here for Ratcliffe is to keep the wheels turning, to offer a distracting plausibility at a club so bound up in its narrative of crises even the current unhappiness has become a kind of brand-fuel, something to be retailed. Wait. Do we have an official protest partner? And where are you getting those bulk black shirts?Meanwhile football is once again giving us a lesson in how the world works, the post-truth dynamic where money moves, power goes to work, and in the foreground people make noise and say distracting things.Mainly the feeling with Ratcliffe is a kind of sadness. Here we have perhaps the richest person in the country. This is our guy. This is England, all cost-cutting and double‑speak, too small to sustain its own parts, out there still selling off the family vinyl. Watching Ratcliffe trawl through this waffle is like realising dad doesn’t actually know what he’s doing. Or, even worse, that he’s not actually here to help.At least the Ineos Compass has a few more words of wisdom. Among the most recent high‑level departures announced at Old Trafford is the head of human resources. Let’s just get that straight. Ineos is now making the person who oversaw its redundancies redundant.

Perhaps it has in the Champions League, too, given Bayern Munich are in the quarter-finals for a sixth successive year. If Inter are treated with the same brutality they inflicted uponBayer Leverkusen, whose brief spell as domestic kryptonite appears comprehensively over, they may move closer to lifting the trophy on home soil in May.This may not have been as sedate as the walking pace at which Harry Kane nudged the opener but, in truth, it was not far off. Bayern never looked like losing even a fraction of the three-goal leadamassed in the first legand could count once again on the England captain, whose presence on their scoresheet does not seem such a luxury any more.PSG beat Liverpool on penalties in Champions League last-16, second leg – live reactionRead moreSomething feels different this season and, in setting up Alphonso Davies for an emphatic second, he proved again that his efforts form part of a coherent whole nowadays. Vincent Kompany’s side are purring and any predictions that this tie would confirm a longer-term shift in the Bundesliga’s traditional power balance have been made to look absurd.Might Xabi Alonso come to wish he had quit while he was ahead? That may be a dramatic reading but Leverkusen, having performed spectacularly to overhaul Bayern last year, may find it harder to check their momentum again now. The sweet spot appears to have long gone, although it would be remiss to ignore the fact Leverkusen outplayed Bayern here in the league a month ago. They did not score that day either, though, and have an eight-point gap to bridge domestically. Over the past week the gulf has looked startlingly vast.This time Leverkusen could point to the absence of Florian Wirtz, whose next action in this competition will come wearing Bayern’s colours if his suitors have their way. The playmaker’s weekend injury meant that, to all intents and purposes, dreams of a comeback were over before they had taken hold. Leverkusen needed to show that the sum of their parts was bigger than the awesome talent watching from the stands, but Alonso always seemed hard pushed to devise a formula that could compensate.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane was able to walk his goal in against Bayer Leverkusen.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APInstead Kane could look towards a last-eight clash whose winners may be favoured to go the distance. “We showed what type of team we are,” he said, referring to their progress since grisly league phase results against Barcelona and Feyenoord. “We pressed high and with intensity. That’s what we wanted to come here and do. It’s never easy when you have a three-goal lead.”It remains to be seen whether that aphorism catches on. Perhaps Kane could sympathise with the importance Leverkusen ascribe to Wirtz: after all, Pep Guardiolaonce named an entire Spurs teamafter him. Here Bayern looked much more like a collective even though, as usual, he was poised at the sharp end. Within 15 minutes of the start he could have scored twice, Lukas Hradecky clawing away from near the line and beating away a meatier strike from distance. The openings never quite dried up despite Leverkusen’s hyperactivity.Quick GuideChampions League: Inter power past FeyenoordShowMarcus Thuram (pictured) and Hakan Calhanoglu were on target as Inter defeated Feyenoord 2-1 in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie to advance comfortably into the quarter-finals with a 4-1 aggregate win.Inter, the Serie A leaders, will face the Bundesliga table toppers Bayern Munich, whodefeated Bayer Leverkusen 5-0 on aggregate, in the quarter-finals next month. The three-time winners Inter last lifted the trophy in 2010, beating Bayern in the final in a treble-winning season, and Inzaghi's side are still on course to repeat that feat, with a Coppa Italia semi-final also to come in April.Feyenoord came into the game with an uphill task after losing 2-0 at home last week, and by the eighth minute they were left with a mountain to climb following Thuram's superb solo goal. Thuram, who also opened the scoring at De Kuip in the first leg, collected the ball on the left wing before cutting inside with some clever footwork before curling a shot into the far top corner.Mehdi Taremi sent a shot straight at the keeper as Inter looked to put the tie even further out of reach but Feyenoord pulled one back three minutes before the break from the penalty spot.Calhanoglu was penalised for a foul on Jakub Moder who picked himself up and sent his spot kick into the bottom corner to beat Yann Sommer, just the second goal Inter have conceded in this season's competition, and the first at  San Siro.Any hope of a Feyenoord comeback all but ended when Calhanoglu made up for his mistake by converting his own penalty six minutes into the second half after Thomas Beelen fouled Taremi.With Feyenoord taking risks in an effort to get something from the game, Inter were always dangerous on the counter and looked like they had another penalty but after a VAR check, Thuram was booked for simulation instead.Thuram still received a standing ovation from the home crowd when replaced, having just struck a thunderous shot which bounced back off the underside of the crossbar, and Inter had little trouble seeing the game out.ReutersPhotograph: Marcel van Dorst/Rex FeaturesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The home side wore their desperation too clearly. Alonso had admitted that a dose of chaos, rather than the control he prefers, might be required but the effect was a jumpiness that wrought little. Passes pinged off knees and toes; footings were lost and bodies opened up prematurely. A formidable Bayern press, of the kind that had smothered them in Bavaria, abetted the confusion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At one stage Alonso gestured for his players to compose themselves; to dispense with the one-touch stuff and make the ball work. They mustered squalls of pressure but the only poise on display oozed from Bayern’s cream jerseys, who marauded regularly and came close again through Michael Olise and Kingsley Coman.At the break Alonso may have hung on to memories of Istanbul; of the heady, swirling, Technicolor night 20 years ago when he and Liverpool took victory from Milan’s clenched jaws. But soon enough Leverkusen needed four goals, not three. Kane’s 33rd of the season may have been his strangest, a straight Joshua Kimmich free-kick evading Schick and Kim Min-jae with Hradecky rooted. Kane could control and stroll it home; so much for fretting about the outcome.Leverkusen flickered, Jonas Urbig saving from Jeremie Frimpong and Schick. But Bayern were long gone, Kane helping the ball on at the end of a slick right-sided move for Davies to sidefoot crisply on the bounce. There was plenty of time for Kane to miss when through and Jamal Musiala to strike the woodwork twice, but the statement had long since been made.“I think the boys showed again today how hungry they are for what they want to achieve,” a clearly satisfied Vincent Kompany said. “We’ve won now, and I don’t want to get too carried away.” If the most dangerous foe is the one you know best, then others may be tempted to do that.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichBayer Leverkusenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It claims a broader agreement over “joint inspections” in the three host countries for the 2026 tournament – Mexico, the US and Canada – had been negotiated withFifa, only for the governing body to pull out before signing.Fifa says inits human rights policythat it “strives to uphold and promote the highest international labour standards” and that it “seeks to ensure respect for labour standards by its business partners and in the various activities directly linked to its operations”.The general secretary of the BWI, Ambet Yuson, said Fifa was “dodging its responsibility” towards workers and that the governing body for global football had failed to learn from the human rights concerns related to recent tournaments.“Fifa keeps promising the world a spectacle while dodging its responsibility to the very workers making it possible,” Yuson said. “Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, has no problem appearing in photo ops with the US president, yet Fifa can’t even guarantee basic protections for workers building its own World Cup show.“They learned nothing from Qatar and Russia. No more excuses. No more delays. Fifa must act now, or North America 2026 Fifa World Cup will be another case of broken promises and neglected workers.”A Fifa spokesperson said: “The Azteca Stadium and its construction process is not managed by Fifa. However, in line with its human rights policy, Fifa strives to respect and promote the highest international labour standards and seeks to ensure that the rights of workers in the various activities directly related to its operations are upheld.“Fifa, through its local team and in close cooperation with the Azteca Stadium, is actively engaging with stakeholders and monitoring the conditions offered to the workers. As part of that, the labour rights protections on site are supervised by a local union, the Confederación Autónoma de Trabajadores y Empleados de México (CATEM). In addition, the work to ensure compliance with labour standards also includes engagement with the Mexican Chamber of the Construction Industry (CMIC). Workers’ rights and compliance with national and international labour requirements is of the utmost importance to Fifa.

Saliba, who has excelled at Arsenal since he was recalled from Ligue 1 loans in 2022, said he had yet to open talks over a new deal but was adamant he wants to win silverware with the club.“I’m really happy here,” he said. “Because we have some years [to go]. There is no rush at the minute. I want to win big things with Arsenal. If you leave this club without winning anything the fans will forget about you. I want to win big things here.”Arsenal head into the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against PSV on Wednesdaywith a 7-1 advantage, with the winners to face Real or Atlético Madrid in the last eight. Asked whether Arsenal were capable of going all the way in a competition they have never won, Saliba said: “If we don’t believe or if we don’t dream to win the Champions League there is no point to play … We can do it, we all believe that we can do it. We have to work and pray as well.”The 23-year-old admitted he had not been happy with his form this season despite Arsenal having the best defensive record in the Premier League and conceding only four goals in nine Champions League matches. “I want to be one day the best defender in the world,” he said. “I know I have to work a lot and to win trophies as well – but that’s my dream.“I am not the best at the moment because, for me, this season I have not been so good. I have to review my season, I have to work on my game. But this season, I have not been so good. I have to watch especially my partner, Gabriel [Magalhães], who has been so, so good this season.

All these adjectives and more greeted Tuesday morning’s announcement that Manchester Unitedwill build a 100,000-seater stadiumto replace Old Trafford, and construct it within a five-year period. Add some context and one has to admire, above all, Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s chutzpah. Debts for his petrochemicals empire areforecast to reach almost £10bn this year. The All Blacks aretaking legal action against Ineosfor exiting a sponsorship deal early. Big Sir Jim has introduced a raft of cost-cutting measures at United, includingmore than 400 job lossesand closure of the staff canteen.On Monday he said that without those savings the clubwould have been bankrupt by Christmas. The men’s team, meanwhile, sit 14th in the Premier League, at times flirting with a relegation scrap. The squad, Big Sir Jim says, are overpaid andin some cases not good enough. Still, theBrexit-supportingMonaco tax exileinsists United are capable of building a venue that will be the envy not just of the Premier League, but the entire world. It will, he claims, create as many as 92,000 jobs and generate £7.3bn annually for the UK economy. With an all-important caveat, Big Sir Jim sought to put pressure on the government, by saying the success of the project will hinge on their commitment to it. “Ifthe government really gets behind this regeneration scheme,” he declared, “then we will build an iconic football stadium.”Having been transformed into a debt-laden investment vehicle for the enrichment of a few at the expense of many, Manchester United is the perfect symbol of modern Britain. The Glazers have been siphoning cash out of the place for 20 years, a fact gently hinted at by Big Sir Jim when he said Old Trafford has “fallen behind” other leading sports venues. All of this required the type of mental gymnastics befitting the proposed stadium’s circus-tent design – incidentally called an “umbrella” by Foster + Partners architects, appropriate enough given theperpetually leaky Old Trafford roof. “It will hugely benefit that region which I am very close to,” Ratcliffe trumpeted. Although notthatclose, Jim, since you moved to Monaco?Amid all the excitement – including a Gary Neville voiceover that made you worry Michael Owen would soon appear in a CGI helicopter – big questions remain. How much is it going to cost, and who will pay? Omar Berrada, theManchester Unitedchief suit, was predictably evasive on the tricky subject of money. “It’s still quite early,” he whistled. “As a PLC we can’t speculate too much about the funding. What I would say is as the centrepiece of the regeneration project, it is a very attractive investment opportunity.” Like so many modern infrastructure projects, then, it will be about “creating value”, “commercial potential” and, as Sebastian Coe perplexingly put it, “the unlocking of other potentialities”. Being such an attractive investment opportunity, perhaps the Glazers might be interested in ploughing some cash in? Or would that, like so much of the noise emanating from Manchester United on this day, be a little too far-fetched?LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray at 5.45pm (all times GMT) for updates on Barcelona 2-0 Benfica (agg: 3-0) in the second leg of their last-16 Bigger Cup tie, while Yara El-Shaboury will be on hand at 8pm for Liverpool 1-0 PSG (agg: 2-0).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it was debunked in the space of four chaotic minutes of extraordinary drama on Tuesday.Jeremy Scott’s mare Golden Ace, at 25-1, emerged as one of the most unexpected of allChampion Hurdlewinners, at the end of a race in which both Constitution Hill and State Man – the champions in 2023 and 2024 respectively – were fallers.New-look Cheltenham festival delivers day of drama for smaller audienceRead moreA much-anticipated renewal of hurdling’s championship event, with Constitution Hill’s 10-race unbeaten record on the line as he attempted to seize back his crown, followed a predictable script to the fifth flight, with Constitution Hill, the odds-on favourite, settled in third behind his main market rival, Brighterdaysahead. But his proud, perfect record was gone in an instant a few seconds later, as the favourite clipped the top of the hurdle and tipped over.His exit left Brighterdaysahead as the hot favourite in running, but she was already being ridden by Jack Kennedy as State Man, the defending champion, loomed up on her outside around the home turn.State Man was clearly travelling much better than Brighterdaysahead and surged into an apparently decisive five-length lead on the run to the last, with Golden Ace moving into second. Just as it had for Constitution Hill, though, a clip of the hurdle was enough to send him crashing out, leaving Golden Ace – who was running in the Champion Hurdle only at the insistence of her owner, Ian Gosden – to pick up the spoils.Both Constitution Hill and State Man emerged from their falls unscathed, while Lorcan Williams, Golden Ace’s jockey, summed up the general mood as he waited to pick up his prize afterwards.“I’m shell-shocked,” Williams said. “Literally, I cannot believe it. She wasn’t travelling as well as I wanted in the latter part of the race, all I was thinking was that we could do with a bit further. Then I thought, ‘we’re staying on well for second’, and things started to happen.”Williams admitted he and Scott had been “pushing [to run Golden Ace in] the Mares’ Hurdle massively”, earlier on the card, before being overruled by Gosden. “Massive call,” he said. “I’m just glad he did it.”For Scott – a former dairy farmer and point-to-point trainer who sold off his herd to pursue a full-time career as a trainer – paid tribute to Camilla, his wife, and the rest of the team at his yard as he celebrated only the second festival success of his career, following Golden Ace’s defeat of Brighterdaysahead in the Mares’ Novice Hurdle last year.View image in fullscreenState Man falls at the final hurdle and hampers Brighterdaysahead as Golden Ace, second right, goes clear to win the Champion Hurdle.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I couldn’t even dream it,” Scott said. “Thump me, because I must be fast asleep at the moment. I think my team at home will be as flabbergasted as I am. Camilla does a lot of the work at home and she has the patience of a saint. She’s the genius, rather than me.“My owner and I were not at loggerheads, because ultimately he pays the bills [and] he was very keen to have a runner here today. We thought we could nick a little bit of prize money and we didn’t feel we could possibly beat Lossiemouth [in the Mares’ Hurdle] so it’s extraordinary how things work out.”Nicky Henderson, Constitution Hill’s trainer, reported afterwards that his eight-year-old was “very bright and breezy” after his fall. “He seems fine,” Henderson said.“He has been in terrific form [at home], but poor old State Man as well. You couldn’t believe those two silly old fools have gone and done what they have done today.“When you are jumping as fast as they jump you have got to get it deadly accurate. It is tough, and we have to live with it, as we know what we are playing with. You have to live with these things, but it is cruel as we waited two years to get back here.”All the focus was on four hot favourites for the Grade One races as the meeting opened here on Tuesday, and as it transpired only two managed to justify their short odds.Kopek Des Bordes drew a blood-curdling roar from the crowd as he came up the hill to win the opening Supreme Novice Hurdle, while Lossiemouth – as Scott had anticipated – took the Mares’ Hurdle for the second year running.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowHuntingdon:12.28 Early Morning Dew 12.58 Dark Mix 1.38 Not So Sobers 2.18 Imperial Jade 2.58 Greenways 3.38 Cloudy Wednesday 4.18 Naval Tribute.Cheltenham:1.20 Final Demand 2.00 Ballyburn 2.40 Beat The Bat (nap) 3.20 Stumptown (nb) 4.00 Jonbon 4.40 Unexpected Party 5.20 Bambino Fever.Wolverhampton:4.55 Rhythm N Hooves 5.30 Shamardia 6.00 Marhaba Ghaiyyath 6.30 Init Together 7.00 Kaaranah 7.30 Light Up Our Stars 8.00 Bungle Bay 8.30 Zooks.Newcastle:5.05 Show No Fear 5.45 Too Much 6.15 Dc Cogent 6.45 Wondrous Ways 7.15 Broken Spear 7.45 Henery Hawk 8.15 Tasever.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Majborough, however, the 1‑2 favourite, was only third in a thrilling four-way conclusion to the Arkle Trophy, as Henderson’s Jango Baie finished fast and late to grab the spoils from Only By Night, with L’Eau Du Sud, who had jumped the last in front, back in fourth.“It was a brilliant ride [by Nico de Boinville] as he had to sit and suffer,” Henderson said. “We thought we were going to make the running but he had no chance because he couldn’t go fast enough, simple as that.

A venue covered in a “vast umbrella” that would exceed the scale of Christo’s wrapping of the Reichstag in 1995. A trident of masts, the tallest of which is higher any other building inManchester. Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s vision for a new Old Trafford is taking shape, and the ambition extends beyond the “Wembley of the North”.On Tuesday designs were unveiled for Manchester United’s proposed new home, to be built on the site of the Old Trafford car park. The project was initiated by a call from Ratcliffe to Norman Foster and scoped out by a taskforce led by Sebastian Coe, and the cast list endorsing it is gold-plated. At a projected cost of £2bn, and to be assembled using prefabricated “modules” shipped down the Manchester ship canal, it could be delivered in five years, the architects suggest. Foster + Partners hopes to begin work this year and United are aiming to move into the new stadium for the 2030-31 season.Football Daily | Manchester United and the mental gymnastics needed for a bigger circusRead moreFor Ratcliffe, the United co-owner, the new Old Trafford is designed to grab the attention of the world and rebalance sporting infrastructure in favour of the north of England. “I think a really good example is the Eiffel Tower,” he said by way of comparison. “Everyone around the world knows the Eiffel Tower: you go to Paris, you stay in Paris, you spend money. We have 1 billion people around the world who follow Manchester United. I think everybody in the world who’s interested in football will want to visit Old Trafford.“The north of England has won 10 Champions League medals, and London has won two, but London’s got Wembley, Twickenham, Wimbledon and the Olympic Village. I think the north of England deserves to have a stadium where England can play football, where we can hold a Champions League final. If the government really gets behind this regeneration scheme then, with Norman Foster’s vision, in my view the greatest architect in the world, we will build an iconic football stadium.”That the government should commit wholeheartedly to a broader Trafford regeneration project was a consistent theme in Ratcliffe’s remarks. In January the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said she backed plans for the regeneration of the Old Trafford area, though she did not explain how the government would support it. Ratcliffe was not specific on why government involvement was so necessary. According to United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, while no public money would be used to build the new arena “the stadium in isolation doesn’t make sense without the wider regeneration project”.2:12Manchester United unveil renderings of plans for 'new landmark' stadium – videoA spokesperson at 10 Downing Street later said of the government’s possible commitment: “The [stadium] proposals involve significant investment and could generate 90,000 jobs and a significant boost to the economy. It’s only been announced today, so we are unsure as to the amount yet. I’m not aware of any government support that has been committed to the project.”Mocked-up images of the stadium and its environs show a cast of visitors from across the world enjoying themselves inside the stadium and outside it, bouncing between bars and cultural venues under the sprawling 126,000 sq metre canopy that will cover a new commercial quarter. Lord Foster’s “vast umbrella” is advertised as offering possibilities for solar-generated power as well as the reuse of rainwater, although the material from which it will be made is yet to be confirmed.View image in fullscreenThe new Manchester United stadium is expected to hold 100,000 fans.Illustration: Manchester United FCView image in fullscreenOther notable aspects of the design include a pitch 15.9 metres below ground level, 15.5% of seats being turned over to hospitality (3% more than at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium), and the three masts that flank the perimeter of the site. With a viewing station installed in the tallest, 200m, tower the new Trafford towers will be a landmark visible from the outskirts of Liverpool “in optimum conditions”, according to a briefing document.According to Foster, the stadium will be “outward looking” and “the beating heart of a new sustainable district”. The whole site “will be completely walkable, served by public transport, and endowed by nature”, he said. “It is a mixed-use miniature city of the future – driving a new wave of growth and creating a global destination that Mancunians can be proud of.”The Old Trafford regeneration taskforce, which includes Ratcliffe, Gary Neville and Andy Burnham, as well as Coe, says it consulted more than 50,000 people in preparing its proposals. According to Coe, 1,200 of those were local residents whose responses were “overwhelmingly positive” in terms of “what they see can be the changes to that community, to jobs, to houses, to visitor values, to the very nature of ambition, particularly amongst young people in what we know to be one of the hardest-pressed areas”. For Coe the regeneration has “the potential to be bigger” than the one he presided over as chief of the London 2012 Olympics.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenManchester United’s new stadium will be part of a wider regeneration project.Illustration: Manchester United FCBurnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, also welcomed the opportunities from redevelopment and the statement a state-of-the-art stadium would make. But he also warned the new Old Trafford should “be true to the traditions of the club, affordable to all, with nobody priced out, and a stadium that sets new standards in the game globally”.These sentiments were echoed by the Manchester United Supporters Trust, which said the plan invited more questions than it gave clear answers. “Whilst investment is much needed and welcome, fans remain anxious about what it means and what the consequences will be,” a statement said.“Will it drive up ticket prices and force out local fans? Will it harm the atmosphere, which is consistently fans’ top priority in the ground? Will it add to the debt burden which has held back the club for the last two decades? Will it lead to reduced investment in the playing side at a time when it is so badly needed? We look forward to further consultation with supporters and discussing these vital questions with the club.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

The players are considered to be key parts of the squad, but both last appeared with the US at the 2024 Copa América, where the team were eliminated in the group stage. Adams, who captained the US at the 2022 World Cup, underwent back surgery after the tournament and returned to action with Bournemouth late last year. Reyna has found consistent minuteshard to come by this seasonat Borussia Dortmund with the team struggling in the Bundesliga, although they made it through to the Champions League round of 16.“Adams is a player that we wanted to sign at Chelsea, of course that is an important player,” Pochettino said on Tuesday. “He’s a very good player, but of course he’ll need to prove that he’s better than the others. It’s a good competition in the midfield.”On Reyna, Pochettino said his invite was partially due to the player being unavailable to the US during this summer’s Gold Cup. With Borussia Dortmund set to compete in the Club World Cup simultaneously, the club will retain their rights to the player.“It’s true that maybe he’s not playing too much, but I think it’s a for us he’s a great player and we want to consider him,” Pochettino said. “The most important thing is … the opportunity to have him 10 days, feeling and connecting and to creating a good relationship that can help him and can help us for the future.”Celtic defender Cameron Carter-Vickers will also appear in his first camp under Pochettino, who was hired by the US in September.The roster is also notable for the lack of Brenden Aaronson, the Leeds United midfielder who had been a regular with the team, and also for the inclusion of MLS-based players who impressed during the team’s annual January camp and friendly wins against Venezuela and Costa Rica. Most notable among the January camp holdovers are Vancouver Whitecaps striker Brian White, Charlotte FC striker Patrick Agyemang, and Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna.Here is the full squad, with initial thoughts on each position group:GoalkeepersPatrick Schulte(Columbus Crew),Zack Steffen(Colorado Rapids),Matt Turner(Crystal Palace)Turner and Steffen have been locked in a competition for the starting job for much of their tenures with the USMNT, and this Nations League will be no different. Turner has more experience playing under Pochettino, starting the coach’s opening friendlies and both legs of the Nations League quarter-final against Jamaica. However, he has yet to make an appearance in the Premier League for Crystal Palace, acting as backup to Dean Henderson while starting in the FA Cup. Steffen, meanwhile, started and kept a shutout in the US’s January win against Costa Rica and has been in decent form with the Colorado Rapids to start the year in MLS.DefendersCameron Carter-Vickers(Celtic),Marlon Fossey(Standard Liège),Mark McKenzie(Toulouse),Tim Ream(Charlotte FC),Chris Richards(Crystal Palace),Antonee Robinson(Fulham),Joe Scally(Borussia Mönchengladbach),Auston Trusty(Celtic)There was some hope that Sergiño Dest would make this list having just returned to action for PSV 10 months after an ACL tear, but Pochettino has elected to leave him out. Scally, who is enjoying a solid season with Mönchengladbach, will presumably start at right-back in Dest’s continued absence, while Fossey will provide depth at either wide spot as Pochettino has elected to bring five center-backs to Los Angeles.Which of those five center-backs start will be a primary question heading into these games. In the quarter-finals against Jamaica, Pochettino opted to pair Ream with McKenzie, leaving Richards on the bench. It remains to be seen how the presence of Carter-Vickers, who has been in good form with Celtic, will change things.“Of course, Mark and Tim, they were playing and are a little bit in advantage to another,” Pochettino said, before cautioning that the final call will depend on how players recover from long flights to Los Angeles, how they perform in training, and other factors. “It’s going to be first training station, second training station, and then decide.”MidfieldersTyler Adams(Bournemouth),Johnny Cardoso(Real Betis),Diego Luna(Real Salt Lake),Weston McKennie(Juventus),Gio Reyna(Borussia Dortmund),Tanner Tessmann(Olympique Lyon)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The latter has cemented a place in the Lyon team after a difficult start to life in France, perhaps boosted by two solid showings starting as a holding midfielder against Jamaica in the Nations League quarters. To what degree Adams’ return affects Tessmann’s role will be an interesting storyline to follow throughout camp. Reyna, meanwhile, will hope a solid Nations League finals will propel him to better form and more minutes with Dortmund, where he has been out of favor for most of the season.Luna, meanwhile, impressed in January camp and has started off the MLS season as a key creative outlet for Real Salt Lake.“I think he’s a player that we followed from the day that we signed for the US national team,” Pochettino told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s a player that can provide different things during the game, and I think it’s important for him to feel the confidence from us.”Pochettino also addressed the absence of Brenden Aaronson, saying that the attacking midfield position he plays is crowded and that he was left off thanks to the numbers game inherent in a 23-man roster.“I think we have players in in that position, like Reyna for first time, Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Diego Luna, I think there are too many players for only one position,” he said. “When you have the possibility to. call only 23 players in a competition that is only two games in a very short space of time, I think we need a balance. Brenden is a player that we consider highly, but in this moment we need to wait for the next [window].”ForwardsPatrick Agyemang(Charlotte FC),Yunus Musah(Milan),Christian Pulisic (Milan),Josh Sargent(Norwich City),Timothy Weah(Juventus),Brian White(Vancouver Whitecaps)Sargent has been in terrific form for Norwich, having scored eight goals in his last eight appearances in all competitions for the Canaries. For once, his checkered injury history will not prevent him from furthering his national team career, as he will be the presumed starter as the most experienced option at center forward.Agyemang and White, the two other options there, made positive impressions in January camp and either could be options off the bench if the US is down a goal.“Always we need to remember that we are talking about a player [Sargent] that is doing really well in Championship,” Pochettino said. “They are not in the first division, but we need our players to know that they are performing well and, and of course they deserve the opportunity. We have [Folarin] Balogun, we have [Ricardo] Pepi who are not available, so I think to have him and to have Brian White, and, and of course, Patrick Agyemang, I think it’s good competition.”Musah is interestingly listed as a forward on this roster, indicating that Pochettino continues to see the versatile player as a winger in his system. Pulisic enters camp as the unquestioned public face of this team, now enjoying the best season of his career so far with Milan.Explore more on these topicsUSAChristian PulisicUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Australian is now a contender for the defensive player of the year award and has recorded 178 steals this season, 66 more than second place. “At that moment, it had absolutely nothing to do with our belief in Dyson,” Griffin said.Griffin also revealed the decision to draft Daniels in 2022 was prompted partly from the intelligence collected by a full-time Australian scout they had deployed at the time. The team has reorganised staff since then and no longer have anyone committed to Australia, but Griffin hoped this trip could serve as a catalyst for better connections and he harbours a “deep appetite” for more signings.The former Cleveland executive has close connections to Australia, and he was reunited with Melbourne United guard Matthew Dellavedova at training on Monday as the NBL side prepares for the second match of the grand final against Illawarra. Dellavedova helped Griffin win the NBA title in 2016 in a team that featured LeBron James.Despite his views on Australian players, the Pelicans boss said there is no guarantee the Pelicans will come back. “I hope it works out well enough that the organisation sees that [it it worth returning]”. The Victorian government is providing funding for the matches, but declined to reveal the size of the commitment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ll attack my rehab every day and support the 2025 Yankees each step of the way ... I can’t wait to be back on the mound – stronger than ever.”Cole experienced discomfort after his second spring training outing on Thursday.The Yankees are also missing AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil, who will be sidelined for at least three months because of a strained lat muscle. Designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton is out indefinitely because of tendon pain in both elbows, and infielder DJ LeMahieu is missing with a calf strain.“You’ve got to be able to handle it and deal with it and maneuver,” manager Aaron Boone told the YES Network before the team announced Cole’s surgery. “It’s not a death sentence for us by any means, so it’s an opportunity for someone else ... The reality is Gerrit still has a lot of pitching in front of him in his career and pitching with the Yankees and we want that to be as successful as it’s been already.”A six-time All-Star, Cole threw a perfect first inning on Thursday and reached 97.6 mph in the second, when he allowed Matt Wallner’s three-run homer on a fastball in the middle of the strike zone. He also surrendered Brooks Lee’s solo homer in the third on a 94 mph fastball with a 3-0 count.Cole signed a $324m, nine-year contract before the 2020 season.After winning the 2023 AL Cy Young Award, the six-time All-Star didn’t make his first start last year until 19 June because of nerve irritation and edema in his right elbow. He went 8-5 with a 3.41 ERA in 17 starts, and then was 1-0 with a 2.17 ERA in five postseason starts.He exercised his right to opt out of his contract on the third day after the World Series, giving up $144mover four years and starting a two-day window for the team to void the opt out by adding a $36m salary for 2029. New York decided not to add the year, and Cole then elected to keep his contract.Cole is 153-80 with a 3.18 ERA in 12 seasons for Pittsburgh (2013-17), Houston (2018-19) and the Yankees (2020-24).Max Fried now heads a rotation that includes Carlos Rodón, Clarke Schmidt and Marcus Stroman.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The iPhone 16e costs £599 (€699/$599/A$999) and is the spiritual successor to theiPhone SE line. Where the iPhone SE still had the old-school chunky design with home button, the 16e has the body of the iPhone 14 with the chips of the £799 iPhone 16.That means the 16e has an all-screen design and aluminium body. It was great forthe iPhone 14and still is good today. The phone is light and relatively compact. The 6.1in OLED screen is good and big enough for most uses, but isn’t as bright as that on thestandard iPhone 16.View image in fullscreenThe 16e has the old-style Face ID notch at the top of the screen rather than the newer “Dynamic Island” used in the rest of the recent iPhone line up.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 16e is only available in black or white, and while it has the handy action button that replaced the mute switch of older iPhones, it doesn’t have the camera control button from therest of the iPhone 16 line.The whole of the 16e has these little compromises from the standard iPhone 16 experience. It has a new more power-efficient Apple 5G modem – a first for an iPhone – but only has wifi 6 not the latest wifi 7. The 16e also lacksThreadand Ultra Wideband radios, the latter of which is used for Apple’sprecision finding of lost itemsand other systems.View image in fullscreenThe action button replaces the mute switch from older iPhones and can be used to turn on the torch, launch the camera or various other features.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianEven the 16e’s A18 chip is slightly inferior to that used in the regular iPhone 16, lacking some graphics power and performing a little slower overall. It is still a very snappy chip, however.The phone has wireless charging, but lacks Apple’s excellent MagSafe magnetic attachment technology on the back that has been aniPhone staple since 2020. MagSafe enables a range of magnetic accessories, from wallets and phone grips to car phone mounts and chargers, none of which work with the 16e, making it a very odd omission.Whether all these small minuses matter depends on your usage, whether your family has accessories that use MagSafe, wifi 7 at home or a bunch of Apple’s AirTags. But at least the 16e has great battery life lasting a solid 52 hours of general usage between charges across a range of conditions – four hours longer than the regular iPhone 16. That means needing to plug it in every two days or every other day with heavy usage.View image in fullscreenThe 16e has a range of Apple Intelligence features, including the new visual intelligence system using the camera to identify objects, but most of them are not terribly compelling.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED) (460ppi)Processor:Apple A18RAM:8GBStorage:128, 256 or 512GBOperating system:iOS 18Camera:48MP rear; 12MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, Satellite and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (6 metres for 30 mins)Dimensions:146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8mmWeight:167gSustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16e charges to 50% in 26 minutes and hits full power in 96 minutes using a 20W or higher USB-C power adapter (not included).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the batteryshould last in excess of 1,000 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can bereplaced for £95. Out-of-warrantyscreen repairs cost £225. The 16e has repair guides available and was awardedseven out of 10 for repairabilityby specialists iFixit.It contains more than 30% recycled material including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements, steel, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is the same as other iPhones, but lacks a 0.5x zoom, macrophotography and some more advanced features.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne feature that has been cut which makes more of a difference is in the camera department: the 16e only has one 48MP camera on the back, not the two or three present on other iPhones.The single main camera can manage a 2x in sensor zoom for a form of telephoto shots, but there is no ultrawide camera. Most of the time I didn’t miss it terribly as the main camera shoots great images across a range of lighting conditions. But on occasions where you can’t step back, you can no longer get the shot.Its portrait mode is slightly less effective, while a lack of a macrophotography mode and the new advanced photographic styles from the main iPhone 16 is a shame. It has the same 12-megapixel selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone line up.Overall the camera is solid, but if you’re at all interested in photography the 16e isn’t the model for you.PriceThe iPhone 16e costs from£599(€699/$599/A$999) with 128GB of storage.For comparison, theiPhone 16costs£799, theiPhone 16 Pluscosts£899,iPhone 16 Procosts£999, theiPhone 16 Pro Maxcosts£1,199, theGoogle Pixel 8acosts£499and the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE costs£549.VerdictThe iPhone 16e is a solid phone that offers most of the core iPhone experience with a few things left out for a lower cost.Many of these things, such as slower wifi, a slightly less powerful chip, no camera control button and an older-style notch probably don’t matter much to most people. But the lack of MagSafe and only a single camera on the back may be deal breakers for some.The advantage the 16e has over the iPhone 15 and older, cheaper models still available from third-party retailers is the Apple Intelligence features, some of which are useful but many are underwhelming or bettered by third-party apps.The biggest problem with the 16e is its price. Though it costs about 25% less than a regular iPhone 16, £599 is still very much at the premium end of the market. That makes the 16e only a sensible choice for someone who wants the absolute cheapest new iPhone available and won’t settle for anything else. For everyone else there are better models to be had either new from third-party retailers or refurbished.Pros:fast, decent screen, great size, action button, USB-C, great battery life, long software support, Face ID, Apple Intelligence.Cons:single camera only and no macro mode, no camera control button, old-style screen design, no MagSafe, no wifi 7, no Thread or UWB, AI features hit and miss, still expensive.Explore more on these topicsiPhoneAppleSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

I asked several enthusiasts who took a stab at it, with very mixed resultsRich PelleyTue 11 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 09.30 EDTShareThere’s a lot going on with video games and generative AI right now. Microsoft and Googlehave each created modelsthat can dream up virtual worlds, with significant limitations. And people have been using Grok, the gen-AI chatbot from Elon Musk’s xAI, to make rudimentary clones of old arcade games.All you have to do is type “write me Pong” and AI (sort of) does the rest, albeit quite badly. On Feb 21,xAI employee Taylor Silveiraclaimed to have created an accurate version of 1980 coin-op Pac-Manusing Grok 3, all the ghosts moving perfectly around their maze while Pac-Man chomps down dots, power pills and fruit.The takeaway is that AI can apparently write simple video games in seconds, so long as you have a good command of the software. But is that really true? Howgoodare these Pac-Man clones, and how do you make one? Can anyone do it? Could I do it? I decided to randomly approach some people on X who had posted their own Grok Pac-Man clones to ask how they did it, and I then had a stab at it myself.Attempt oneView image in fullscreenJohn Hester’s Pac-Man.Illustration: AI-generatedAuthor:John Hester,@HesterJohnTime spent:two hoursFirst up, welcome retired corporate software developer John Hester from California. Perhaps Hester can help explain why people are gushing over Grok. “Grok is a large language model (LLM) that competes with other language models likeChatGPTor Llama,” he says over Zoom. “Grok 3 is the most advanced because it’s learning new things on a daily basis.”So, is it as easy as typing: “Hello, Grok. Please write me Pac-Man”? (Manners are important. My mum still says please and thank you to Alexa.) “Almost,” says Hester. “I asked: ‘Can you create [a version of] Pac-Man that I can play on a Windows desktop?’ I didn’t give much more detail. It chose to write it in [coding language] Python … I got a pretty good approximation in seconds. It knew Pac-Man was yellow, a ghost was red, and the maze was blue, but my Pac-Man was square. I had to say: ‘Make Pac-Man round with its mouth open. Get the ghosts to actually chase Pac-Man.’ I need to add more ghosts, the power pills, more levels. From my experience as a software developer – where I was using AI to write half of my code – I’mextremelyimpressed with Grok. I’d give myself three out of five.”“I don’t know if you’ve heard, but now Musk has announced he’s starting his own gaming company using Grok to develop games,” says Hester. Isn’t computers writing code how Terminator starts? “The main worry with the AI doomers is once machines are able to improve themselves, humans are out of the loop. I’m sufficiently concerned, but also cautiously optimistic that AI is not going to kill us all.”Score:3 starsAttempt twoView image in fullscreenSuperTrucker’s Pac-Man.Illustration: AI-generatedAuthor:Justin Martin AKA SuperTrucker,@supertruckerTime spent:One hour“I wanted to make a game for my four-year-old son,” says 41-year-old ex-truck driver SuperTrucker, from New Jersey. “I took programming in high school, but I’m not a coder. It was surprisingly easy. My first attempt, Pac-Man was a dot, there were no pellets, the warp tunnels didn’t work, and the ghosts wouldn’t move until you were in their line of sight, but then came screaming at you. You can’t ask open-ended questions like: make Cyan a hunter and Red a scavenger. You have to be specific. Sorting out the bugs was frustrating. After an hour, I decided to make Tetris instead. Grok isgreatat making Tetris.“When I was behind the wheel, there was a massive push to recruit. There was a skill bar, and everyone has to be able to drive to a particular safety level. So they made the trucks easier to drive. Now the pool of truck drivers has gone through the roof and wages are down. I see the same thing happening with AI.”Score:3 starsAttempt threeView image in fullscreen8 Bit’s Pac-Man.Illustration: AI-generatedAuthor:Jimmy AKA 8 Bit,@0rdlibraryTime spent:15 minutes“I found an image of the original Pac-Man and dragged it in. It’s pretty freaking awesome how quickly it broke it down,” says 8 Bit, who also lives in New Jersey. (I’ve no idea why all these AI-assisted Pac-Man cloners live in New Jersey, so I ask Grok: “There’s no evidence that people who use Grok are concentrated in New Jersey,” it answers, uselessly.) “The sound and maze could be more accurate, but it’s got an actual server for high scores. I’d give it four out of five,” says 8 Bit.Score:3 starsAttempt fourView image in fullscreenOxLnk’s Pac-Man.Illustration: AI-generatedAuthor:Stiven AKA OxLnk,@LnkWeb3Time spent:Five minutes“I wanted to see what Grok could do,” says 32-year-old OxLnk over Zoom, who is from Estonia and works in HR but dabbles in AI and crypto in his spare time. “I asked it to write me Pac-Man. It was so fast – I’m very impressed.” However, I’m not sure he’s got the colours, maze, ghosts or even Pac-Man right, even if it was only a five-minute jobbie.Score:1 starskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When you ask for modifications, it often adds a few bugs, which is annoying. I’m impressed by Grok 3. In the time it’s taken to answer you, I’ve used it to create a version of Arkanoid.

But what of the crapper efforts? Over to Phreakops, from somewhere in the UK, who has summed up the mood of the entire country in one Pac-Man clone. “I’d noticed Musk’s engagement accounts gushing over their creations – Asteroids etc – and gave it a go,” he says over DM. “Pac-Man didn’t feel a big ask for something as hyped as Grok 3. The results were a lot worse than I expected. I won’t be a game developer anytime soon!”Score:1 starAttempt sevenView image in fullscreen₿lackthorne’s Pac-Man.Illustration: AI-generatedAuthor:₿lackthorne,@BtcBlackthorneTime spent:UnknownI knew that randomly approaching people on X would backfire sooner or later. “All it takes is a two- or three-sentence prompt. But it was kind of a failure, as Grok couldn’t be bothered to place the Pac-Man in a non-wall area,” says ₿lackthorne over DM. Unfortunately, my invitation to chat further over Zoom apparently means I’m after his crypto. “[Expletive] you, scammer,” he says.

The 10-point manifesto, which proclaimed that “the next evolution of consciousness, creating unthinkable next-generation lifeforms and silicon-based awareness” was imminent, quickly went viral, as did follow-up posts.Effective accelerationism, or “e/acc”, exploded from being a fringe movement dedicated to pushing back against AI extinction-fearing “doomers” to being name-checked by major Silicon Valley CEOs such as Garry Tan, the CEO of the start-up accelerator Y Combinator;Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI; Marc Andreessen, the billionaire software engineer; andElon Musk.In 2023, Andreessen issued his Techno-Optimist Manifesto, expanding beyond the e/acc’s focus on AI to encompass all questions of technological progress. “We are told to be angry, bitter, and resentful about technology,” he writes, yet previously and for hundreds of years, we had glorified it. The enemies of techno-optimism are, he says, statism, economic planning and socialism. Andreessen tells us: “Technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential … It is time, once again, to raise the technology flag.”And last year saw the release of the Techno-Humanist Manifesto from the Roots of Progress Institute and Jason Crawford, who makes similar arguments for the liberatory power of technology, while alsoarguingthat anything that can be for profit should be.But where is the left in all this?The left needs its own version of techno-optimism | Amana Fontanella-KhanRead moreOne would think that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the market flounder and the state rise to the occasion with responses such as Operation War Speed’s vaccine development and rollouts, the left would be crowing about how it produced technological progress far better than all this market fundamentalism.It was the embrace of varieties of economic planning that produced the innovation needed to defeat the virus. For decades, large firms had gotten out of the business of vaccine development because it was insufficiently profitable. The mRNA vaccine delivery vehicle that is now recognized asrevolutionaryfor the life sciences far beyond Covid had beensitting on the shelffor about a decade, spurned by uninterested, risk-averse investors.At the start of the pandemic, big pharma remained wary that transmission might fizzle out and they’d be left having spent billions on a white elephant. Instead, it was the advance purchase agreements, subsidies and coordination of the government – which does not need to turn a profit – via the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) and Operation Warp Speed that delivered the vaccine and saved the world.Meanwhile, free-market driven distribution of PPE, ventilators, medical fridges and oxygen hadproducedlittle more than corruption, bottlenecks and irrational allocation to those who could pay the highest price – not allocation where it was most needed. It was only when the White House deployed the Defense Production Act to enable the government to takeover distribution that the market’s deadly mess was cleared up.The left should be proudly flaunting the record of governments around the world in responding to CovidThe left should be proudly flaunting the record of governments around the world in responding to Covid. It should make the case that all major technological and scientific advancements are best delivered by governments. And it should make the case that we – the people – should embrace faith in technological progress that is rooted in public investment.In other words, the left should be the real techno-optimists. But instead, in recent years, there has been a growing skepticism of technology on the contemporary left – from cynicism about space-faring to fear of genetic engineering and opposition to nuclear power.The left should be calling for government intervention to ensure decarbonization of data centers for AI. It should demand that we direct machine-learning research to prioritize the solving of grand scientific challenges such asprediction of protein foldinginstead of bad fantasy art fabrication and plagiarism. But instead, the mostpopular leftwing tech podcastcalls for degrowth of generative AI and data centers due the latter’s carbon intensity.Progressives could be reminding the world of Neil Armstrong’swarningabout the privatization of space – while still cheering on SpaceX’s work to develop reusable rocketry, radically reducing the cost of humans and payloads escaping our planet’s gravity well, all the better to deliver the space and planetary science we need to monitor and solve so many ecological challenges.We could be explaining how space colonization, a worthwhile multigenerational, perhaps millennia-long endeavor, will be public sector-led or it will not happen, due to the risible likelihood of it being profitable. Musk won’t get to Mars without Nasa. But instead the leftdeclaresspace-faring to be settler-colonialism, oddly equating lifeless rocks with Indigenous peoples.Environmentalists and green NGOs should be celebrating research into genetically modified crops that if successful will reduce pesticide use, nitrogen pollution and land-use change. But instead, anti-GMO campaign groupsvandalizedan Italian research trial of rice-blast-resistant arborio (risotto) rice this summer, while Greenpeace successfullyconvinceda Filipino court to overturn approval of commercial cultivation of Golden Rice, a variety modified to combat vitamin A deficiency, which causes blindness and even death in tens of thousands of children annually in Asia.This leftwing technophobia is something of an historic aberration. Traditionally, the left had always been enthusiastic about the potential of technology for liberation, to release us from drudgery and boundlessly expand our degrees of freedom – so long as technology was unfettered from the irrationality of profit and hierarchy and yoked to egalitarian reason. Prometheus plus Spartacus, as mid-century Marxist Hal Draper put it.We sometimes forget that the Communist Manifesto was itself a techno-optimist declaration of intent. It was a critique of capitalism but it was also a celebration of the new technologies, both industrial and social, that this system had set loose.From Karl Marx’s enthusiasm for the Industrial Revolution through to British Labour prime minister Harold Wilson’s call to harness the “white heat” of the Scientific Revolution, the conventional left position was that its programme would enable society tosurpassthe technological progress of mere capitalism. The point was not to retreat from capitalism, but instead to advance from it. We the people would develop the “forces of production” much more rapidly through conscious, democratic planning (albeit to greater or lesser degrees of such planning, depending on the flavour of leftist) rather than leaving such development to the fetters imposed by the risk-averse, poorly coordinated and unconscious anarchy of the market.The left should be the real techno-optimists. But instead, in recent years, there has been a growing skepticism of technology on the contemporary leftScientific, technological and industrial development would not only be faster, but broader, for the left would share the fruits of development with all humanity as rapidly as economic capacity would allow, rather than limiting their spread to those locations and populations where such production was profitable. A virtuous circle was then supposed to emerge as a result: with ever more humans benefiting from such progress, ever more humans would be able to contribute to science, engineering, medicine and agronomy, resulting in yetmoreprogress. Liberation would beget ever accelerating liberation.It was instead the counter-Enlightenmentright– aristocrats, the church, Burkean critics of the French Revolution – who were horrified at how technology and industry constantly revolutionized society, washing away ancient traditions and endlessly transforming social relations. The industrial engineering of the factory and the “social engineering” of democracy were the same thing to the reactionary, anti-modernist mind. The children of the Radical Enlightenment, both liberals and socialists, also made little distinction between social and technological progress, but thought them good, and were intent on carrying out French revolutionary Georges Danton’s commandment:“De l’audace, encore de l’audace, toujours de l’audace!” (“Audacity; yet more audacity; always audacity!”)Today, however, that leftwing optimism and confidence about humanity’s capacity for superior, entwined social, scientific and technological progress – once political economy was thoroughly democratized, has been lost, especially on the environmental left. It has been replaced by a techno-scepticism and cynicism about progress that varies from a soft neo-Luddism through to a more thoroughgoing Malthusian opposition to further economic development, prompted by a fear that we have long since outstripped the carrying capacity of the planet. Many believe industrial modernity was a mistake.Elon Musk is a proven danger to good science, but the Royal Society won’t say so. That’s why I resigned | Kit YatesRead more(Note that these contemporary neo-luddites should not be confused with the historical Luddites, the 19th-century stockingers – workers running stocking frame mechanical knitting machines – who engaged in riot and sabotage of automated textile machinery to protest employers’ use of such machines to drive down wages. It was the capitalist socio-economic relations surrounding this technology that the Luddites were protesting, not technology itself. If anything, today’s neo-luddites should learn from their namesakes and focus less on the machines and more on who owns them.)All of this creeping anti-modernism threatens not merely human development and the expanding freedom that flows from it, but also undermines our ability to adequately respond to a range of existential threats, from climate change to pandemics. We are caught between the capitalist techno-hucksterism of Musk and the Malthusian technophobia of Greenpeace and friends.Thankfully, there is – to coin a phrase – a third way.In place of technophobia, the left’s traditional arguments around the “market alignment problem” still offer a better path toward enhancing human liberation. In place of both market fundamentalist neoliberalism and green-inflected neo-Luddism, the left should be talking once again about conscious design of the economy – and thence which technologies we want to develop and accelerate – through industrial policy, public ownership and other forms of democratic economic planning.As of 2024, we are roughly at the halfway point between the first climate treaty, 1997’s Kyoto protocol, and the 2050 deadline for net-zero decarbonization of the economy. Yet due to policymakers’ overdependence on market-based mechanisms such as carbon-pricing (and the developing world’s understandable demand for fossil-fueled development), the share of fossil fuels in global energy consumption has barely moved, dropping from 86% to 82%. But industrial policy domestically – building on Bidenomics’ version of the Green New Deal, the Inflation Reduction Act – and a properly egalitarian approach to climate finance and economic development internationally, can turn all this around.Our suite of antibiotics is rapidly failing and so in the absence of new discovery and development of new ones, as well as new diagnostic techniques and vaccines, clinicians warn that we are nearing a collapse of the foundation of antimicrobial protection upon which almost all of modern medicine depends. But decommodification of pharmaceutical production and, again, internationalism could solve the problem entirely.Similarly, pandemic monitoring and early warning systems require robust public-sector funding, restructuring of intellectual property rights, and even global democracy. All of this is optimized by a more muscular social democracy.There are so many areas where the left should have so much more to say about technology and progressBiodiversity loss threatens to undermine ecosystem services that we depend upon, but precision agriculture, new genetic techniques and “lab meat” can radically reduce humanity’s land-footprint, so long as there is strong state intervention to de-risk these new technologies.In order to overcome less well known but still profound risks from space debris and near-Earth asteroids, we need not cynicism about space, but a revival of space as primarily a public-sector enterprise and the sort of internationalism and global democracy that the left favours.But a left approach to technology is not just about avoiding harm, but about grand ambition. Getting to Mars and beyond, spreading life throughout the cosmos, is a gargantuan multi-generational endeavour, of the level of audacity that Danton commanded. Markets will never get us there if it isn’t profitable enough – and it is unlikely to be so.The left needs to abandon its miserable, irrational pessimism | Aaron BastaniRead moreArtificial intelligence has already solved the hard problem of protein-folding, and soon it could radically enhance medical diagnosis, accelerate materials discovery, and reduce mineral exploration costs, and maybe even predict earthquakes, but much of this will require humans working alongside AI rather than AI replacing humans – meaning an increased cost over either humans or computers alone, which will thus tend to be far less attractive to capital. And so AI thus far appears to be primarily directed at much more profitable but far less freedom-enhancing endeavours such as enterprise software, theft from artists and musicians, and ever more panoptical state surveillance.To steal a phrase from artificial intelligence discourse, the market has an “alignment problem”. It is an algorithm independent of human control. And so it could be said that the techno-libertarians want to liberate themselves from all things that unconsciously dominate humanity – except for markets.There are so many areas where the left should have so much more to say about technology and progress, whether the challenges we face are existential threats or how to achieve the most soaring of ambitions.Neither Silicon Valley tech hucksters nor eco-austerity technophobes are up to the task.Leigh Phillips is a science writer and a political journalist"

These terms all describe what has happened with theTrump administration’s first arrest for thought crimes, something that should never happen in a democracy.But it has, to Mahmoud Khalil, a recently graduated master’s student from Columbia University’s school of international and public affairs. And for each minute that Khalil is held in detention, every one of us should feel like our own individual rights in this country are being shredded. The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil is a barefaced attempt by theTrump administrationto destroy free thinking while murdering due process and free speech along the way. This is an ominous development.On the evening of Saturday 8 March, Khalil, who is a lawful permanent resident of the US (a green card holder), and his US-citizen wife, who is eight months pregnant, were returning home to their Columbia University apartment in upper Manhattan. According toreports, the couple had just unlocked the door to the building when plainclothes agents from the Department of Homeland Security pushed their way in like thugs and demanded Khalil surrender himself for arrest.The lead agent told Khalil’s lawyer, whom Khalil had immediately called, that his student visa was being revoked. But Khalil doesn’t have a student visa for the very simple reason that he is alawful permanent resident! Apparentlyconfused, the agent next responded that Khalil’s green card was being revoked – which, by US law, cannot be done without a lot of due process. When pressed by Khalil’s lawyer to show a warrant for arrest, the agent simply hung up on the lawyer, shoved Khalil into handcuffs, and carted him away. As of this writing, Khalil is in a detention facility in Louisiana.[Democracy] takes a lot of people to support it, but it gives quickly when faced with pressure from the other sideLet’s be clear. If you grew up in Egypt or Nicaragua or Russia, you would recognize this behavior. If you have read the work of Milan Kundera or Ariel Dorfman or Breyten Breytenbach, you will recognize this behavior. This is how the authoritarian regimes always operate, seeking to demonize their critics and neutralize their opposition by lies, exaggerations and the blunt force of state power. This despicable and dangerous conduct has now come to the land of the free and the home of the brave as official policy.The Trump administration doesn’t even bother to disguise the ideological assault that characterizes Khalil’s arrest. Khalil was an active member of Columbia University’s protests againstIsrael’s war on Gaza, a war that has been characterized as a genocide by Israel byexpertsandmultiplehuman rightsorganizationsaround the world. Khalil also served as a negotiator between the university administration and student activists who had set up an encampment on campus.It was in that role that Khalil’s profile grew, particularly among extreme rightwing organizations supporting Israel that begansendinglists of students to the Trump administration who, they said, should be deported from the US because of their views. This blatant attempt to shut down free speech picked up afterDonald Trumpissued two executive orders in late January that called for deporting “perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment”. (It shouldn’t be lost on anyone that the Trump administration is activelycancelingevery form of protection for other minority populations, while appearing deeplyconcernedabout antisemitism, as it also tacitlysupportsantisemitic behavior.)Khalil had already suffered so much harassment by these pro-Israel groups that the day before his arrest, hewroteto the interim president of Columbia University, telling her that he was afraid that government officials or private actors would target him or his family, urging her to provide him legal support and protection. After his arrest, the official White House account on X issued apostthat said: “Shalom, Mahmoud,” using a Hebrew word that can mean goodbye. Haha. Whoever wrote the post must think this very clever. But in a court of law, the post will only buttress the argument that Trump is on a rampage to shut down any types of speech he doesn’t like.Exactly which crime has Mahmoud Khalil committed? Which activities has he engaged in to warrant arrest and deportation? The best theDepartment of Homeland Securitycan come up with are the same flimsy innuendo that we hear over and over again. Any show of concern for Palestinians is, presto, turned into “activities aligned to Hamas”.That “aligned to Hamas” is not a legal standard is hardly surprising. It comes after all from the Trump administration, which operates almost definitionally as the opposite of a legal standard. Expecting something reasonable from this administration is like eating a razor-blade sandwich and thinking you won’t come out all bloodied, which is of course why the Trump administration is repeatedly offering you such aromatic and enticing fresh bread.I expect as much from Trump, but I demand more from Columbia University, my own alma mater. After Trump withdrew some $400m of federal funding over an unproven and completely ideologically driven allegation that Columbia was a hotbed of antisemitism, the interim president didn’t bother to defend her institution. Instead, she immediately sent us Columbia affiliates an email to “assure the entire Columbia community that we are committed to working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns”. I’m educated enough to know that the word “appeasement” has a specific history. I also know that cowards run away from Palestine, even if they too will be the ones who suffer in the end.Threaten campuses, shut down debate: that’s what free speech looks like under Trump | Owen JonesRead moreI also demand more from my local officials. This federal assault on protected speech from a New Yorker should raise huge alarms from the mayor of New York, but all we’ve heard fromEric Adamsthus far is … well, what sound would crickets make if they were flyingbusiness class on Turkish Airlines? If it’s any sound at all, I imagine the jet engine hums louder than the lack of objection he’s made. His silence is matched only by Andrew Cuomo, Adams’s new competition for the next New York mayoral race. Together, they might have enough courage to lose a game of chicken to the lion in the Wizard of Oz.But mostly, I demand a whole lot more from the Democratic party. Where is Hakeem Jeffries? Where is Chuck Schumer? They seem to believe the best way to defend free speech in this country is not to speak at all. Irrelevance has never been so recognizable.Democracy has always been a fragile, improvised, teetering wall of bricks that extends high in the air. It takes a lot of people to support it, but it gives quickly when faced with pressure from the other side. The thing is, even if you’re not supporting it, you’ll still get crushed when the wall falls. Too many people seem ready to be crushed. That’s only the tiniest reason to support Mahmoud Khalil. We all need to rush to the wall and do what we can to free him from his unjust imprisonment. For him and also for us. Because, you know what? He won’t be the last.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS universitiesOpinionPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUS campus protestsUS immigrationTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But we’re regularly told our careers and lives aren’t worth savingTue 11 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 13.35 EDTShareLate last month, the Trump administrationmoved to firetransgender people serving in the armed forces.This includes those who have honorably served for for 19 years (one year short of retirement) those who have served honorably in combat situations, and those in whom the military has already invested millions of dollars in training.I’m a transgender woman who medically transitioned while on active duty service. I wish more people knew that transgender service members are not a threat. Instead, we’re the ones who volunteer when others won’t. We bring unique perspectives and skills to the armed forces. Transgender individuals aretwice as likelyas all adults in the US to have served in the armed forces, a testament to our commitment and dedication.We are alsoseven timesmore likely than US civilians to attempt suicide during our lifetimes. This is no surprise when we are constantly told – through actions like this drastic transgender military ban – that our careers and our lives are not worth saving.I served for 20 years in the army and endured my share of hardships. In 2005, I was deployed to Afghanistan, working as a repairer on Apache helicopters, when I found out that my wife had been diagnosed with cancer. She died 12 months after I got home, and I became a single parent to our young children.The cumulative loss of institutional and career knowledge will be devastating, as will the personal loss to these service membersAs their only provider, I was fortunate to be able to keep my job when I came out publicly in 2016 under President Obama. But while I was stationed in Missouri, I faced a frightening amount of transphobia. I was verbally harassed, physically threatened, and once, someone stood in my driveway and shot into my car. My kids saw all of it. This is the reality of the discrimination that transgender service members face.If I were still actively serving in the military today, I would lose my career, health insurance, and other benefits, and so would my family.The Trump administration is wrong about transgender service members. ThePentagon memodeclares that being transgender is “incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service”. This couldn’t be further from the truth.There are at least15,000 transgender individualsin the military, and they serve everywhere. They are pilots, submariners and infantry; they are in command positions; they are trusted in the highest-skilled military jobs and the riskiest; they hold top secret clearances (as I did). The cumulative loss of institutional and career knowledge across the spectrum that will come from this decision is devastating, as is the personal loss to these service members and their families.This new order is reckless and counter-productive to military preparedness. When we face threats worldwide, we need a strong and resilient military. We don’t need to leave 15,000 skilled positions vacant.Trans military members on the feared ban: ‘I would meet Trump to show how we’ve served our country’Read moreFurthermore, what precedent does this set? We already know that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense,does not believewomen should serve in combat. Many people don’t realize that equal African American military service is not codified by law – only by President Truman’sExecutive Order #9981. This means it can be reversed at any time. I use this as an example because when policies are allowed to ping-pong between executive orders instead of law, it puts people’s lives at risk.I was fortunate to have found an online arts organization during my lowest moment in Missouri.Community Building Artoffers creative writing and art workshops for female and non-binary veterans. Participating in a community like this saved my life and has proven to reduce suicidality among participants.But I worry now for all those suddenly forced out of the careers and communities they’ve known. We should support their service to our nation, and should they be dismissed, we must offer them safe spaces. Yet, instead of focusing oncrises like veteran suicide, the administration isendangering veterans’ care. We will need the private sector to support service members and veterans in this dangerous time.Having retired from the military, I recently discovered a disheartening change in my Veterans Affairs (VA) profile. My medical records now mark me as “male”, a stark reminder of the personal impact of policies like the transgender military ban. While I have weathered storms like these, I worry about those with much more to lose.Alleria Stanley is a retired United States army service member, advocate, and member of the LGBTQ+ community.

What we notice, and don’t notice, about that story says a lot about what we notice, and don’t notice, inIsraeland Palestine.The tale comes from thebook of Esther. It begins with a dissolute Persian king. He hosts a banquet, gets drunk, orders his queen to “display her beauty” to the revelers, and, when she refuses, banishes her from the throne. As her replacement he chooses Esther, a beautiful young maiden who, unbeknownst to him, is a Jew. Then he makes a calamitous personnel decision: he selects Haman, a pathological Jew-hater, to be his right-hand man. The stage is now set for an epic clash.Haman persuades the king to sign an edict exterminating the Jews. Esther’s uncle, Mordechai, hears the news and sends word that she must save her people. Although protesting puts her own life at risk, Esther appeals to the king and, through a series of daring maneuvers, turns him against Haman. Haman is hanged. Mordechai takes his job. Good triumphs over evil.When Jews tell the story of Purim today, many of us stop there. But that’s not quite right. The book of Esther doesn’t end with Haman’s death. It continues because although Haman is gone, his edict to kill the Jews remains. The king can’t reverse it. What he can do is empower Mordechai and his kinsmen to take matters into their own hands. Which they do. “The Jews struck at their enemies with the sword,” proclaims the book of Esther, “slaying and destroying; they wreaked their will upon their enemies.” On the 13th day of the month of Adar, the Jews kill 75,000 people. They declare the 14th “a day of feasting and merrymaking”. With the blood of their foes barely dry, the Jews feast and make merry. That’s the origin of Purim.Purim isn’t only about the danger Gentiles pose to us. It’s also about the danger we pose to them.Most of us ignore the violence that concludes the Esther scroll. Some contemporary Jews justify it as self-defenseFor most of our history, when Jews had little capacity to impose our will via the sword, the conclusion of the book of Esther was a harmless and even understandable fantasy. Who can blame a tormented people for dreaming of a world turned upside down? But the ending reads differently when a Jewish state wields life and death power over millions of Palestinians who lack even a passport. Today, these blood-soaked verses should unsettle us. When we recite them aloud in synagogue, we should employ the anguished, sorrowful tune in which we chant the book of Lamentations, which depicts the destruction of our ancient temples.Instead, most of us ignore the violence that concludes the Esther scroll. Some contemporary Jews justify it as self-defense. On the far right, some revel in it. But they’re the exception. More often, we look away. We focus on what they tried to do to us. There’s a joke that every Jewish holiday has the same plot: “They tried to kill us, we survived, let’s eat.” That’s how many Jews narrate not only Purim but many of our other best-loved holidays. Passover recounts our liberation from bondage in Egypt. Hanukah celebrates the Maccabees, who freed us from persecution by the Syrian-Greeks.Why do America’s liberal hawks attack Russia while giving Israel a free pass?  | Peter BeinartRead moreFestivals we can’t fit into this script tend not to capture our collective imagination. Why is Shavuot, which commemorates the giving of the Torah, less well known among contemporary Jews than Purim and Hanukah, holidays of lesser religious significance? There are various reasons. But one of them is this: Shavuot no longer fits the story we tell about ourselves. In modernity, Jews have grown more secular. Except for a religiously observant minority, we no longer describe ourselves as a people chosen by God to follow laws engraved at Sinai. We instead describe ourselves as a people fated by history to perpetually face annihilation but, miraculously, to survive.With this secularization has come moral evasion. When explicating Jewish suffering, the rabbinic tradition almost obsessively demands that Jews look inward and reckon with our sins. The Talmud blames the Jews for Haman’s rise because they participated in the king’s drunken debauchery. A midrash on the Song of Songs suggests that the Israelites enslaved in Egypt were unworthy of freedom because they worshipped idols. The Talmud devotes almost an entire tractate to how Jews should respond to drought. Its answer: fast and repent for our misdeeds.This theology is hard to stomach. When applied to modern calamities like the Holocaust, most Jews rightly consider any suggestion that we blame ourselves to be obscene. But in the absence of a belief in divine reward and punishment, we have largely stopped wrestling with what our sacred texts say about Jewish ethical responsibility. We have turned them into tales of Jewish innocence.That false innocence pervades mainstream Jewish discussion about Israel. It’s why, when discussing Israel’s founding, American Jewish leaders blame Palestinians for their own mass expulsion. “The Palestinian refugee issue originated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war,”explainsthe Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the US’s best-known organization fighting antisemitism, “when five Arab armies invaded the State of Israel just hours after it was established.” The moral chronology is clear: the Palestinians left their homes because Arab nations started a war. Palestinians suffered, but the real victim was Israel.The problem with this account is thatbetween one-third and halfof the Palestinians departedbefore14 May 1948, when Israel declared independence and the Arab governments declared war. By the time the Arab armies attacked, Zionist forces had already largely depopulatedJaffaandHaifa, Palestine’s two largest cities. The war’s most notorious massacre of Palestinians, in which Zionist militias killed more than a hundred men, women and children in the village of Deir Yassin, occurred in April. When Jewish leaders claim the Arab invasions drove Palestinians to leave, they’ve got the causality reversed. “It was not the entry of the Arab armies that caused the exodus. It was the exodus that caused the entry of the Arab armies,”concludedthe historian Walid Khalidi after consulting extensive Arab government documents and press reports.Jewish leaders don’t only evade Jewish moral responsibility when recounting Israel’s past. They do so when discussing Israel’s presentThe other way Jewish leaders render Israel blameless for the mass ethnic cleansing it committed in 1948 is by claiming that Palestinians only left because Arab leaders told them to. In his heftiest book, A Place Among the Nations,Benjamin Netanyahuargues that in many cases “Jews pleaded with their Palestinian Arab neighbors to stay. This was in sharp contrast to the directives the Palestinian Arabs were receiving from Arab governments, exhorting them to leave in order to clear the way for the invading armies.” This argument, too, is mostly fiction. A 1948reportby Israel’s own intelligence service concluded that Zionist attacks accounted for roughly 70% of the Palestinian departures while orders from Arab forces accounted for roughly 5%.Jewish leaders don’t only evade Jewish moral responsibility when recounting Israel’s past. They do so when discussing Israel’s present. Most Jews were rightly sickened and appalled by Hamas’s massacre on 7 October 2023. But when Israel responded to that carnage with a ferocious assault on the Gaza Strip, the first reaction of many Israeli and US Jewish officials was to question whether large numbers of Palestinians were being killed. “The ‘Gaza health ministry’ or ‘Palestinian health ministry in Gaza’ is controlled by Hamas, and the information it releases cannot be trusted,”declaredAipac, the US’s most influential pro-Israel lobbying group, that November. The death figures coming from Gaza,addedMichael Oren, Israel’s former ambassador to the United States, were “simply untrue”.For my great-grandparents, for all Jews, for all humanity, I say never again | Mark DreyfusRead moreIn fact, the Gaza health ministry’s numbers were wrong – but in exactly the opposite way that Jewish leaders suggested. They were too low. A January 2025studyby public health experts from Yale and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine found that during the first nine months of the war, the death toll in Gaza was roughly 40%higherthan the Gaza health ministry estimated. This undercount was predictable. In the first months of the war, the health ministry only counted bodies in morgues yet many of the people killed in Gaza never made it to a hospital. But for Israeli and American Jewish leaders, these details were beside the point. The point was to render Israel blameless, to avoid reckoning with the possibility that a Jewish state might be doing anything wrong.When establishment Jewish officials did admit that Palestinians were dying in large numbers, they blamed Hamas. “Hamas is responsible for getting Palestinian civilians killed,”declaredAipac on 14 October. The reason: it uses them as “human shields”.The human shields argument piles fallacy upon fallacy. Hamas certainly operates within civilian areas. But that’s typical of insurgent groups. No guerrilla force puts on brightly colored uniforms, walks into an open field, and takes on a vastly more powerful conventional army. “From the American Revolution and the Italian Risorgimento to anti-colonial struggles in Malaya, India, Sri Lanka and Vietnam as well as Algeria, Angola and Palestine, militants have hidden among civilians,”notesthe Israeli-born international law professor Neve Gordon. “Hamas, in this sense, is no outlier.”Israel’s assault on Gaza became excessive on 9 October, when it cut off food and electricity to everyone in the StripIn fact, even conventional armies often operate near civilians. The Israeli military locates its headquarters in central Tel Aviv. Twenty-four schools sit within a kilometer and a half of its general staff building, which houses the offices of its top commanders. Because such intermingling is common, international law is clear: civilians don’t become fair game just because there are fighters nearby. In the words of theAdditional Protocol to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the presence of fighters in an area “shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population”. One key legal obligation is proportionality. According to the Additional Protocol, the “loss of civilian life” from an attack cannot be “excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.Israel’s assault on Gaza became excessive on 9 October, when itcut offfood and electricity to everyone in the Strip. The following day, Israel’s defense minister announced that he had “released all the restraints” on how Israel fought and its military spokespersondeclaredthat “emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy”. Aninvestigationby the publications +972 Magazine and Local Call found that in the first five days of fighting alone, Israel bombed more than a thousand “power targets” – which included high-rise apartment buildings, banks, universities and government offices – that it struck not because of their military value but merely for psychological effect. Israeli officials hoped the destruction would shock Gaza’s population into turning against Hamas. Justifying this by invoking “human shields” torches the core principles of international law. But it is necessary to prove that Israel is always innocent. Even when a Jewish state drops bombs that kill tens of thousands of people, it cannot be the real author of this mass death.We asked the people of Gaza how they saw their future – this is what we found | Nils MallockRead moreNow, rather than proceed to the second round of a ceasefire that wouldrequireit to withdraw its troops from Gaza, Israel hasrelaunchedthe war with even greater ferocity. Ithas stoppedall humanitarian aid from reaching the people of Gaza. Aipac’s response: Israel is notresponsiblefor this policy of starvation because Hamas will not rewrite the ceasefire deal to release Israel from its obligations.In this way, establishment Jewish discourse sanitizes Israeli behavior in much the same way many Jews sanitize the book of Esther. Our communal story – told by Jewish leaders from Jerusalem to New York – is not wrong because it acknowledges the evil that Jews suffer, including the evil that Hamas committed on 7 October, and continues to commit by holding Israelis as hostage. The story is wrong because it denies the evil that Jews commit. Our refusal to reckon with the dark side of Purim reflects a refusal to reckon with the dark side of ourselves, to acknowledge our full humanity, which renders us capable of being not only victims, but victimizers as well.My hope, this Purim, is that when Jews encounter the slaughter that concludes the Book of Esther, we shudder. And that from this revulsion comes a new dedication to ending the slaughter being committed in our name in theGazaStrip.Peter Beinart is a professor at theNewmark School of Journalism at the City University of New York, a contributing opinion writer atthe New York Times, an editor at large ofJewish Currentsand writesThe Beinart Notebook, a weekly newsletter.This essay is adapted from Peter Beinart’s new book,Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza, which is published by Penguin Random House in the US and Atlantic Books in the UK.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The 10-point manifesto, which proclaimed that “the next evolution of consciousness, creating unthinkable next-generation lifeforms and silicon-based awareness” was imminent, quickly went viral, as did follow-up posts.Effective accelerationism, or “e/acc”, exploded from being a fringe movement dedicated to pushing back against AI extinction-fearing “doomers” to being name-checked by major Silicon Valley CEOs such as Garry Tan, the CEO of the start-up accelerator Y Combinator;Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI; Marc Andreessen, the billionaire software engineer; andElon Musk.In 2023, Andreessen issued his Techno-Optimist Manifesto, expanding beyond the e/acc’s focus on AI to encompass all questions of technological progress. “We are told to be angry, bitter, and resentful about technology,” he writes, yet previously and for hundreds of years, we had glorified it. The enemies of techno-optimism are, he says, statism, economic planning and socialism. Andreessen tells us: “Technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential … It is time, once again, to raise the technology flag.”And last year saw the release of the Techno-Humanist Manifesto from the Roots of Progress Institute and Jason Crawford, who makes similar arguments for the liberatory power of technology, while alsoarguingthat anything that can be for profit should be.But where is the left in all this?The left needs its own version of techno-optimism | Amana Fontanella-KhanRead moreOne would think that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the market flounder and the state rise to the occasion with responses such as Operation War Speed’s vaccine development and rollouts, the left would be crowing about how it produced technological progress far better than all this market fundamentalism.It was the embrace of varieties of economic planning that produced the innovation needed to defeat the virus. For decades, large firms had gotten out of the business of vaccine development because it was insufficiently profitable. The mRNA vaccine delivery vehicle that is now recognized asrevolutionaryfor the life sciences far beyond Covid had beensitting on the shelffor about a decade, spurned by uninterested, risk-averse investors.At the start of the pandemic, big pharma remained wary that transmission might fizzle out and they’d be left having spent billions on a white elephant. Instead, it was the advance purchase agreements, subsidies and coordination of the government – which does not need to turn a profit – via the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) and Operation Warp Speed that delivered the vaccine and saved the world.Meanwhile, free-market driven distribution of PPE, ventilators, medical fridges and oxygen hadproducedlittle more than corruption, bottlenecks and irrational allocation to those who could pay the highest price – not allocation where it was most needed. It was only when the White House deployed the Defense Production Act to enable the government to takeover distribution that the market’s deadly mess was cleared up.The left should be proudly flaunting the record of governments around the world in responding to CovidThe left should be proudly flaunting the record of governments around the world in responding to Covid. It should make the case that all major technological and scientific advancements are best delivered by governments. And it should make the case that we – the people – should embrace faith in technological progress that is rooted in public investment.In other words, the left should be the real techno-optimists. But instead, in recent years, there has been a growing skepticism of technology on the contemporary left – from cynicism about space-faring to fear of genetic engineering and opposition to nuclear power.The left should be calling for government intervention to ensure decarbonization of data centers for AI. It should demand that we direct machine-learning research to prioritize the solving of grand scientific challenges such asprediction of protein foldinginstead of bad fantasy art fabrication and plagiarism. But instead, the mostpopular leftwing tech podcastcalls for degrowth of generative AI and data centers due the latter’s carbon intensity.Progressives could be reminding the world of Neil Armstrong’swarningabout the privatization of space – while still cheering on SpaceX’s work to develop reusable rocketry, radically reducing the cost of humans and payloads escaping our planet’s gravity well, all the better to deliver the space and planetary science we need to monitor and solve so many ecological challenges.We could be explaining how space colonization, a worthwhile multigenerational, perhaps millennia-long endeavor, will be public sector-led or it will not happen, due to the risible likelihood of it being profitable. Musk won’t get to Mars without Nasa. But instead the leftdeclaresspace-faring to be settler-colonialism, oddly equating lifeless rocks with Indigenous peoples.Environmentalists and green NGOs should be celebrating research into genetically modified crops that if successful will reduce pesticide use, nitrogen pollution and land-use change. But instead, anti-GMO campaign groupsvandalizedan Italian research trial of rice-blast-resistant arborio (risotto) rice this summer, while Greenpeace successfullyconvinceda Filipino court to overturn approval of commercial cultivation of Golden Rice, a variety modified to combat vitamin A deficiency, which causes blindness and even death in tens of thousands of children annually in Asia.This leftwing technophobia is something of an historic aberration. Traditionally, the left had always been enthusiastic about the potential of technology for liberation, to release us from drudgery and boundlessly expand our degrees of freedom – so long as technology was unfettered from the irrationality of profit and hierarchy and yoked to egalitarian reason. Prometheus plus Spartacus, as mid-century Marxist Hal Draper put it.We sometimes forget that the Communist Manifesto was itself a techno-optimist declaration of intent. It was a critique of capitalism but it was also a celebration of the new technologies, both industrial and social, that this system had set loose.From Karl Marx’s enthusiasm for the Industrial Revolution through to British Labour prime minister Harold Wilson’s call to harness the “white heat” of the Scientific Revolution, the conventional left position was that its programme would enable society tosurpassthe technological progress of mere capitalism. The point was not to retreat from capitalism, but instead to advance from it. We the people would develop the “forces of production” much more rapidly through conscious, democratic planning (albeit to greater or lesser degrees of such planning, depending on the flavour of leftist) rather than leaving such development to the fetters imposed by the risk-averse, poorly coordinated and unconscious anarchy of the market.The left should be the real techno-optimists. But instead, in recent years, there has been a growing skepticism of technology on the contemporary leftScientific, technological and industrial development would not only be faster, but broader, for the left would share the fruits of development with all humanity as rapidly as economic capacity would allow, rather than limiting their spread to those locations and populations where such production was profitable. A virtuous circle was then supposed to emerge as a result: with ever more humans benefiting from such progress, ever more humans would be able to contribute to science, engineering, medicine and agronomy, resulting in yetmoreprogress. Liberation would beget ever accelerating liberation.It was instead the counter-Enlightenmentright– aristocrats, the church, Burkean critics of the French Revolution – who were horrified at how technology and industry constantly revolutionized society, washing away ancient traditions and endlessly transforming social relations. The industrial engineering of the factory and the “social engineering” of democracy were the same thing to the reactionary, anti-modernist mind. The children of the Radical Enlightenment, both liberals and socialists, also made little distinction between social and technological progress, but thought them good, and were intent on carrying out French revolutionary Georges Danton’s commandment:“De l’audace, encore de l’audace, toujours de l’audace!” (“Audacity; yet more audacity; always audacity!”)Today, however, that leftwing optimism and confidence about humanity’s capacity for superior, entwined social, scientific and technological progress – once political economy was thoroughly democratized, has been lost, especially on the environmental left. It has been replaced by a techno-scepticism and cynicism about progress that varies from a soft neo-Luddism through to a more thoroughgoing Malthusian opposition to further economic development, prompted by a fear that we have long since outstripped the carrying capacity of the planet. Many believe industrial modernity was a mistake.Elon Musk is a proven danger to good science, but the Royal Society won’t say so. That’s why I resigned | Kit YatesRead more(Note that these contemporary neo-luddites should not be confused with the historical Luddites, the 19th-century stockingers – workers running stocking frame mechanical knitting machines – who engaged in riot and sabotage of automated textile machinery to protest employers’ use of such machines to drive down wages. It was the capitalist socio-economic relations surrounding this technology that the Luddites were protesting, not technology itself. If anything, today’s neo-luddites should learn from their namesakes and focus less on the machines and more on who owns them.)All of this creeping anti-modernism threatens not merely human development and the expanding freedom that flows from it, but also undermines our ability to adequately respond to a range of existential threats, from climate change to pandemics. We are caught between the capitalist techno-hucksterism of Musk and the Malthusian technophobia of Greenpeace and friends.Thankfully, there is – to coin a phrase – a third way.In place of technophobia, the left’s traditional arguments around the “market alignment problem” still offer a better path toward enhancing human liberation. In place of both market fundamentalist neoliberalism and green-inflected neo-Luddism, the left should be talking once again about conscious design of the economy – and thence which technologies we want to develop and accelerate – through industrial policy, public ownership and other forms of democratic economic planning.As of 2024, we are roughly at the halfway point between the first climate treaty, 1997’s Kyoto protocol, and the 2050 deadline for net-zero decarbonization of the economy. Yet due to policymakers’ overdependence on market-based mechanisms such as carbon-pricing (and the developing world’s understandable demand for fossil-fueled development), the share of fossil fuels in global energy consumption has barely moved, dropping from 86% to 82%. But industrial policy domestically – building on Bidenomics’ version of the Green New Deal, the Inflation Reduction Act – and a properly egalitarian approach to climate finance and economic development internationally, can turn all this around.Our suite of antibiotics is rapidly failing and so in the absence of new discovery and development of new ones, as well as new diagnostic techniques and vaccines, clinicians warn that we are nearing a collapse of the foundation of antimicrobial protection upon which almost all of modern medicine depends. But decommodification of pharmaceutical production and, again, internationalism could solve the problem entirely.Similarly, pandemic monitoring and early warning systems require robust public-sector funding, restructuring of intellectual property rights, and even global democracy. All of this is optimized by a more muscular social democracy.There are so many areas where the left should have so much more to say about technology and progressBiodiversity loss threatens to undermine ecosystem services that we depend upon, but precision agriculture, new genetic techniques and “lab meat” can radically reduce humanity’s land-footprint, so long as there is strong state intervention to de-risk these new technologies.In order to overcome less well known but still profound risks from space debris and near-Earth asteroids, we need not cynicism about space, but a revival of space as primarily a public-sector enterprise and the sort of internationalism and global democracy that the left favours.But a left approach to technology is not just about avoiding harm, but about grand ambition. Getting to Mars and beyond, spreading life throughout the cosmos, is a gargantuan multi-generational endeavour, of the level of audacity that Danton commanded. Markets will never get us there if it isn’t profitable enough – and it is unlikely to be so.The left needs to abandon its miserable, irrational pessimism | Aaron BastaniRead moreArtificial intelligence has already solved the hard problem of protein-folding, and soon it could radically enhance medical diagnosis, accelerate materials discovery, and reduce mineral exploration costs, and maybe even predict earthquakes, but much of this will require humans working alongside AI rather than AI replacing humans – meaning an increased cost over either humans or computers alone, which will thus tend to be far less attractive to capital. And so AI thus far appears to be primarily directed at much more profitable but far less freedom-enhancing endeavours such as enterprise software, theft from artists and musicians, and ever more panoptical state surveillance.To steal a phrase from artificial intelligence discourse, the market has an “alignment problem”. It is an algorithm independent of human control. And so it could be said that the techno-libertarians want to liberate themselves from all things that unconsciously dominate humanity – except for markets.There are so many areas where the left should have so much more to say about technology and progress, whether the challenges we face are existential threats or how to achieve the most soaring of ambitions.Neither Silicon Valley tech hucksters nor eco-austerity technophobes are up to the task.Leigh Phillips is a science writer and a political journalist"

He wants to stifle criticism of Israel – but the real target is dissentTue 11 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 04.58 EDTShareFor those who fearDonald Trumpis a despot in the making, don’t worry: he has an answer. “I’ve stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America,” he triumphantly declared in his State of the Union address. “It’s back!” JD Vance scolded Europe in his speech at the Munich security conference last month, declaring that “free speech is in retreat” across the continent.Like all authoritarian creeds, Trumpism turns reality on its head and empties words of their meaning in an effort to sow confusion and disarray among its critics. On the same day Trump announced the revival of free speech in Congress, he posted on Truth Social that federal funding for educational institutions that allow “illegal protests” will be ceased. Notably, illegality was not defined, but the issue Trump is referring to, of course, is Palestine. “Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came,” he declared. “American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS!”Trump’s first target: Columbia University, which has had $400m of federal funding slashed because of what the government says is “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students”. At least nine other campuses – including Harvard and the University of California – could be next. All were the sites of overwhelmingly peaceful encampments protesting over Israel’s genocidal attack against the Palestinian people. They weren’t simply opposing their government’s facilitation of this atrocity, through weapons, aid and diplomatic support, but demanding their colleges divest from companies linked to Israel.Just as Trumpism is no guarantor of free speech, nor is it a vanguard of anti-racism: it is, in fact, the opposite. The very real menace of antisemitism has been systematically conflated with any critique of crimes committed by the state of Israel. This is what is meant by “anti-Israel hate”, as Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick as new ambassador to the UN puts it, who became a rightwing icon after facing down university presidents over Israel. The president’s most powerful allyis Elon Musk, a man who in 2023 expressed his agreement with a tweet claiming Jewish communities were pushing “hatred against whites”, and recently performed Nazi salutes at a Trump rally.Trump himself declared that Jewish Americans who support the Democrats – that is,the vast majority– “hate their religion”, “hate everything about Israel” and “should be ashamed of themselves”, and menacinglysaid they wouldhave a “lot” of blame if he lost the presidential election. The university protests, on the other hand, had a large Jewish presence, and hundreds of Jewish students signed a letter rejecting “the ways that these encampments have beensmeared as antisemitic”.Indeed, Columbia in particular victimised its own students. The university banned Jewish Voice for Peace before the encampment began, ordered police raids which led to more than 100 students being arrested, disciplined and expelled, andtargeted sympathetic academics.One wasKatherine Franke, a professor who was publicly denounced by Stefanik and forced into retirement. Far from protecting Jewish students, Franke claims, this is about “radical advocates for Israel” lying about the campus protests. “This university has bent a knee and coddled bullies,” she says of Columbia’s repression of students’ free speech – and still it had its funding slashed.It gets more sinister. The Department of Homeland Security arrested one of the lead negotiators of Columbia’s encampment: Mahmoud Khalil, a US green card holder of Palestinian origin,married to a US citizenwho is eight months pregnant. Unknown to his wife, he was sent more than1,000 miles awayto a notorious detention centre in Louisiana. The department’s claim: that “he led activities aligned to Hamas”, a blatant attempt to conflate Palestinian solidarity with the militant group responsible for war crimes on 7 October.Far from restoring free speech, Trump’s administration is incinerating the first amendment. When it comes to Palestine, free speech simply does not exist. Surely there is one man who will be particularly incensed by this outrage. After all, just last weekhe grandly proclaimed: “We have to ask ourselves the question as leaders: ‘Are we willing to defend people even if we disagree with what they say?’ If you’re not willing to do that, I don’t think you’re fit to lead Europe or the United States.” That was the vice-president, JD Vance.Ice arrests Palestinian activist who helped lead Columbia protests, lawyer saysRead moreBut the truth is, the US right never actually cared about free speech. It was simply a ruse, intended to stigmatise any attempt to rebut its bigotry against largely voiceless minorities. TheTrump administrationhas escalated the biggest onslaught against free speech since McCarthyism: even before its assumption of power, those opposed to Israel’s genocide have faced being deplatformed, victimised and indeed targeted by institutions like Columbia.Yet it was not just the hardcore right who defamed these protests. Many self-described “liberals” and “centrists” joined in, smearing those opposed to some of the worst atrocities of the 21st century as hateful, dangerous extremists – Jewish Americans among them. In doing so, they helped legitimise the inevitable authoritarian crackdown that is now under way. Simone Zimmerman, co-founder of Jewish American campaign groupIfNotNow, told me we are now seeing “the terrifying logical conclusion of smearing anyone calling for Palestinian freedom as an antisemite: a white nationalist administration carrying out its war on civil rights and free speech under the banner of ‘fighting antisemitism’. We are all endangered by this blatant assault on our democracy.”It would be deeply naive to believe this repression will end with the attacks on people expressing solidarity with Palestine. A precedent that is established can swiftly be expanded. As it is, the US media are increasingly menaced by – among other things – Trump’s libel actions, the threat of vexatious investigations and plutocrats like Jeff Bezos bending the knee to the would-be king. Free speech is being pummelled by those who claim to be its greatest advocates.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But to exclude the patient experience is to do them a disserviceTue 11 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 19.14 EDTShareWhen my friend suggests dinner, I beg off.“Finishing M&M, not in the mood,” I explain with a sad emoji.“One of those,” she sympathises.When I first encountered the acronym for the morbidity and mortality meeting, I thought it ironic that one of the bitterest reckonings in medicine shared the name of the sweet treat of my youth.I first began attending M&Ms as a medical student, squeezing into the back of the room to listen to senior doctors dissect various harms patients had incurred. Back then I was just a wide-eyed observer keen to understand the moving parts of a huge system. Fast forward a few decades and I have attended hundreds of these meetings.Morbidity and mortality meetings in medicineare a century old.Cold calling patients with bad news can be excruciating. At those times, instinct is all I can rely on | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreIn the 1930s surgeons, physicians and anaesthetists would meet to discuss cases and conclude with a vote if the death was preventable. Imagine the contest of ideas (and egos) in that gathering.Today the format and aim of the M&M is still surprisingly unclear. While deaths must be recorded, the meeting itself is not compulsory.It is variously regarded as an educational opportunity, a tool for quality improvement, and a forum for identifying outliers. It may also serve to restrain hubris, interrogate standards and force system changes, the last especially relevant in shifting from the traditional “blame-and-shame” approach to a collaborative one.No clinician enjoys being in the crosshairs of an M&M. It is a delicate matter to raise problems without judgment, acknowledge the benefit of hindsight and focus on the future instead of litigating the past. When conducted from a place of psychological safety, curiosity and empathy, the process can be useful for setting standards.But I can’t help noticing that the more M&Ms I attend, the worse I feel on my way out.First, I am sceptical about the definition of morbidity as determined by doctors. Mortality means only one thing but morbidity is open to interpretation – and it is well recognised thatdoctors frequently underestimate the patient experience.I met a chemotherapy patient with such profuse diarrhoea and weakness who received help so late that he became bedbound. Morphine had him hallucinating, waving to “all those people” on the ceiling. His poor wife was distressed and terrified – and yet, the medical notes recorded his condition as stable because he wasn’t getting worse. The use of such narrow medical standards worried other providers, including his nurse, but, if his doctors didn’t flag his morbidity as serious, chances are no one else would.The M&M meeting is an opportunity to get things right the next timeThis is how non-fatal events can be downplayed instead of receiving systematic exploration to ensure they are not repeated.The truth is that any patient sick enough to be tabled at an M&M has encountered a whole range of providers from whom it is important to hear. To review the case from the perspective of doctors alone is to miss the full story and, potentially, attract groupthink. But modern medicine with its siloed nature renders impossible the kind of communal deliberations needed to achieve holistic care.In my view, the most troubling absence at M&M meetings is the patient or family voice. Admittedly, the object of the meeting is to untangle medical errors in a safe space but to altogether exclude the patient experience or filter it through the eyes of doctors is to do patients a disservice.The most powerful way of reflecting on our omissions and commissions is to hear how they affected the patient. “It was the worst experience of my life, and I really thought Dad was going to die” lands differently than “the patient’s daughter was a bit upset”.“I kept calling, got passed around, and have never felt more alone” is more damning than “unfortunately, the patient couldn’t reach us”.But unless patients demand accountability (by resorting to a complaint, if they can be bothered), the magnitude of their troubles can go unheeded. M&Ms need a better way of incorporating the patient voice even if the patient is not in the room.Clinical cancer trials are vital for scientific progress – but there are many unanswered questions for patients | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThese meetings are intended to help doctors reflect on what we could have done better and simultaneously advocate for a healthcare system that is our ally. But it’s hard not to carry a heavy conscience whenthe pattern of errors is familiar. A lack of communication between providers, a failure to listen to the patient, a surfeit of confidence, a dearth of humility.The M&M meeting is an opportunity to get things right the next time. But without skilful and impartial moderation, the process can turn into a mere checkbox exercise, which may well leave patients wondering how this could ever achieve systemic change in a healthcare system that is always distracted by some crisis.Walking away from some of the most depressing M&M meetings, I dream of an outcome that says to the affected people: “We reflected on your case. Here is how it made us feel and this is what we learned. In the future, this is what we will do differently.”Whenever there is morbidity and mortality, rarely do patients or families seek retribution. Indeed, their uniform wish is that “this doesn’t happen to anyone else”. I suspect most never find out.Mostly, I love my job but there are days when I dread the thought of attending another M&M. But I know it’s important to go back because we owe it to our patients, past and future.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

A negative amount of time, it seems, with Great Yarmouth MPRupert Lowealready relieved of the whip for saying that Reform is currently “a protest party led by the Messiah”. Yep: Jesus Christ Superkings.Anyway, Nigel Farage has taken all this as well as you might expect. In terms of what’s happened since, with even Nigel judging that “things have got a little bit out of control”, I’m finding it quite hard to immerse myself fully in every angle. Mainly because I’m worried it’s going to be one of those stories that demeans men – and I’m a passionate supporter of their involvement in politics, whatever people are saying about DEI nowadays.But the broad brush of it is: a party leader who wants to be PM is too much of an egomaniac to even handle having some MPs; some of his people who hate lawyers have called in the lawyers; some of his people who love free speech have been upset by some words; and some of his people who hate snowflakes have gone to the actual police about what they say is a bit of verbal. Then again, there is an alternative broad brush: Lowe is an old Radleian who admires Tommy Robinson; meanwhile, Elon Musk – a man who owns X but apparently has no access to Google – now thinks Rupert is the fairest of them all and that Nigel “doesn’t have what it takes”. In fact, according to a report in Tuesday’s Financial Times, Elon Musk’s allies suggest he wouldfinancially back a credible alternativeparty to Reform.All this has outraged Farage, because he badly needs donations and isn’t currently getting them at anything like the rate he needs (hepicked up £280,000in the last three months of 2024, versus £2m for the Tories and £1m for Labour. Also, because he’s Nigel Farage. As so often in seeking the perfect commentator on contemporary British politics, I am drawn to Legend from Gladiators, who once remarked: “There is no I in team. But there are five in individual brilliance.”Hang on – there have been even more developments in Nigel v Rupert. On Tuesday morning, Lowe’s Westminster staff countered alleged bullying allegations against the MP by putting out anadorably weird statementsaying they love working for him. For his part, Lowe has issued an invitation to Farage that feels somewhat hilarious in these particular circumstances: “Please, let’s have dinner and resolve this in a manner that our members and the country would expect.” Half-cut in an ultra-metro-elite restaurant on someone else’s dime? You’re right, I would expect that.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage in front of his notorious, widely denounced Brexit poster, June 2016.Photograph: Phil Toscano/PAMeanwhile, a senior Reform figure last weekendconfided darkly: “[Rupert] has crossed Nigel, and the political world is littered with the bodies of people who have done that.” Mm. Not sure that’s the boast they think it is. Yet we do have to accept that violence, both figurative and literal, has occasionally been a feature of the 37 parties which Nigel has at one point or another led / founded / been associated with / been CEO of. But for the benefit of the lawyers, I want to be very clear that I agree entirely with his senior Reform ally: Nigel Farage is only ametaphoricalpsychopathic killer who cannot handle colleagues disagreeing with him.Or, as Farageprefers to characterisethe deterioration of relations with Lowe: “I have been surprised and saddened at this behaviour. Certainly, I never saw anything like it in the European parliament in 2019 when I was the leader of the Brexit party and Mr Lowe was an MEP colleague.” And yet, is Nigel quite such an innocent? In terms of vignettes that all this has exhumed from the memory hole, do you remember theUkip punch-upin the Strasbourg parliament? This was during the Brexit years, and saw poetry-writing MEP Steven Woolfe flat-out collapse, shortly after a reported altercation with the party’s defence spokesman, Mike Hookem. Initial chronicler of the bust-up was fellow Ukip MEP Neil Hamilton, who rushed towards the cameras to play thechuckling man-of-the-world, declaring: “Steven picked a fight … and came off worse”. (Sorry Neil, but you simply CAN’T carry off talk like that when you wear a bow tie and sit on your wife’s knee.) Farage’s own dismissive comment on the incident was that this was just “something that happens between men”.A big thank you to Reform for the comic relief in dark times | John CraceRead moreMuch more to the present point, however, we now have to ask how the Lowe-Farage kumite will play out in Runcorn and Helsby. There is, of course, going to be a byelection there, after Labour MP Mike Amesbury was convicted of punching one of his constituents on a night out, which I believe started with himposing upwith his good friend the local police commissioner. (There is nothing – NOTHING – wrong with our country right now.) Reform is in second place in Runcorn and Helsby, so the question is whether this public meltdown will derail the momentum it has enjoyed since the election. Lowe is certainly trying to make sure it does, taking to social media to announce: “I feel so sorry for millions of decent British men and women from all over the country who put their faith in Reform.” Tell you what, it’s great to find themuch-loved former Southampton FC chairmanon the side of the fans again.Having said that … if you’d had a political Tardis in recent years, you could have taken someone from the not-too-distant past on any number of mind-blowing journeys into the batshit present. But I almost think you’d get the most poleaxed reaction of all if you piloted it back to Southampton’s Westquay shopping centre in 2009, and gave any random Saints fan a quick look at the future. Consider what you’d be revealing: “In 16 years’ time, the richest man in the world – who’s the unofficial vice-president to Donald Trump, yes, the one off the US Apprentice – will say that Rupert Lowe should be prime minister of the United Kingdom.” Rupert Lowe?! RUPERT LOWE?!?!?! I honestly think the resultant psychiatric eruption would blow the roof off the mall.Yet here we all are. Listen, I’m not against the idea of personal growth, but it is some distance beyond wild that a guy who took Southampton football club into administration now reckons he’d do a better job with an entire country. And, it must be acknowledged, it says even more about the utter failure of the political mainstream that guys like Lowe now seem a possible throw of the dice for people who don’t feel their lives have been remotely improved in getting on for two decades.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageRupert LowecommentShareReuse this content"

This is horribly short-sightedTue 11 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 11.50 EDTShareOn a picturesque bridge beside Harvey’s brewery in Lewes, Steve Coogan, local resident and lifelong Labour man, stood surrounded by Liberal Democrat campaigners and many Labour supporters. It was the middle of last year’s general election campaign, and supporters of both parties cheeredCoogan’s message: “Where the main contenders against the Tories are the Liberal Democrats, that’s what people should vote. Vote tactically to get the Tories out!” Around the country, millions did. John Curtice, still working on the estimates, says he reckons tactical voting may have delivered Labour up to 100 extra seats, and stacks of Lib Dem gains. The spirit of the election was a country determined to punish the Conservatives.On the bridge that day was Lewes Labour member and film-maker Tony Dowmunt, filming Coogan to put his message on social media, urging progressive voters everywhere to vote tactically to oust the Tories. But Dowmunt and fellow Lewes Labour member Paul Wafer, who was holding the microphone that day, have both beenexpelled from Labour. “Your membership of the party stands terminated. You are no longer entitled to attend any party meetings or to exercise any other rights associated with membership of the party,” said their letters from Labour HQ, unsigned – merely from the “Disputes Team”.The claim is that the two ousted members “demonstrated the type of support for the Liberal Democrats that is incompatible with chapter 2, clause I.5.B.vi of theLabour party rule book”. In principle, that’s a necessary rule: members can’t back parties standing against Labour, or the multitude of prohibited anti-Labour groupuscules. But, as Wafer wrote to party officials in his defence, many had “worked together during the election campaign to do everything we could locally to help secure a Labour government, by ridding the country of as many sitting Tory MPs as possible. In Lewes, Labour couldn’t win, but the Tories could lose. Getting the Tories defeated in Lewes made a direct contribution to Labour’s victory in July.”Labour HQ had rightly written off Lewes anyway. In an unspoken electoral alliance, Labour and the Lib Dems laser-focused their respective campaigning on plausibly winnable seats. Lewes Labour people like Dowmunt went canvassing in Crawley and Worthing West, where they helped eject Tories from both seats. Labour’s selective targeting was so overt that LabourListpublished a listof 211 “non-battleground” constituencies: of which Lewes was one. When the results werecounted, Labour came in fourth behind Reform with just 6.7%. But someone snitched on these two members to Labour HQ for breaching the rules; Labour even contemplatedthrowing outNeal Lawson, the director of Compass, for his organisation’s tactical voting campaign. What madness is this? Keir Starmer often says, “Country first, party second”. But this puts party tribalism well ahead of everything, as does his rejection of electoral reform.What happened in Lewes is a small local matter, you may think, but its implications for progressive government are profound. With the right in power most of my lifetime, despite the left and centre-left clocking up most votes in virtually every election, Labour’s high command sticks to bone-headed tribal obduracy on electoral reform. In doing so, it is responsible for preventing British politics from matching that of its citizens. That’s despite the party at large voting in favour ofelectoral reformin 2022, and despite the dozens of new Labour MPs whosupport it. The latest polling shows votersbacking proportional representation(PR) over first past the post (FPTP) by 49% to 26%. Frequently cheated itself in the past, in 2024 it was Labour that benefited grotesquely from FPTP, winning more than 60% of seats on a third of the vote. The Electoral Reform Society chief executive, Darren Hughes, called it one of the mostdisproportional election resultsthe world had ever seen.As the youngest peer in the House of Lords, I have a bold plan for this place. Abolish it – me included | Carmen SmithRead moreIt is all the more frustrating that Labour could be using its ill-gotten stonking majority to bring in reform – at least for one election initially, with another confirming vote in parliament afterwards. A system devised for two parties has become dangerously fragile and unpredictable with four to five parties competing. The smallest voting shift causes seismic shocks. “A breath of wind can change everything,” Prof Rob Ford tells me. “Just one in 50 voters changing their minds can make the difference between triumph and disaster.” Between the 2019 and 2024 elections, Labour gained only1.7% more votes, but that gave it 32% more of the total seats. That same dysfunction could blow Reform into power on a small increase: FPTP now causes fickle precarity, not stability and certainty. With such fine margins,Elon Musk’s millionsreally may swing an election, says Ford – another good reason to clear big money out of politics at the same time.Turbulence at home and abroad makes election predictions pointless: Starmer got a bounce this week fromYouGov, with 48% thinking he is handling the Ukraine crisis well, against 32% who don’t. But in a few days Labour’s standing may plummet again, if its benefit cuts are too harsh. The crunch spending review later this month will define Labour: iron-fisted fiscal rigour with severe cuts could alienate progressive voters, without attracting the right.Voting systems profoundly influence everyday politics. FPTP focuses all effort on wooing a few mercurial swing voters, who are likely to be more tax-averse. “Under PR, politics becomes more progressive,” Ford tells me. “PR prevents extremes; you’d never get a Thatcher government again. Coalitions moderate policies.” Then why didn’t Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems moderate the ferocious austerity of David Cameron and George Osborne in the2010 parliament? “They got run over: they’ve learned their lesson.”Next timeLabourmay well be in coalition, and electoral reform will be the price. As Ford warns them: “Be nice to people when you’re on top, as you’ll need them on your way down.” Treating near-allies as the enemy looks arrogant. Lewes’s sensible tactical voters are not Labour traitors.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerFirst past the postProportional representationcommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s illusory: the poster was never publicly displayed during the war and only discovered by chance decades later.Illusions bedevil our readiness to cope with the crises we might face. Reviewing the state of UK civil food resilience for aNational Preparedness Commission report, I found that there is, in fact, scant preparedness going on, and little attention given to involving the public.The official government resilience framework has three sound principles: first, take a “whole of society” approach; second, prevention is better than the cure; and third, build a shared understanding of the risks. But what does this mean in practice? Not nearly enough. I found the further away from Whitehall I looked, the less people were being engaged.On the morning of 22 May last year, hours before the general election was called, the Conservative MP Oliver Dowden, then deputy prime minister, told a defence industries conference that he wanted everyone in the UK to storethree days’ worth of food and water.But this is scarcely realistic. For individuals juggling competing financial demands, food is the flexible item in their budget. Fixed costs come first. There are other problems too. The Food Foundation’s 2025Broken Platereport states: “Healthier foods are more than twice as expensive per calorie than less healthy foods and less available. The most deprived fifth of the population would need to spend 45% of their disposable income on food to afford the government-recommended healthy diet – rising to 70% for households with children.” So with rampant diet and health gaps caused by income inequalities, any notion of a “whole of society” solution evaporates.The national risk register, the UK’s official list of 89 risks facing us, barely acknowledges food. It points to just one risk:food supply contamination, and that’s on page 122 in the 2025 document. Yet almost all the expert opinion I canvassed predicted enormous short- and long-term food security challenges ahead. Think energy outages, ransomware attacks, AI/bot attacks, internet failure, chokepoints and trade disruption. Think geopolitical downturn, the spread of war and overt conflicts, and disinformation-led public panics. In addition, there are all the impacts of climate heating: biodiversity loss, too much or too little water, and soil erosion.It may salve the consciences of central government planners to putemergency preparedness adviceon to a website, but it is clearly not enough. Two countries I examined, Latvia and Sweden, have developed practical advice. Last year Sweden produced a major reorientation of its food policy and intends to build more diversity into its food system, including creating dispersed national food stores. Sweden is also passing new legislation making it a responsibility of mayors to ensure that all are fed in a crisis. Storage has been central to crisis preparedness throughout human history, but in the modern world only Switzerland retains anational food store.So what should we do? Myreportargues that public protection depends on action at national, regional, community and household levels. Just telling the public to store food is ridiculous. As interviewees told me, it’s a fantasy to think that everyone can look after themselves. Resilience isn’t a bolt-on feature. It emerges from how the food system operates, how we relate with each other.For more than half a century, food companies have pursued lean efficiency. The only storage, as the logistics industry told me, is what’s on the motorway in delivery lorries.“Just in time” managementhates storage. That’s why I propose that we switch to a“just in case” approach.This needs community action, not just top-down advice. Already there are UK communities, towns and some cities that see the need for this. In Yorkshire, theFixOurFood coalitionof communities, suppliers and academics has created a network of advice and knowledge about who can do what now. InFlintshireandEdinburghcommunity gardeners have trialled alternatives to our dependency on the big retailers. Building community solidarity is a process.Latvians I spoke to said: “We tell our people that if Russia invades, government will collapse.” This advice is given not to scare people but to focus the public’s attention so people know how to help themselves and each other if shocks do come. Every household has a pack of cards containing this information.Rule number one in resilience planning is to try to prevent crises in the first place via a sustainable food system. But rule number two is to help build capacities to bounce back after shocks hit. Things won’t be the same. A country that expects food to be on shelves 364 days a year (Christmas Day excepted) just isn’t prepared for shocks. TheFair Food Futures Projecthas been asking communities in Bradford and London’s Tower Hamlets to assess what emergency food systems they have by mapping “community food assets”. I think this is essential. Your local cafe or pub might be where simple meals can be cooked after a shock.Biohazards, Putin, extremism… we’ll need more than a few tins of beans | Martha GillRead moreAt a restricted official meeting I attended last year, we were all asked how many of us had a “grab bag” – a carrier you can sling over your shoulder to escape when danger strikes, with essentials such as passport, bank details, phone, charger, keys, glasses, medication, child essentials, cash, contact details and food. We were also asked how many of us kept a store for emergencies. Most kept the bag; fewer had an emergency store of food.But then it’s easier to prepare a grab bag than it is to lay down heavy and costly stores of food, much less water, which is what you most need in the short term. The Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protectionreminds its citizensthat they can go without food for 30 days but without water for only three. The truth is that we UK citizens live in a fantasy world – a legacy of the British empire – that someone far away will always feed us. At the same time, business knows that there are shocks ahead too big for even them to handle. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says 2025 is the year itaddresses food security and resilience. It must. Only the government can provide the direction that is sorely needed. The public must hold it to account, hopefully before calamity strikes.Tim Lang is professor emeritus of food policy at the Centre forFoodPolicy, City St George’s, University of LondonExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionEmergency planningcommentShareReuse this content"

Recent talks between Ukraine and its partners have given rise to great hope that the Ukrainian people will very soon return to the peaceful lives that they enjoyed before the war began in 2014 or the extreme escalation since 2022.I believe that together with strong American leadership we can reach this goal. The prospect of peace – long hoped for – forces every Ukrainian to reflect on our shared gratitude, concern and determination. Gratitude for the support and confidence that we have received in recent years, concern for the future of Europe and determination to reaffirm Ukraine’s democratic, European convictions. No one wants the war to end more than our people – but a peace must be found that is both just and sustainable.A ceasefire in Ukraine will not come through diplomatic gestures alone. A number of conditions are crucial beforehand in order to ensure that peace – when it comes – is lasting. This includes putting political and financial pressure onRussiato raise the cost of renewed conflict.First, Ukraine must be given security guarantees that lend credibility to a future ceasefire agreement. Second, Europe must act decisively to strengthen and increase the sanctions against Russia. And third, Europe should take control of the frozen Russian assets to enable continued and increased support for Ukraine. Last week’sEuropean Council sessionproves that Europe – when united – can take control of its own security and destiny. It is our concern for lasting European security that drives Ukraine’s insistence on these conditions. Moscow’s decade-long aggression against Ukraine cannot be taken lightly – the leaders of Europe recognise this and we call on them at this critical time to deliver on the promising discussions in Brussels last Thursday.The growing recognition of the need to enhance European strategic autonomy on defence, backed up by fiscal flexibility on defence spending, is an important step. Europe’s decision tojointly borrow up to €150bnfor member-state defence spending is critical. This – combined with a potential €20bn for Ukraine’s defence – will make a tangible contribution to establishing a robust defence architecture for the whole of Europe.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy with Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 10 March 2025.Photograph: Saudi Press Agency/ReutersCredible deterrence will help to ensure that any ceasefire has the best chances of becoming a lasting peace.Europecannot allow a ceasefire that serves only to allow Russia to rearm, rebuild its forces and come back for more Ukrainian lands and resources.The EU has just approved its16th sanctions package against Russia, hitting key sectors such as imports of aluminium and broadening export restrictions. This economic pressure must be maintained – to strengthen all of our economic autonomy.Stronger sanctions will close loopholes in the financial system, preventing European businesses and institutions from indirectly funding Russia’s war machine, while also setting a precedent for dealing with future threats. In the long run, Europe’s decreased dependency on Russia will bring geopolitical strength and market stability.Europe has promised €30.6bn in financial supportthis year. We are grateful for this commitment to our future and economic recovery.Yet one of the most potent tools in Europe’s arsenal is the€300bn in frozen Russian assetsheld in western financial institutions. These resources should remain under embargo, with profits used to sustain Ukraine’s financial recovery. Allowing Russia to reclaim these funds after its war of aggression would have catastrophic consequences.We greatly appreciate the generosity of the US and its efforts to achieve peace for Ukraine. But European unity is no less important in this process. Only together can we build a security architecture that will guarantee peace and prosperity for generations to come.A stronger, safer and more resilient Europe – militarily, politically and economically – is our shared goal. Securing a meaningful ceasefire is the first step. This requires a Europe that is economically and politically resilient. Europe must be prepared to act to deliver its own security, and Russia must understand the political and economic cost of using force to achieve its ends.Andriy Yermak is head of the Ukrainian presidential officeExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

She was one of about 70 people who gathered on 30 November last year to commemorate the anniversary of the death of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a leader of Romania’s interwar fascistLegionary Movementand head of its paramilitary wing, the Iron Guard.Codreanu and his ally, Ion Antonescu – Romania’s virulently antisemitic wartime dictator – were central figures in the country’s Holocaust history. Codreanu was assassinated in 1938 and Antonescu was executed as a war criminal in 1946.Yet, in today’s Romania, their legacy is being posthumously resurrected as part of the same nationalist pride movement that has driven the meteoric rise of far-right pro-Russia candidateCǎlin Georgescu.Georgescu came from obscurity to win the first round of presidential elections last November, prompting the courts to annul the ballot on suspicion of outside interference. On Sunday, Georgescuwas barred by the country’s election authorityfrom standing in the rerun in May, on the basis that he had violated the constitutional obligation to defend democracy.The former agronomist wasinvestigated in 2022for remarks that praised Codreanu and Antonescu as patriotic heroes and “martyrs”. The case waslater dropped. But last month he madewhat looked like a Nazi salutein public after he was questioned by prosecutors.Romania’s ‘rigged’ election shows Europe the dangers of Russian disinformation | Paula ErizanuRead moreHe enjoys thevocal supportof theEuroscepticUS vice-president, JD Vance, and another apparent fan of the sieg heil salute, Elon Musk.Nazi salutes, like the commemoration in Tâncăbești forest, are illegal under Romanian law, which prohibits the glorification of fascist figures. But such gestures and symbols have attracted new attention after November’s election turmoil.The constitutional courtannulledthe vote after declassified intelligence documents alleged Russian interference, including via a TikTok disinformation campaign.No evidence of Russian campaign financing has been uncovered so far, but prosecutors last monthindicted Georgescuon six counts, including illegal campaign financing, affiliation to antisemitic organisations and promotion of fascist symbols. He has denied wrongdoing.Even though he has been barred from standing for office, Georgescu’s emergence has amplified a culture of incendiary revisionism. Steeped in religious conservatism and ultranationalism, his rhetoric has tapped into a potent mix of discontent and nostalgia. This has resurfaced deep undercurrents of xenophobia, racism and antisemitism that many thought had been consigned to history, even though Romania’s diverse population – including significant Hungarian and Roma minorities – has long been a flashpoint for tensions.Romania’s reckoning with its fascist past has always been tenuous. After thefall of communism, which had vilified interwar fascists as enemies of the state, people such as Codreanu and Antonescu were reframed as nationalist heroes by far-right figures. This narrative found fertile ground in a country grappling with the legacy of a brutal dictatorship and the chaos of transition.Tensions were ratcheted up a notch in 2020 when the Alliance for the Union of Romanians party (AUR), the first far-right group to enter parliament,began normalising rhetoricthat minimised the Holocaust and rehabilitated the Legionaries, according to Adina Marincea, a researcher at the Elie Wiesel National Institute for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Călin Georgescu at a rally in Bucharest, 8 March 2025.Photograph: Andreea Alexandru/APBut unlike the more subtle dog-whistling preferred by the AUR, Georgescu’s messaging is overt and explicit. He stood as an independent in the aborted presidential election. His support comes from groups across a broad spectrum: young people, rural dwellers, intellectuals, priests, police, military personnel and media figures. Many refer to Georgescu as “the captain” – a title once reserved for Codreanu. More than 40 organisations with affinities to the Legionary Movement, with anti-abortionist and ultranationalist views, signed aletter of supportfor him after he won the first round.“The expression of extreme attitudes came to a peak,” Marincea said about the weeks after the first round of cancelled elections. “We saw a wave of threats and radical rhetoric from those who believed they were on the winning side.”Intimidation of minorities increased at the same time. A Roma rights group, Volunteers for Roma for Democracy, says itsmembers received death threats, photos of guns and Nazi symbols, accompanied by messages warning that “Jews and Roma must be eliminated”.“The threats wouldn’t have been possible if they weren’t encouraged by Georgescu, who is also emboldened by the extreme-right parties,” the head of the NGO, Alin Banu, told me. LGBTQ+ rights associations were also threatened.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has also received death threats.Romania’s law enforcement agencies haveconducted raidson the homes of people suspected of having commemorated the fascist leaders or of displaying fascist symbols. But these actions are reactive and insufficient.The tide of hate has already spilled over into public life, with civil society reporting increased threats, which Marincea says could turn into physical violence, especially against LGBTQ+ groups. If criminal investigations lead to no arrests, extremist groups will be further emboldened andfar-right targeting of the mediais likely to worsen.Two ultranationalistparties entered parliamentfor the first time last year, creating a political environment where hate speech is not just tolerated but celebrated. The leader of one of these partiesstreamedlive images of herselfcommemorating fascist leader Codreanu.Georgescu recently declared his support for ethnic minorities and guaranteed them safety. Marincea believes it was a “performative” social media post and “part of a strategic calculus to wash his image”.Many more people have been radicalised by the cancelling of the election results and what they see as a campaign against a messianic figure whose mission is to save the people from the establishment. Many are now calling the rejection of his candidacy in the re-run a coup d’état.Georgescu’s success is symptomatic of a broader trend supported by foreign actors including Russia: the resurgence of ultranationalist, anti-democratic movements that exploit economic uncertainty, societal divisions and distrust of mainstream institutions.In Romania, with three far-right parties holding sway in parliament, this trajectory has a uniquely dangerous edge. It is likely to increase polarisation and social divisions and reshape policy on Romania’s relationship with the EU and its support for Ukraine, as itreawakens the ghostsof a fascist past that many hoped had been exorcised.Andrei Popoviciu is a Romanian investigative journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Alternatives are obvious – and limitedMon 10 Mar 2025 21.48 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 02.19 EDTShareThe Trump administration’s actions in abandoning long-term alliances with Europe, support for Nato and Ukraine is a wakeup call. The new reality underscores the need for a fundamental review of arrangements to supply Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines. We need a sovereign solution which avoids vulnerability to a change in US and UK priorities and shortfalls in their defence budgets.The new UK-designed submarine,“Aukus-SSN”, is too big and too expensivefor Australia’s geographical and strategic needs. It is also likely to betoo late and over budget. The UK’s defence budget is under extreme stress as the country’s prioritiesswing firmly to Europe.The proposal to sell us submarines from the US navy’s inventory as a stop gap is a pipe dream. Not only is the mix of different types of SSN logistically impractical for Australia’s small navy but the US willnot be able to construct additional submarinesin time to meet its own needs and cover the gap between the retirement of the Collins until arrival of Aukus-SSN. As the nominee for head of policy at the Pentagon, Elbridge Colby, has warned, the US faces“a very difficult problem” in meeting its pledge to supply three Virginia-class submarines to Australia.It is time for plan B: building the smaller, cheaper, easier-to-crew French Suffren-class boat.Surface tension: could the promised Aukus nuclear submarines simply never be handed over to Australia?Read moreTimescale is the first critical criterion. The first of Australia’s Collins-class submarines retires in 2038, having served 40 years. We should aim to commission a replacement submarine no later than 2036, providing two years to achieve an operational capability. Thereafter we should deliver a new submarine every two years, replacing each Collins as they retire. Nuclear propulsion provides higher speed and superior mobility. This makes the nuclear-powered submarine more flexible and survivable, compared with a conventional submarine.Australia’s submarines must be optimised for anti-submarine and anti-surface ship warfare. Intelligence and surveillance contribute to our understanding and provide warning of developing threats.Personnel requirements are the second key issue. The Royal Australian Navy is already havingdifficulty recruiting and retainingpersonnel; the crew size of the new submarine should be a critical selection criterion.Against this backdrop, the options for plan B are obvious (and limited). The Suffren-class SSN, now in production for the French Navy, meets these criteria. It would be significantly cheaper to build, own and crew than the Virginia or Aukus-SSN. Suffren’s smaller size and better manoeuvrability makes it more capable in the shallow and confined waters of most interest to us in Australia’s north.Australia could operate the 12 Suffren demanded by our geography and still need fewer crew members and at less cost than the Aukus plan for eight larger submarines. Suffren is designed to Nato standards, assuring interoperability with US and UK allies.We should cease making payments for unspecified and uncontracted support to the US and UK’s submarine enterprises. We must begin urgent preparations for jointly building the first batch of three Suffren with France, before evolving to a fully Australian build, with Australian design support.Issues such as where the first batch are built – Cherbourg or Adelaide – and the amount of change, if any, in the first batch are matters for early resolution. The priority should be meeting the delivery target. The ability to evolve the SSN design during the building program, to meet changes in both threat and requirement and to maximise an Australia-based supply chain should also be priorities.This would be best achieved by Australia buying the design IP and rights, establishing a sovereign capability to act as thedesign authorityfor the new SSN; as was done for the Swedish-designed Collins class. Dependencies such as ongoing supply of the reactors, refuelling and design support should an integral part of the plan.The incoming federal government, of whichever persuasion, needs to commit to urgent implementation of plan B, with an aim of beginning the build by 2028. Time is tight. This is not a case of “she’ll be right” – continuing to invest more time and resources in the flawed Aukus-SSN program, which is subject to US goodwill and vulnerable to US and UK’s over-stretched defence budgets, is not an option if we are to develop a sovereign submarine capability.In an increasingly uncertain world, we do not want to be left without submarines to protect an island nation.Peter Briggs is a retired Royal Australian Navy rear admiralExplore more on these topicsAukusOpinionAustralian militaryAustralian foreign policyNuclear powercommentShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration has sacked more than a thousand staff from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the country’s leading agency for weather forecasting and climate science, potentially damaging its ability to do lifesaving work forecasting hurricanes and other extreme weather events. The New York Times reported plans are under wayto fire another 1,000. If true, that will take the cuts to about 20% of the workforce.On Monday, it was announced Nasa wasaxing its chief scientist, Katherine Calvin, who had been appointed to lead the agency’s work on climate change. In trademark Donald Trump/Elon Musk style, there appearslittle care or sense in where cuts have been made. It’s destruction for destruction’s sake, with tens of thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers underpinning the understanding of climate science dismissed as a “hoax” or, somehow, “woke”. As in most areas, what happens in the US on forecasting and science capability will have an impact beyond its borders.In Australia, the past week has seen a fresh wave of climate denial as ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred approached and hit the southern Queensland coast. News Corp outlets, in particular, have run straw man arguments attacking people that have forcefully linked the storm to the climate crisis.The fact that humans can only survive on Earth doesn’t bother Trump – and I know why | George MonbiotRead moreSome commentators have pointed out that southern Queensland has had cyclones before. Others have suggested there is uncertainty in the data about the pace and way in which they are changing, and that climate change didn’t “cause” Alfred. Well, yes. That’s all correct, of course, but hardly the point.What they mostly haven’t said is that the ocean and atmosphere are demonstrably warmer than even just a few years ago. Or that this means the most intense storms formed in warmer conditions carry more energy and more water. Or that the conditions under which tropical cyclones can form are moving south as the planet heats up.Tropical cyclones can take shape when the sea is 26.5C. Temperatures at that level are not enough for a cyclone to form – a range of climatic conditions have to occur – but they are being reached and sustained more often in places further away from the equator.As the cliche goes, the dice are increasingly loaded towards an extreme event being worse than in the past. We have loaded the dice by burning fossil fuels in greater and greater quantities. They have been the primary driver of a more than 50% increase in the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times.The evidence is that this is making tropical cyclones less frequent but more intense. There is data suggesting they also tend to last longer. Greater intensity plus time equals heightened risk of damage and casualties. It doesn’t mean that every cyclone or extreme storm will be more damaging than in the past. It does mean that when one comes, the potential for it to carry enough energy to wreak significant havoc is rising, not falling.Debate over the climate crisis can seem stuck in an eternal bad faith rutThe extra energy in a cyclone has a number. Nearly 200 years ago, physicists found that if air warms by 1C it can hold about 7% more water vapour and dump more rain. It has proven remarkably correct.What they didn’t know is that it was only part of the story – that in the case of some particularly strong storms in a warmer climate there are further multiplying factors in the atmosphere that can increase their power and lead to a 30-40% increase in localised rainfall intensity. Yes, due to climate change.Pointing this out isn’t a “political lecture”, as the Liberal National party senator Matt Canavan suggested last week. Nor is a form of hysteria or an expression of religious belief, as an overexcited Sky News commentator claimed. It is highlighting facts that are relevant to how we might prepare for what lies ahead.This might all feel like a statement of the painfully obvious, given the years of scientific inquiry and reporting. For those who feel that way: I hear you. Debate over the climate crisis can seem stuck in an eternal bad faith rut, even as attempts across the community to address it speed up.But let’s consider some more facts. If you’re after a clear picture on the physical science you could do worse than listen to Prof Mark Howden, the director of the Australian National University’s Institute for Climate, Energy & Disaster Solutions and a vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Ina state of the climate address last month– his final in the role before stepping down later this year – he set out an extraordinary list of evidence.Some of it is reasonably well known. Best we can tell, global CO2emissions still increased last year – by 0.8%. If we want to put an optimistic spin on it we might describe this as basically flatlining. But they’re not coming down yet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Particularly: there had been a “massive step-change up” in warming since June 2023, when temperatures vaulted well beyond what was already a historically high level. Scientists don’t exactly know why this happened. Howden described the past 18 months as “mind-boggling” and “like more than a decade of temperature increase in two years”.Scientists do know thepast decade has been the hottest 10 years on record. They do know that, averaged across the globe, every day in 2024 was at least 1.25C hotter than pre-industrial levels, and three quarters were 1.5C hotter. And they do know feedback loops are making things worse. Howden gave two examples: melting of Arctic ice and tundra and massive wildfires. Both release large amounts of CO2into the atmosphere, worsening the climate crisis, which in turn make large-scale melting and burning more likely. And so on.Howden made a couple of overarching points. One was a barely veiled message for the political class, and perhaps those charged with holding them to account. He said that Australia had the resources and means to become a global leader in zero-emissions solutions if it had the will, but stressed: “We have to put to bed this idea that we’re tracking OK and having some aspirational target of net zero by 2050 will somehow make us avoid 1.5C [of heating above pre-industrial levels].”The second wasn’t directed at the columnists and coal bosses who would use Alfred as the latest front in an ideological war, but could have been.“If this isn’t certain enough,” Howden asked, “how much certainty do you need? What’s the evidence base that tips you over into taking this seriously?”Good question.Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editorExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisClear airClimate science scepticism and denialTropical Cyclone AlfredExtreme weathercommentShareReuse this content"

A petition was unsuccessfully filed to his country’s supreme court to stay his extradition, aslawyers challenged the ICC’s jurisdiction, and pleas were made for any trial to take place in a Philippine court.The relatives of those butchered during Mr Duterte’s brutal and lawless “war on drugs” will struggle to sympathise. Notoriously, many of its victims never got near a courtroom of any description. In 2016, months into a presidency in which thousands of Filipinos suffered summary executions, Mr Duterte readily acknowledged an indiscriminate dimension to the lawless carnage he had unleashed. The deaths of innocents and children,he told reporters, amounted to inevitable “collateral damage” in his mission to clean up the streets.Given a green light from the top,vigilante gangsand hired hitmen turned the poorer parts of Manila and his home city of Davao into killing zones. Corrupt police were allegedly financiallyincentivised to shoot suspectsrather than arrest them. Only a handful of officers were ever convicted of a crime. Testifying to the Philippine senate last October, the former presidentoffered “no apologies, no excuses”for this reign of terror, during which foreign criticism was dismissed with swaggering contempt and internal opponentsthreatened and imprisoned.The ICC was expressly established as a tribunal of last resort to deal with such catastrophic abuses of power, especially in cases where leaders appeared to enjoy domestic impunity. Enforcing its writ has been a slow, seldom straightforward and frequently unsuccessful process. Thearrest of Mr Duterteat Manila airport, on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity between 2016 and 2019, is therefore a moment of signal importance.For thousands of Filipino families, Mr Duterte’sextraditionto the Netherlands at last offers the possibility of accountability and a reckoning. The vast majority of the victims of the “war on drugs” were poor, urban males whose relatives lacked the resources to fight for justice on their behalf. Until recently, a political understanding with the current president, Ferdinand R Marcos Jr – and the election of Mr Duterte’s daughter, Sara, as vice‑president – appeared to have ensured his immunity from prosecution. It took a falling out between the country’s two most powerful clans to give the ICC judges their opportunity, and bereaved relatives their chance of closure.Mr Duterte’s savage brand of authoritarianism was popular among a majority of voters, and the evidence and testimony to be heard at The Hague may make for uncomfortable hearing. Still an influential political figure, until Tuesday the former president planned to run once again to become mayor in Davao.Instead he finds himself the central figure in proceedings which are a vindication of the patient, dogged persistence of ICC investigators. At a time when the notion of a rules-based world order is being treated withroutine disdainin Washington as well as Moscow, Mr Duterte’s arrest on Philippine soil sends a salutary warning to would-be strongmen around the world: investigations launched in The Hague carry a greater threat than mere reputational damage to rogue leaders.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But, given the club’s £1bn debts, the idea seems as flimsy as its own tensile membraneOliver WainwrightTue 11 Mar 2025 13.57 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 14.00 EDTShare‘What Manchester does today,” Benjamin Disraeli once proclaimed, “the world does tomorrow.” So begins thebreathless promotional videofor Manchester United’s proposed £2bn football stadium, summoning the words of the Victorian prime minister to launch Norman Foster’s vision for a “mixed-use mini city” beneath a gigantic, three-spired tent.Manchester United to build new 100,000-capacity stadium next to Old TraffordRead moreThe only thing is, the world has seen quite a lot of big tops before. There is something decidedly retro about the plans, which depict a vast tensile canopy stretched over the 100,000-capacity stadium and its surrounds, covering what Lord Foster says will be “arguably the largest public space in the world”. Putting something bigger than Tiananmen Square under a tent doesn’t sound like a particularly appealing prospect, but then the Man Utd mantra appears to be bigger is better.Stretched between three tall masts – which recall etiolated cousins of theSkylon, erected on the South Bank for the 1951 Festival of Britain – the project looks like a vision of the future from another era. It could be something dreamed up back when Foster was a lad in Levenshulme, growing up in poverty while his father laboured at the Metropolitan-Vickers works in Trafford Park, near where his new stadium will rise. The architect lord may now fly helicopters and enjoy homes in Cap Ferrat and Martha’s Vineyard, but for the purposes of this project at least, his northern working-class roots remain strong.View image in fullscreen‘A pleasure dome worthy of Kubla Khan’ … Foster’s Khan Shatyr shopping centre in Astana, Kazakhstan.Photograph: Andrey Orekhov/Getty Images/iStockphotoFoster’s festive visuals may conjure thoughts of Zippos travelling circus, but the big tent has an illustrious architectural history. The Russian engineer Vladimir Shukhov was the first to experiment with tensile membrane structures at scale, creating thrilling enclosures for theNizhny Novgorod Fair of 1896. His work inspired the German engineer Frei Otto to createthe world’s first tent-covered stadium for the 1972 Munich Olympics, which remains a stunning, gossamer thing to encounter. Its delicate roof hangs like a series of taut spider’s webs, dancing over the stands and concourse, suspended from tilting masts. It spawned a wave of similar experiments with tensile structures in the following decades, culminating in the big top to end all big tops, the Millennium Dome, designed by Foster’s former partner, Richard Rogers.Not to be outdone, Foster has already gone one better. The architectural lineage of his Old Trafford fantasy is not Frei Otto’s stadium, nor Rogers’ dome, but his own humungous shopping mall for Kazakhstan’s former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Unveiled in 2006, the Khan Shatyr stands at the end ofthe monumental urban axis in Astana, its cable-net roof rising at a jaunty angle to 150 metres, glowing pink and green by night, just as his Old Trafford big top will throb red. It is a pleasure dome worthy of Kubla Khan, housing dodgems, a rollercoaster and an artificial beach, beneath the biggest tent in the world. For now.If all goes to plan, Manchester could one day own that pleasure dome crown. The images depict an entire world swept beneath Foster’s three-pronged canopy – the trio of masts a reference to the club’s devil’s trident logo. They show vast acreages of concourse populated by crowds frolicking beneath the glossy red haloes of the stands, stacked in shimmering ringsrecalling Foster’s Apple HQ, while holograms of footballers float around them. Punters sit on grassy steps beside a water feature while a night-time scene shows people dancing on a stage with coloured lights suspended from the great tent, giving it the look of a disco at Center Parcs.But, just likeChelsea’s grand plans for a brick cathedral of football by Herzog & de Meuron, which was scrapped in 2022, could it end up being a PR mirage, as flimsy as Foster’s tensile membrane? Manchester United is currently £1bn in debt, and the club has yet to say how it plans to pay for the project.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureManchesterManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his song Europapa eclipsed the winner’s – and he’s about to tour the world in his gigantic shoulder padsTue 11 Mar 2025 12.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 12.50 EDTShareJoost Klein is arguably the first artist to triumph at theEurovisionsong contest without actually performing in the final. In May last year, the 27-year-old Dutch wild child “gabber pop” rapper was disqualified from the world’s largest live music event just hours before he was due to perform Europapa to 170 million TV viewers around the globe.This song – a chaotic but catchy ode to the father he lost as a teenager, and to the free movement of people ethos his father instilled in him – was touted as a favourite. But instead of gearing up for his big moment, Klein spent seven hours that day sitting in his changing room in a reflex-blue, Ursula-von-der-Leyen-meets-Vivienne-Westwood suit with gigantic shoulder pads, fearing he was about to be arrested – on live TV – over a “backstage incident” after the semi-final the previous evening. Swedish host broadcaster SVTfiled a police complaintaccusing Klein of “threatening behaviour” by pushing a female camera operator’s equipment. Entertainment careers have been cancelled for less.When my father died, the first thing I did was make 20,000 videos for YouTube with silly dance movesYet now, in the spring of 2025, Klein is celebrating the release of his new album Unity with an 18-stop, 35,000-tickettourthat doesn’t just loop in Friesland and Wallonia but also includes sold-out shows in London and LA – a historic first for someone “yapping in Dutch”, as he puts it. Europapa is diamond-certified in the Netherlands and has racked up 170m streams on Spotify – almost twice as many as the song that officially won Eurovision, Swiss singer Nemo’s The Code.“People tell me, ‘Oh, this disqualification was actually really good for you, because your career got so big,’” Klein says in a mocking voice, in his first English-language interview since Eurovision came crashing down around him. “But if all I cared about was a career, I would actually make listenable music. I would make music that the masses want to hear. Yet I make what I want to hear. And sometimes that’s what the masses want after all, because zeitgeist works in that way.”“Unlistenable” is an overstatement, but it’s true that the paradox of Klein’s appeal is that much of his musical output sounds like utter trash at first listen. Gabber is the Dutch variant of hardcore dance music that grew out of Amsterdam and Rotterdam nightclubs in the early 1990s. It means “friend” in Amsterdam slang, but it was never the kind of friend your parents would have considered a good influence. On most of the songs on Unity, a relentless kickdrum beat is distorted and pitched at a breakneck speed of 140-190bpm (Klein says he started to listen to gabber on his one-hour cycle ride to school “because it makes you pedal faster”). The vocals are either sped up to sound like Mickey Mouse, or involve Klein spitting child-like rhyming couplets – “Evil corporations ruling all the nations” – sometimes in English or German but mostly in guttural, rasping Dutch. Unity features a collaboration with German eurodance titans Scooter that is about as aesthetically refined as a wet T-shirt competition in Magaluf.Yet Klein’s version of happy hardcore is infused with deep sadness: where you expect euphoria, there is melancholy. “I feel like a trampoline, I feel powerless and seething,” Klein mumbled on his first hit single, 2022’s Wachtmuziek. “I feel so, so alone, but I’ve felt that way since I was a child,” he raps on Unity’s Discozwemmen, an unlikely collaboration with 64-year-old Dutch lo-fi rocker Spinvis.Growing up in the village of Britsum in the Frisian flatlands, Klein started making YouTube videos inspired byBo Burnhamand “Weird Al” Yankovic when he was nine, though his father disapproved and made him delete them. When his father died of cancer when he was 12, “the first thing I did was make 20,000 videos for YouTube with silly dance moves,” Klein recalls. “The internet was the only way out.”View image in fullscreenCharged atmosphere … a pro-Palestinian demonstrator holds a ‘12 Points to Joost Klein’ sign in Malmö.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesHis mother passed away after a cardiac arrest a year later and he was raised by his older siblings, whose dates of birth he has tattooed on his knuckles. “If you lose your parents at a young age there’s not a lot that you remember,” he says. “And the things you do remember become bigger and more powerful in your heart or brain.”Which is where Eurovision comes in. One of Klein’s formative childhood memories was of lying on the couch with his parents and watching Finnish heavy metal band Lordi win Eurovision in 2006. “I saw the impact Eurovision had on me on that couch. And I thought, for some reason, ‘That’s maybe how I can use my life.’” Friends warned him about the complicated politics of the event. “But I was just blind with a melancholy and love for the old Eurovision.”The reality of taking part in Eurovision was sobering. Some of the international broadcasters’ delegations that accompany the artists backstage were acting in a bullying manner, he alleges, with one journalist whipping out his smartphone to film him at the urinals.“There was no privacy,” he says. “It was not a safe environment.” Ireland’s entry, Bambie Thug,accused Israeli broadcaster Kan of intimidating behaviour. So which delegation filmed Klein at the gents? All he will says is: “I think everybody knows.” The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) later said it regretted that some delegations “didn’t respect the spirit of the rules”. It has announced new codes of conduct for this year’s contest in the Swiss city of Basel, including no-filming zones.I think stubbornness is necessary in art. You gotta feel your fuel – or there’s no purpose to it allEuropapa ends with an outro in which Klein directly addresses his late father. So he says he was in an emotionally vulnerable state as he exited the stage after the semi-final. “For me, that’s not really a nice moment to, I don’t know, film somebody.” Sweden’s public prosecution service initially said Klein made a movement that hit a female camera operator’s equipment, though it closed its investigation last August afterconcluding that there was no proofthe singer had intended to cause “serious fear”.What exactly happened? Was there a shove? Klein denies he ever touched the camerawoman, or that he damaged her equipment. “If that was the case,” he says, “then there would be a case to be dismissed in the first place.” Klein says he has the footage of the incident filmed by the operator on his phone and might upload it to his YouTube channel one day, insisting it will show “exactly nothing happened”.If nothing happened, why was he suspended? He says the EBU has still not explained it to him. Did the geopolitical backdrop of the war in Gaza play a part? In Malmö, there had been protests calling for Israel to be excluded from the event, and at the semi-final press conference, there was a tense moment when a Polish journalist asked the Israeli contestant Eden Golan if her presence at the contest was endangering other acts. The host intervened to say she did not have to answer the question if she did not want to. But Klein, sitting next to Golan with a Dutch flag over his head, piped up: “Why not?”Unlike some of the other contestants, Klein says he had not felt an urge to make a statement about the Gaza war. “I signed up for an apolitical event.” I suggest that the press conference incident still made him come across as a bit of a bully. “I just said that as the most Dutch person that I am,” he says. “So someone gets a cookie. Someone else gets a cookie. Someone else – not. Why not? Equality is very important, especially in a competition.” There’s a Dutch word for that kind of attitude: astijfkopor “stiffhead”. Is Klein stubborn? “I think stubbornness is necessary in art,” he says. “You gotta feel your fuel, or else there’s no purpose to it all.”As he describes his experience of Malmö, I am struck by a double bind: Klein is still visibly hurt by what happened, his specs fogging up as he describes his anxiety in the dressing room. But he’s also allowing himself to be dragged back, and I am not sure how much he wants to move on.Indeed, the gabber-fuelled pop-punk opening track of his album is called Why Not, revisiting that press conference. And earlier this month he released a single called United by Music, which was Eurovision’s 2024 motto. In it, he and Estonian singer Tommy Cash chant: “Fuck the EBU, I don’t wanna go to court.” He’s still smarting from having his privacy invaded, but he also expresses concern that someone is trying to wipe footage filmed off-stage from the internet.That double bind might be the most zeitgeist-y thing about Klein, and what makes his music resonate so much with Gen-Z’s digital natives: memories can never drift off into the distance but always remain a click away in some online archive. Raw and unrefined, gabber-pop may be the Netherland’s own version of punk, but for Klein, No Future is not a cry of protest but an admission that the past is all-consuming.He seems happy to admit it. “For me,” he says, “reminiscing is almost a 24/7 thing, and that’s not always good. I try to be more in the moment, and I think it’s getting better.” He pauses, and adds: “At least I hope so.”Joost Klein plays Electric Brixton, London, on 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsPop and rockEurovisionDance musicElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why are so many men going full frontal?Michael HoganTue 11 Mar 2025 09.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 17.42 EDTShareLucius Malfoy just showed us his wand. In the fourth and latest episode ofThe White Lotus, viewers saw more of actor Jason Isaacs than they expected. Several inches more. We screamed in unison with his character’s grossed-out children. You didn’t get that at Hogwarts.As wealthy patriarch Timothy Ratliff, he has been steadily coming off the rails at the five-star Thai resort. The dodgy dealings upon which he built his high-finance empire have been uncovered by journalists in the US. The feds are closing in. Assets have been seized. He is desperately trying to cover his tracks to avoid jail time, while hiding the scandal from his dysfunctional family, who were forced into a digital detox upon arrival at the spa. Safe to say they will have a fair few notifications when they switch their phones back on.As Tim spirals, he has turned to pill-popping by stealing his neurotic wife Victoria’s prescription lorazepam, washed down with copious whisky and wine. This wasn’t in the wellness brochure. “You’re not yourself,” Parker Posey keeps telling him in that mangled Mississippi accent.A phallic manifestation of his meltdown came as we reached the season’s midway mark. Shambling around half-stoned in a complimentary White Lotus bathrobe, Ratliff Sr inadvertently flashed his junk at his offspring. Cue hands over eyes, faces buried in cushions and grossed-out cries of “Dad!” from Saxon, Piper and Lochlan (the diet Succession).View image in fullscreen‘Dad!’ … Jason Isaacs’s character of Timothy Ratliff accidentally reveals himself to his kids in The White Lotus season three.Photograph: HBOAs well as Tim’s tackle, the latest series showed his sleazebag son Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) heading to the bathroom, butt-naked, to watch porn. It was squirmingly uncomfortable viewing – not least when he made meaningful eye contact with little brother Lochlan (Sam Nivola) before closing the door.Creator Mike White’s sun-soaked satire has made such moments a trademark. All three seasons have deployed flashes of male nudity for comic effect. Such shock tactics might seem puerile but in the White Lotus universe, it works. Showing the insufferable super-rich in states of undress is a metaphor for their vulnerability.It strips them of their generational privilege and aura of blithe superiority, reminding us that they are as flawed as the rest of us, if not more so. At any minute, the edifice could come crashing down. With an X-rated flourish, White shows the audience exactly who his characters are.The full-frontal assault started from the acclaimed anthology’s first ever episode. During the debut season, hypochondriac trophy husband Mark Mossbacher, played by Steve Zahn, arrived in Hawaii worried that he had testicular cancer and was doomed to die young like his closeted father. (“He could’ve still been butch, Dad,” his college student daughter, Olivia, reassured him. “Maybe grandpa was a power bottom.”) Unsuspecting viewers duly got an eyeful when Mark showed his swollen parts to his tech tycoon wife, Nicole (Connie Britton). Zahn later admitted that he got to choose his own prosthetic. Perks of the job.View image in fullscreenAn eyeful … Steve Zahn’s prosthetics shocked viewers shortly after this scene in White Lotus season one.Photograph: AmazonThe bare-all baton was promptly picked up by doomed resort manager Armond (the magnificent Murray Bartlett) who, after five years sober, fell off the wagon in spectacular style. Honeymooner Shane (Jake Lacy) walked in on Armond performing a sex act on waiter Dillon (Lukas Gage) during a drug-fuelled romp in his office. Analingus – “getting my salad tossed”, as Dillon put it – is an act rarely seen on television, so all the more taboo-busting. When Shane got him fired, Armond infamously wreaked revenge by squatting and taking a dump in the obnoxious guest’s open suitcase.The second outing, set in Sicily, didn’t stint on male flesh-flashing either. As cocky finance bro Cameron, actor Theo James wore a 9in prosthetic (which the actor joked was “ginormous”, “like a hammer” and “stolen off a donkey in a field”) for a sequence where his best college buddy’s wife, Harper (Aubrey Plaza), glimpses him changing into swimming shorts. Harper, who made a habit of rude interruptions, later walks in on her husband, Ethan (Will Sharpe), pleasuring himself in their suite.View image in fullscreen‘Ginormous’ … Theo James wears his prosthetic penis for a scene with Aubrey Plaza in The White Lotus season two.Photograph: AmazonMeanwhile, Essex boy Jack (Leo Woodall) was seen having graphic sex with his faux-uncle Quentin (Tom Hollander) – a scene Woodall admits left him “speechless” when he first read the script.Mike White, the showrunner, is openly bisexual and has said: “There’s a pleasure to me, as a guy who is gay-ish, in making gay sex transgressive again.”HBO dramas were once notorious for “sexposition” – the shameless technique of advancing the narrative against a backdrop of bare bodies. The Sopranos would set plot-progressing conversations at the Bada Bing! strip club, so boring old dialogue could be enlivened by pole-dancers. Similarly, Game of Thrones often spiced up its power-plays with Westeros sex workers as living scenery.Times have changed. Gratuitous female nudity is no longer the default setting. The GoT prequelHouse of the Dragonis more partial to, ahem, unsheathed swords. HBO stablemates such as Industry, Euphoria, And Just Like That and Scenes from a Marriage have also featured jaw-dropping phallic displays. Now comes The White Lotus and its priapic habit.Since the hit show’s inception, White has interrogated the nature of modern masculinity and the dark side of sexuality. His subversive sensibility ensures his creation is consistently provocative. The Daily Mail recently clutched its pearls with a story un-snappily headlined: “The White Lotus doubles down on full-frontal male nudity in every single series – with solo sex acts, incestuous romps and prosthetic penises sending shockwaves through fans.” White wouldn’t have it any other way.It’s a welcome rebalancing of the books after decades of the male gaze. TV has swapped sexposition for dicksposition, with The White Lotus leading the charge. Well, at least until next week’s Full Moon Party episode, when all bets are off and it’s an equal opportunities flesh-fest. Welcome to the White Lotus.

As they go on tour, the band look back on half a century of being a voice for the voicelessTue 11 Mar 2025 10.50 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 11.15 EDTShareIn the late 1970s, whenever young Birmingham reggae band Steel Pulse performed their songKu Klux Klan, the group’s vocalists would theatrically wear white KKK hoods onstage to illustrate the song’s lyrics, which excoriated the Klan’s violence, racism and cowardice. British audiences loved it and understood the power of a black band making such a striking visual statement, but in America it was different.“American audiences were sort of dumbstruck and flabbergasted,” says lead singer David Hinds, now 68, remembering their first US visit, in 1981. “They told us they didn’t even know there were black people in England, let alone would do a song like Ku Klux Klan. In Boston a white guy jumped out of the audience and started a struggle onstage. In the end the police came and dragged him off. Our elderly African American T-shirt seller said he was scared for us every time we went onstage. He’d say ‘You don’t know America. This place is something else.’”When the tour reached Birmingham, Alabama, where a black man had recently been lynched in nearby Mobile, they wore the hoods in front of a visibly segregated audience. “We could see the divide from the stage,” Hinds remembers. Founding guitarist Basil Gabbidon, 69, is no longer with the band but still marvels at what he now puts down to youthful bravery and naivety. “Looking back, we could have been shot or anything,” he says, “but I suppose if I saw a band doing something like that, I’d think, ‘These guys are serious.’”View image in fullscreenSerious guys … (l-r) David Hinds, Steve Nisbett, Mykaell Riley, Selwyn Brown, Alphonso Martin, Basil Gabbidon.Photograph: Echoes/RedfernsThe song – and the hoods – certainly made an impression on Bob Marley, when they toured together. “The expression on his face was simply ‘What the …. ?’!” Hinds chuckles. “He’d never seen anything like it. Nobody had, but after a while we didn’t need to wear them any more because the song had done its job.”Today, ahead of their 50th anniversary celebration tour, Steel Pulse can look back on many such milestones. They were the first British reggae band to score a Top 10 album, with their debutHandsworth Revolutionin 1978, and one of the first on Top of the Pops. “The first non-Jamaican act to win a best reggae album Grammy [for 1985’sBabylon the Bandit],” says Hinds. “The first – maybe only – reggae act to perform at a Presidential inauguration” – for Bill Clinton, in 1993. “There are a lot of firsts with Steel Pulse, but sometimes I feel we’re overlooked.”Still, none of it could have seemed remotely possible when they started rehearsing in various parents’ houses with, as Gabbidon remembers: “My brother Colin playing the sofa with sticks, like a drum kit.”A group of former Handsworth Wood Boys schoolfriends, they started the band in 1975 as teenagers wanting to play a British take on reggae. “We lived in an industrial area, so the music had a kind of metallic edge,” the guitarist explains. “Plus, we listened to everything from jazz-funk to Elton John. We didn’t want to sound Jamaican.” With Ronnie “Stepper” McQueen on bass, the songs reflected the British Black experience, not the Caribbean one informing most reggae at the time.View image in fullscreenDavid Hinds in 2010.Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Drăgoi/The Guardian“We sang about our lives,” explains keyboard player Selwyn Brown, 66. “Institutionalised racism in the police and education, civil rights, injustice – and the treatment of our parents, the Windrush generation, who’d been invited to the UK to rebuild the country after the second world war. We wanted to be a voice for people who didn’t have a voice.”Initially, gigs were hard to come by. Black clubs felt they were too militant or rebellious. “Or they’d say we were ‘too interesting’, musically,” chuckles Gabbidon. “They’d ask, ‘Can’t you just play someDennis Brown?’” Things changed after the band’s management had the radical but inspired idea of putting them in punk clubs. “We were like: what?!” Brown chuckles. “In those days punks would spit and throw things if they liked an artist … so we thought, what happens if they don’t like you? But we took the chance.”Thus, in the punk summer of 1977, the young Brummie reggae band nervously found themselves sandwiched between the Lurkers and Generation X at the Vortex club on London’s Wardour Street. “I was dreading going on,” Brown admits. “But before we played a note we introduced ourselves as a reggae band, not punk, and said, ‘You’re welcome to pogo or whatever but can you please not spit at us?’ To our surprise, nobody did. Instead, they listened. We stayed and watched all the other bands and the following week we were all over the music press.”View image in fullscreen‘We stuck to our guns’ …. David Hinds and Selwyn Brown.Photograph: Patrick NiddrieThis was the beginning of a deep kinship and tours with the likes of the Adverts and the Stranglers. “The punks empathised with us because they went through similar experiences,” says Brown. “Thesus laws[‘suspected person’ stop and search] and such. We were all rebelling against the system.” As Hinds puts it: “We became part of the punk family.”After they signed to Bob Marley and the Wailers’ label, Island, Ku Klux Klan became Steel Pulse’s first single for the label. At school Hinds had achieved a poor grade in English, but discovering the poetry of William Blake and Alfred Tennyson inspired him to write lyrics. He penned the words to his band’s most controversial song in response to reading that Klan grand wizard David Duke was about to visit the UK to advise the National Front, but also drawing on his own experiences of being chased by older white men. “I used to kick a stone all the way to school in Handsworth,” he says. “So I wrote: ‘Walking around kicking stones, just minding my own business / I go face to face with my foe, disguised in violence from head to toe.’”Released in April 1978, the single coincided with a huge march from Trafalgar Square to Victoria Park, where Steel Pulse, the Clash and others performed forRock Against Racism. “The organisers expected 20,000 people, but over 80,000 turned up,” remembers Brown. “It was overwhelming.” The Labour politician Peter Hain – an RAR organiser then – has since said that the scale of that show was “decisive in running the NF out of town and helping to create a climate in which being racist was not acceptable”.Ku Klux Klan was denied airplay and reached No 41, but the band’s momentum was unstoppable. The Handsworth Revolution album landed in the Top 10 and Marley asked them to support the Wailers in the UK and in Europe. “That was the first time I saw a crowd hold lighters in the air,” remembers Gabbidon. “Bob’s audience was so eclectic. Black, white, brown. I’m sure I saw some Martians there as well.”Hinds, who fondly remembers playing football with Marley, still bitterly regrets turning down an offer to visit the singer in hospital in New York in 1981, when he had cancer. “I knew he’d lost his hair with the chemotherapy so I didn’t want to see this great man like that,” he sighs. “We spoke on the phone instead but there was no suggestion in his voice that he was ill. He talked about having us on his label and had all these plans. I didn’t know he’d been told he had a month to live. I said, ‘You know what? All I want you to do is get well soon so we can chant down Babylon together.’ That was the last time we spoke.”It hasn’t been plain sailing for Steel Pulse. Hinds talks of being dropped by labels, business rip-offs and at one point having to record in “what was virtually a shack”. Today, only the singer and Brown remain from the Handsworth Revolution era, but they’ve navigated the ship through decades of personal, musical and political upheaval and still record and tour around the world.“I think that’s been a combination of trying to stay current, creating an affinity with our fans and also a bit of luck and timing as well,” considers Brown. At times they’ve also had to hold their nerve, just as they did on that first trip to America. “When we told Island we wanted to call the first album Handsworth Revolution, [label boss] Chris Blackwell said ‘Nobody knows where Handsworth is. Can’t you call it Birmingham Revolution or something?’” remembers Gabbidon. “But we stuck to our guns. I like to think we put Handsworth on the map.”Steel Pulse’s 50th Anniversary Celebration tour is at the Roundhouse in London tonight, then touringExplore more on these topicsReggaePunkBlack British culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Actors, and the ‘wellbeing facilitators’ tasked with keeping them safe, reveal the trick to acting under the influenceHannah J DaviesTue 11 Mar 2025 07.30 EDTShare“Iam not a big drinker, I don’t do drugs, I don’t smoke,” says Sagar Radia, best known as the ruthless, potty-mouthed trader Rishi Ramdani in the HBO/BBC banking sagaIndustry. “But when friends and family watch, they’re like: ‘You look like you do know what you’re doing.’”Nowhere was this more the case than in season three’s White Mischief, an episode focused entirely on the character’s grim descent into gambling addiction, inflamed by booze and cocaine. Previously described by a colleague as “the ghost of Margaret Thatcher in a handsome Asian kid”, here Rishi starts to look more like a disgraced Tory MP in the 90s, as he binges on shots and coke in a seedy casino. At first he’s euphoric – dancing like a drunk uncle at a wedding – but soon his behaviour becomes erratic, his movements shaky and impaired, his legs unsteady. Despite rising debts, he gambles away all he has, and even seems to consider pawning his wedding ring for a few, long seconds. The next morning, we see him stagger into work on a comedown – bloody cuts and bruises all over his face.Be it on film or TV, it does feel as though we are seeing more of these emotional – and occasionally absurd – rock-bottom moments, with increasingly hardcore amounts of drink and drugs swilling around in characters’ systems. Industry and the Zendaya-led dramaEuphoriaare oft-cited examples. But who could forgetMurray Bartlett’s out-of-control hotel manager Armond in thefirst seasonof The White Lotus, a recovering addict who falls off the wagon so severely that he decides to defecate in a bratty guest’s suitcase?Season twowas equally marked by the presence of powder and pills, not least when Jennifer Coolidge’s already dopey Tanya is plied with party drugs at a Sicilian villa (after that series aired, one fan wrote on Twitter/X that judging the Emmys would be “tough this year as cocaine, viagra, and molly battle it out for best supporting actor”). Cinema isn’t immune, either. A new “proper naughty” hooliganism comedy, Marching Powder, sees Danny Dyerreunite withThe Football Factory director Nick Love for what the actor has described as a film with “more violence [and] more drugs” than its predecessor, released back in 2004.View image in fullscreenTired and emotional … Sagar Radia in Industry.Photograph: Nick Strasburg/BBCOf course, we know that actors aren’t likely to be necking tequilas or snorting the devil’s dandruff on screen; on Industry, the actors sniff milk powder rather than cocaine, and once the director shouts “Cut!” someone brings over a tissue and the actors blow out as much as they can. But how do they manage to make it look so real? Ironically, a great amount of focus is required for this kind of acting. For Radia, somewhat counterintuitively, that meant concentrating hard on appearing sober. On set,Konrad Kay, one of Industry’s showrunners, advised him to steady his legs, so as not to overcompensate. “It’s that classic thing of drunk people nottryingto play drunk,” Radia says. “Drunk people are trying to be sober!”His attention was also on the personal and professional pressurebubbling under the surface that might lead someone like Rishi to misuse drugs and alcohol in the first place. “I think if you’re trying to [act these scenes] without a sense of ‘Where is this coming from?’ and ‘Why is he sabotaging himself like this?’, then you’re just a guy playing drunk, and it makes no sense,” he says. “I didn’t think too much about the substances. I was thinking more about the pressures – whether it was his wife, his kid, his debt, or how much money he was losing at work. You bring all of that into his walk, his thousand-yard stare, his longing when he’s lost the money …”It would be naive to think that great acting underpinned all depictions of drink and drug use on screen. Method acting has definitely played its part: James Gandolfini and Michael Imperioli were once so sozzled on the set ofThe Sopranosthat they chained themselves to a tree so they wouldn’t fall off a cliff. ForWithnail and I– a comedy as alcoholic as it is melancholic – Richard E Grant was encouraged by director Bruce Robinson to drink, in order to have a “chemical memory” of inebriation. Despite an intolerance to the stuff, Grant has said that Robinson sent him home during rehearsals for the film with a bottle of champagne, and told him to “work your way through that, even if you vomit in between – which I did all night long.” Meanwhile, Billy Bob Thornton’s liquor-fuelled mall meltdown in Bad Santa was powered by an actual binge (he would later tell Entertainment Weekly: “I drank about three glasses of red wine for breakfast … then I switched over to vodka and cranberry juice, and then I had a few Bud Lights”). There are also the more troubling tales of actors turning up drunk for unrelated reasons, such as Oliver Reed who – says Ridley Scott – “probably had a couple of pints [during the filming of Gladiator] … said, ‘I don’t feel good’, laid on the carpet and died.”View image in fullscreenAll smilies … Murray Bartlett (right) as The White Lotus’s Armond.Photograph: HBOThese days, unsurprisingly, drinking on set is less acceptable, though not totally unheard of – especially when a performer is struggling with an alcohol problem off screen. “There have been times when an actor has substituted their non-alcoholic drink with an alcoholic one,” says Matt Longley, who also cites what he describes as a “one-off” example of an actor who managed to get their hands on some booze at a filming location (it was, after all, a shoot at a pub).Longley is one of the founders of6ft from the Spotlight, a non-profit that aims to support cast and crew in the filming of difficult material, and whose “wellbeing facilitators” are to portrayals of drugs and alcohol – or any other potentially problematic subject matter – what an intimacy coordinator would be to a sex scene.The organisation has to date trained 40 people to go on to sets, completing risk assessments and offering support to cast and crew, “from the SAs [supporting artistes, AKA extras] to the Mark Ruffalos of the world”. Industry is one production that benefits from a wellbeing facilitator.“Our whole ethos is to be preventive, and to try to work out what the issues might be before we start, by going through the script,” says Longley. “We offer training beforehand as well, so that people can support each other through that process, and also support themselves.” On some productions, he says, directors want something to happen that the performers don’t know about, in order to capture an authentic reaction (think: a character who we suspect takes drugs, suddenly snorting a line in front of their colleagues). “Much like an intimacy coordinator, we would say, ‘No, I wouldn’t do that.’ They’re actors, they’re able toacta reaction!”View image in fullscreenDeep end … Zendaya in Euphoria.Photograph:  Landmark MediaIn the US, a similar role has also started to become more widespread. Mental health coordinators now work across all of the major networks, according to Amanda Edwards, a therapist and intimacy coordinator who has spearheaded the movement. Coordinators support actors and crew in a similar way to their UK counterparts, and also offer guidance around the acting process itself. “It’s about how to act the thing without traumatising yourself, or risking injury to yourself,” says Edwards. This can mean finding ways to adjust an actor’s breath and how they move the muscles in their face, or modifying their speech patterns, vocal intonation and posture. “There are so manytricks that we can use so that a performer doesn’t actually have to feel or even imagine that they are feeling the effects of a substance; they can just make their body do the things it would do if it was under the influence.”It is as important to think about how to get into character as it is to think about how to get out of it once production has wrapped, says Edwards. There are, she says, “documented cases of crew members who maybe have a sober journey behind them, but through participating in a project that involves substance use, have gone into a relapse or have struggled tremendously with their mental health”. In 2023, Euphoria’s Dominic Fike, who was struggling with addiction at the time,talked aboutthe impact filming the HBO series had on him: “I was a drug addict and coming on to a show that’s … mainly about drugs, is very difficult” (he was subsequently provided with a sober coach on set).If this all sounds rather heavy, then it’s a relief to know that acting drunk, high or both on screen can be a welcome challenge. In a2021 interview, Murray Bartlett told the Observer that playing Armond had been “a gift. There were moments of terror, but mostly it was pure joy.” As for Radia, he says he had a blast. “It was an amazing moment for a south Asian actor like myself to get an opportunity to carry an episode on one of the biggest networks in the world,” he says. “I know it can seem like it’s all deep and high stakes, but actually sometimes they’re the fun things to play.”Season three ofThe White Lotusis airing on Sky Atlantic & Now; Marching Powder is in cinemas7 March.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionAlcoholDrugsTelevision industryThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then broke down sobbing’Notorious for his drug-fuelled literary experiments and the fact that he shot his partner, beat writer Burroughs also made art inspired by the climate crisisStuart JeffriesTue 11 Mar 2025 06.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 11 Mar 2025 06.49 EDTShareOne day 51 years ago, out in the wilds of New Mexico,Kathelin Grayasked a question of her hero, the writer and artist William S Burroughs, whom she had just met. “William, I have read your books and I must know: what is your attitude to women?”The question had been eating away at Gray for the best part of a decade. As a teenage babysitter, she read Burroughs’ novelThe Naked Lunchand was blown away by it. “The very yuckiness of the imagery, the critique of predatory capitalism, the degrading sex and violence – all that spoke to me,” she says.A few years later she invited her hero to give a lecture at a ranch near Santa Fe where she and some like-minded souls had established the counterculturalInstitute for Ecotechnics, and he had accepted. But how could she square this inspirational writer with the man who killed his partner Joan Vollmer during a party at a friend’s Mexico City apartment in 1951?“Put that glass on your head, Joanie,” Burroughs is reported to have said at the time. “Let me show the boys what a great shot old Bill is.” Burroughs fired one shot from a Czech-made Star .380 pistol, missed the glass and killed her. The local papers wrote up the tragedy as a William Tell prank gone wrong. He was never prosecuted.View image in fullscreenWilliam S Burroughs Burn Unit, 1987.Photograph: Jonathan Greet/© Estate of William S BurroughsAnd yet, even today, at a time when the late writer and artist is coming to the attention of a new generation thanks to the film adaptation of his storyQueerstarring Daniel Craig, the suggestion that he was a lowlife heroin- and-booze addicted woman-hater who intended to shoot his common-law wife (the pair were not married) won’t go away. Arecent profile, for instance, described him as Joan Vollmer’s murderer. “It was an accident,” counters Gray. “Of course he didn’t intend to kill her.”How did Burroughs answer your question, I ask Gray? “He stood stock still, looked into my eyes and said ‘I killed the only woman I ever loved’. Then he broke down sobbing.” That evening, Burroughs entranced Gray and her compadres with a lecture given inside the Institute’sgeodesic domeon the theme oflingua-technis.Gray is recalling her meeting with Burroughs to me over coffee at theOctober Galleryin London, where she has curated an exhibition of rarely seen Burroughs artworks, made in the last decade of his life, from spray paint, acrylics – and gunshot. Until hisdeath in 1997, she and Burroughs were close friends and she has spent much of her life since curating his art. “There was nothing misogynistic about him at all,” he says. “As a straight woman” – Burroughs was gay – “I felt nothing but comfortable with him. He was a very sensitive soul, and that comes out in all his art, literary and visual.”View image in fullscreenBlast first: William S Burroughs and his 'shotgun' paintings in a gallery in London circa 1989.Photograph: Steve Speller/AlamyIndeed, in a catalogue essay, Gray wrote. “Burroughs could not bear the idea that anyone would suffer pain. He identified with patients of burn units, he identified with the endangered lemurs of Madagascar.” On the walls above us as we chat is his 1987 painting Burn Unit, a howl of red paint overlaid with crudely daubed human faces evidently in pain; above my head is his photomontage of lemurs in a flaming hellscape, expressing Burroughs’s outrage at how slash-and-burn agriculture was destroying the animals’ Malagasy habitat and driving them to extinction.Gray reminds me that in his 1991 novellaGhost of Chance, Burroughs meditated on whether our species could ever live in harmony with other life forms. For Gray, this compassionate late text poses a question that obsessed him: “What is a human destiny that would be life-enhancing, not destructive to other beings? Perhaps,” Gray reflects, “clues to that destiny will be found in dreams, in what’s called subconscious, in altered states.”What Gray loves about Burroughs’ art is how it always involves an element of chance, which she recognises as one of his manifold tactics for exploring the subconscious, entering transcendental realms or simply overcoming societal conditioning and egotistical control. That’s why, she explains, when his artist friendBrion Gysinshowed Burroughs his textual cut-up method in the late 1950s, he decided to adopt the practice in his writing – in turn inspiring David Bowie to randomise his lyrics.It’s why too that, far from eschewing guns after Vollmer’s death, Burroughs turned his studio into something akin to a rifle range, peppering paper, wood and canvases with bullets. Here at the October Gallery, several artworks betray his continued fascination with firepower. There is a free-standing plexiglass vitrine holding the bullet-ridden wreckage of a piece of painted wood. “The shotgun blast,” wrote one critic, “releases the little spirits compacted into the layers of wood, releases the colours of the paints to splash out in unforeseeable and unpredictable images and patterns.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marker and gunshots on sketchbook paper.Photograph: Jonathan Greet/© Estate of William S Burroughs. Courtesy October Gallery, LondonI tell Gray this reminds me of theauto-destructive artofGustav Metzgerwho in 1959 launched this art movement by throwinghydrochloric acid at a nylon sheet on London’s South Bank, thus creating voids in the surface akin to Burroughs’ bullet holes. Metzger and Burroughs were friends, Gray tells me, and no wonder: the former was a Holocaust survivor, CND activist and lifelong foe of human destructive power; the latter, Gray reckons, was deranged into artistic expression by the advent of the atomic age, whereby humans finally had the power finally destroy themselves and their planet, fulfilling the logic of what Burroughs once called “the death trap of the industrial revolution”.“In thrall to the world market,” wrote Gray in a catalogue essay, “humanity accelerates its rapacious behaviour using rationalisation … to justify the ravages of predatory capitalism. In his life and work, Burroughs deconstructed logic and rationalism to pursue other strategies of thought.”Fair enough, but the gun thing still troubles me. A 1992 work hanging nearby is called Brion’s Birthday and consists of a marker sketch of his friend, his midriff riddled with bullet holes. Nearby, Warhol: A Portrait in TV Dots from the same year looks like a perforated rifle range target that, by happenstance, depicts the eponymous artist nearly shot dead in 1968 by Valerie Solanas. “Europeans,” says Gray, “always have a trouble with Americans and their guns. William was a very ordinary American in that sense.”Why is she putting on this show of Burroughs right now? “Because he was on the money,” she replies. “As someone else said of him, he was a Nostradamus – certainly when it came to climate catastrophe, which he foresaw clearly. He imagined, too, that anyone could achieve inner and outer liberation from the ravages being inflicted on the world. That’s why his art matters to me – and why it’s worth seeing right now.”William S Burroughs is at theOctober Gallery, London, until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designWilliam BurroughsExhibitionsPaintingArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you’re paying enough attention, and you have your spirit tuned to the frequencies of the planet, then you’ll be able to sense that the old Avatar machinery is starting to crank up again. The third instalment of the series, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is set for release in December. And this means thatJames Cameronfinds himself saddled with a familiar task; in just nine months he has to try and motivate people to see a film from a franchise that they’ve already forgotten about twice before now.The bad news is that these are incredibly expensive films to make. So expensive, in fact, that Cameron previously stated that the second film needed to be the third highest grossing movie of all time just to break even. And, just to compound things, that film was such an incomprehensible mishmash of confused mythology, nondescript motivation and vague characterisation that this one needs to be something really special to get bums on seats.View image in fullscreenBoy, is it going to get wetter … Avatar 2 (2022.Photograph: Album/AlamyBut the better news is that James Cameron has been here before. He knows exactly how to get people excited forAvatarmovies now, and by God he’s going to pull out the big guns. So, how is Cameron going to make you want to watch Avatar: Fire and Ash? Simple, by promising you a sustained emotional breakdown.So far, one of the only people to have watched Fire and Ash in its entirety is Cameron’s wife Suzy Amis Cameron. According to an interview in Empire, Suzy watched the film just before Christmas. There is a chance she might not yet be over it.“My wife watched the whole thing from end to end. She had kept herself away from it and I wasn’t showing her bits and pieces as we went along. This was 22 December,” Cameron said. “She bawled for four hours. She kept trying to get her shit back together so she could tell me specific reactions, and then she’d just tear up and start crying again. Finally, I’m like, ‘Honey, I’ve got to go to bed. Sorry, we’ll talk about it some other time.’”Now, Fire and Ash is thought to be a long film – Cameron has already said it will be longer than Avatar 2, which had a three hours and 12 minutes runtime – but even so, a four-hour bawling fit seems excessive. This is a film that will make you cry so hard and for so long that even James Cameron will eventually get bored. That’s really saying something.View image in fullscreenAll smiles … James Cameron with Suzy Amis Cameron at the London world premiere of the first Avatar movie in 2009.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockLet’s do the maths here. If Suzy Amis Cameron’s reaction is any indication then, come December, you’re going to have to put aside seven-and-a-half hours aside to experience Avatar: Fire and Ash; three-and-a-half to watch it and then another four to lie on the floor weeping and wailing as you process what you just saw. That’s a big chunk of time. It means that realistically you can only watch a matinee performance, or else you risk losing a full night’s sleep to sobbing uncontrollably about the fate of some blue smurf thing whose name you will never be able to remember. Surely that will affect box office grosses.But let’s look at this as an opportunity. If Fire and Ash is really as emotionally pulverising as Cameron makes out, then the marketing possibilities are endless. Perhaps audiences could be handed a sachet of rehydration salts with their tickets, or maybe fleets of therapists could be waiting in the lobby to soothe the exploded nervous systems of everyone who sees it.Also, it’s worth pointing out that the third Avatar film isn’t even going to be the most hysterically brutal Avatar film of the series. No, that honour goes to the fourth instalment. In 2022, Cameron revealed that, while studio executives sent him three pages of notes after reading the script for Avatar 2, and just one for Avatar 3,the sum total of the response to the fourth film’s script was an email reading “Holy fuck”.Now, bear in mind that Avatar 3 managed to ruin Suzy Amis Cameron for four hours, with the implication being that the same will happen to you. What on earth is going to happen after the fourth film? Will you bawl for five hours? Six? Will your hair spontaneously burst into flames? Will your heart explode inside your ribcage and kill you instantly? Better start pre-booking your ambulances for December 2029.Explore more on these topicsFilmAvatarJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The core themes for the 38th iteration of the spring festival will be “the impacts of AI, health and wellbeing, new political orders and intergenerational exchanges,” according toHay festivalCEO Julie Finch.As well as Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leaderAlexei Navalny, there are a number of activists set to speak at the festival, including the US president’s niece, writer and psychologist Mary Trump and Gisele Pelicot’s daughter Caroline Darian.Chef and Guardian writer Yotam Ottolenghi, artist Grayson Perry and actor and podcaster Jameela Jamil are also due to appear, as are broadcasters Susie Dent,Stacey Dooleyand Lorraine Kelly.Novelists make up much of the programme, and this year’s lineup includes Hanif Kureishi, Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah and Elif Shafak. Young readers will be able to attend events with children’s authors including Jacqueline Wilson, Julia Donaldson andKatherine Rundell.And fans of music and comedy also have plenty to look forward to, with Paloma Faith, Brian Eno, Sara Pascoe andKatherine Ryanamong those due to speak and perform.Hay festival presidentStephen Frysaid he is “delighted to be returning to Hay Festival – one of my favourite places on Earth.”“Besides the fun and joy of gathering to share stories,” the festival is “also the antidote to disinformation and division,” he added.Last year, two days into the festival,Hay dropped its principal sponsor Baillie Giffordafter boycotts from speakers and performers over the firm’s links to Israel and fossil fuel companies. The investment management company subsequently cancelled all of its remaining sponsorship deals with literary festivals, and, last November, the 2024 winner of the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction, Richard Flanagan, refused to accept the £50,000 prize money unless the fund manager shared a plan to reduce its investment in fossil fuel extraction and increase investments in renewables.

Emergency services attended and confirmed he had sadly died. A postmortem has taken place and samples have been removed for further analysis.”“I understand there are no family concerns,” he added. “No note was left.”The court heard that the provisional cause of Danan’s death was combined toxicity of heroin, heroin-substitute methadone, painkiller codeine, anxiety-treatment pregabalin, cocaine, insomnia-treatment zopiclone, and it was contributed to by antidepressant benzodiazepine.Danan had battled drug addiction, claiming to have spent about £1m on rehab over the years, with a Covid-related relapse leaving him living on the streets at one point, until he checked into a Cotswolds rehab facility.Danan had been due to appear for a plea hearing at Warrington magistrates court on Thursday, after being charged with being in possession of cocaine and cannabis, according to court documents.He was also accused of driving while under the influence of drugs on 2 October last year, in Warrington, Cheshire.Statements will be taken from Danan’s GP, family, police and the ambulance service and inquiries are continuing with Avon and Wiltshire mental health partnership NHS trust, the hearing heardThe coroner set a provisional date of 28 May for the full inquest hearing.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionHollyoaksBristolnewsShareReuse this content"

See you on March 15.”Since his singing debut in 2002, Wheesung had been popular in South Korea with numerous hit songs, including chart-topping With Me, and was well regarded for his soulful performances.But his music career took a hit in 2021 when he was convicted and handed a suspended jail sentence for use of propofol – a surgical anaesthetic that is sometimes abused recreationally.An overdose of the drug was cited as the cause of pop star Michael Jackson’s death in 2009.The South Korean rapper Verbal Jint paid tribute on Instagram, saying: “Every moment we spent together was an honour and I’m thankful. You’ve worked so hard. Rest in peace, Wheesung.”Another rapper, Paloalto, thanked the veteran singer for fond memories, mentioning he went to see his first concert.“It’s shocking and sad. I’m thankful for the music that accompanied me through the good memories of my youth,” he wrote on Instagram.Deaths of K-pop stars put focus on mental health taboos in South KoreaRead moreSouth Korea’s entertainment industry has been under scrutiny for years due to the sheer number of stars of stage and screen dying at young ages.K-popstars are picked up by agencies at a young age – usually in their early or mid-teens – and live under tight control, with their days taken over by gruelling musical and dance training.Just last month, the South Korean actorKim Sae-ronwas found dead at her home aged 24. A former child star, her career came to a sudden halt after a drunk-driving accident in 2022, after which she struggled to land new roles.Last year, the South Korean actorSong Jae-limwas found dead at home aged 39, while Moonbin, the K-pop star and member of boyband Astro,was found dead in his apartment in 2023, aged just 25.Several other young K-pop stars who have died in recent years includeGoo Hara and Sulli in 2019,Minwoo of boyband 100%in 2018 andSHINee’s lead singer, Jonghyun, in 2017.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsK-popSouth KoreaPop and rockAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Flack, an influential performer with an intimate vocal and musical style that ranged easily between soul, jazz and gospel, died last month at 88.Her celebration of life memorial was open to the public at the Abyssinian Baptist church in New York and live-streamed at robertaflack.com and on YouTube. The church, founded in 1808, is one of the oldest Black Baptist churches in the US.The church was decorated for the ceremony with stunning white and yellow bouquets and filled quickly beforehand. At center, a screen showed a young Flack at the piano and played highlights of her career.It was a fitting location: Flack grew up with church gospel and her mother played organ at the Lomax African Methodist Episcopal church in Arlington, Virginia. As a teen, she began accompanying the church choir on piano.View image in fullscreenAl Sharpton gives the eulogy.Photograph: Richard Drew/APThe program featured a powerful quote from Flack, which became a message that was repeated by many of the speakers of the day.“Remember: always walk in the light,” it read. “If you feel like you’re not walking in it, go find it. Love the Light.”“Many of us are here today because she has touched not just our hearts but she also touched our souls,” said the Rev Dr Kevin R Johnson, the senior church pastor who led the service.Music greats such as Clive Davis, Dionne Warwick, India Arie, Peabo Bryson and Alicia Keys sent video messages speaking to Flack’s remarkable career.Former vice-president Kamala Harris sent a statement that was read: “Ms Flack broke down barriers, paved paths of opportunity, and fully embodied the words my mother often said to me, ‘You may be the first to do many things, but make sure you are not the last.’ As an activist and Grammy-award winning singer, her legacy will continue to inspire generations to come.”View image in fullscreenPhylicia Rashad speaks at the ceremony in New York.Photograph: Richard Drew/APThe actor Phylicia Rashad remembered first seeing Flack perform when she was a student at Howard University – to an audience that grew rapt by her quiet, steady voice.Flack lived comfortably with her genius and without having to proclaim it to people, Rashad said.“She wore that like a loose fitting garment and lived her life attending to that which she cared for most: music, love and humanity,” Rashad said.Hip-hop legend Hill’s appearance was unexpected but fitting. In the 1990s, Hill’s hip-hop trio the Fugees did a masterful take on Flack’s cover Killing Me Softly with His Song, which introduced much of the world to Hill’s gift.View image in fullscreenWyclef Jean, left, and Lauryn Hill of the Fugees.Photograph: Richard Drew/AP“Her existence was a form of resistance,” Hill said, holding back tears. “I adore MsRoberta Flack,” she said. “Roberta Flack is legend.”Hill then launched into a cover of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face followed by Killing Me Softly with His Song with the Fugees’Wyclef Jean– and Wonder joining in on harmonica.A legend who needed no introduction, Wonder followed up.“The great thing about not having the ability to see with your eyes is the great opportunity of being able to even better see with your heart. And so I knew how beautiful Roberta was, not seeing her visually but being able to see and feel her heart,” Wonder said.He performed his song If It’s Magic, then sat at the piano to sing with the harpist a song he wrote for Flack, I Can See the Sun in Late December.“I love you, Roberta. And I will see you,” Wonder said at the end.View image in fullscreenStevie Wonder performs at the ceremony.Photograph: Richard Drew/APEarlier, songwriter and performer Valerie Simpson played piano and sang an extended take of Ain’t Nothing Like the Real Thing interspersed with recollections of her friend.“But that voice. Aw, she’d just grab you in the heart. And then when she touched the keys, she knew how to dig down deep,” Simpson said.Simpson recalled being tapped to perform in Chicago for her 2018 Broadway debut and how she told Flack she wasn’t sure if she could act.“She looked at me and said, ‘Girl, where’s the script? Bring it over here. We’re going to work on this thing. We’re going to do this,’” remembered Simpson.New Orleans singer and piano player Davell Crawford performed a soulful version of Flack’s song Just When I Needed You Most to extended shouts and cheers.Flack leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, First Take, wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.She will likely be remembered for her classics. Those include her dreamy cover of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger. It marked the beginning of Flack’s mainstream success when it was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film Play Misty for Me.But most will think of Killing Me Softly with His Song when Flack’s name comes up in conversation. She first heard Lori Lieberman’s Killing Me Softly with His Song while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. On tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience fell in love with it, too, as they’d continue to for decades.Explore more on these topicsRoberta FlackStevie WonderLauryn HillWyclef JeannewsShareReuse this content"

His rise might have been a rare spot of good news on that front but it’s otherwise been a rough period for the emergence of true, crowd-drawing leads, a problem across many genres that’s recently been felt most in the action sphere. The last year has seenAaron Taylor-Johnson,Henry Cavill,Bill Skarsgård,Dev Pateland, last month,Ke Huy Quanface a mixture of critical shrugs and audience lack of interest (Love Hurts in particular, bombing with $15m globally and an 18% RT rating) while those more established, such as Gerard Butler, Keanu Reeves and Jason Statham, have continued to dominate.Holland review – twisty Nicole Kidman thriller is a disappointing messRead moreAhead ofAna de ArmasandRami Malektrying their luck, here comes nepo baby done good Jack Quaid in Novocaine, the son of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid fresh off the patchy sci-fi comedyCompanion. That film saw him riff on his Scream persona – toxic bro doing nice guy cosplay – while here he’s closer to Amazon’s The Boys – nerdy guy doing action hero cosplay – and, again, he’s better than the material. But his charm still isn’t enough to power us through another quippy and egregiously thin little lark, hinged on a one-joke premise that stops being funny far too soon.The joke here is that the junior bank manager Nathan Caine (Quaid) can’t feel pain. He has a rare disorder that has turned his small life even smaller, shying away from everyday life with the adoption of a tightly controlled routine to avoid serious injury. For reasons known only by the screenwriter, he’s tempted to change that after loosely working with the teller Sherry (Prey’s Amber Midthunder), who gets him to do things like eat solid food (he’s been on a liquid diet to avoid biting his tongue off) and risk his life for her during a robbery. She’s taken hostage by a crew of Santa suit-dressed criminals (the film is half-heartedly set at Christmas) so he decides to track them down and save the girl.Such recklessness from someone who has curated the cushioned life of a solitary introvert would need more motivation than the shreds we’re given here. A diner lunch, some drinks and a night in bed, all tied together with the vaguest hint of chemistry, are not enough to warrant a death-defying act of romance, his insertion into the crime then serving to implicate him. While his inability to feel pain might act as a superpower in the right moment, we’re never really shown why he would also be such a nifty fighter. It’s all the stuff of basic male fantasy – a lanky video game-playing geek is actually a secret action star – and while the film isn’t purporting to be a grounded slice-of-life drama, there are too many leaps required.There’s also not really enough fun here, the repetitive nature of the fight scenes – quip, laugh, injury, wince – growing tired fast. There’s such glee over the violence that it takes precedence over any genuine excitement, the directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen shooting the action with such drab flatness that our pulses never quicken. The neo-noir marketing campaign and the smartass script would lead one to expect something visually sharper but there’s no discernible style here, the duo weirdly choosing to emulate the feel of a bigger Michael Bay-esque action thriller rather than something more suited to the offbeat material and small budget (it’s also shot in Cape Town, a hugely unconvincing double for San Diego).After exhausting its elevator pitch premise, the script, from Lars Jacobson, doesn’t have much more to offer. The plotting of the heist is filled with distracting “but how come” holes and while there’s a decent-ish twist early on, it’s then just one long unexciting chase to the end, a boringly straight line when some left turns would help. Quaid’s charm is diluted by dialogue that’s never quite as funny as it should be or those involved think it is and as his zippy gamer sidekick, Jacob Batalon, finds himself in autopilot territory that as an actor he seems unable to escape (he’s trapped in a cycle of regurgitating lesser versions of his Spider-Man role). It’s clear that this is being primed as a cheap and cheerful new B franchise but with the premise exhausted so very fast, it’ll be a struggle to find that much more to do with such a lacklustre character with such a played-out condition. Novocaine urges us to feel something big – excitement, revulsion, romance, shock, amusement – but I left feeling very little.Novocaine is out in US cinemas on 14 March, the UK on 28 March and Australia on 3 AprilExplore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

And that’s the trouble with the movie – it derives most of its laughs from a belief in the inherent amusingness of nuns – the idea that putting a woman in a habit and a veil is instantly funny. It’s the story of convent of nuns entering a road cycling race to win the €25,000 prize – the only glitch is that none of them have been on a bike in years. Nuns on bikes. Hilarious! Nuns falling off bikes. Side-splitting!Mother superior Véronique (Valérie Bonneton) is the driving force behind the convent’s bid for cycling glory. Her worthy motive is to raise funds to refurbish an old people’s home. But really, she’s in it for a trip to Rome; her daydreams of hanging out at the Vatican, taking selfies with Pope Francis (acted by a pretty decent lookalike) are the funniest scenes in the movie. Véronique presides over a convent of slummy sisters, and the characterisation leans towards cartoonish. Theres’s naive nun Béatrice (Guilaine Londez) who sees miracles everywhere, and pious Augustine (Camille Chamoux) who has a racy past. Rebellious novice Gwendoline is the team’s Mark Cavendish.The movie puts a holy spin on the classic underdog sports movie. The nuns’ rivals for the prize are highly proficient cyclists from another convent where Véronique’s arch-enemy is the mother superior. Nothing here is subtle as the nuns slug it out for victory, both sides resorting to underhand tricks. It becomes annoying quickly, lumbered with cheap laughs and sloppy gags.Oh My Goodness! is in UK cinemas from 14 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsCycling (Sport)Cycling (Life and style)ChristianityFranceComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

A plumber is in the basement of a family home inChicagopeering with a spy camera into the pipes. Something is rotting under the house: a rat! Worse, the ancient creaking pipes might collapse at any moment.The house belongs to out-of-work actor and scriptwriter Graham Landry (Josh Radnor); more accurately it actually belongs to his successful older brother Will (Rob Huebel) the star of an outrageously awful hit TV series. It was their childhood home, bought by Will from their parents. Now only poor, stuck Graham – still sleeping in his childhood bedroom – lives there. But for a couple of days, the entire family gathers under one roof. Will has been accused of misconduct on the set of his show; their mum Sue (Becky Ann Baker) is groped by her boss at her retirement party, while dad Roy (John Ashton) is gambling.All Happy Families is a film with a few too many storylines, none of them fully explored. It’s easygoing and likable if not-quite satisfying, getting by on the natural and relaxed performances. Baker in particular is warm and wonderful as mum Sue, and there’s a lovely, tender scene with her and Will’s teenage daughter (Ivy O’Brien), who has just come out as trans. In the end the film’s message is perhaps more intricate and subtle – and truthful – than it first appears, with its portrait of a family that is both happy and unhappy, each in their own way.All Happy Families is in UK cinemas and on digital platforms from 14 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsChicagoComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the kind of serendipitous road-trip story more often seen in an American context, he plays Laotian orphan Satu, whisked off from the Buddhist temple that raised him on a quest to find his mother by urban runaway Bo (Vanthiva Saysana).Bo, in contrast, is fleeing her family: after her mum’s death, her father has taken to violently abusing her. An aspiring photojournalist, she is looking for a story in order to enter a competition; Satu’s situation, abandoned by his parent (Sonedala Sihavong, seen in flashback) with a letter hinting at her whereabouts inVietnam, is just the ticket. So when the discovery of unexploded bombs on the temple grounds means it may be evacuated, the pair hit the road on her dirt-bike, with Satu’s pet rabbit Jeobong in a cardboard box.Trigg has the eye of a photojournalist himself, honouring the lush Laotian landscape in warm, attentive and picturesque cinematography. He keeps his protagonists’ passage through it fairly uncluttered events-wise: their bike breaks down; Satu is offended by Bo having lied about being a fugitive; they encounter some would-be human traffickers. But this simplicity is both a strength and a weakness; paradoxically, maintaining it is no simple matter. Trigg injects pace as the authorities close in on Bo, and some awkwardly staged pursuits break up the surrogate-family intimacy he has delicately fostered between her and Satu.Using Bo’s voiceover to make explicit salient themes also smacks of over-adornment when Trigg is clearly able to convey them visually and dramatically. The importance of storytelling in forging a sense of self is clearly Trigg’s priority – and more than adequately encapsulated as Satu’s tale comes to rest, in a very Buddhist fashion, under a tree. Playing the role, Sonepho has a kind of stubborn wisdom beyond his years that – in tandem with equally resolute Saysana as his chaperone – sustains this moving parable about self-responsibility.Satu – Year of the Rabbit is at the Prince Charles, London on 14 March, then tours.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsLaosVietnamWorld cinemaAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its narrator, Tom Layward, a law professor, husband and father, tells us: “When our son was 12 years old, my wife had an affair…” Tom makes a private pact to endure his marriage only until their six-year-old daughter, Miriam, leaves for college. It is a quiet, bitter calculus, the sort of grimly rationalised fatalism that pervades the book. “What we obviously had, even when things smoothed over, was a C-minus marriage,” Tom reflects, “which makes it pretty hard to score much higher than a B overall on the rest of your life.” Markovits is an artist of such scorching recognitions – wry, unsentimental summations that make you wince at their truth.Then, with the turn of a paragraph, 12 years evaporate. Miriam is 18, the family is summering at her mother’s parents’ house in Cape Cod, and Tom’s long-planned departure hangs over the novel like an unbroken storm. Markovits is superb at conjuring the temperature of a failing marriage – not through eruptions, but through the long accumulation of slights, hesitations and rehearsed hostilities. Tom’s wife, Amy, is masterfully drawn: brittle, commanding, a woman who has long since learned the tactical advantages of exasperation. The novel’s brilliance lies in how it refuses to reduce her to an antagonist – because, of course, Tom is just as complicit.Tom is not discovering the US; he is retreating into it, moving not toward freedom but toward the inescapability of consequenceYet Tom has more than just his marriage to reckon with. He is besieged – by the lingering, shifting symptoms of what appears to be long Covid (“palpitations, sudden fatigue… I woke up with a swollen face and leaky eyes”), by a professional implosion at his unnamed university, where his refusal to include pronouns in his email signature has made him a lightning rod for campus politics. Worse, he has provided legal counsel to the owner of a basketball team accused of racism and sexism. He is, in short, on the losing end of a culture war battle he has neither the stomach nor the conviction to fight.With all of this in the air, he and Miriam set off to drive her to college in Pittsburgh. After dropping her, and seemingly on a whim, Tom just keeps on driving. His ostensible destination is California, where his son, Michael, is studying, but the journey is less a road trip than an act of attrition. He drifts through the wreckage of his past, stopping to visit old lovers, old friends, a brother, a business associate who ropes him into yet another consulting job in the ongoing ideological skirmishes of the NBA. If the great American road novel has traditionally been a narrative of youth – of possibility, of the US as something to be sought – thenThe Rest of Our Livesis its weary, middle-aged inversion. Tom is not discovering the US; he is retreating into it, moving not toward freedom but toward the inescapability of consequence.A Weekend in New York by Benjamin Markovits review – absorbing tennis dramaRead moreHemingway said he wrote best about Michigan when he was in Paris. Markovits, too, has spent much of his life outside the US – he played professional basketball in Germany, and now teaches at Royal Holloway, University of London – but remains one of the most astute novelists of modern America.The Rest of Our Livesis another quiet triumph, an elegant, devastating book that lays bare the way time calcifies our failures, how we find ourselves trapped not by circumstance but by the slow erosion of the will to escape. Markovits has long been one of our most under-appreciated novelists; this is yet more proof that he deserves far greater recognition.The Rest of Our Livesby Ben Markovits is published by Faber (£16.99).

The film feels ill-considered somehow, like one of the half-sketched fantasies that Dinklage’s protagonist, a university lecturer named Phil, often indulges in, such as imagining a pair of identical twins (Rebecca Olson) are his sister wives ready to minister to his every need. There’s a reason why it’s best not to know other people’s dreams.Phil’s other big desire is to own a proper home instead of the shabby condo he rents near the lesser-level Massachusetts college where he teaches cultural economics. One day Phil finds a deal that looks too good to be true. If he buys a granny flat inside the sprawling mansion occupied by eccentric widow Astrid (Shirley MacLaine on sparky form) as a live-in, he will inherit the full $5m spread when she dies. Advised to go for it his by his greasy friend/realtor Dell (Matt Dillon), Phil scrapes together every bit of cash he can and moves in. There are a number of baffling strings attached, of course, including hangers-on who may or may not be Astrid’s children; one of whom, Maggie (Kimberly Quinn), is a lawyer specialising in probate, so she’s naturally keeping a close eye on things. Nevertheless, like nearly every woman in the film, she eventually falls into bed with him, unable to resist that rumbling voice and languid charisma.The script is by Theodore Melfi, who wrote and directedthe similarly languid St Vincent with Bill Murray, and an air of disappointed masculinity resonates in both films; they are easy to consume but don’t give back much, like the protagonists themselves.American Dreamer is on digital platforms from 17 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsPeter DinklageShirley MacLaineMatt DillonComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It catalogues one young woman’s steady descent into incarcerated madness, becoming, as it goes, exponentially unsettling and increasingly stomach-churning.Marguerite Périgord lives a stone’s throw from the “shit-stink” of the River Thames in Victorian London with her family in a crumbling house that once was grand, but is no more. She has been confined to the attic, the sinister opening lines convey, “for the sake of her wellbeing. That’s what her mother had said.”Marguerite is the oldest daughter of Cécile Périgord, a woman who comes from new money – her father made soap for the queen - but who has since lost her tenuous grip on London high society after the departure of her husband, a man whose flagrant sex obsession has mired them in scandal. Marguerite is to be married to a much older – and significantly poorer – solicitor, but Cécile, whose general view of men now is understandably dim, does not approve. She locks her daughter away so that Marguerite can properly prepare herself for wifedom, and leaves her with the collected works of Victor Hugo,Mrs Beeton’s Book of Household Managementand a sewing machine. Each evening, more or less, Cécile visits with a plate of sustaining food.But Marguerite worries that she might have been forgotten. Time slides. “She understood that by now she must be older than when first she entered the attic; that there would be much less of her, no swell at her hips or breast, nothing to fill her cheeks up when she smiled.”A writer from Rotherham now living in Glasgow, Heather Parry is the author of one previous novel, a short story collection and a nonfiction work on capitalism, each of which found more plaudits than they did readers. This should change withCarrion Crow, which, surely, will win awards. Victorian London is reliably fertile ground for novelists. There is so much refinery, so much contrasting squalor; Parry prefers, and revels in, the latter. Her depiction of it, so vivid, makes the pages squelch.The more Marguerite diminishes in her confinement, the more Parry comes into her elementLocked away, Marguerite grows increasingly lonely. She can hear her siblings down below but can no longer access them, and her mother’s nightly visits seem far less regular. Craving distraction, she indulges in self-exploration, no cavity too inaccessible. “Marguerite found that the insides of her ears were thick with a mustard-coloured wax.” Beneath one fingernail she finds a woodlouse, “so old as to be fossilised”. On particularly drab days, “she could entertain herself for hours with the investigation of her own tonsils”.Hunger conjures its increasingly hypnotic spell, and she develops by necessity an adventurous palate. When a crow nesting alongside her brings worms back, Marguerite swipes one and pops it into her mouth. “There she let it move, drawing moisture from her dry gums. She bit it into two wet halves, chewing it into a cud. It was orange jelly, it was veal cake, it was fricasseed turkey. A banquet for one.”Gradually, we come to learn more of Cécile’s own nervous disposition, which may explain her maternal cruelty. Cécile is greatly reduced herself, cut off from her parents, adrift. But her steel remains. Reputation is at stake. When her daughter says, “Mother, I am rotting here”, Cécile barely flinches.The more Marguerite diminishes in her confinement, the more Parry comes into her element. Every sentence oozes a crushed purple poetry, overripe with devastation and wretchedness. Marguerite’s plight is clearly one of tragedy, but it is thrillingly told, and you cannot look away. The film adaptation will carry an 18 certificate.If you finish it feeling you might just skip dinner, then you also feel filled with awe for a writer so gifted at conveying this much ick in such luxuriant, refulgent style.Carrion Crowby Heather Parry is published by Transworld (£16.99).

This exciting initiative gives wild campers exclusive access to wild spaces where no one has been allowed to camp before.“These are some of the most ecologically rich places in the UK, where ecosystems are being restored, landscapes are healing and biodiversity is returning – and those staying can contribute to these efforts.”CampWild members will be able to find out about the rewilding projects on the site – from beaver reintroduction to habitat restoration – before they go. On booking they will receive an interactive map with a species checklist and things to do, such as helping to track biodiversity, monitoring wildlife and removing invasive species.View image in fullscreenNature’s secrets … one of the Rewilding Britain sites.Photograph: CampWildInitially launching with 15 spaces, from Cornwall to Scotland, the plan is to expand to other sites in theRewilding Britain network. As part of the initiative, £1 from every CampWild membership will be donated to Rewilding Britain. “Every membership will directly contribute to rewilding efforts, ensuring that the very places we explore continue to thrive for generations to come,” said Backhouse.Among the rewilding sites is Pine Island on a renaturing farm on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales. Off-grid campers will be able to participate in activities from bracken bashing to deweeding trees (25,000 have been planted on the estate). Other options include Mapperton Wildlands in Dorset, where 404 hectares (1,000 acres) of farmland are being rewilded, andRewildingKinkell, a nature restoration project in St Andrews, Scotland.“Rewilding – the restoration of nature to the point where it can take care of itself – must have people at its heart to succeed, and allowing people space to form a connection to areas undergoing rewilding is a wonderful way to bring them on this exciting journey with nature,” said Sara King of Rewilding Britain.“It’s also an amazing opportunity to experience the astounding benefits rewilding can bring to our health and wellbeing, and to witness first-hand what reinstating natural processes, restoring ecosystems and letting nature lead can achieve.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it is also a good alternative tourda, a Balkan cheese made from leftover whey that, whenIrina Janakievskamoved to the UK 20 years ago, was impossible to find here. “I started using cottage cheese instead,” says the author ofThe Balkan Kitchen. “And while it isn’t a direct substitute, it is versatile.” For a riff on a Balkan-style filo or hand-stretched savoury pastry (“such asgibanica,banitsaorburek”), Janakievska combines cottage cheese, fried leeks and blanched and roughly chopped greens (spinach, chard, sorrel, nettles, say), then binds them with an egg before swaddling in filo and baking.Gustavo Giallonardo, chef director ofOriolein London, meanwhile, suggests adding it to huevos rancheros: “Cottage cheese provides a tangy, creamy contrast. Blend it first, or mix it with lime and queso fresco to enhance that tanginess.” Otherwise, Giallonardo adds, cottage cheese would make a fine alternative to soured cream in a burrito, or get some into that perennial brunch favourite, shakshuka: “Mix some into the sauce, spoon it over just before serving or simply serve it on the side.” Any cottage-cheese cravings could also be sated with Janakievska’s mum’s savoury bread pudding, which she has “unfairly called old bread bake”: “It’s an amazing dish, though, using odds and ends of bread with cottage cheese to make an almost-strata,” she says. “That makes a very nice breakfast or brunch.”Now on to dessert, where cherries, be they frozen, fresh (when the time comes) or sour, make a superb filling combined with cottage cheese and a bit of semolina for a strudel, Janakievska says. Alternatively, go for a kind-of deconstructedkadaifbaklava bowl. This involves layering cottage cheese mixed with honey, lemon or orange zest, and ground cinnamon, followed by a mix of toasted and roughly chopped nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, for example). “You could add fruit [apples, pears, frozen cherries] stewed with citrus juice, then top with kadaif pastry brushed with butter and toasted in the oven until light brown,” Janakievska says. She then finishes off proceedings with a drizzle of honey and an extra sprinkle of toasted nuts. “That’s also a good way to use up any leftover kadaif pastry, which is itself having a moment with everyone trying to make a Dubai chocolate bar at home,” she adds. It just so happens that the Guardian’s ownRavneet Gillwill be sharing her own take on that bar very soon, so keep an eye out in the run-up to Easter.Got a culinary dilemma?
