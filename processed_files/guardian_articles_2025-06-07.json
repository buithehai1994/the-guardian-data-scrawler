In the past five years, he has become infamous for hisincendiary takeson masculinity, dating and the perceived challenges that men face in contemporary society.Combs was a natural person of interest for Gaines, as well as his peers who focus on Black masculinity and traffic in many of the same misogynistic tropes that have been present in hip-hop from its early days. For decades, the New Yorker was an alpha-male fantasy come to life: a self-made captain of industry and paragon of “Black excellence” who helps mainstream hip-hop music while juggling a roster of paramours that included Bad Boy artist Cassie Ventura.According to Gaines, 35, the Diddy trial is “the biggest hip-hop case of all-time” – “bigger than Epstein”, he declared after the first few days of testimony, adding: “Honestly, it’s bigger than Trump’s.” And with no TV cameras in the courtroom, his sliver of themanospherehas become a crucial information source for its loyal audience of young men – and also casual trial observers who might stumble into such content through algorithmic forces.Diddy trial draws media circus to New York streets: ‘I just want to catch the vibe’Read moreSince Combs’s arrest last September on federal criminalchargesfor racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, these podcasters and YouTubers have been notably more sympathetic to him than to the witnesses called for the prosecution. The allegations about Combs’s behavior are horrific and include shocking revelations about his drug use, sexual indulgences and hair-trigger temper. But you wouldn’t know that from following trial coverage from these faithful evangelists of toxic masculinity. Ventura, especially, is an object of their derision, and their assessment ofher testimonyis withering. In their view, Combs is not a man with incredible power and influence who abused and mistreated those in his circle, but the target of a #MeToo-style witch-hunt orchestrated by Ventura.“I don’t see no crimes committed n this case,”tweetedBoosie Badazz, the southern rapper andmanosphere ambassador, three days into the trial. “U shouldn’t be sent to jail for being a freak.”YouTuber Greg Adams, who discourages Black men from settling into committed relationships, pushed back against the prosecution’s attempts to characterize Ventura as a naif on his channel, Free Agent Lifestyle. “There’s no accountability on her part,” he said. “Everything is: ‘My brain still ain’t developed, he slipped me a drug, he tricked me,’ when it should’ve been: ‘I was 21, Diddy was a damn near millionaire kabillionaire and I was upgrading.’”Rapper Cam’ron, aself-styled sports commentator, interviewed one of the male escorts who testified to participating in Diddy “freak offs” for anexplicit recapof his sexual experiences with Ventura. DJ Akademiks, the hip-hop tastemaker always playingdevil’sadvocate, has called the allegations against Combs “bullshit” and says the crimes he’s accused of committing hardly warrant the life sentence he could receive if found guilty.It is Gaines, though, who is uniquely well-positioned to cast himself as a voice of reason, often evoking his seven-year stint as a homeland security special agent, during which he handled human-trafficking and organized crime cases, to his audience of almost 2 million people. The Diddy trial doesn’t just recall elements of his claimed background; it also allows him to dwell on favorite themes: in hours-long daily trial postmortems, Gaines uses blunt talk and reductive reasoning to stitch the facts of the case into a broader rebuke of modern, independent women.View image in fullscreenSean ‘Diddy’ Combs listens as his defense lawyer questions witness ‘Mia’ as she testifies in Combs’s sex-trafficking trial in New York, on 2 June 2025 in this courtroom sketch.Photograph: Jane Rosenberg/ReutersAmong other things, Gaines claims Ventura’s testimony shows that she was not a “passive victim”. (“For her to kind of omit responsibility from this stuff is a little crazy,” he said.) He points to the videos, texts and other freak-off-related exhibits that the government has presented in court – much of which came from Ventura – as evidence of how women entrap powerful men. He reckons Ventura’s 2023lawsuitagainst Combs, which was quickly settled for $20m, speaks to how women use the legal system against high-profile men to humiliate them and enrich themselves. To Gaines, Ventura testifying to receiving an additional $10m settlement from the InterContinental hotel for their handling of the2016 altercationbetween her and Combs was a “gotcha” moment.“What it looks like to me and I think anyone who’s in the courtroom is this is a dysfunctional relationship where you have two extremely jealous individuals that are both violent, that are both using drugs every single day, partying every single day, where emotions are fluid and there’s a lot of infidelity going on,” Gaines said five days into the trial. “So it’s almost like a recipe for disaster.”The more Gaines lives up to his online reputation, the more neutral observers struggle to square it with the guy they queue up with outside the courthouse. During the trial, he has acquired something of a reputation. “He’s actually quite meek in real life,”said Stephanie Soo, the creator behind a popular crime-focused YouTube channel called Rotten Mango. “Not that I think he should carry himself as he does on his podcast in the courthouse. But he’s rather, like he has a very soft demeanor.”Gaines also seems to appreciate some nuances of Ventura’s predicament that his peers wholeheartedly dismiss. Namely: he accepts that Ventura was abused and mistreated throughout the decade-long relationship with Combs. But for the most part, he seems to side with the defense argument that the government has taken a domestic violence case and turned it into a sex-trafficking case. “Let’s be honest here: Cassie had a very strong hand in a lot of this,” he said.For these men, the trial is a test of their influence as they reframe a female victim’s storyWhile Gaines and his ilk assail Ventura’s credibility and ridicule supporting witnesses such as rapper Kid Cudi for “ratting out” Combs, the crux of the prosecution’s racketeering argument – that Combs exploited his extensive corporate resources and outsized interpersonal control to engage and traffic in prostitution – is largely lost on them. So is the southern district of New York’s95% conviction rate. As much as these voices make it seem plausible that Combs could beat this case, the reality is his best chance of beating the case might be through a presidential pardon.Not surprisingly, that’s somethingDonald Trump– themanosphere championand a one-time Diddy wingman who has granted clemency to an assortment of hip-hop heroes, including the rapper NBA YoungBoy last week – is apparently considering.“I haven’t spoken to [Combs] in years. I think when I ran for politics, that relationship busted up, from what I read,” Trump said during an Oval Office event last week, when asked about a potential pardon. “I would certainly look at the facts [of the case]. If I think someone was mistreated, whether they like me or dislike me wouldn’t have any impact.”Either way, it’s clear whohethinks the victim would be.With the Diddy trial at its projected halfway point, that Combs’s defense team can count on continued support from Black voices in the manosphere is a marked development. Just this week, at least one content creator wasreportedly requested to be barredfrom the trial after leaking the identity of an anonymous witness.For these men, the trial is a test of their influence as they reframe a female victim’s story into a modern allegory on the perils of being too powerful a man. It seems to be working. During the first week of the trial, a fan approached Gaines outside the courthouse and told him: “You’re the only person I trust to cover this trial.” He didn’t need the encouragement.Anna Betts contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsHip-hopUS crimeRape and sexual assaultNew YorkRaceMenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it covers a broader conflict that began in 2022, when Peltz wore Valentino instead of Victoria Beckham to her wedding, and brings us to this week’s lavish cover-shoot for German Glamour magazine in which the junior Beckhams discuss their “occasionally messy, very real love” and whether they might open a restaurant – without a word about her in-laws.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham on the cover of Glamour Germany.Photograph: The Morelli Brothers/Glamour GermanySuch are the vagaries of celebrity beef, no one really knows what happened in between. But things had clearly ratcheted up when photos of David’s 50th birthday party last month appeared online – with no sign of Brooklyn. Further details involving Romeo Beckham’s now-ex-girlfriend, various tattoos and a failure to attend one of Victoria’s fashion shows began bubbling up, and soon Beckxit had become a reality.Since then every appearance and Instagram post has been picked over by media outlets and armchair journalists alike. Within hours of the Glamour shoot appearing online, the Daily Mail was speculating in one of its 52 stories (and counting) whether the interview was proof that the feud was far from over.The timing of the Glamour piece was terrible or brilliant, “depending on whose publicist you were”, said the PR agent Mark Borkowski, who helped revive Noel Edmonds’ career. But however you look at it, it is “absolutely a war of spin”, he said of the shoot. “It’s what I call a visual soundbite. These images often don’t always have the meaning we imbue them with. But we still feed off of it because we are all culprits driven by twitching.”Dr Kadian Pow, a lecturer in sociology at Birmingham City University, agreed. “The PR moves have to be connected,” she said. “It’s another power play between the two parties.”From the Times of India to Jordanian paper Amman, coverage of this three-year family “feud” has been extraordinary – especially considering we will probably never know the truth, nor really care. So why are people compelled to read on?View image in fullscreenBrooklyn and Nicola at London fashion week in February.Photograph: WWD/Getty Images“It’s about titillation, and it’s about power [and] the Beckhams,” said Pow. “But more widely, these tales are an escape from the doom and political reality [of the news cycle]. We are fascinated because they are supposed to be richer and better than us – so when we see a flaw that mirrors us ordinary folk and our everyday fallouts, it makes us feel better about ourselves.”In The Stars in our Eyes, Julie Klam’s 2017 book exploring our fascination with celebrities, celebrity-watching is compared to a fun-house mirror, as if celebrities are constructed to keep us in check. “If we can get a handle on our relationship to celebrity,” Klam writes, “we can better understand ourselves.” Celebrities are perfect, she says, until they aren’t.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just as newspapers have dedicated Beckham correspondents, there is an entire Tiktok cottage industry of amateur sleuthing that capitalises on other people’s difficulties for clicks and profit. Most of this is unregulated. “And there are libel laws that bring to bear [legal action], but the harm is usually done by that point,” said Stephens.Still, fights and breakups are life’s great equaliser and occasionally, said Pow, when the stars are as big as the Beckhams, these feuds can be “a shared experience, which is particularly salient in what has become an increasingly siloed society. There isn’t a lot of monoculture left, but these big juicy stories allow us to whisper together.”Celebrity feuds have been entertaining us for centuries. In medieval Italy, the satirist Pietro Aretino was supposedly employed by the French king to write propaganda about the Spanish king, while being paid by the Spanish king to write propaganda about the French king. It was a weaponising of gossip on a par with 2019’s Wagatha Christie, in which the machinations of back-stabbing footballers’ wives turned Instagram into a global whodunnit.Move over Harry and Meghan: Britain’s real royal family are now dominating the US headlines | Arwa MahdawiRead moreSometimes the fights feel curated – and often are. Some gossip sites are suggesting the feud has been confected to drum up publicity for Victoria’s Netflix documentary this October.One reason for the intense Beckxit media interest is that it involves two nepo babies (Peltz, an actor, is the child of a billionaire businessman and a former model). “These children are looking to monetise their lives, yet are in economic competition not just with their peer-group, but also their parents,” said Stephens. This is particularly uncomfortable for the Beckham brand, which is built on family. Victoria and David came of age “in full tabloid glare”, said Stephens. “[But with the offspring] it’s harder – what you have is a case of children growing and boundary finding, except [they are doing it] in the public eye.”Klam said: “I do think people believe that the kids of celebrities are fair game. But I do not. Nepo babies have it worse than normal people because everyone thinks they’ve had everything handed to them.”Still, she said: “Now that Brooklyn is choosing to be in the spotlight, well, he is fair game. It’s not like he decided to be a shepherd or something.”Explore more on these topicsCelebrityBrooklyn BeckhamVictoria BeckhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A problem before you even realised, lurking in the background of your earliest memories. Never with a clear mark for when yourealisedit was a problem. (When you realised what it means, to hate your skin so much.) But with signs scattered throughout your life.The very earliest sign was swimming. Or clothes in general, really, but swimming was the easy one. When you swam, you always wore (and always still wear) a shirt, even though the males of your family don’t. More broadly, you refuse to ever be seen without one. You called it modesty, but now you know it as shame. Shame for your square-ish, flat, slightly hairy flesh prison. Because, even then, you knewyourchest should be covered up, even though your skin is flush against your ribs and males don’t need to cover up.(The thought makes you sick – not the unfairness of who should cover what, but that you don’t actually have to care. Youwantthe extra part of the dress code, the additional rule when swimming.) So despite the fact that you didn’t have to, you covered up. Refused to take off your shirt, anywhere, for any reason. Convinced that you were just being dumb.You were afloat, and now you’re drowning, and you don’t know if you’ll ever surface againAnd even if it was discomforting, it was so easy to write it off. So easy to shy away from the teasing about your modesty, so easy to pretend you were just a little odd and there was nothing else to it. Because as long as you’re just a bit odd, nothing could go wrong. Just push it down, just don’t think about it, just ignore the wrongness of your skin and the strangeness of your bones. Masking yourself as you masked your body, because you were safe if you didn’t think about it. If you ignoredwhyyou needed to cover up, you could pretend you were fine and normal and yourself.A sweet little lie.The most obvious sign, a little later than the swimming, was video games, and your refusal to play as a male. “Girls look better!” you might have said. But that wouldn’t explain the first-person games, the ones where you spent hours dressing up a character so unlike you, even though you would only ever see the results in menu screens. Even back then, playing games, having fun, there was a crushing sensation. A vague, growing envy. That even little digital pictures wore their skins better than you.That feeling – the crush, the envy, even a little hurt. It’s never left you. You find it in the mirror, in your head when you look down at yourself, in the back of your mind when you’re reading. It’s a second skin, a layer of disgust. You clench your hands and it’s there. You scrub yourself in the shower and it’s there. Rest your hands on your thighs and it’s there. You’re terrified that no matter what you do, the crush will never leave. That you willalwaysbe what you are, instead of what you want to be.The first time you showed off a bit – wore a sports bra, showed some skin – there was so much joy that it scared you. Because the one truth of you is that your skin disgusts you. But put a strip of fabric over your chest and suddenly your skin made you ecstatic.And from that moment, from seeing yourself in the mirror like that, you know something has changed. You realise that there’s a word for you, as your eyes trace the shape of the skin you suddenly want to keep seeing. A word that encapsulates so much but also so little, and you’re terrified of it. (You still are, if you’re being honest.) It settles over the crush and the envy and the hurt and, suddenly, there’s so much more of you than there was only a few days before. A cut in that second skin of disgust, showing something promising beneath.And then the crush comes, and you put a bandaid over that cut. The joy of your skin deserts you, and the disgust returns, because you know exactly what’s wrong when you look in the mirror now, and there’s no amount of pretending that can fix it. You stay up late with your best friend, and they help you find a name, and it is the warmest feeling in the world, and your skin constricts around you. Because names don’t fix the fact thatyou aren’t you. That your skin isn’t yours, and seeing your own face is like the sound of cracking glass turned into a feeling, and you begin to fear that you willneverbe fixed.Because you have lived in ignorant bliss for so long – simply calling yourself weird, simply swallowing it all down. There was peace in your lack of self, in not realisingwhyyou’ve slowly, unnoticeably grown addicted to skirts and long hair and bare strips of skin. Because as long as you didn’t think about it, it couldn’t quite hurt you. As long as you were strange little (not-)you, you were safe and you were normal and you were completely fine.And now you’re not.You’re not fine.And you haven’t been for a long, long time.Your safety, your peace, has been torn down so slowly you didn’t even notice, and now everything hidden behind it has come rushing out. Everything youwerehas been torn out and you don’t know how to rebuild yourself. You’ve lost every building block, and all that’s left is the hurt that you’ve spent your life crushing out. The hurt when you touch your face, when you see your hands, when you sit down with your thighs together.You’re terrified of what you want to be. Terrified because you finally realise it, finally see the shape of everything you’ve been forcing down.Terrified, because now you know what you are, and that knowledge is like an anchor with a too-short chain. Fine when you kept it up, but now you’ve let it drop, and it’s tugging you down with it. You were afloat, and now you’re drowning, and you don’t know if you’ll ever surface again.In Australia, support is available atheadspace.Other international helplines can be found atbefrienders.orgElsie Thwaites is a student and hobbyist writerExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionTransgenderMental healthHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

On smooth, almost silent, test runs, its pioneering wheel system allows it to round the corner without slowing – a small bend for this tram but a sharp turning point for tramkind.The embryonic Coventry very light rail (CVLR) is riding a bigger wave; suddenly, trams are go again. British cities trail Europe but once led the way, before retiring the hundreds of street trams that once flowered under horse and steam power.And although the likes of Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham re-established tram networks, the number of modern revivals were almost matched by the list of cancelled projects, with schemes for Liverpool, Bristol, central London and Leeds dropped.View image in fullscreenBattery-powered trams have no overhead wires.Photograph: Andrew Moore/CVLRBut now the dreams are back – and funded. In the run-up to next week’s spending review, the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, confirmed £15bn for citiesto develop urban transport. That money will be spent partly on new tram lines in the West Midlands and Greater Manchester, as well as developing plans for a possible tram line from Bristol to Bath. Notably, it includes £2.1bn for the biggest city in Europe without a fixed transit system – Leeds.For the West Yorkshire mayor, who has long campaigned to get the city its tram, the announcement was critical. “This gives us absolute certainty and security that we will have spades in the ground by 2028,” Tracy Brabin says.While Brabin has championedenhanced bus routesand services, two tram lines – one running from Leeds to Bradford – will be the backbone of an integrated mass transit system.“There is a reason why European cities have trams,” Brabin says. “They can carry three times as many people. They are often segregated, so they are reliable. And you can time your journey. It’s absolute reliability: you go to the tram stop, and the tram is there in a few minutes. It’s also cleaner and greener.”1:41Rachel Reeves announces £15bn investment for trams, trains and buses outside London – videoBrabin says the Leeds-Bradford line will benefit 675,000 people. “That’s massive – not just for people on the line, but to also unlock areas that have really struggled. The tram connectivity will absolutely unlock housing and development,” she says.Perhaps tram and light rail networks have suffered as being neither fish nor fowl: never boasting the speed of a train or the solidity of a railway station for the passenger; nor, for the public purse and politicians, the lower infrastructure investment and higher flexibility of a bus network. Yet this halfway house has multiple benefits – and modern innovations may provide the answer.So why don’t more people want them? David Andrews, the chair of the campaign group Tram Forward, says: “The cost is one thing but mainly the disruption. People don’t want trams because they worry about the disruption, and it’s true that in Edinburgh itwent on for years. But if you can just lay it on the surface, you can do it overnight.”View image in fullscreenGraham Dibbins, a train driver at RailAdventure UK, steers a tram in the test phase.Photograph: Andrew Moore/CVLRBattery-operated trams are starting to appear around the world, from Florence in Italy to Doha in Qatar, potentially cheaper than installing and maintaining an overhead wire network, although Andrews says that concerns that the lines are unsightly can be overblown: “In Vienna, you’ve got the cables pinned to the side of the Grand Opera House and people don’t notice them.”The bigger element of the cost and disruption of laying a tram network is what lies beneath the road: the pipelines for gas, electricity, telecoms and water.Traditionally, for a heavier tram, installing rails has meant digging down several feet and having to divert utilities. It is a slow and costly process that helped push the price of building Edinburgh’s 11-mile tram line to more than £1bn, and drove residents and businesses to distraction over years of construction delays affecting the heart of the city.View image in fullscreenInstalling rails requires excavating only 300mm from the road surface, leaving pipes in place, say engineers.Photograph: CVLREngineers now believe much of that can be avoided, by laying concrete slabs with embedded rails over the roads: excavating only 300mm from the surface and leaving the pipes in place.The lightest footprint yet may be found in Coventry, where the public can try out a local innovation bringing its automotive tradition and new battery developments into what it terms Very Light Rail.Using a smaller, composite vehicle – carrying about 60 people but weighing less than half the tonnage of a normal tram – the CVLR team says the cost of installing a track can be halved, down to about £10m a kilometre from typically £25m (costs have reached £100m a kilometre on some projects). Pioneering bogies – the wheel-axle system underneath a tram or train – allow the vehicle to make much tighter turns, permitting routes through narrower city streets.Riding the prototype, the city councillor, Jim O’Boyle, says: “The vehicle itself can go around 15-metre radii. But the alchemy is the track beneath.”View image in fullscreenA large part of the cost and disruption of laying a tram network involves what lies under the road.Photograph: CVLRThe concrete slabs and rails were installed with a fraction of the disruption of a traditional tram line. The 220-metre test track here was laid within weeks – not much more disruptive than resurfacing a road, the engineers claim. Running on battery, there are no overhead wires.Yet for a tram this size, why not simply run a bus? Nicola Small, the CVLR programme director, says: “It’s permanent infrastructure. People can see that the tracks have been laid and that it’s here to stay. They know where the route’s going because they can see it and that gives them confidence – and it also gives businesses confidence to invest in the area, because they know that there’s going to be that connectivity.”Intriguingly, research shows that while car drivers avoid buses, there is no such stigma about the tram. Small says: “From looking at statistics, most bus users are non-car owners, so they are using the bus because they have to.

Which brands are rich and satisfying, and which smell like a pickled egg?The best food processors and mixers – chosen by chefsTom HuntSat 7 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve spent my whole adult life making mayonnaise from scratch, turning my nose up at store-bought versions with chef-like snobbery, but after this tasting, I’m ready to accept that jarred mayonnaise is a valid addition to the store-cupboard.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I wanted to consider in more depth what it is we want from a mayonnaise. According to Harold McGee inOn Food and Cooking, mayonnaise is an emulsion of two liquids that don’t normally combine – oil and water – stabilised by egg yolk’s lecithin, which allows the oil to form tiny droplets dispersed in the water and creates that wonderful, unctuous, fatty texture we so love.I think texture is the No 1 priority but, of course, flavour and the quality of the ingredients are also important factors. Mayonnaise lubricates and adds umami savouriness to our food, making otherwise bland ingredients desirable. I prefer a gently flavoured mayonnaise with a subtle tang of lemon juice or white-wine vinegar, but most shop-bought options, including “premium products”, use spirit vinegar, which gives them the aroma of a chip-shop pickled egg.Mayonnaise isn’t meant to be eaten straight from the jar, but tasting these that way was invaluable, because it let me see how each brand might have a more distinctive or pronounced sweetness or sourness or salt content. I also sampled each mayo with salad leaves and chips to see how it behaved in real-life conditions. For me, the best vehicle for mayo is a crunchy lettuce leaf or a chicken sandwich; for my wife, it’s tuna. Either way, a good mayo should enhance our food.I’m normally firmly of the opinion that you get what you pay for, but surprisingly, while I’m sure the more expensive mayonnaises use higher-quality, ethically sourced ingredients, my taste buds couldn’t always tell the difference; some of the humble, lower-priced options delivered just as much satisfaction as their premium counterparts. While I’ve discovered that there are some worthy shop-bought options that deserve a place in my pantry for convenience, there’s still a special magic to homemade mayonnaise that can’t be replicated in a factory.The best mayonnaiseBestall-rounder:Kenko Japanese mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen£4.50 for 500g at Waitrose (90p/100g)£4.55 for 500g at Ocado (91p/100g)★★★☆☆This really packs a punch, but it’s one of the more processed options. Naturally sweet from sake lees (the grain mash left over from making sake), which brings a unique depth, this is sweet, sour, salty and has an umami-rich profile that’s enhanced by MSG and vegetable oils (soya and rapeseed), while mustard adds complexity. With a high egg yolk content of 17%, this is rich and satisfying, making it a good choice if you want full-on flavour. It’s also well priced compared with its main competitor, Kewpie (see below).Best splurge:Delouis mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 250g at Ocado (£1.30/100g)£3.30 for 250g at Waitrose (£1.32/100g)★★★★★A pale mustard yellow colour with a distinct scent of white-wine vinegar, egg and dijon mustard. Well emulsified but loose, this has a natural sweetness with no added sugar – a refreshing change. The vinegar acidity is clear but not overpowering, while the dijon really stands out, landing a satisfying punch. The closest I tried to homemade, with classic ingredients, and lemon juice instead of concentrate. It also uses sunflower oil rather than rapeseed oil, which I prefer for environmental reasons due to the lower pesticide levels and the natural weed-suppressing benefits of sunflowers.Best bargain:Tesco mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen99p for 500ml at Tesco (20p/100ml)★★☆☆☆Pale ivory in colour and glossy. The aroma is eggy and acidic, probably due to the spirit vinegar, and it’s thick, with a slight jelly-like consistency from the corn starch. On tasting, it’s quite sweet but still enjoyable, with a clear vinegar acidity that’s not overpowering. There’s also a hint of lemon. Worryingly cheap (how do supermarkets make such cheap food and at what cost?), but pretty good for the bottom of the price range.And the rest …Daylesford organic mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 175g at Ocado (£3.71/100g)★★★☆☆Dairy cream in colour, with a gentle egg aroma. This was the only mayonnaise tested that didn’t have a strong acidic smell. It has a light texture, partially thickened with xanthan gum, which is perhaps used to play it safe and avoid separation. Sweet but enjoyable, with a balanced acidity and a pleasing complexity from the mustard and olive oil. It’s a nice choice, but a bit disappointing given the extremely high price, especially because I usually find organic mayonnaise to be leagues ahead of conventional options.Dr Will’s classic mayoView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 170g at Ocado (£1.47/100g)★★★☆☆Nice, golden-yolk colour with specks of mustard seed. The aroma is sour, with complex notes of egg and mustard, and it’s thick-textured, with a slight jelly-like consistency. A subtle, natural sweet taste with a sour kick, though sadly the apple vinegar doesn’t come through clearly, possibly due to the addition of concentrated lemon juice and white vinegar. Overall, a good all-rounder, with balanced flavours and a loose texture that maintains good emulsification. A nice option, though not a heavy hitter. B-Corp certified, meaning it meets high social and environmental performance standards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The aroma is dominated by egg, with a sharp acidity. Firm and thick, with a well-emulsified consistency, and sweet with a noticeable sour tang. Mustard and a blend of vinegars (spirit, apple and red wine) add depth and complexity. The high 14% egg yolk content gives it a rich, satisfying texture and its umami-rich flavour is boosted by MSG and the preservative calcium disodium EDTA. Despite its industrial production using caged hens’ eggs, Kewpie’s popularity could stem as much from its brand recognition as its distinctive flavour.Hellmann’s real mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen£2.28 for 400g at Asda (57p/100g)£2.80 for 400g at Tesco (70p/100g)★★☆☆☆Pale cream-white, with an acidic aroma and subtle eggy notes. It has a thick texture and a jelly-like wobble.It’s quite sweet but otherwise bland, with a balanced sourness and a hint of mustard in the background. Although it contains calcium disodium EDTA, there’s nothing especially alarming about the ingredients list. Overall, a classic and inoffensive option.Heinz seriously good mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen£2.90 for 540g at Tesco (54p/100g)£3.40 for 540g at Sainsbury’s (63p/100g)★★☆☆☆Snow-white in colour (an indication that little yolk is used in the recipe), with a pungent aroma of vinegar and egg. Light texture, yet stiff from the added starches. Mildly sweet, with a balanced acidity and subtle egginess, it’s less salty than others. While it’s neutral and inoffensive, the overall flavour is fairly bland and uninspiring. Like Hellmann’s and Kewpie, it contains calcium disodium EDTA. If you’re looking for a mayo without strong character, this one will fit the bill, but it falls short if you want depth and richness.M&S Collection mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 165g at Ocado (£1.97/100g)★★☆☆☆A lovely pale-mustard yellow with a strong vinegar aroma. The texture is loose but well emulsified, and there’s a subtle sweetness, but the acidity dominates, with a little complexity from mustard and olive oil. Disappointingly, the olive oil didn’t add the depth I was hoping for, and the dominant flavour was vinegar. A nice enough mayo, but it falls way short of expectations for the price.Stokes real mayonnaiseView image in fullscreen£4 for 345g at Waitrose (£1.16/100g)£15.95 for 3 x 345g at Amazon (£1.54/100g)★★☆☆☆A pale ivory colour and a glossy sheen. The aroma is pungent with acetic acid, and the texture is thick and slightly jelly-like. Very sweet and a touch too sour, though the mustard and olive oil bring some complexity. Made with British free-range whole eggs, it has a slightly looser texture than the others, but is still well emulsified, although there was some oil separation – a big faux-pas.Waitrose mayonnaise with extra-virgin olive oilView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 500ml at Waitrose (55p/100ml)★☆☆☆☆Pale custard-yellow (coloured with paprika), with an aroma that’s quite acidic from the spirit vinegar. The texture is thick and slightly jellified, and it’s fairly sweet, though with a touch of sourness. The mustard flavour adds a subtle complexity. The addition of 5% olive oil adds nothing and doesn’t justify the price, making it underwhelming overall.Explore more on these topicsSauces and graviesThe FilterFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As they trudged for hours through the ruins of Gaza towards a food distribution centre, she rehearsed over and over again with her 20-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son what they should do and where they should wait if an Israeli attack turned the column of hungry people into a chaotic, panicking mass and the family were torn apart.It was the last conversation she had with them. She was dead before dawn broke on Tuesday, killed by a single bullet through her forehead. Her daughter and son spent nearly three hours beside her body, pinned down by gunfire.“We went there out of desperation. Hunger is what forced my mother to go. She had been going every day for a full week walking six hours to get there and coming back with nothing,” Mirvat, her daughter, said in a phone interview.A couple of days before, after Israeli forces had opened fire on the weary crowds approaching new Israeli and US-backed food distribution centres, Mirvat had begged Reem not to risk the trip any more.The walking, waiting, battling the chaos and then returning empty-handed seemed a pointless risk, a waste of what little energy they had left after months of small, irregular meals. But her children were famished.“I told my mother it was a sign from God not to go again and that convinced her,” Mirvat said. “But she would quickly change her mind when my little sister Razan, who is only five years old, cried to her that she was hungry.”Reem tried to stretch out what little stocks the family had left after months of siege, but it is hard to trick a hungry child. After one meal of “soup”, made with just a handful of lentils for the whole family, Razan begged for food, telling their mother “water doesn’t fill my stomach”, Mirvat said.So on Monday, Reem told Mohammad, her husband of 28 years, that she wanted to try again to get some food. They set off before midnight because the distribution point is several hours’ walk from Khan Younis, where the Zeidan family have been sheltering in the ruins of their old home. Food handouts begin early and end fast.Map“For six days, my wife and I went there and came back with nothing,” said Mohammad. “She insisted on going [again], hoping we would at least get one kilo of flour. Instead, she came back covered in blood, wrapped in a shroud.“It feels like I have lost a part of my body, like someone tore my heart out of my chest. The soul of our home has gone.”Reem was praying and worrying the whole journey, as the weary family walked and rested, walked and rested. They were nearly at the food distribution point, when suddenly they heard heavy gunfire.Reem checked one more time that her son and daughter remembered their pre-agreed meeting point. Then she was gone. “Her last words were: ‘If we get separated, where will we meet again?’” Mirvat said. “But now we’ve been separated forever.”Both saw their mother being killed. Ahmad turned round after a girl behind him started screaming and watched his mother collapse, face down, behind him.1:20Ahmad describes the moment his mother was shot at the aid centre – video“I started trying to wake her up, shaking her and shouting her name,” Ahmad said. “The sound of explosions grew louder, snipers were firing in all directions, and quadcopters [drones] around us were also shooting. In just one second, everything turned upside down without us knowing why.”Reem’s death was a tragedy foretold; her children’s loss a grief that could have been prevented. Humanitarians had warned that mixing guns and food would put civilians at risk since Israel and the US first mooted plans to concentrate food delivery in hubs guarded by private security contractors and the Israeli military.The UN and major charities have fed more than 2 million people since the start of the war, using networks built inGazaover years, and security protocols – without weapons – that have been tested in many conflicts and disaster zones.Israel has limited the access allowed to UN and other groups delivering critical aid to Gaza throughout the war, and from March to late Mayimposed a total siege, causing a starvation crisis.‘The world does not care if we all die’: hunger and despair in the ruins of Gaza CityRead moreIt claims Hamas has diverted and exploited aid throughout the war, and that it needs a new delivery mechanism to starve the group of cash and supplies. But it has never provided evidence to back up that claim, or statistics detailing thefts.It presented the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) as an answer to these problems. A secretive group that has not revealed its funding, it is ledby an evangelical Christian from the USwho has ties to Trump but has no experience delivering humanitarian aid at scale in a war zone.Less than a week after the GHF started operations,at least 27 people were killedtrying to reach one of its sites on Sunday 1 June, health authorities said. Mass attackscontinued on Monday and Tuesday, when Reem was among the victims.The Red Cross said that in that period, hundreds of casualties were brought to its field hospital in Rafah after attacks on crowds trying to reach GHF sites. The toll over three days was at least 50 killed and more than 400 injured.The GHF acknowledged the Israeli military attacks on Tuesday. It “was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”, a spokesperson told Associated Press. It halted food handouts on Wednesday and part of Thursday to “enhance security measures”.The Israeli military had previously denied shooting at civilians seeking food but has since said its forces opened fire on Tuesday near a food distribution centre, firing on people troops deemed were “moving towards them”.Mohammad, who is 46 years old, said that on repeated trips to the centres there was never enough food for even a fraction of the desperate crowds gathered from all over Gaza. The distribution of those limited supplies was brutal and dehumanising, he said.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“These are not aid distribution points. These are traps set for the people,” he said. “When the shooting begins, you stay down. Someone next to you might get shot or killed, and you can’t even look at them or help them. And when they’re done with their ‘fun’ they open the gates at 6am, and chaos erupts.“The soldiers film people fighting over the aid, and once it’s finished, they throw teargas to disperse the crowd. I saw displaced people who couldn’t get any aid picking pasta from the sand.”The Zeidans have almost no food left. After the war resumed in March they mostly ate at charity kitchens, but fewer and fewer kept operating as the siege deepened and supplies inside Gaza dwindled.Now, as they should be celebrating Eid, Mohammad’s children are mourning their mother, their second holiday marked by grief. Last year, at the end of Ramadan, they buried the couple’s eldest son, Nabil.“Our holidays were supposed to be filled with joy, sweets, and feasts. Now, we greet them with death and blood,” Mohammad said. “What did my children do to lose their mother because she tried to get food for them? The youngest is only five. They still need their mother.”Mirvat cannot escape the agonising image of her mother’s death, etched into her brain since it happened. “Every time I close my eyes to sleep, I see the scene of my mother falling and dying. It’s like I’m reliving it over and over. I watched my mother die before my eyes and I was powerless to do anything.”At first, she could not believe her mother had been killed. “I ran to her. People around started offering condolences, saying she had been martyred. But I told them: ‘No, she’s still alive,’” Mirvat said.“I truly felt that she was still alive. I could feel her pulse. I held her, lay on her chest. I felt her soul was still there. I could hear her heartbeat. I started calling her: ‘Mother, can you hear me? Come on, wake up. Let’s get out of here, let’s crawl on the ground. Don’t worry, you’ll be OK. I’ll pull you with me. But she didn’t respond.”For three hours, Mirvat and Ahmad waited beside Reem’s body for the shooting to stop. When it finally did, crowds surged forward for food and the children began looking for a car or cart that could take their mother to a hospital.0:42Ahmad cries over his mother’s body – videoIn the chaos they were separated and Mirvat had to choose between leaving her mother’s body or abandoning her little brother. She decided to focus on the living, whispering to Reem: “I entrust you to God.”By the time she found her brother, emergency workers had taken their mother’s body away, so the siblings began a bleak tour of Gaza’s battered hospitals to find her.First the British hospital, then the American hospital, then the Red Cross. Finally as they reached Nasser hospital, an ambulance arrived carrying unidentified bodies. Reem was among them.A journalist captured Ahmad grieving over the body, stroking, kissing and hugging his mother through tears. “No, no, my mother is not dead. She’s still alive,” he says.The video spread online, because of his raw grief and also because a video of Reem herself identifying Nabil’s body had gone viral a year earlier.Nabil was killed in a bombing in January 2024, as civilians fled Khan Younis in the face of an Israeli advance, but Reem could not retrieve her son’s body for months.0:45Reem identifies the body of her oldest son who had been killed in an Israeli strike – videoThe moment when she recognised his clothes on an unidentified victim, then broke down in agony, captured the pain of so many Palestinians in Gaza. Now her killing is a brutal reminder of the scale of suffering and death visited on the most ordinary families there.Before the war, the family of 10 were poor but had each other. Nabil worked for a cleaning company and earned 50 shekels (about £11) a week alongside Reem for many years. His father worked as a day labourer when he could find employment.Reem was kind and cheerful, Mirvat said, quick to laugh and with a ready smile. She treated her children with respect and kept order in their large family through love, not fear.When a child got upset at being chastised, she would comfort them with their favourite food. “She’d come with a smile on her face and start explaining that she did what she did for his own good. She would keep trying until he was happy again,” her daughter said. “She loved to listen to our thoughts and valued our opinions.”Mirvat was in her last year of high school when the war began. Her dreams of going to university to study law have been set aside, replaced by the basic hope that the rest of her family will survive the war, and by new responsibility now her mother is gone.“My future is clear. There are children depending on me, so even if education starts up again I won’t be able to go back,” she said. “I can’t imagine sitting around the dinner table and seeing my mother’s place empty, knowing she died trying to bring us food.”"

Through the plan for change”, we are investing in Britain’s renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off.”Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, said: “R&D is the very foundation of the breakthroughs that make our lives easier and healthier – from new medicines enabling us to live longer, more fulfilled lives to developments in AI giving us time back, from easing our train journeys through to creating the technology we need to protect our planet from climate change.”Ministers said the investment would boost the life sciences industry in Liverpool, the defence sector in Northern Ireland and semiconductors in south Wales. It matches a commitment made by the previous Conservative government to spend £22bn a year on R&D.The seven mayoral strategic authorities in England – Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Liverpool City Region, North East and Greater London – will each receive awards of at least £30m each. The fund will also include a competition open to all other parts of the UK.The announcement was welcomed by Richard Parker, the mayor of the West Midlands, and Kim McGuinness, the north-east mayor. McGuinness said the funds would support the car and green energy industries in her region.The package also includes £4.8m for a partnership between Manchester and Cambridge to attract business investment.Alongside the spending review on Wednesday, Reeves is planning to announcean overhaul of the Treasury’s “green book”– the rules that govern how public investment plans are judged. Critics say the existing rules are biased in favour of London and the south-east.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the creditors’ bid fails, ThamesWateris likely to fall into state ownership via the special administration regime – a fate the Treasury is desperate to avoid.Sources described the creditors’ list of demands as a “ransom note” that underlined their powerful negotiating position as the “last show in town”.Creditors argue that failure to secure leniency from fines and enforcement will mean Thames Water is caught in a “doom loop” that prevents it from recovering and injecting enough money into its tired network. The company, which has 16 million customers in the London and Thames Valley regions and 8,000 employees, is labouring under about £20bn of debt and is running out of cash.The requests formed part of the creditors’ turnaround plan that was put to the water regulator, Ofwat, in recent days. Among the proposals were that the EA stops enforcing personal liability for managers at Thames Water and does not pursue enforcement over the company’s failure to deliver a huge number of infrastructure upgrades, known as the water industry national environment programme (Winep).The Guardian revealed in December that Thames Water intentionally diverted millions of pounds pledged for Winep environmental clean-upstowards bonuses and dividends,sparking an Ofwatinvestigation. Customers have already paid for those projects via their bills. Thames Water failed to deliver more than 100 of 812 Winep schemes it was due to between 2020 and 2025.Other creditor requests include not prosecuting Thames Water for sewage spills on dry days or for“flow to full treatment” licence breaches– where the EA and Ofwat police how much wastewater its plants can treat at any time.They also want Thames Water to be exempt from prosecution for breaches of the industrial emissions directive, which governs pollution into rivers, streams, land and the atmosphere.To achieve these requests, the creditors want Reed to give a strategic decision statement ordering the EA to deprioritise enforcement.View image in fullscreenExcess raw, untreated sewage being spilled at the River Thames in London.Photograph: Ambrosiniv/AlamyThe Guardian revealed in March that Thames Water wasdemanding leniency for fines and penaltiesin order to attract bidders and stop cash they might inject from leaking out of the business.However, the extent of the creditor demands, and request for near-blanket immunity for serious environmental crimes, has surprised water industry insiders, who warned it could spark legal challenges from rivals or lead to more requests for special treatment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The regulator said its investigation had uncovered failings around Thames’s handling of sewage and wastewater, which amounted to a “significant breach” of its legal obligations.The EA is still pursuing parallel investigations into Thames Water over alleged failure to comply with environmental permits, and has powers to prosecute the company.Creditors are expected to write down a significant proportion of their debt in return for taking over the company. Time is running out to find a solution to keep it afloat as it burns through £3bn of high-interest rescue loans.A spokesperson for the creditors declined to comment on commercial discussions but confirmed their plan required “regulatory support”.“The creditors’ proposal will fix the fundamentals, protect public health and prioritise improved customer and environmental outcomes,” they said. “In addition to a detailed operational plan and billions in fresh investment proposed by the creditors, Thames Water requires a fundamental reset and regulatory support so that asset health and performance can be restored to the levels that customers and the environment deserve.“The creditors are committed to working with the government and regulators to achieve that outcome as quickly as possible and expect Thames Water to be held to account to deliver a realistic but ambitious trajectory for the company’s return to compliance.”A government spokesperson said: “The company is stable and government is carefully monitoring the situation. We expect the company to continue to meet its obligations to both customers and the environment.”An Ofwat spokesperson said: “Our focus is on ensuring that the company takes the right steps to deliver a turnaround in its operational performance and strengthen its financial resilience to the benefit of customers. We are assessing whether the [creditors’] plans are realistic, deliverable and will bring substantial benefits for customers and the environment.”Thames Water said: “In order to be investable, we and prospective investors would need to engage in discussions with our regulators.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterWater industryUtilitiesWaternewsShareReuse this content"

Yusuf tweeted on Thursday that Sarah Pochin, the Reform MP for Runcorn and Helsby, had been “dumb” toask Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questionswhether he would ban it.Hours later he announced he was quitting, saying he did not believe working to get a Reform government elected was a good use of his time.“When I pushed that tweet out it was a coming together of a bit of exhaustion and a feeling that all I got in return for it was abuse,” he said on Saturday. “I was doing so many things, in the foreground and in the background.”“What has happened since then is that I’ve been inundated with messages from Reform members and supporters who were saying they were devastated and heartbroken and asking me to really reconsider my decision.“I left my business interests behind, I’ve volunteered full-time, because I love my country and I believe the best way to save it and turn it into a great one is for Nigel to be prime minister.“It made me realise that in that moment I was turning my back on that – and I didn’t want to do that.”Yusuf, who is a practising Muslim, insisted he did not have “any strong views about the burqa itself” and said that “if there were a vote and I was in parliament, I would probably vote to ban it actually”.He described the fallout over Pochin’s comments as “an internal miscommunication issue” and said he had found out about her remarks for the first time on X. “I don’t mind saying that it frustrated me,” he said.He added that he did not think the issue of burqas “is one of the most important [to] British people when they go about their day-to-day lives”.Earlier on Saturday, Farage said: “When Zia says anything you cannot believe the absolute tirade of personal racist abuse that he gets … I just think he snapped.” The Reform leader told Times Radio the abuse came “from the very hard extreme right” and blamed “Indian bots”.Yusuf was brought in by Farage to be Reform’s chair last year, months after he donated £200,000 to the party.He iswidely credited within Reformfor having professionalised the party, hiring new people, setting up more branches and making it run in a more corporate way.However, he also rubbed some of the Reform old guard up the wrong way with his management style and by overseeing the departures of several long-serving former members of staff.Some of Reform’s members have turned against Yusuf over his role in thedeparture of one of the party’s most rightwing MPs, Rupert Lowe, after the pair clashed earlier this year.The Sunday Times reported that Yusuf’s former role of chair will now be split into two. There will be a front-facing chair tasked with touring the country and speaking to the media, and a deputy in charge of organisational matters.Ellie Reeves, the Labour party chair, said: “Reform’s revolving door shows that the party is all about one person – Nigel Farage. Zia Yusuf’s humiliating hokey cokey is laughable but there is nothing funny about Farage’s £80bn in unfunded commitments.”A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said: “It looks like Reform are playing musical chairman.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

We have robust processes in place for this.”Warren Kirwan, media manager at disability equality charity Scope, said: “Attitudes and language like this are never acceptable.“It’s not just ignorant and hurtful to disabled people, it has wider consequences. Negative attitudes hold disabled people back in all areas of life, from getting a job to shopping on the high street.“Mr Borthwick needs to reflect on what he said, educate himself and do better. We hope he takes the opportunity to get to know the reality of disabled people’s lives.View image in fullscreenJamie Borthwick and Michelle Tsiakkas at the Strictly Come Dancing Live Tour launch on 16 January 2025.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/Rex/ShutterstockBorthwick won the Strictly 2023 Christmas special with Nancy Xu. The 30-year-old took part in the most recent series of Strictly, where he was paired with the professional dancer Michelle Tsiakkas. They were eliminated in week 10, finishing seventh.Borthwick, who joinedEastEndersin 2006 and is one of the longest-serving actors on the show, told the Sun on Sunday: “I want to apologise sincerely and wholeheartedly for the words I used in the video showing my reaction to making it through Blackpool week on Strictly. I am deeply sorry for any offence and upset my words and actions have caused.“It is no excuse, but I did not fully understand the derogatory term I used and its meaning. That is on me completely. Now I am aware, I am deeply embarrassed to have used the term and directed it in the way I did. It was wrong.“When I made the video, I was excited and caught up in the moment. Again, that is no excuse. But my regrettable actions are not a true reflection of my views, or who I am.“I enjoyed every minute of my time in the Blackpool Tower Ballroom and the town itself. The people of Blackpool have always been amazing with the Strictly crew, dancers and cast members. I know they will be again for this year’s show and those in years to come. I am truly sorry.”Wynne Evans, who also competed in last year’s edition of Strictly, said last week he had been dropped by the BBC, after apologising for using “inappropriate language” during the launch of the Strictly Come Dancing tour.The Welsh opera singer, 53, will no longer be a BBC Radio Wales presenter, he announced last week.Earlier this year, he apologised for language that he called “inappropriate and unacceptable” after the Mail on Sunday reported that he was heard making a remark to a woman in a video filmed during the Strictly launch event.It is understood Evans was given a warning over the remark by tour producers.In January, he said: “I’ve agreed with the BBC that I’ll take some time out from my radio show and the Strictly Live tour, as well as my other public commitments, to prioritise my wellbeing. I am deeply sorry for the pain my inappropriate actions have caused, and plan to take this time for self-reflection.”Explore more on these topicsBBCEastEndersStrictly Come DancingSoap operaTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the woman, Leto, who was seated with the actor Ashley Olsen, who was then 19, grabbed her arm.“I looked down and it wasJared Leto,” the woman told Air Mail, adding: “We had a quick conversation, and he got my number.” She went on to say that Leto called her home a few days later, recalling: “I don’t know if he was on drugs or what … It was the weirdest, grossest voice … [But] for me, it’s Jared, you know?”She said that Leto said he was hosting a party at his house that evening and that he invited her. The woman declined, telling the outlet: “I didn’t even have a driver’s license.” Nevertheless, she said, Leto kept calling her, “always at one, two, three AM”.“And the conversations turned sexual. He’d ask things like: ‘Have you ever had a boyfriend? Have you ever sucked a dick?’” she told Air Mail.Another woman, the model Laura La Rue, recounted a similar experience to the outlet, saying that when she was 16 years old in 2008, she was at an event in a private residence in Beverly Hills where Leto was “watching her so intensely”.“He asked how old I was. I said, ‘I’m 16. How old are you?’” La Rue told Air Mail. Leto, who was 36 at the time, proceeded to ask for her number. The two began an email correspondence, which eventually led to her visiting Leto’s home in April 2009, the outlet reports.“I remember him teasing me the whole time I was there,” La Rue said, adding: “He was flirting with me. He’d lean in close, then pull away, like it was a game.”In a statement to Air Mail, a representative of Leto said: “Their communications contain nothing sexual or inappropriate … and Ms La Rue later applied to work as Mr Leto’s personal assistant, further underscoring the absence of anything inappropriate in any of their interactions.” Air Mail reports La Rue denying ever applying for a personal assistant role with Leto.During a separate visit, La Rue said, Leto walked out of a room completely naked when she was 17 years old. “He just walked out, dick out, like it was normal … I thought maybe this was just what adult men do,” she told Air Mail.Another woman who spoke to the outlet said that she and Leto began a texting relationship while she was still underage. According to her, Leto would ask her inappropriate questions during her visits to his house, such as: “Do any of the little boys you hang out with fuck you?”The woman added that once, when she was 18, Leto “suddenly pulled his penis out and started masturbating”. She told the outlet: “Then he walked over, grabbed my hand, and put it on him. He leaned in and said: ‘I want you to spit on it.’”Another woman, Allie Teilz, a Los Angeles-based DJ and music producer, last month on Instagram reposted a 2012 Facebook status in which she had said: “Youre [sic] not really in L.A. until Jared Leto tries to force himself on you backstage… In a kilt.. And a snow hat,” Air Mail reported.In her Instagram stories, which Air Mail reviewed, Teilz said: “I was assaulted and traumatized by this creep when I was 17 … He knew my age and didn’t care. What he did was predatory, terrifying and unacceptable.”A representative of Leto has “expressly denied” the various women’s accusations reported in Air Mail, including Teilz’s, which the representative said were “demonstrably false”.Leto himself has yet to comment on the allegations.In the US, call or text theChildhelpabuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visittheir websitefor more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

Asked whether he thought their relationship was over, he said: “I would assume so, yeah,” and said he had no plans to speak with his erstwhile sidekick.“I’m too busy doing other things,” Trump said, adding: “I have no intention of speaking to him.”But he predicted that the spat had helped to unify the Republican party around him, saying the “party has never been united like this before. It’s never been. It’s actually more so than it was three days ago.”Musk’s opposition to the Republican budget bill, formally the “one big beautiful bill act”, would not, he predicted, affect its passage through Congress. The bill narrowly passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate. However, some conservative Republicans share Musk’s concerns about the need for significant spending cuts and are considering making changes.The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and includes new spending for border security and the military. Republicans aimed to offset these costs with cuts to programmes such as Medicaid, food stamps and green-energy tax credits.Projections from the congressional budget office and independent analysts indicate that the bill would add between $2.3tn and $5tn to the deficit over the next 10 years. White House officials contend that the economic growth generated by tax cuts will offset the increased spending.Still, Trump told NBC he is “very confident” that the bill will pass the Senate before 4 July.“I think, actually, Elon brought out the strengths of the bill because people that weren’t as focused started focusing on it, and they see how good it is,” Trump said. “So in that sense, there was a big favor. But I think Elon, really, I think it’s a shame that he’s so depressed and so heartbroken.”He also accused Musk of being “disrespectful to the office of the president”.“I think it’s a very bad thing, because he’s very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the president,” he said.Earlier, Musk deleted a post from X, the social media platform he owns, that asserted links between Trump and disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even Epstein’s lawyer said I had nothing to do with it. It’s old news.”Musk has also retracted a threat to begin “decommissioning” SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft used by Nasa to ferry astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.The original threat came after Trump suggested he might cancel SpaceX’s federal contracts. On Saturday, the president said he hadn’t given the subject any more thought.“I’d be allowed to do that,” he said, “but I haven’t given it any thought.”Earlier on Saturday, JD Vance told interviewer and comedian Theo Von that Musk was making a “huge mistake” going after Trump, but downplayed Musk’s attacks as being made by an “emotional guy” who got frustrated.“I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that’s not possible now because he’s gone so nuclear,” the vice-president said.But he added: “Look, it happens to everybody. I’ve flown off the handle way worse thanElon Muskdid in the last 24 hours.”“I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,” Vance said.David Smith contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskDemocratsRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The date for the next king’s speech has not been set but several sources said it could take place in May 2026.Labour had originally planned to introduce a short, narrowly drafted AI bill within months of entering office that would have been focused on large language models, such as ChatGPT.The legislation would have required companies to hand over their models for testing by the UK’s AI Security Institute. It was intended to address concerns that AI models could become so advancedthat they posed a risk to humanity.This bill was delayed, with ministers choosing to wait and align with Donald Trump’s administration in the US because of concerns that any regulation might weaken the UK’s attractiveness to AI companies.Ministers now want to include copyright rules for AI companies as part of the AI bill.“We feel we can use that vehicle to find a solution on copyright,” a government source said. “We’ve been having meetings with both creators and tech people and there are interesting ideas on moving forward. That work will begin in earnest once the data bill passes.”The government is already locked in a standoff with the House of Lords over copyright rules in a separate data bill. It would allow AI companies totrain their models using copyrighted materialunless the rights holder opts out.It has caused afierce backlash from the creative sector, with artists including Elton John, Paul McCartney and Kate Bush throwing their weight behind a campaign to oppose the changes.This week, peersbacked an amendment to the data billthat would require AI companies to disclose if they were using copyrighted material to train their models, in an attempt to enforce current copyright law.Ministers haverefused to back down, however, even though Kyle hasexpressed regretabout the way the government has gone about the changes. The government insists the data bill is not the right vehicle for the copyright issue and has promised to publish an economic impact assessment and series of technical reports on copyright and AI issues.In a letter to MPs on Saturday, Kyle made a further commitment to establish a cross-party working group of parliamentarians on AI and copyright.Beeban Kidron, the film director and cross-bench peer who has been campaigning on behalf of the creative sector, said on Friday that ministers “have shafted the creative industries, and they have proved willing to decimate the UK’s second-biggest industrial sector”.Kyle told the Commons last month that AI and copyright should be dealt with as part of a separate “comprehensive” bill.Most of the UK public (88%) believe the government should have the power to stop the use of an AI product if it is deemed to pose a serious risk,according to a surveypublished by the Ada Lovelace Institute and the Alan Turing Institute in March. More than 75% said the government or regulators should oversee AI safety rather than private companies alone.Scott Singer, an AI expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “The UK is strategically positioning itself between the US and EU. Like the US, Britain is attempting to avoid overly aggressive regulation that could harm innovation while exploring ways to meaningfully protect consumers. That’s the balancing act here.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Peter KyleComputingIntellectual propertyRegulatorsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

That has changed. We are concerned about the risk of a major war of aggression in Europe,” he told the Süddeutsche Zeitung news outlet.Tiesler called for a national effort to pinpoint and turn tunnels, metro stations, underground garages, car parks and the cellars of public buildings into protective shelters to “quickly create space for 1 million people”. He said his agency will present a comprehensive plan later this summer.He added that the country was in a race against time, and to rely on the construction of new bunker facilities was insufficient. Such shelters would take a long time to plan and construct and be very costly, Tiesler said. As a result, existing structures needed to be closely considered more immediately.Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has caused fears in other countries, especially in Baltic states but also in Poland and Germany, that Moscow could open new fronts in Europe.Overnight, Russian forces launched missile and bomb strikes on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, leaving three people dead and 22 injured. The mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said in a post on Telegram on Saturday that the city was “experiencing the most powerful attack since the start of the full-scale war”.Of about 2,000 bunkers in Germany and protection rooms left over from the cold war, only about 580 are in working order and most need multimillion-euro revamps. They would shelter about 480,000 people, just half a percent of the German population. In comparison, the BBK said that Finland has 50,000 protection rooms, amounting to space for 4.8 million people, or 85% of its population.Tiesler said efforts also needed to be put into fine-tuning information systems, such as apps and road signs, to share with the public exactly where they could seek shelter, as well as upgrading warning sirens. Existing warning apps also needed to be better protected from hackers, he said.He urged Friedrich Merz’s government to ensure funding was in place to enforce his agency’s plans. It has agreed the plans are necessary but has yet to formally prescribe funds.Money is expected to be made available from the billions unleashed after parliament suspended Germany’s debt brake in March, allowing large amounts of spending to take place in the military, vital infrastructure – such as bridges and roads enabling them to carry tanks and supplies – and civil defence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was unclear where the large black bull came from or why it was running loose.0:35Bull runs loose around streets of Birmingham – videoWendy Valentine, founder of the Hillside animal sanctuary in Frettenham, near Norwich, said: “We became aware of his desperate break for freedom when we received multiple calls from concerned supporters asking if we could help.“We sprang into action and negotiated with the Birmingham police, assuring them that we could give him a secure home here at Hillside.“With nobody coming forward to claim him, they agreed that we could collect him and bring him to our sanctuary.”The bull arrived at Hillside at about 2.45am on Saturday. It has been named Liam and will live with the sanctuary’s 750 other rescued cattle.A video released by the sanctuary showed the bull munching hay in its new surroundings within minutes of its arrival.Majid Mahmood, a councillor and Birmingham’s cabinet member for environment and transport, posted a picture of the bull on X and wrote: “This magnificent animal seemed to be enjoying an unexpected break, but our amazing street cleansing staff weren’t phased [sic] at all, helping moving it into a safe place.“Well done to our animal welfare staff & park rangers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the real shame of this is we just didn’t know. It was hidden so well.”Gillespie’s elderly grandmother lived at The Firs, aNottinghamshirecare home that was dramatically shut down by the Care Quality Commission in April due to a catalogue of shocking failures – everything from meeting nutritional and hydration needs, staffing, equipment, fire safety and governance was found to be lacking.The CQC found people were at “serious risk of harm from overdose” due to poor medicine management, while some were at “increased risk of developing pressure sores and ulcers”, and one person was “at risk of choking from not having their immediate needs met”.The people living in the care home, who were elderly, vulnerable or receiving end-of-life care, were evacuated in ambulances by the council into the early hours of the morning. One person who was receiving palliative care died within hours of the move.Soon after, the home in Lowdham – which housed 11 people with dementia and physical disabilities – went into liquidation. Staff lost their jobs and have been left with wages unpaid, and many residents are owed thousands of pounds in fees – people paid from £1,250 a week to live there.“People must be held accountable for this. I don’t think anyone who can run a home like this should be allowed to work in the care sector ever again,” said Gillespie, a corporate investigator more accustomed to turning his hand to international cases of public office bribery and fraud than care homes.He is compiling a dossier of evidence on what went wrong at The Firs and why it took so long to act on whistleblowing complaints, which he plans to submit to his local MP and the health secretary.“I won’t be letting the matter go, not just for my own relative and the staff who lost their jobs, but out of principle, because no one’s loved ones or their families should have to go through this,” he said. “I think this situation is so unique and appalling it needs to be looked at a higher level.”Emma Locking’s 87-year-old grandfather, Tim, who has dementia, lived at the home. She said her family were shocked when they received a call at 5.30pm on a Friday saying the home was being shut down with immediate effect.“Obviously my nan, at 85, was panicking, thinking: ‘Oh my God, now he’s homeless,’” she said. “It was really stressful. It’s awful for all the residents. These are people in their 80s and 90s. Some of them didn’t even have family to help. I just think the way it was all handled was disgusting.”They had held concerns about the home for a while, particularly after Tim was left for 15 hours with an open wound on his wrist after a fall in December. His family said they were not informed of the seriousness of the injury until the next morning, when staff asked them to take him to hospital for stitches.When they arrived to pick him up, one staff member said the wound had been “like a bloodbath”.“I said: ‘Why the hell did no one tell us this last night?’ I would have taken him in. The wound was horrific,” she said. “He’s diabetic. He’s on blood thinners. He’s 87 years old. He could have died from that cut because he could have got sepsis. It makes you think: would he have been better off at home?”She said her grandfather’s medication was not stored correctly and was often out of date, and he suffered two other falls at the home due to faulty or missing equipment. Her family considered raising concerns with the CQC, but worried about the repercussions for Tim while he lived there.View image in fullscreen‘No one’s loved ones or their families should have to go through this’ … Greg Gillespie, whose grandmother lived at The Firs.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianThe CQC reporton the failures at The Firs found a number of serious safety breaches. A fridge used to store medicine, including insulin and antibiotics, had been switched off for five days with no one noticing, meaning the medicine may have become ineffective.Errors and a lack of training led to frequent overdoses – three residents received above the maximum dose of their pain relief, putting them at “serious risk of harm”. Others weren’t receiving medication regularly, including one person on end-of-life care.People with dementia had unsupervised access to unlocked doors, leading outside to a busy road and to a retaining wall that had been taped off as it was at risk of collapse.Fire exits were blocked, and there was no equipment to transport two people living upstairs with mobility issues down in an emergency. The home’s manager was absent for long periods of time.The findings didn’t come as a surprise to many of the staff at The Firs, some of whom had been raising concerns for months. One care worker, who asked to remain anonymous, said in the four years they had worked there only two fire drills were carried out.“It was scary. No one knew how to get the residents downstairs if there was a fire,” they said. “The whole time I was there, we only had two fire drills and we failed both of them – and we didn’t get more training on it.”Another care worker, Megan O’Neill, said she had been pressed into taking on medication duties due to staff shortages, but wasn’t given proper training.“I was just chucked into it. I didn’t really feel comfortable about it and they knew that,” she said. She claims she was unfairly dismissed when she left a shift early due to poor mental health exacerbated by the pressure of providing medication without training, and later reported her concerns to the CQC.Another care worker said one person was given double the amount of morphine they should have received and it was simply “brushed under the carpet”.View image in fullscreenNutritional and hydration needs, staffing, equipment, fire safety and governance were all found to be lacking at The Firs care home.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianAcross the country there are concerns that increasing strain on the care home industry is leading to deteriorating levels of care, and could lead to more emergency closures.“Seeing this CQC report, it’s horrendous, but some of it is stuff that we’re hearing quite often every day,” said Helen Wildbore, the director of Care Rights UK, which runs a national advice line for older people with care issues.“Closed cultures and institutionalisation is on the increase. Staff don’t have the time and the resources to give personalised care. And that is having an impact on people not being able to live with dignity, basic rights being breached and relatives experiencing anxiety, more stress and unnecessary trauma.”Staff shortages, a lack of funding and the rise in national insurance contributions were all playing their part in pushing the sector to breaking point, Wildbore said. She added that failures by the CQC, which the health secretary, Wes Streeting,described as “not fit for purpose” last year, were exacerbating the situation and leaving poor care unchecked for long periods of time.“They’re supposed to be setting minimum standards and making sure they’re there, but they can only do that if they’re responding when people raise concerns and actually crossing that threshold to see with their own eyes what’s happening,” she said.The Firs was previously rated “requires improvement” at its last full CQC inspection in February 2021, four years before the one that led to its closure, with many family members questioning why it took so long for it to revisit when there were known issues.“How did it get to this? Why didn’t the CQC intervene earlier?” said Gillespie.The Firs has been contacted for comment.James Bullion, the CQC’s interim chief inspector of adult social care and integrated care, said: “Following an inspection in April 2025 of The Firs care home in Lowdham, we took action to suspend the registration of the home for three months following concerns we had around safety, care planning and oversight of the service.“We have since been informed that the provider has gone into liquidation. We are considering if any further action needs to be taken. Care homes are people’s homes and everyone living there deserves to be treated with dignity and respect–and to be listened to. We will continue to hold providers to account where we find this is not the case.”Explore more on these topicsHealthCare Quality Commission (CQC)NottinghamshireOlder peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I felt like a little girl, crying and being comforted by my grandmother one last timeSharnee RawsonSat 7 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 16.03 EDTShareIn their final moments, Ron and Irene lay together in a single bed, soft smiles on their faces. They wore special shirts picked out for the occasion; his a cranky cockatoo print, and hers the same white and floral print blouse she wore to their 70th wedding anniversary a few months previously.The only sign of what was to come were the twin cannulas, one in each of their intertwined hands, with long thin tubes winding back behind the beds and out of sight.It had felt like an eternity to get here – the reality closer to three weeks – with countless possible pitfalls. But it was about to happen. Ronald and Irene were about to get their final wish; to die peacefully together.My grandparents met in South Hurstville in the 1950s. Irene defied her father’s wishes and married at just 19. As the youngest of seven, she was expected to remain in the family home and care for her sickly mother. Ron, whose parents and older siblings migrated from London in the early 1930s, met her through a friend, and was smitten from first sight.View image in fullscreenSmitten from first sight. Irene and Ron on their wedding dayThe courtship was fast, but the love endured. They had four children in Sydney before moving the family unit to Port Macquarie in the 1960s. My mum speaks so warmly about her childhood, growing up on the banks of the Hastings River, days of sandy feet and salty hair. Streets where they knew the names of every neighbour, and afternoons spent prying oysters off river rocks to slurp down.In the decades between my mother’s childhood and my own, my grandparents travelled Australia in a caravan, with long stints in Perth, Katherine and wherever else took their fancy. In the 1990s, they bought a small hobby farm in Unumgar, inland dairy country on the Queensland-New South Wales border. By this point, they had five grandchildren and set about turning the property into a kids’ paradise. Ultimately they moved back to Port Macquarie, to spend their twilight years with the wider family.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsI can’t remember the first time my grandparents told me that they wanted to end their lives together. I felt like I’d always known, and to my surprise so did many others. In the lead up to them accessing voluntary assisted dying, we learned that they’d said it early and often to many people.Fiercely proud, Irene had nursed all her siblings through their final stages, seeing first-hand how painful the end of our lives can be. It was at least 10 years ago that she told me, vehemently, that when it was her time, she wanted to go her own way.Fate took away her sight first, with glaucoma making her almost totally blind, and then saddled her with a hideously cruel degenerative spinal condition. She’d lose dexterity and feeling in her hands and feet first, as her nerves were slowly crushed by the crumbling spinal discs, eventually leading to paralysis. She was tougher than an old boot, and barely let any of us see her pain – wrestling with my toddler even at the age of 90.View image in fullscreenRon was crystal clear and adamant – he did not want to live without his loveIn April, when the nerve damage turned into dysphagia and she could no longer eat, she decided it was time.“I’m done,” she said. “I’ve done everything I wanted to. I am ready to go.”NSW was the last state to legalise voluntary assisted dying, coming into effect in 2023. Each state has slightly different requirements, and it remains illegal in both the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. Eligibility is strict; in NSW, a person must make three requests (two verbal, one written), be assessed by two separate physicians and a board, and, crucially, suffer from a terminal illness that is expected to cause death within six months. In the first seven months oflegalised VAD in NSW, 1,141 people initiated a first request to access VAD and 398 patients died via the service.Irene’s first assessment was tense. It was unclear whether the spinal condition would qualify as a terminal illness. Ron, overcome by the situation and his own myriad health problems, had a severe panic attack. These attacks were frequent, incapacitating him mentally and physically. One of the medical staff commented that he’d likely qualify easier than my Nan – and the room stood still.It felt like an obvious choice. A period of wonderment – would they really get their wish? Ron was crystal clear and adamant. He did not want to live without his love. They were ready to write the final chapter of a love story spanning seven decades.The next few weeks were incredibly stressful. They each had three stages to pass, in quick succession, with their primary physician walking a thin line in balancing medications to keep them comfortable without ever impairing their ability to make a clear choice. Any perceived impairment or loss of mental ability could disqualify them. For people in their 90s, that could be triggered by something as simple as a fever.My grandparents took it in their stride, instituting a daily happy hour – longtime friends and family could drop by from 4pm, for a last glass of “bubbles”. Miraculously, Irene’s dysphagia seemed to not include Australian sparkling wine.It was like a farewell tour, as they laughed and cried, treating nearly every visitor to their own rendition of Willie Nelson’sOn the Road Again, which they’d sing together with a smile, anticipating their final adventure together. My aunt made a last-minute, multi-leg journey from Western Australia to hold her parents’ hands one last time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

It had only been a few months earler that we’d celebrated their 70th anniversary in the rec room, with balloons and a giant slab cake. A volunteer played the guitar, and my grandfather crooned Too Young by Nat King Cole over the microphone. Despite this, they were unwavering and emphatic in their decision. They had a wonderful life, they had done everything they had ever wanted, and it was time to go.View image in fullscreenRon and Irene had a wonderful life, they had done everything they had ever wantedOnce the NSW Voluntary Assisted Dying Board passed that final approval, the date was set. Arrangements were made. Final meals were requested; honey king prawns for him, spring rolls for her, from one of Port Macquarie’s many Chinese-Australian restaurants.I have no idea how my mother, their primary carer and an absolute saint, managed the process of orchestrating not only the death of both her parents, but also wrangling all five of us grandkids together from across Australia. Even with the approvals in place, there were still hurdles to jump. There were last-minute psychological evaluations. Anecdotally, we’d been told only half of VAD cases actually go through with it – data from the states puts the number closer to 30-35%. What if one of them changed their mind at the last minute?The night before the final day, we all gathered in my parent’s Port Macquarie house, sitting around the table with our Nan and Pop for one last meal. A blur of tears and laughter. Holding my Nan’s soft wrinkled hand, and her convincing me that this is what they wanted. I felt like a little girl, crying and being comforted by my grandmother one last time.In a way, I felt as though I had pre-grieved, particularly when I took my husband and two boys to say farewell two weeks earlier. My three-year-old climbed up on my Pop’s lap to share his plastic insect collection, and they talked at length about grasshoppers versus praying mantises. My Nan toggled her head around until she found the one pinpoint in her vision that still worked, fixed it on my husband, and told him to look after me. I could tell that day that they were so sure, so strong in their decision. They would never go back, not knowing it was what the other one wanted. They told me my boys were special, and destined for great things, and in that moment I broke.View image in fullscreenIt happened in a room full of love, with smiles on their faces and without any pain at allMaybe that’s why on the day I could be strong. The “event”, as we called it, was scheduled for 10.30, and we started assembling in their room from 9.30am. My dad opened bottles of champagne, and we all had our final bubbles together. The kitchen staff of their assisted living facility wheeled in a trolley laden with finger sandwiches, caramel slices and tea and coffee provision. Willie Nelson played. It felt like a party. It was a party.Both my grandparents chose to die via medical assistance, rather than self-administer, requiring four medical personnel in the room. The two doctors shepherded us through the process with an endless amount of patience, empathy and care. They gently told us it was time, and Irene laid down next to Ron on the bed. The cannulas went in, the cords winding back and away, so the doctors could step back and allow us to be by their sides.Ron and Irene held hands. The music changed to a soft version of You Are My Sunshine.I sat next to my Pop and held his other hand, while my Mum, brother and cousins surrounded my Nan on the other side. I whispered the first line of a favourite childhood story, and he smiled, picking up and taking over, telling it to me one last time.My Nan made a highly inappropriate joke – terrifying us that it would be her last words – before chuckling, and saying: “Here I go – love you all.”And then it happened. Calmly, quickly, with dignity. In a room full of love, with smiles on their faces and without any pain.We’d been told that hearing was the last sense to go, so we repeated I love you, I love you, I love you, until we were sure that they’d finally slipped away.Explore more on these topicsHealthAssisted dyingAgeingDeath and dyingAged careFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The vehicles were a huge technological leap forward that caused asensationwhen rolled out on the battlefields (“astonishing our soldiers no less than they frightened the enemy”, as theManchester Guardian put it) and helped tip the scales in favour of the allies’ eventual victory.Mother was a unique and hugely important piece of military and technological history. But withpeople across Britain donatingtheir railings, saucepans and even keys for the war effort, there was no room for sentiment. Mother was surrendered to the scrappers to be melted down and recycled.Or was she? For decades, rumours persisted at Bovington Camp that to save it from being scrapped, “the Mother of all tanks” had instead been secretly buried somewhere in the military base. Now, an army officer isplanning an archaeological surveyto search for the mythical tank after finding a historical letter that suggests the rumours are true.View image in fullscreenA British Mark I tank, the first military vehicle of its kind, in France in November 1916.Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty ImagesStaff Sgt Anthony Sherritt, a tank commander with the Royal Armoured Corps, came across the mystery of what happened to Mother several years ago when listening to a podcast; intrigued by the rumours, he began scouring military records in his free time for evidence of what really happened.He traced the source of the rumours to a former foreman at the British army’sTank Museum, which is based at Bovington Camp, who would frequently tell visitors that his father had been part of the team that hid the prototype. But still, there was no proof.Then, last summer, Sherritt came across a letter written by an officer called Lt Col NM Dillon about the wartime activities of a friend who had been based at Bovington, Maj Bill Brannon. One day, wrote Dillon, Brannon had “found the scrap metal staff beginning to demolish some of the old tanks”. After waiting for the scrappers to stop at midday for lunch, “Bill organised a towing tank and pulled four of the oldest tanks and buried them in the driving area. These four included Mother.”It was a eureka moment for Sherrett, who called a small group of fellow enthusiasts, buzzing with the news. “I was super-excited, calling everyone – [saying] ‘Look, I found this,’” he says. “And they couldn’t believe it.”Burying a tank in your lunch break may seem no small feat, but the expansive driver training area would have been full of enormous pre-dug holes, says Sherritt, to allow trainees to practise driving the vehicles in rough terrain. But even if Mother was buried, the next challenge is finding her. Bovington Camp stretches to404 hectares(1,000 acres), and even the section Sherrett has identified as the wartime training area, not in the same spot as today, is enormous.“It’s a kilometre squared, and that’s a huge piece of land,” Sherrett says. Now a patch of restricted heathland, it’s not as if he can just wander around with a metal detector. “It was used for driver training for 100 years so it’s covered in metal. Back in the day, they probably didn’t really care about any environmental issues and were just littering everywhere” – potentially including unexploded ammunition.View image in fullscreen‘Mother’ is buried somewhere in a square kilometre of land at Bovington Camp, Dorset.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianUndeterred, Sherrett has spent a year petitioning defence authorities to be allowed survey the area; with that permission secured, he iscrowdfundingto commission archaeologists to start the search later this autumn. Lidar (light detection and ranging) scans have already identified five spots that hint at a large object buried underground.According to Chris Price, the director of the Tank Museum, finding Mother “would be a mic drop moment in the tank world. Jaws hitting the floors everywhere.“There’s every possibility that it won’t be found – but it would be a wonderful thing to find, a wonderful mystery to be solved and given to everyone around the world.”“It would be insane,” agrees Sherrett. “Because it’s not just a tank. It’s everything else that she [led] to, the machine that broke the stalemate in world war one. There were no [battlefield] tanks before her.“I joke with the Tank Museum all the time, saying ‘You’ll have to make space to put her in there,’ because currently, all they have for her is a drawing.”Explore more on these topicsFirst world warArchaeologyMilitaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when she died, no one seemed to take my grief seriouslyFriends know you differently from family, but where do you sit in the pecking order after they die? Below immediate relatives, ahead of a cousin, behind a workmate?Tiff BakkerSat 7 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareIdon’t remember a time in my life when Chrissy wasn’t in it. We were born 11 days apart and were both one when our families moved on to the same street in Geelong, a port city an hour south-west of Melbourne. We had a very Australian childhood; summers spent in our bathers, running through sprinklers; swimming in back yard pools; eating sausages in bread on New Year’s Eve, when we were allowed to stay up late while our parents drank cask riesling with the neighbours, and we’d lie on the cool evening grass listening to crickets.During those blisteringly hot summer days of our childhood, we lived at the beach, where shark alarms were constant and the waves dangerous. Occasionally, Chrissy would paddle out on her inflatable red and blue raft to the big waves out the back where the serious surfers were. Sometimes, I’d panic when I’d lose sight of her, only to see her come rolling in on a massive wave, perched on top, laughing her head off. She was fearless.But I did lose her, five decades later. When Chrissy died at 51, I discovered a new and terrifying grief: that for a best friend. It was shocking, painful and incredibly lonely. Friends know you differently from family, but where do you sit in the pecking order? Below immediate family, ahead of a cousin, behind a current workmate?View image in fullscreenChrissy (on left) and Tiff in 2001.Photograph: courtesy of Tiff BakkerOur lives began together and the sheer amount of time spent with each other – the years of conversations and experiences, silly and serious – gave our friendship depth and meaning. Chrissy knew me in a way nobody else ever will. She saw me through experiences no one else ever knew about, not even my family. So why is it so hard to talk about the specific pain of losing a friend?Though we’d spent most of our childhood and early 20s together, Chrissy and I diverged in our mid-20s when I moved cities and, eventually, countries, to America. But despite the distance, our friendship remained strong, rooted in a shared history. We were like branches on an old tree that had grown in and around each other.“I’ve got a damned brain lesion,” Chrissy had messaged from Melbourne while I was on the runway at LAX in Los Angeles, about to fly home to New York after a raucous weekend celebrating a friend’s birthday. “It’s happened so fast. I have to go straight into hospital to get it removed, so I don’t know if it’s straightforward and they just get it or if I need follow-up treatment,” she’d written.“I just wanted to let you know the bad news rollercoaster is still taking rides,” she’d added, referring to my wife, Mika, who’d been successfully treated for breast cancer a few years before. “But they said it’s in a good spot and they can access it, so I’m feeling OK.”I felt like the wind had been knocked out of me as the plane began taxiing down the runway.“Sorry this is a message,” she’d ended, betraying a deeper anxiety. “I reckon I’d cry too much if I called you.”Chrissy’s initial surgery didn’t go well; the surgeons couldn’t get to all of the tumour and a leak on her brain left her in intensive care for weeks, with a drain in her skull. Friends sent voice messages and songs that reminded us of her. (Mine were Friday I’m in Love by the Cure, Modern Love by David Bowie and Eye of the Tiger by Survivor – she loved the Rocky movies.)Chrissy was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, which has a survival time of 12-18 months. When she was discharged from hospital after five horrific brain surgeries, she was given a brief respite before going straight into radiation and chemotherapy. Talking was hard, so we would message and she’d put on a brave face and say she was “doing as best as I can be”. She made jokes about her “crazy hair”, half-shaved because of the drain in her head. She refused to cut it purely to annoy the people who kept asking why she didn’t. The tumour (“the fucking toomer,” she called it, using a Schwarzenegger-Terminator accent, which made us laugh) was aggressive, but she remained optimistic.What is the appropriate course of action when your oldest friend is dying in another country? Is one trip enough? Five?I flew to Australia to see her, catching a train from our home town to Melbourne where Chrissy lived with her British husband, Kev, and two teenage children. I looked out at the steel-grey skies and low winter sun reflecting off the paddocks, making them a deep golden as troops of kangaroos sat on their hind legs, affronted by the train speeding past. I held my overnight bag to my chest and thought about what I would say to her.Kev met me on the platform while Chrissy waited in the car. When she saw me, she got out slowly, laughing, before the tears came and I held her close to my chest. She felt so fragile, I had to swallow a sob.We went out for Vietnamese food and talked with Chrissy’s kids about TikTok videos, the aerial silks classes her daughter was taking, and part-time jobs. I looked round the packed restaurant and wondered how people could sit there, eating, drinking and laughing, enjoying their lives, while my friend was dying.Chrissy is that friend who is embedded in every important memory in your life: she was there through primary school, high school and university – where we did the same degree and lived in each other’s pockets. After graduation, when I did what every other wide-eyed Australian has done for generations before me and moved to London on a working holiday (and, yes, I did land in Earl’s Court), Chrissy and Kev called in to see me while they backpacked around Europe.When I returned to Australia, Chrissy often took up residence on my old brown velvet couch, and when I moved to New York she made the trip across the Pacific a few times, most memorably for my wedding, where she commandeered the dancefloor until the early hours.But the most vivid memories I have are of early childhood. The slumber parties where we’d stay up watching The Empire Strikes Back in my parents’ wood-panelled, brown-carpeted rumpus room, when we would cocoon ourselves in piles of blankets and pillows, waking up to morning cartoons and my mum cooking us bacon on toast with Worcestershire sauce.View image in fullscreenChrissy (centre) and Tiff (on right) with their friend Andrea at Tiff’s house around 1982 …View image in fullscreen… and their band, Chipmunk Punk, at Andrea’s house in 1981 (Tiff on drums, Chrissy in blue). Photographs: courtesy of Tiff BakkerShe was a natural at sport and every game we played felt like it had a grand slam title at stake. Her strength and agility, always so apparent, made it difficult to see her so depleted now. The endless cycles of radiation and chemotherapy she had undertaken in the hope they would extend her life were brutal. The steroids she was given to mitigate the side-effects of the “chemo bombs” made her ravenous, but she found it hard to eat, and the keto diet the doctors put her on to slow the growth of the tumour made her excruciating headaches worse.She apologised for “being a burden”. “I don’t want to die,” she said. We’d had intense conversations before – in the early 90s, she was among the few people I had told I was gay – but this one threw me. “I know,” I said, adding hopefully but pitifully that the treatments “could still shrink the tumour” and give her more time.We’d go for short walks on Williamstown Beach in Melbourne, where she had liked to swim and take her rescue dog, Polly, for a run. She took me to her favourite bakery – in a former textile factory – where I ordered the sausage roll and custard doughnut. She had the Reuben pastrami sandwich and key lime pie. “I know you can probably get better ones in New York,” she’d said. “But I love them.”She tired quickly and needed to lie down. I walked her home the few blocks from where we had eaten lunch; the unsaid hanging in the air between us that she couldn’t go anywhere alone because her balance was affected by the tumour and she could fall or, worse, have a seizure. She hated being dependent on anyone. “This fucking toomer,” she said, trying to smile as we walked slowly along her street in the bright winter sun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But when Chrissy became ill, people seemed to either interrogate me about how deep our friendship really was or avoid the situation – I even felt a vibe from some of, “Why are you making such a meal of this?”Some friendships were damaged. When I told one friend of 20-plus years I was flying home to Australia to see Chrissy as she was dying, he said, “Jesus, I’m so sorry,” before moving on to tell me about some dramas he was having at work. He never asked me about it again.A colleague spoke about the death of a friend’s father. “He’s had to fly home – it’s your worst nightmare,” she said after I’d returned to New York from seeing Chrissy for the last time. When I got back to work, my boss never mentioned it and we just carried on as normal, as if my month off had been a jolly holiday.Some people asked about Chrissy once, and you could almost hear the sigh of relief vibrating through subsequent conversations when they could go back to talking about holidays, parties, work. Some friends, at least, were honest. “I’m sorry. I’ve wanted to message,” a good friend who’d known Chrissy in our early 20s texted. “But I didn’t know what to say.”I rang a close friend of 15 years to let her know that there was a possibility I might have to fly back to Australia and not be in New York to help her through a medical procedure, suggesting she put a Plan B in place, in case I had to leave quickly. “Of course you’re backing out,” she said, clearly annoyed, which left me speechless.“Why aren’t you there already? She’s still alive,” she said, which felt very much like an accusation. “Why would you wait for the funeral?”View image in fullscreenAt Chrissy’s house in May 2024 (Tiff on right).Photograph: courtesy of Tiff BakkerWhen I said goodbye to Chrissy in Melbourne (we’d cried and said we’d “see each other soon”), I had known I likely wouldn’t see her again, but I’d made peace with that decision. I also knew I would go back for her funeral – not just to celebrate her, but for myself as well, and to be among friends and family. But my friend’s comments made me doubt myself. What is the appropriate course of action to take when your oldest friend is dying in another country? Is one trip enough? Should I have gone five times? Should I have moved back to Australia?Even if I’d wanted to go and sit by her bedside for a month, there were barriers that stopped me from doing what I wanted to do because when you work on contract as a journalist, a dying friend doesn’t merit the involvement of HR. There was also the crushing sense brought on by some of those around me that a dying friend didn’t warrant the grief I felt.“We have socially constructed templates for losing a parent, a child or a life partner, but the lack of social templates in the death of a friend plays a big role in isolating people in their grief,” says Rebecca Sokoll, a New York-based relationship therapist. “If I tell someone my mother has died, they immediately reflect back their own understanding over a type of suffering that is established. The response to the loss of a friend is not established, and that requires people to listen and to understand, and few people are going to truly know they need to do that.” ​​In hindsight, I think I craved some kind of acknowledgment over what I was losing; that I shouldn’t need to explain or justify my grief around a 50-year friendship and how devastating that was.Two days before Chrissy died, I spoke to her on FaceTime. By then, she was mostly asleep but, in a kind and moving gesture, Kev put headphones on her so I could speak to her in private. I told her I loved her; what she and our friendship had meant to me. She frowned slightly and moved her mouth as if to speak, before exhaling deeply and going further into sleep. The memories of our friendship had been ours and now they were mine. I promised her I would remember all the stories for her kids. Kev kissed her hands for me – hands I would know anywhere – and I said goodbye, almost a year to the day since she had been diagnosed.Mika, a teacher, asked for bereavement leave to fly with me to Melbourne, which was denied because Chrissy did not qualify as a direct family member. The New York City Department of Education gives its employees four days off for deaths in the immediate family, plus an extra travel day if the funeral is outside New York. Mika, who had her own special relationship to Chrissy over the 15 years she’d known her, watched online as I gave a eulogy.Istill talk to Chrissy (God, she loved a chat!) but the loneliness I’ve felt since her death has been painful. Her absence has made me question other relationships in my life. Some I once considered strong have fallen by the wayside. Others have been reignited and some have flourished unexpectedly.None of us will escape the devastation of losing a close friend. I can only say, cherish those relationships, nurture them and protect them. I thought Chrissy and I would know each other when we were 80, still talking about music and still eating strawberry doughnuts, but she wasn’t afforded the privilege of growing old.The 10 rules of friendship: show up, go beyond banter, learn the boring detailsRead moreA couple of weeks after her funeral, I went for a swim at Ocean Grove, a rugged beach on the Victorian coastline near my parents’ house, a haven for surfers, seals and, occasionally, great whites. It was an uncommonly hot November day but the ocean still had a chill, the waves were enormous and the current was strong.I inched in deeper and deeper, sucking in air from the chill, hopping from one foot to the other as the cold of the ocean rode its way up my back. Beside me, a group of teenage girls had run full throttle into the water, screaming and laughing at the shock of the cold. Without fear, they had dived straight under the waves, emerging still laughing and clinging to each other. When did I get so timid? Once – like those girls – I would’ve gone straight under, brazen and unafraid.On the horizon, a monster set of waves started to rise, rolling in so quickly that I had a second to decide – go over or go under. There was only one course of action. I breathed deeply and went down into the water as low as I could go, fighting against the washing machine-like cycle of the ocean, which thrashed me around for what felt like an eternity. I knew I couldn’t resurface because there’d be another wave right behind it before the swell could reset and calm itself ahead of the next rising onslaught. I held on until my lungs felt as if they were about to burst when, finally, the endless churn started to subside, and I could come up for air.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFriendshipDeath and dyingBereavementfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’ll have to forgive the cliche, because it’s literally true. The author ofThe Anxious Generation, an urgent warning about the effect of digital tech on young minds, is based at New York University’s business school: “I’m around all these corporate types and we’re always talking about companies and their mission statements,” he tells me. So, he decided to make one for himself. “It was very simple: ‘My mission is to use my research in moral psychology and that of others to help people better understand each other, and to help important social institutions work well.’”This is characteristic of Haidt: there’s the risk that writing your own brand manifesto might seem a bit, well, pompous. What comes across instead is the nerd’s desire to be as effective as possible, combined with the positive psychologist’s love of self-improvement (one of his signature undergraduate courses is called Flourishing, which sets students homework such as “catch and analyse 10 automatic thoughts”).He is in London for a week or so and we meet in the deserted cocktail bar of a grand hotel off Whitehall at 8am (the early start makes me feel as if I’m being dragged into the orbit of a fearsome productivity routine). He speaks softly as a result of a vocal cord injury, which adds to an impression of scholarly courtesy – punctuated by bursts of excitement when he talks about, say, Socrates or the US constitution.It also belies the fact that he’s written a monster bestseller, and is now a busy campaigner. The Anxious Generation, out in paperback, follows books on happiness, political polarisation and campus culture wars. It’s an evidence-based but thoroughly mission-driven call to action: smartphones, he argues, are largely responsible for a collapse in young people’s mental health since 2010. The gloomy picture takes in increased anxiety, depression, even self-harm and suicide (with hard indicators such as an uptick in emergency room admissions for self-inflicted injuries meaning that it can’t be down to increased “awareness” or diagnosis creep). There are ways out of the mess, Haidt says, but time is limited, particularly if we want to avert the even greater threat posed by AI.View image in fullscreenJonathan Haidt.Photograph: Hayley BenoitThe book has sold 1.7m copies in 44 languages, capturing the attention of a different anxious generation – parents thankful they were born too early for the phone-based childhoods Haidt describes in dispiriting detail, but desperate for guidance now they have children of their own. His statement of the problem, and straightforward advice on what to do about it, has convinced policymakers, too. In Australia, where aban on social media for under-16swill take effect later this year, his work has changed the law. The wife of the politician who helped design the legislation was reading The Anxious Generation in bed, Haidt told one interviewer, “and she turns to him and says: ‘You’ve got to read this book, and then you’ve got to effing do something about it.’” The day before we meet, he attended a session in parliament organised by the crossbench peer Beeban Kidron, whose rules to protect children’s privacy on social media became part of the 2018 Data Protection Act (“she has been a force of nature”). And he’s in touch with UK government ministers as well: “I won’t mention names. I will be talking to a couple by Zoom.”So what is his prescription to reverse, or at least treat, what he calls the Great Rewiring of children’s lives? He sets out “four norms” that parents, and society at large, should adopt: no smartphones before the age of 14; no social media until 16; phone-free schools; and far more unsupervised play and childhood independence. Although The Anxious Generation has largely been seen as a book about digital devices, it’s as emphatic about that last point. Boomers, gen Xers and even millennials enjoyed plenty of free play outside when crime rates were much higher than they are now. Modern parents, exposed to a diet of constant bad news, are more paranoid. This stunts development, reducing the opportunity to learn skills such as cooperation and conflict resolution, to overcome fears and, well, to have fun.Essentially, he argues, we’re guilty of overprotection in one place (the real world) and underprotection in another (online). “I think that was one of the important points ofAdolescence,” he says, referencing the Netflix show that dramatised the influence of the “manosphere” on teenage boys. “We all freaked out in the 90s about the outside world. We all thought our kids are in danger if they’re not in our sight, and so we’ve stopped letting them out, and we thought: well, as long as they’re on computers, that’s good. They’ll learn to program. They’ll start a company. One of the poignant moments in [the show] was when the parents said: ‘We thought he was safe. He was just up in his room.’”The four norms look simple enough on paper. But what about the fiendish reality of enforcing them, particularly if your children are already extremely online? “What I found in the year since the book came out is that parents with young children love it,” Haidt says. “They’re excited, like: yes, we’re going to do this. Whereas parents of teenagers have more mixed reactions, for exactly the reason that all of us are already so deeply into this.”Haidt has two children of his own with artist and photographer Jayne Riew: a girl of 15 and a boy of 18. “The advice that I give to parents of teenagers is, if you recently gave your child a smartphone or social media, you can take it back. Give them a flip phone, a brick phone, a dumb phone. The key is you want your kids to be able to communicate with their friends, but you don’t want to give them over to for-profit companies [whose] goal is to hook your child.”“Now, if your kids are 15 or 16 and their entire social lives are on Instagram and Snapchat, it would be very painful to cut them off,” he says, “because they’ll experience that as social death. So the key strategy … is to help them take back their attention by creating large parts of the day where they’re not on it.” Ban devices in the bedroom, push for phone-free schools, do everything you can to expand the window of time spent away from addictive tech.Human consciousness is being changed at an industrial scaleBack in 2019, when he was laying down ground rules for his own children, the evidence pointed to social media as the greater evil, particularly for girls. So he banned that, rather than phones per se. “My daughter says she’s the only person in her high school who doesn’t have Snapchat.” Isn’t he worried about her being left out? “Her friends have compensated for it. They say when there’s something important going on that she needs to know about, they’ll text her so she’s not entirely out of the loop, and it’s been great, because she is really involved in the real world. She runs track, she does sewing and makes clothing.” Even so, he would do things slightly differently now: “The rule I wish I had followed was no screens in the bedroom, ever. My kids seem to need their computers and their phones more than they would have if I’d had a better policy.”Haidt clearly loves his job, and sets great store by what he regards as the truth-telling function of academic research. But with the book’s success, is there a risk he morphs into a kind of activist? Yes, he concedes, though he doesn’t seem unhappy about it. “Once I came to realise the full extent of what is happening to literally hundreds of millions of children – I mean, human consciousness is being changed at an industrial scale – and the fact that AI is not yet entangled in our world, but in two years it will be very hard to do anything – I [felt] a kind of a campaigner’s zeal to get this done, to get the norms changed this year.”When I mention a colleague who hears from her kids that “everyone does their homework using ChatGPT” he nods, and says “this is a potentially unsolvable problem for education. Like all teachers, we’re struggling to figure out what to do. It makes it easy for everyone to do their homework, but students need to learn how to dohardthings.”Does his newfound zeal mean it’s harder for him to admit he might be wrong? To give counterarguments their due? “Oh, yeah, I suffer from confirmation bias like everyone else. I have a whole book on confirmation bias, practically [2012’sThe Righteous Mind]. And so that’s why one thing that we’ve done from the very beginning is seek out contradictory views, talk to our critics, have them publish on the Substack.” Haidt, with researcher Zach Rausch, maintains a running commentary on the evidence base for the Great Rewiring atafterbabel.com. There, he posts “responses to sceptics” who question the link between screens and declining mental health. Some claim there are better explanations, such as Covid (though indicators of wellbeing started declining in 2010) or the climate crisis (though preteens, rather than more politically aware adolescents, seem to be particularly affected – the opposite of what you’d expect if climate worries were responsible).In March 2024, psychologist Candice Odgers wrote areviewof The Anxious Generation in Nature. She said: “Hundreds of researchers, myself included, have searched for the kind of large effects suggested by Haidt. Our efforts have produced a mix of no, small and mixed associations,” adding that “most data are correlative”. In other words: the problem may have coincided with the introduction of smartphones, but we can’t say that there’s a causal link. Odgers instead leans towards the idea that people with pre-existing problems use social media more, or in more destructive ways.Haidt comes out fighting, though, citing “dozens” of papers, including, for example, ameta-analysisof 26 studies that found the risk of depression increased by 13% for each extra hour spent on social media. “She accused me of not knowing the difference between correlation and causation. That has structured the debate ever since. And the strange thing about that review, I just looked back at it the other day, what I realised is there’s not a single word that indicates that she read past chapter one.” This seems hard to believe, but, Haidt says, “I had a long section in chapter six specifically titled ‘correlation versus causation’”. When I asked her to respond to this later, Odgers said: “The issue is not a failure to understand the distinction between correlation versus causation, it is the failure toapplythis understanding when making causal, and frankly damaging, claims about young people that will be heard by millions of people.”Companies have acknowledged that children are vulnerable in internal reports never intended for public consumptionOur conversation starts to go down a rabbit hole as Haid attempts to show me a long rebuttal document he’s writing on the five kinds of evidence of harm, with multiple subheadings, sections labelled “Exhibit A” etc. “I love debating and arguing, and that’s what drew me to academic life … but the accusation that I don’t understand the difference in correlation and causation, I guess that did get to me.”One important part of the puzzle, he says, is that companies have acknowledged that children are vulnerable in internal reports never intended for public consumption. Hecites one by TikTok, for example, admitting that the app was “popular with younger users who are particularly sensitive to reinforcement in the form of social reward and have minimal ability to self-regulate effectively”. When contacted by the Guardian, TikTok declined to comment.If the evidence is so strong, what does he think drives his critics? “I think some of them seem to be motivated by an admirable desire to defend the kids, to say, ‘Look, if this is what the kids are doing, we adults shouldn’t criticise’.” He claims that “some of the researchers are deep video gamers, and they went through this whole thing about ‘Do violent video games cause violence?’. So they seem especially primed to see everything as just a replay of previous moral panics.”I also wonder whether he’s got people’s backs up through his interventions in academic life, railing against what he sees as progressive overreach. His 2018 book with Greg Lukianoff,The Coddling of the American Mind, was based on an Atlantic piece of the same name, though it’s more careful and caveated than the title makes it seem (editor Don Peck zhuzhed it up from Arguing Towards Misery: How Campuses Teach Cognitive Distortions). The idea is that colleges have become highly risk-averse places, where students expect to be shielded from difficult ideas, and faculty and administrators live in fear of career-wrecking complaints based on offended sensibilities.There are many reasons for this turn, Haidt argues, some of which overlap with those set out in The Anxious Generation: overprotective parenting raising a generation of fragile, nervous kids, for one. He cites the expectation of good “customer service” driven by high tuition fees, and an administrative culture of “CYA” (cover your ass). But he also blames a lack of “viewpoint diversity” among faculty, leading to a moribund, timid intellectual environment and a failure to push back against overly empowered students.This argument hits a little differently in 2025, with the Trump administration carrying out an unprecedented assault on universities, and using “woke” culture on campus as its primary justification. Aletter sent by officialsmenacing Harvard specifically demands “viewpoint diversity in admissions and hiring”. Is it a case of be careful what you wish for? Or, more directly, did Haidt’s championing of this issue provide ammunition for the current war against academic independence?“I don’t think the fact that I’ve been calling for reform since 2011 should be used against me when the fact that therewasn’treform became a trigger for Donald Trump,” he says. Haidt believes the progressive monoculture that produced calls to, among other things, defund the police and abolish standardised tests alienated “normies” to the extent that Trump rode into office “on a wave of revulsion about what’s happening on campus and more broadly in society”. Surely inflation, the cost of living, played a larger role in voters’ rejection of the Democratic candidate? Haidt concedes that “it contributed”, but otherwise sticks to his guns in a way that, to me, suggests he’s a little too immersed in this particular debate to see thebigger picture. Which is not to say he isn’t outraged by the way things have unfolded. Still speaking softly and precisely, he unleashes the Haidtian version of a tirade.“Trump is a deeply unstable, narcissistic man who has a zero sum view of the world and a strong sense of vengeance. And now [he’s] using the power of the federal government and the department of justice to harass and harm his enemies … this is the most shocking transformation of America I’ve ever heard of. So while I have been a critic of schools like Harvard that, you know, was ranked as theworst university for free speechin the country … now everything is reversed.” He adds that “[Trump] is especially using antisemitism as a cudgel. I don’t think that’s his real motivation. And while I have always stood for the value of viewpoint diversity, so I think President Trump is not wrong to call for it, I’ve also always stood against government micromanaging what universities do.”In The Coddling … Haidt declared himself “a centrist who sides with the Democratic party on the great majority of issues” and said that he had never voted Republican for Congress or the presidency. More recently, he stated: “I was always on the left. Now, I’m nothing. I’m not on any team.” Either way, he has undoubtedly annoyed progressives who take a more instinctively tribal approach. A contrarian by nature, he also sees that instinct as an essential part of any intellectual’s toolkit. His postdoc supervisor, cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder, modelled “an incredible playfulness with ideas and a joy in intellectual perversity, which means his dictum was: if someone asserts it, deny it and see how that goes. And if someone denies it, assert it and see how that goes.”Does that make him a bit irritating? “Oh, yes, it does,” he says, without a trace of offence. That’s the point: “The founding story of the academic world is Socrates being a gadfly.” Does it ever bleed into his personal life? “My wife and I have long had a conflict of truth versus beauty, and in my view, she is willing to sacrifice truth for beauty. I have to have a footnote for everything. There has to be a source for everything. And that sometimes makes me annoying to her.”“Carried to excess it [has] the risk of know-it-allism, and I’ve been accused of that by my wife – and several ex-girlfriends. So yeah, I think my strengths are also my weaknesses. The same is true for everyone.”The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt – a pocket full of poisonRead moreThe Anxious Generation started life as a different book about the corrupting effects of social media on democracy. After he’d written one chapter, Haidt realised that the scale and urgency of the problem faced by children and teens meant it would have to be about them instead. He still has plans to go back to the first idea, but given everything that’s happened, he’s taking two or three years “off” to support the movement he’s started (“I don’t have to drive it, I just have to help it along”). He says he’s optimistic – “very optimistic that we’re going to, if not fully solve it, make enormous progress – we already are.”This is energising, but I note that, when discussing “green shoots” of hope back in 2018, he welcomed the new, socially responsible approach taken by Facebook and Twitter, including the latter’s commitment to “increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation”. “Yeah, that died. That green shoot did not go very far,” he sighs. And in a follow-up exchange, he strikes an even darker note. I ask about the broader picture – as a student of societies, is he concerned about … the end of civilisation as we know it?Somewhat alarmingly for a man who first made his name in the Pollyanna-ish field of positive psychology, he really is. “I am extremely worried about social collapse,” he emails. “Technology always changes societies, and we are just beginning the biggest technological change in history. It will only speed up as AI becomes entangled in everything. So we are headed into very dangerous times, especially for liberal democracies that require some degree of shared facts, shared stories and trusted institutions.“This is part of the reason I feel such urgency to protect kids now, this year, 2025. The next two generations may face challenges beyond anything we can imagine. They need to be strong, competent and in control of their attention.”The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt is published by Penguin.

Well, you can! How tribute festivals ‘grew into a monster’More than 30 outdoor music events including Tribfest and Big Fake Festival are taking the UK by stormNadia KhomamiArts and culture correspondentSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 02.01 EDTShareMatt Blumberg launched the tribute festival, GlastonBarry, in 2013 as a way of doing something positive and joyful for his hometown of Barry, Wales.But what started as a local festival of 500 people is today a three-day event attended by an audience of 18,000. “It started off as a community incentive, and a bit of fun, and it quickly grew into a monster. It’s bonkers,” the former primary school teacher said.GlastonBarry – a play on Glastonbury – is one of more than 30 outdoor tribute festivals that have taken the UK by storm. Others include Glastonbudget, Tribfest, and Big Fake Festival, which showcase tribute acts such as Oasish, Antarctic Monkeys, Coldplace, Badness, the Fillers, Stereotonics and Blondied.According to The Entertainment Agents Association [TEAA], tickets for tribute festivals have been “on the rise” over the past five years.“These events have seen a significant growth in popularity, with some festivals having to move to larger venues due to increased popularity,” said Paul Winteridge, immediate past president of TEAA.This week, Steps star Ian “H” Watkins wasforced to change the name of his Cowbridge tribute festival, Cowchella– where the likes of Harry Styled UK and Got to be Taylor Swift are due to perform – after organisers of the famous California event made an official complaint.View image in fullscreenIan ‘H’ Watkins of Steps.Photograph: Dymond/Talkback Thames/ShutterstockWatkins said he viewed it as a “massive compliment that they feel like our little festival is a little bit of a threat to their ginormous, juggernaut of a machine”.Winteridge said the soaring costs of concerts were one of the reasons behind the popularity of tribute events, especially during a cost of living crisis. There was also a nostalgia factor, as well as the fact that theywere accessible for families.At GlastonBarry, weekend tickets cost £65, making it great value for money, said Blumberg, who founded Mack Events with his cousin – a former aeronautical engineer. “We cram it with 22 acts in two days, and there’s literally something for everyone, from Eminem to Bad Manners.“A lot of the acts we book, like Queen, Bob Marley or George Michael, are tributing people you’re never going to be able to see live again. We don’t take it seriously, we even encourage fancy dress. We get a lot of hen dos and stag dos, as well as families bringing their kids.”Although tribute acts have been around since the 1960s, modern advances in lighting, stage makeup and sound technology means musicians can look more authentic now.They can even become huge brands in their own right, like the Bootleg Beatles and Björn Again, who have been paying tribute to Abba longer than the original band were together.“In the early days, we would get a lot of people saying: ‘Why would you want to go and see fake bands? Book some real acts’,” Blumberg said. “But that’s changing.“Some of the bands we’ve had are honestly amazing, like Oasish. I’ve seen the real Oasis a few times, and Liam Gallagher stormed off stage and didn’t come back. They played their latest album rather than crowd favourites. Whereas the tribute acts get everyone singing along.”Oasish formed in 2004 and were voted the UK’s official No 1 Oasis tribute band by TEAA. Paul Higginson, who plays Liam Gallagher, has been in tribute bands since 1999, when he performed as Kelly Jones in Stereotonics.“We play about 80 to 90 gigs a year,” Higginson explained. “It’s become like breathing. As soon as the wig and parka go on, and I take the first step on to the stage, the shoulders go back, the chest comes out, and the chin goes up in the air. The swagger comes out all of a sudden.”Higginson compared his performance to acting on any West End stage. “You play your role, you sing your lines. I never take the character home with me.”View image in fullscreenAntarctic Monkeys at Mosfest, Sheffield in 2017.Photograph: Glenn Ashley/Famous/AvalonThe band were even asked to play at Wembley Stadium on the day of the 2013 FA Cup Final when Manchester City were playing Wigan. “We were in the hospitality bit. I’m stood there singing Wonderwall, and both Noel and Liam Gallagher were going up the escalator. They leaned over and started clapping and cheering.”Higginson said the difficulty in securing tickets for the Oasis reunion concerts had driven ticket sales for his band. “We do get a lot of people saying: ‘We couldn’t get tickets to see Oasis, so we’ll go see Oasish instead.’”When Ed Faulkner, a member of the Beautiful Couch (a Beautiful South tribute band) started Tribfest, one of the UK’s first tribute festivals, in 2007, it was a “massive gamble”.“It didn’t help that that was the year of the floods in Hull, and we were up to our waists in water. We lost a lot of money. But I had a vision.”Within a few years Faulkner’s dedication started to pay off. “We’ve seen a gradual increase in ticket sales over the years. We’re licensed for 5,000 people and we got about four and a half last year,” he said.“We can keep control of things other festivals can’t, like toilets, showers, and security. We get a lot of families coming for that reason. They don’t go to Leeds any more, they come to ours, because there’s nobody setting fire to tents at the end of the weekend.”If Glastonbury is the Waitrose of the music festival world, Faulkner added, “then we’re the Lidl. I suppose me and my daughter Dempsey [who helps organise the festival] are the Michael and Emily Eavis of the north.”Faulkner also commended the quality of current tribute acts. “When people come to see them they’re just blown away. It’s like they’ve landed on the moon.“I remember we had a Muse tribute band from Holland, who were used to playing little social clubs in and around Amsterdam, and the lead singer came off stage and went: ‘Wow, this is like our Olympic Games.’”Explore more on these topicsFestivalsPop and rockOasisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

HisYouTubechannel has 400 million subscribers. In this profile Mark O’Connell tries to grasp the scale of Donaldson’s role in modern popular culture:“I don’t intend to make a case here that you should start appreciatively watching Donaldson’s videos. I don’t intend to make a case for MrBeast as art – although I reserve the right to talk about it as though it were. I’m not even going to try to convince you that these videos are even necessarily good, whatever that might mean. But I do feel quite strongly that Donaldson is some type of genius – a prodigy of a form that, as degraded as it is, deserves to be taken seriously as one of the signature artefacts of our time.”Read more2.I crisscrossed America to talk to people whose views I disagreed with.

I’m sure you guys know,” said Gauff during her press conference. “But just to be able to be a representation of that and a representation of, I guess, people that look like me in America who maybe don’t feel as supported during this time period … just being that reflection of hope and light for those people.”Coco Gauff claims first French Open title after fightback floors Aryna SabalenkaRead more“I remember after the election and everything, it kind of felt like a down period a little bit, and my mom told me during Riyadh: ‘Just try to win the tournament just to give something for people to smile for.’ So that’s what I was thinking about today when holding that. And then seeing the flags in the crowd means a lot.“Some people may feel some type of way about being patriotic and things like that, but I’m definitely patriotic and proud to be American, and I’m proud to represent the Americans that look like me and people who kind of support the things that I support.”Gauff contested her first grand slam final aged 18 at the 2022 French Open, losing to Iga Swiatek, beforedefeating Sabalenka at the 2023 US Opento win her first grand slam title. She said that she struggled with anxiety and doubt in 2022, a complete contrast to the confidence she felt before this match.“I just remembered that ceremony when Iga won, I just remembered trying to take it all in and pay attention to every detail and just feel like I wanted that experience for myself,” said Gauff. “So when the anthem got played, I vividly remember watching her pretty emotional when the Polish anthem was played. I was, like, ‘Wow, this is such a cool moment’. So when the anthem got played today, I kind of had those reflections.“It was a tough time. I was doubting myself, wondering if I would ever be able to overcome it, especially my mentality going into that match. I was crying before the match and so nervous, and literally couldn’t breathe and stuff. I was, like: ‘If I can’t handle this, how am I going to handle it again?’ Then obviously the US Open happened, and now I just felt really ready today, and I was, like: ‘I’m just going to leave it all out there, and regardless of what happens, I can leave proud.’”View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka expressed her frustration in defeat.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesAfter also losing the Australian Open final this year in three sets to Madison Keys, Sabalenka is now 3-3 in grand slam finals. She did not hide her rage. Asked how Gauff made things difficult for her, Sabalenka credited her opponent’s framed shots and lambasted the windy conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yeah, it just hurts. Honestly hurts. I’ve been playing really well, and then in the last match, I go out there and perform like I did. That hurt,” she said.Speaking less than an hour after leaving the court, Sabalenka said she already knows plans for the next few days as she tries to get over this tough defeat: “I already have a flight booked to Mykonos and alcohol, sugar,” she said. “I just need a couple of days to completely forget about this crazy world and this crazy … if I could swear, I would swear right now, but this crazy thing that happened today.“And I couldn’t today.

No previousEnglandmanager has ever begun with three successive victories to nil, but Tuchel was clearly very unhappy with the performance.Harry Kane saves listless England’s blushes as Andorra frustrate TuchelRead more“I didn’t like the attitude how we ended the game,” he said. “I liked the attitude how we started the game. But I didn’t like the last half hour. I think we lacked urgency and seriousness you need in a World Cup qualifier. I didn’t like the body language and it was not what the occasion needed.”What made it all the more frustrating was that there had been no indication of that flatness in the days leading up to the game during warm-weather training in Spain. “They were enthusiastic and they showed that as a group when they were in the camp. When we started the game, the attitude was right. We wanted to play according to our principals and to the plan.“Matches like this can become awkward when you don’t score. It can be stuck. Then it’s necessary to not get frustrated, to do the little things right. I had the feeling after 25 minutes we were a bit frustrated with the little things and everybody tried different things. Then it becomes freestyle and it gets slower. Everyone wanted the ball in to feet, and nobody was speeding the game up with runs. You need contra-movements and runs and if you don’t invest it becomes a stuck game.”Tuchel acknowledged that fatigue at the end of the season might have been a factor, but was determined not to offer that as an excuse.“The window is the window, so no excuses. I think the clubs don’t like the window and for the national team also it’s not easy because the players are coming from a long season. We can and have to do better for the 90 minutes. We created an xG of 3 and underperformed with one goal. Normally in games like this you overperform the xG because of greater individual quality. But we didn’t. We lacked the energy. It’s the most honest thing to admit it and not talk around it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were underwhelmed and not happy with our performance. I don’t think we can blame them for that.”He said he was unaware of the offensive chanting about Keir Starmer. “If it happens, it is not acceptable, but I didn’t hear it,” he said.Fundamentally, though, this was a night of frustration. “It’s very hot here, dry pitch, probably similar conditions to next year at the World Cup,” said Kane. “We probably weren’t good enough on the ball – we kept giving it away, which gave them confidence and energy.

There is always a lot of emotion. That is both its appeal and why it is so difficult for those in the game to make decisions. Ange Postecoglou gave Tottenham one of the great nights in the club’s history whenthey won the Europa Leaguein Bilbao.A first trophy in 17 years. A first European trophy in 41. It’s easy to understand why the instinct is gratitude, to hope that somehow victory can be self-replicating, that silverware begets silverware and something fundamental in Tottenham’s being was transformed at San Mamés.Ange-ball was breath of fresh air but Europa League alone could not save him | David HytnerRead moreBut the question really shouldn’t be how you felt about Postecoglou at 11pm CET on 21 May, but how you felt at 9pm. It makes no sense for anybody to have changed their mind on whether Postecoglou should stay on the basis of a dreadful performance from Manchester United and a goal scrambled in off Luke Shaw’s arm.When Postecoglou said he always wins something in his second season, the underlying logic was that it takes that long for the players to absorb his principles and put them into practice. Was there any sense of that in the Europa League success? Did it feel Tottenham had slowly been building to that?On the contrary, the wins against Eintracht Frankfurtin the quarter-final, Bodø/Glimtin the semi-finaland then United in the final weren’t rooted in Angeball as we had come to understand it, but in sitting deep, playing without the ball and striking on the break. On the one hand, credit is due for adapting, albeit largely because the high-intensity football Postecoglou prefers became unsustainable with a squad of injured and exhausted players, but on the other that removes any argument that the Europa League win was the result of an ongoing process.View image in fullscreenSpurs fans embraced Ange Postecoglou winning a trophy but their Europa League glory did not suggest further success.Photograph: Chris Foxwell/ProSports/ShutterstockA case perhaps could be made that the new pragmatic Postecoglou would have prospered in the Premier League next season. He was unfortunate with injuries – while acknowledging the intensity of his style may have played a part in that crisis. He was dealing with a very young squad. But that requires a leap of faith Daniel Levy was not prepared to make. Who did not watch Paris Saint-Germainripping through Interin the Champions League and wonder with a shudder what that might look like against a Postecoglou defence in the Super Cup in August?Precedents in football should be treated with caution: there’s no reason to assume what happened with one particular manager at one particular club in one particular set of circumstances will necessarily repeat with a different manager at a different club in a different set of circumstances. But the memory of Erik ten Hag casts an unavoidable shadow: Spurs could not afford to find themselves in the position United did last October,sacking a managerthree months after allowing his ideas to shape summer spending and in effect writing off another season.Tottenham have their own precedents:Juande Ramos went eight monthsafter the2008 League Cup finalandMauricio Pochettinofive and half months afterthe 2019 Champions League final. Ramos’s side were bottom of the league, Pochettino’s 14th. Levy has experienced the cost of an autumn sacking.If there were doubts, best to act upon them; Levy signalled his intention fairly clearly in his programme notes for the final game of the season. And, for all Danny Blanchflower’s line that the game is about glory has been thrown at Spurs since the decision was taken, Postecoglou’s departure leaves the glory of Bilbao unsullied by future failure.There is a beauty in the simplicity of the narrative arc: glory at the last, delivering on the promise of a trophy in the second season (albeit a glory that owed a lot to having significantly more resources than most clubs in the competition). That Postecoglou was dismissed two years to the day afterhis appointmentwas announced underlined the sense of a cycle ending.View image in fullscreenDaniel Levy (right), the Tottenham chair, did not want to risk another mid-season sacking.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockThe question then is what comes next. Tottenham’s preference isfor somebody with Premier League experience, which is understandable enough. The league is uniquely relentless, as evidenced by Bruno Fernandes’s comment about Ruben Amorim’s surprise at how good Ipswich were. That presents particular pressures that cangrind managers down. It removes some of the risk to turn to a manager familiar with that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere is, though, always the fear that a manager cannot step up. The level of scrutiny, the expectations, at Tottenham are far greater than those at, say, Brentford or Fulham. Another autumn sacking must also haunt Levy:that of Nuno Espírito Santo, whose reign lasted 17 games over four months. He never seemed the right fit for the club and had been undermined by so obviously being not the first, or even the second or the third, choice for the role.Thomas Frank seems the preferred option, but that would require paying compensation to Brentford in excess of £10m. Levy is renowned for his willingness for protracted negotiations, but this is a case where swift resolution should take priority, even if it ends up costing a couple of million more than it might.‘A Spurs legend forever’: players hail Ange Postecoglou in wake of sackingRead moreAlready there has been some online grumbling that Spurs should not be appointing from Brentford, which is absurd given the job Frank has done (Brentford finished the season 10th on the 19th-highest wage bill in the Premier League) and how things turned out with the two big-name managers Tottenham have recently appointed, José Mourinho and Antonio Conte.But Postecoglou has left a problem for whoever succeeds him, both in terms of style and achievement. If the new manager starts slowly, there will be immediate grumbles that they are not building on the Europa League success and that the football is not so much fun as it was under Postecoglou, the 22 league defeats last season occluded by the gleam of silverware. Does a trophy win outweigh finishing fourth-bottom of the league?Perhaps that’s not the right question. Personnel decisions should be based less on what has been done than on what is likely to be done and Levy evidently saw Bilbao as a glorious blip rather than a harbinger of a spectacular future. On that logic, change was the only option.Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouInside footballTottenham HotspurAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Opening up alongside her skipper, Sophia Dunkley contributed 26 before being trapped leg-before by Karishma Ramharack, while Alice Capsey struck a quick-fire 20 from 11 balls at No 3, as England stormed to victory.England beat West Indies by nine wickets in rain-reduced third women’s ODI – as it happenedRead more“We’ve taken a lot of confidence from this,” Edwards said of her side’s first outing since their 16-0 Ashes thrashing last winter. “We’re under no illusions that we’re going to have tougher times ahead, but equally what I’m seeing already is that appetite for people to want to keep getting better because they’ve got to.“We want to be picking from a pool of 25 players which I genuinely think we are now. We’ve created [pressure] ourselves by competition for selection in county cricket, by going to county cricket and having to perform.”One notable absentee from the series was Sophie Ecclestone, who has been struggling with injury. On Saturday, the England and WalesCricketBoard confirmed in a statement that she is taking a break from domestic cricket “to manage a minor quad injury and prioritise her wellbeing”. She is expected to be available for the series against India, which begins at Nottingham on 28 June.However, her selection is by no means guaranteed after a series in which fellow left-armer Linsey Smith took a career-best five for 36, Charlie Dean formed part of England’s new “leadership group”, and Sarah Glenn bagged three wickets during her return to the one-day international side at Taunton on Saturday.“We’re going to have some selection headaches over the next week or so,” Edwards said. “We’ve got four of the best spinners in world cricket at the moment, which we’re blessed to have.View image in fullscreenNat Sciver-Brunt hit an unbeaten 57 from 33 balls, including nine boundaries.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“We’ve been in constant communication [with Ecclestone] over the last couple of months. Soph’s had a really tough six months. We just want her back in this team in a really good place.

They lost a tumble of wickets immediately after the return, but Aaliyah Alleyne smashed 20 runs off the penultimate over from Lauren Filer, twice top-edging over the head of Jones behind the stumps, while Jahzara Claxton sent the ball sailing over the deep midwicket boundary for six, adjacent to a jubilant West Indian dugout. It was, at least, something to cheer about in a tour which has offered little joy for the visitors.West Indies fly home early on Sunday and are being thrown into the deep end by a bizarre act of scheduling from their board: their series against South Africa in Barbados begins in just four days, meaning the hosts will have to face last year’s T20 World Cup finalists while still battling jet-lag.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's cricket teamWest Indies WomenWomen's cricketCricketmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

One of the team’s players is a transgender girl.“This championship was hijacked,” Gaines wrote on X, referring to the student-athlete as “a boy” and ridiculing the league for disabling comments “lol”.Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all time with 11 Olympic and 30 world championship medals, had seen enough. In a rare foray into online confrontation, she reposted Gaines’ tweet and responded with a direct rebuke.“You’re truly sick,” Bileswrote. “All of this campaigning because you lost a race. Straight up sore loser.”@Riley_Gaines_You’re truly sick, all of this campaigning because you lost a race. Straight up sore loser. You should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive OR creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports. Maybe a transgender…https://t.co/pjpzuZ0AlO— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles)June 6, 2025The post referenced Gaines’ performance at the 2022 NCAA championships, where she tied for fifth withLia Thomas, a transgender swimmer. Since then, Gaines has built a prominent public profile lobbying against the inclusion of transgender women in women’s sports, becoming a fixture on right-wing media outlets and appearing alongside Donald Trump ashe signed an executive orderbanning trans girls and women from competing in women’s sports.But Biles didn’t stop there.“You should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive OR creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports,” she wrote. “Maybe a transgender category IN ALL SPORTS!! But instead… You bully them… One thing for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around!!!!!”In a follow-up post, Bilesadded: “Bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male.”bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male@Riley_Gaines_— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles)June 6, 2025Gaines quickly fired back, calling Biles’ remarks “so disappointing” and insisting: “Men don’t belong in women’s sports and I say that with my full chest.”A 12-time All-American swimmer at the University of Kentucky, Gaines has used her race with Thomas as the basis for a national campaign opposing transgender inclusion in sports. She has frequently misgendered athletes in public forums and has drawn criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates and athletes alike for singling out individuals, often minors, by name on social media.In the case of Champlin Park, Gaines made multiple posts about the transgender pitcher, even mentioning the player by name and referring to her with male pronouns, despite the team’s vocal support for their teammate. The Rebels won the Class 4A title game 6-0.View image in fullscreenPolitical activist and former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines, center, appeared alongside Donald Trump in February as he signed an executive order banning trans girls and women from competing in women’s sports.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images“She’s a great kid and a great teammate,” one coach told local media after the game. “Her teammates love having her out there.”Now more than ever, cis female athletes must show solidarity with trans athletes | Johanna MellisRead moreThe comments from Biles, who has long championed mental health awareness and survivor advocacy, drew swift backlash from conservative commentators, who accused the Olympic champion of hypocrisy and attention-seeking. Outkick, the right-leaning sports outlet where Gaines is a regular contributor, called her remarks “self-contradicting”.Gaines reposted several replies from fans who echoed her position, arguing that Biles was undermining women’s sports and confusing the issue by suggesting a separate transgender category. “It’s not my job or the job of any woman to figure out how to include men in our spaces,” Gaines wrote in response.Other conservative influencers piled on, questioning why Biles chose to weigh in and accusing her of “siding with men” in women’s athletics. “If trans participation isn’t a big deal, why propose a separate division?” one post read, summing up a recurring critique in her mentions.Despite the backlash, Biles has not walked back her comments. Supporters praised her for using her platform to defend marginalized athletes and push back against what they view as a pattern of bullying and scapegoating by Gaines.Explore more on these topicsSimone BilesTransgenderGymnasticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Lambourn was not the first string in the trainer’s three-strong team – Delacroix, the 2-1 favourite with Ryan Moore in the saddle was only ninth – but like every other horse at the yard, he had been prepared like an Epsom horse from his first days at the yard.Like Minnie Hauk, Friday’s Oaks winner, he had also been sent to Chester’s May meeting, where the undulations and turns are similar to those at Epsom, to complete his preparation for Saturday’s race, and having been sent straight into the lead by Wayne Lordan, his jockey, he gained another length or two on his field with a slick, assured passage down the hill and around Tattenham Corner.Lambourn wins the 2025 Derby in dominant fashion: horse racing – liveRead moreLazy Griff, who was one and a half lengths behind Lambourn in the Chester Vase, had also been close to the pace from the off and briefly threatened to make inroads into Lambourn’s lead from three out, but Lambourn found more when Lordan asked for a final effort and he was nearly four lengths in front of Lazy Griff (50-1) and Christophe Soumillon at the line. Tennessee Stud, another outsider at 28-1, was third for trainer Joseph O’Brien, the winning jockey aboard Australia, Lambourn’s sire, in 2014.Lambourn, in fact, is a third-generation Derby winner for O’Brien, as Australia was sired by Galileo, the first of his record total of 11 Derby winners in 2001.“He’s a lazy horse, and Chester is always great place for putting an edge on a horse,” O’Brien said. “It makes them quick and wakes them up, there’s a great atmosphere there and there on the turn. So we always think Chester really sharpens them up, it gives them quick feet and we always send good horses there.“Lambourn was second to Delacroix [in the Ballysax Stakes] first time out, and we took him to Chester and Ryan loved him at Chester, but he couldn’t ride them all. I’d say he’s probably an Irish Derby horse [for his next race], but he will get further as well.“Ryan said he got taken out of his ground over halfway [on Delacroix] so his chance was over. Colin [Keane] said The Lion In Winter wasn’t going forward, so it was maybe the track or the ground.”For Lordan, who picked up the ride on Lambourn when Moore opted for Delacroix, this was a first Derby victory and as close to an armchair ride as it gets around Epsom.View image in fullscreenWinning jockey Wayne Lordan and trainer Aidan O’Brien celebrate with the trophy after sending out Lambourn to win the Derby.Photograph: Harry Murphy/Getty Images“He’s a lovely, genuine horse,” Lordan said. “When I jumped I just wanted to get him into a stride because he’s a horse that stays well, and races lazily also.“He was enjoying it in front and his ears were pricked and I was able to go forward good and early. I did feel [going into the race] that he was a bit underrated, because he’s not a flashy horse, he just goes on the bridle and does his own thing. The other horses are good travellers and quicken, mine is just genuine and goes with the flow, but when you look for him, there’s loads in there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To Mikey Lewis perhaps, the Rovers half-back, who kicked the goal that secured a first major trophy in 40 years and their firstChallenge Cupsince 1980. To Willie Peters on the touchline, the coach who has masterminded Hull KR’s rise and has now won the Challenge Cup, something that confirms them as one of Super League’s elite sides.Or to the stands, to the tens of thousands of fans who had made the trip from Hull and finally witnessed history after so many years of heartbreak and near-misses. Among them, their owner, Neil Hudgell, who has saved the club from financial ruin on multiple occasions and now has the piece of silverware his commitment merits. Wherever you looked, there was nothing but raw emotion – and why shouldn’t there be?Hull KR have warned for weeks they are built differently. Steeled by lossesin the 2023 cup finaland last year’sSuper League Grand Final, and heartened by the chance to become the first Hull KR side to win a trophy since 1985. That particular stat has been a point of ridicule on the other side of Hull for years. But now it is consigned to history.View image in fullscreenDejected Warrington players after the final whistle.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianRovers were labouring to unlock aWarringtonside who had defended gamely all afternoon. But an instinctive Tyrone May kick bounced the way of Tom Davies as Wolves, for once, failed to clear their lines. Davies, whose only previous Wembley experience was pulling out of a final for Wigan on the eve of the game as a youngster, got the decisive touch to level the scores at 6-6.Lewis, so often the go-to man for Rovers, did the rest, with a nerveless conversion from out wide to put the Robins ahead. They held on in a frantic finale and then euphoria took over.“It’s a weird feeling,” Peters said. “I’m so proud of this playing group. This is the highest moment of my career. There’s a lot of people here, and who aren’t here sadly, that have contributed to this moment. The players can now take belief from this to go and do it again.”View image in fullscreenTom Davies touches down for Hull KR with less than two minutes left of the final at Wembley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSam Burgess was adamant the better side lost and it is hard to disagree. But this is theirsecond straight cup final defeatand the manner of this one will sting. “You don’t always get what you deserve and I don’t think we deserved to lose today,” the Warrington coach said. “It’ll be tough for the players to understand because they won’t feel like they should have lost.”Led bythe outstanding Marc Sneyd, who became the second man to win the Lance Todd Trophy for man of the match three times, they looked like they would hang on after Sneyd converted Josh Thewlis’s try on the stroke of half-time to make it 6-2.View image in fullscreenJosh Thewlis opens the scoring for Warrington.Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/ShutterstockThat first half was certainly attritional, played in driving rain that played into the hands of Sneyd with his kicking game. That theme continued into the second half, with neither side able to find a breakthrough but Warrington were keepingHull KRat arm’s length.May’s kick caused a rare moment of panic in the Warrington line and the club who have craved this moment for so long took the opportunity.

Tries from Megan Williams, Mary Coleman and Emily Veivers put the Warriors into a commanding 18-0 lead by half-time and though you wondered whether St Helens’ big-match experience could help them mount a comeback, they were once again second best after half-time.The Warriors made it 24-0 when Isabel Rowe scored before converting her own try.

Leicester will face off against Bath in thePremiershipfinal at Twickenham next Saturday – and the rest of us will have to check which century we are in.Leicester, admittedly, have featured far more among the honours this millennium, which is to say at all, than their arch rivals from the West Country, who so dominated the 1980s and 1990s. But neither team, if you asked their hoariest old warriors, could pick a foe they would rather lock horns with on what will no doubt be a sunny afternoon at HQ.Leicester 21-16 Sale: Premiership rugby union semi-final – live reactionRead moreThis was a darker and more swirling affair. The Tigers seemed to haveSalein their pockets for half the match, but the visitors rallied midway through the second to level the scores with only 15 to play. Their tails seemed up.Then came a flash of brilliance – not the first of the afternoon by any means – and all that darkness was pierced by a try fit to win a semi-final. The final minutes played out to Leicester’s beefiest squeezing out Manchester’s, as English rugby’s largest support bellowed them on. So familiar. A bit like next week might feel.“There’s what we can handle, what we’re in charge of,” said Michael Cheika, as he looked forward to his second major final at Twickenham, after the Rugby World Cup final in 2015. “And then there’s what the other team’s in charge of. That game was physical today. It was another level up from anything that’s been played this season. Next weekend will be again.”View image in fullscreenAdam Radwan cuts through Sale’s defence to dive over for Leicester’s first try.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAIntensity guaranteed, then. And there was plenty of it in this semi-final, after the pyrotechnics of the one the night before. Neither Leicester nor Sale are known for their lightness of touch. Nor did they flourish any of it for much of the match.But let it be noted that the decisive breakthroughs owed everything to brilliance. Welford Road bade farewell to some of Leicester’s greatest servants, Dan Cole, Ben Youngs and captain Julián Montoya playing their last matches at the old place, but it was the relative newcomers who won the match.Adam Radwan’s two first-half tries, his 10th and 11th in 10 matches since his arrival mid-season from Newcastle, were taken with stunning audacity to earn Leicester a 10-point lead at the break. Solomone Kata carried hard off a scrum, and Jack van Poortvliet flung the ball wide to Radwan on the blindside. One step did for three defenders scampering desperately across – and a few more set up the customary dive across the line for his first.His second try, though, featured a dive that defied belief. After much close-quarter intensity, Handre Pollard sent a cross-kick to unmarked Radwan on the right. He scuffed it horribly, such that the ball seemed certain to fall out of reach over the line. But Radwan had other ideas. He swallow-dived on the run and reached out to catch the ball as he fell to ground – over the tryline.Those two flashes earned Leicester a 13-3 lead at the break. Sale had barely fired a shot, but the fightback duly came. Their lightness tends to be supplied by George Ford, a previous champion with Leicester. A second penalty of the match by the old maestro, early in the second half, gave notice. Then Sale struck just shy of the hour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ford’s third penalty, from an angled 40 metres a few minutes later, after Sale had replaced their props and squeezed a penalty out of a scrum, silenced the 20,000.Then, come the hour, or at least the 68th minute, come Izaia Perese. The Wallaby whose season has been so disrupted by injury had been on for barely a minute when he burst on to a pass from 40 metres out. He skinned the first man and left the rest trailing to seize the keys to Twickenham.Sale pressed at the very death, having survived another siege of muscle and roars, when Luke Cowan-Dickie spilled the ball with the clock deep in the red. Euphoria, but there was one last TMO intervention to endure. Freddie Steward and Cowan-Dickie had clashed heads. The former’s tackle was deemed legit. Leicester berserk all over again.Some heroes of yore had the send-off they craved.

I really wanted to come here in good form and show Britain how good I can be and I think I proved that,” said Ferguson. “It’s really emotional, even talking about it now.“We worked well together as a group and I knew that if I positioned myself well into that final corner I could probably win the sprint. It was useful we’d done it before, in the intermediate sprint. I knew it was better to be second wheel and then launch first because you lose some momentum on the cobbles and it’s hard to build it back up.”View image in fullscreenCat Ferguson celebrates on the podium.Photograph: Alex Broadway/Getty ImagesOn the final stage Ferguson said: “I’m a little bit nervous.

In most countries in the world, children could hope to live, on average, longer, healthier lives than their parents. This expectation is still true of the mega-wealthy. In fact,tech billionairesand multimillionaires have recently beenfixated on findingthe secret to longer life, convinced that with enough money, technology and cutting-edge science, they can stave off the inevitable for a few more decades to reach 120 or even 150 years old.But their efforts aren’t trickling down to the rest of us. The world’s health crises are getting worse, with life expectancygoing backwardsin several high-income countries, such as the UK and US. In Britain, stagnation started before the Covid pandemic and has decreased by six months, and in the US by 2.33 years.Obesity rates are rising – not just in wealthy countries, but also in places like Ghana, which has experienced a650% increase in obesitysince 1980. Not 65%; 650%. Clean air is a rarity in most places in the world. Mental health conditions like depression areon the rise, worsened by financial precarity and stress.We’ve been told for decades that if we just optimise ourselves, we can live longer, healthier lives. So how can we explain the gap between our growing knowledge about living longer and our collective health going backwards? Personally, I’ve set myself a suitably ambitious goal: to live to 100 with good health and to help others to do the same. According to theONS life expectancy calculator, I have a 9.3% chance of making it that long (although even more challenging is to have a quality life during this time).As someone who has a strong interest in and passion for health, I follow the latest research on superfoods and what to eat. I’ve tried sugar-free diets; I went vegan for a period. I’ve tried all kinds of different exercise regimes from running long distances to intervals to HIIT (high intensity interval training) toHyrox, outdoor bootcamps, spin, hot pilates, barre and paddleboard yoga. In my mid-30s, I decided to become a personal trainer to combine my interest in fitness, nutrition and wellbeing.However, every time my mind goes down the “optimisation” route, I’m reminded of my main job and lifelong career as a public health scientist, looking into the factors that affect how long we will live. Most of these are out of individual control and have to do with the country and community we live in. The truth is, this “self-help” narrative doesn’t reflect the reality of how health works. In fact, the focus on personal responsibility and self-improvement has distracted us from the real issue –the impact that public policy, infrastructure and community make in affecting our health chances and longevity.Environment more crucial than genes in risk of early death, study suggestsRead moreIn public health, research projects have studied places where people live significantly longer, healthier lives – think of Japan or South Korea, or within Europe, Zurich, Madrid or Sardinia. In these places, chronic diseases like heart disease and obesity are far less common.Take Japan, which has 80% less breast and prostate cancer than North Americans and half the risk of hip fractures.Much work has gone into analysing the behaviours of people living within these cities and regions. Based on this, we get lists of changes we could be making at an individual level to live longer, such as moving to a largely plant-based diet, sleeping seven to nine hours a night and exposing yourself to a certain amount of sunlight each day. These are of course helpful, but I suspect that hardly anyone in the areas above has read a self-help book or has a daily health “to do” list.What stands out about these places is that the people living there don’t just make individual choices that lead to better health – they live in places where healthy lives are normalised by government and culture.Take the issue of obesity: the UK isn’t fatter than Japan because it is a country filled with fundamentally different people who choose to be overweight or are lazy or stupid – that kind of logic is not only naive, but it stigmatises overweight people. In fact it seems like at the level of choice, the UK is more interested in dieting, with a diet industryestimatedto be worth £2bn annually and diet books selling millions of copies each year. In contrast, Japan’s diet industry is tiny,worth only $42.8m. The main difference is actually in the food environment – including affordable fruit and vegetables, nutritious school meals and support from the government – meaning that it’s far easier for an individual to stay within a healthy weight living in Japan. The odds are stacked against you in Britain.You can become the healthy “outlier” or bubble yourself off from larger societal challenges if you have wealth, time and resources. You can carry an air purifier, drink a matcha latte, swim in expensive leisure centres, even hire a chef to bake you fresh bread and prepare nutritious meals. There’s a reason that being a royal or marrying into royalty is one of the surest ways to live a long and healthy life. But for those of us who are commoners, there’s no fully opting out of the societal factors completely: we have to go outside to breathe air, walk and cycle the streets, drink tapwater and eat the foods available near where we live or at school.Life expectancy growth stalls across Europe as England sees sharpest decline, say researchersRead moreAs I talk about in my new book, if I’m going to live to 100, I need more than fastidiously counting my calories and posting pictures of myself exercising on Instagram (which I am guilty of). I need to live in a world where health is a collective responsibility, not an individual one. This means supporting policies that make us all healthier – and politicians who prioritise the conditions for good health such as nutritious food especially for children, active cities, clean air policies, preventive healthcare and public provision of water, which should be at the core of what a government provides its citizens. There are lessons in how to improve life in all of these areas across the world: these are places where good health is built into daily life.If we think of Ponce de León’squest for immortalityin the 16thcentury – at a time when life expectancy in his native Spain was just 25 to 30 years, perhaps the lesson is that the answer for longer, healthier lives wasn’t in a fountain of youth but in the rise of stable government, public services, science and community. Tech billionaires could take note.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsLife expectancyOpinionHealthHealth policyPublic services policycommentShareReuse this content"

Now the government must harness that to bring about real changeSat 7 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 06.41 EDTShareThe toppling of the statue of the British enslaver Edward Colston, five years ago today, felt like a historic moment. Bringing down this one statue and symbolically hurling it into Bristol harbour, protesters – predominantly white – drew international attention to the barbarity of African enslavement, its generated wealth that turbocharged the UK’s global power and the legacy of slavery, whose long historical tail had led to the murder of George Floyd less than two weeks before.Five years on, however, it seems fanciful that out of those protests a global reset on race could occur. Back then, structural race inequities were also laid bare by the Covid-19 virus. We watched our TV screens with dread as the kaleidoscope of Black and Asian doctors, nurses and other health workers were dying disproportionately. Those same minoritised communities were also more likely to be in precarious jobs, forced to travel to work as cleaners, care workers and security guards, and were thereby more exposed to the deadly disease.These two seismic occurrences sparked a discussion the likes of which we had never seen in the UK. Corporations held multiple staff meetings over what their response to the Black Lives Matter protests should be. I, along with other race equality activists, was often invited.The discussions would usually begin with the chief executive or a director leading the conversation, proclaiming their commitment to race equality with the usual caveat: “But we must do better.” Then would come the uncomfortable truth, from their own Black staff, who for the first time felt emboldened to speak truth to power.“I’ve been in your company for 20 years. I’ve lost count of how many white women I’ve brought in, trained up, only for them to be promoted and often become my line manager.”“Normally we don’t dare speak out. Managers quickly spread the word that Black people are trouble and are always complaining.”I witnessed one woman tell her boss: “I don’t care if you sack me. I’ve had enough. This charade, you being down with Black Lives Matter, is a bit like you showing up for 10 minutes to our Black History Month in-house event. It changes nothing.”These were difficult and chastening conversations, but with the prolonged Black Lives Matter protests they did bring about action that we hoped might create generational change. For example, company boards began to look at their desperate lack of Black members. Institutions appointed some Black men and women to top roles. And perhaps one of the most noticeable changes was the way that advertisers, along with TV and film producers, placed Black characters in “everyday” roles, away from the usual villainous or holier-than-thou stereotypes. It could be argued that this cultural normalisation of Black and Asian faces on our TV screens may yet play a significant part in bringing communities closer together.Educationally too, there was the beginning of what we thought would be institutional shifts. My own university, Cambridge, under the stewardship of the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope, had already begun itsfirst serious investigationinto its own slavery roots in 2019. After the toppling of Colston, many other universities, such as University College London, Newcastle, Nottingham and Nottingham Trent, opened up their archives. Others looked to broaden their curriculums, bringing in developing-world perspectives.Yet despite so much optimism, the national momentum began to slow down, came to a halt and, in many quarters, is now in reverse. The most significant blocker to change came from Boris Johnson’s government, which in the face of the Black Lives Matter protests was forced to set up a race inquiry. Led by Tony Sewell, this report into systemic racism in the UK is widely seen as one of the mostflawed race reports ever written. Despite all the evidence, Sewell questioned the level of systemic racism in the UK and also claimed there was a positivestory to tell about the enslavement of Africans“not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves”. Sewell was given a peerage by Johnson in 2022.Other factors that stalled the momentum included the rightwing attack on England football playerstaking the kneein support of Black Lives Matter. Then came theattacks on critical race theory, which examines the structural and systemic aspects to racial inequality. Fast forward to 2024 and the climate had gone from tackling race inequality to race hatred riots that sought to firebomb Muslims and refugees. The unprecedented scenes, whipped up by lies around the Southport killer but fuelled by years of Islamophobic and anti-migrant newspaper headlines, harked back to the Ku Klux Klan lynch mobs. And this year we have a US president who demands that businesses and all public institutions abandon their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes. Many of those institutions, in the UK and the US, which had been seen as allies for the Black Lives Matter movement, didn’t take much persuasion to fall into line and abandon their commitments.Five years on from that momentous day in Bristol, many of the hopes of generational and systemic change have evaporated. However, we can be somewhat hopeful that, while on the surface many companies have capitulated, some are covertly continuing with their DEI trajectory. Others, such as the Co-op, where I am a director, wear their DEI credentials as a badge of honour.I think the greatest hope will come from the tens of thousands of people, Black and white, young and old, who demanded change during the longest race equality protest ever seen. They have neither gone away nor lost their ideals. The challenge, then, for this government and others, is to reconnect and empower them to demand that historical change they still want to see.Simon Woolley is co-founder of Operation Black Vote and head of Homerton College, CambridgeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What’s your emergency?”“Hello, I would like to report the fact that I am having a very heavy period. Can you send a police officer over right away to collect my menstrual matter and check whether I’ve broken any laws?”The above is not a transcript of an actual conversation in West Virginia but, the way things are headed, it could be a glimpse of what’s to come. The Raleigh county prosecuting attorney Tom Truman recently warned that women who have a pregnancy loss in West Virginiacould face criminal charges. To protect themselves, Truman said, women should call local law enforcement and report a miscarriage – which is the loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. “Call your doctor. Call law enforcement, or 911, and just say: ‘I miscarried. I want you to know,’” Truman told theoutlet WVNS 59News.Truman said he was personally opposed to prosecuting women who miscarry. But he warned that other prosecutors inWest Virginiahad indicated that they would be willing to file criminal charges against women who had lost a pregnancy via state laws related to the disposal of human remains. “I thought these guys were just chewing on a Dreamsicle,”Truman lamented. But, he added, West Virginia’s laws include definitions that are “pretty broad-ranging” and give law enforcement a lot of discretion to go after women who have had a pregnancy loss.A dystopian surveillance fear has become reality in Texas | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTo be very clear about the law: while abortion is all but banned in West Virginia, the pregnant person themselves can’t be prosecuted for having an abortion. Miscarriages also aren’texplicitlycriminalized. However, law enforcement can get creative and use legislation that governs the handling of fetal remains to punish women. And this sort of “creativity” isn’t just confined to West Virginia: following the2022 overturningof Roe v Wade, a lot of women who experience pregnancy loss in the US have been plunged into legal limbo.While it would appear that Truman was trying to be helpful, I should note that calling the police isn’t necessarily the best idea in a scenario where you have experienced, or suspect you’ve experienced, a miscarriage. “It’s always a mistake to invite law enforcement into your reproductive life,” Kim Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School,told CNN. “I understand the idea that caution is better than being caught up in something that you weren’t anticipating, but it is difficult for me to imagine any circumstance in which I would think it was safe for someone who miscarried to call the police.”If you are going to call the police, you might want to quiz them on their understanding of the female reproductive system before going into any details. After all, how many of the men salivating over the prospect of locking up women for miscarriages do you think actually know what a miscarriage is? How many of them do you think understand that anestimated23m miscarriages occur every year globally and about10% to 20%of known pregnancies end in miscarriages? Again, that’sknownpregnancies: a lot of miscarriages happen before someone even realizes they’re pregnant. We don’t have the full picture of why pregnancy lossesoccur, but they are quite often due to chromosomal abnormalities. They are often, in other words, completely out of the woman’s control. And a very early miscarriage (also known as a chemical pregnancy) can be hard to distinguish from a period. Sometimes the only way to tell the difference is via medical interventions like a blood test or an ultrasound.All that said, this does strike me as a situation where a little malicious compliance wouldn’t go amiss. I’m not saying women inWest Virginiashould call up the prosecutor’s office whenever they’re menstruating and ask to speak to someone about the size and consistency of their blood clots or inquire whether they’d like to send a police officer to examine the toilet before they flush. Nor am I saying that women in West Virginia should drop off their used sanitary items at their local police station so they can be thoroughly examined by the powers that be. But I’m notnotsaying that either!Trump rescinds guidance protecting women in need of emergency abortionsThe Biden-era guidance hadmade it clearthat hospitals in states with abortion bans cannot turn away pregnant patients who are in the midst of medical emergencies.Catholic bishops sue Washington state over law requiring clergy to report child abuseThe Trump administration has alsolaunched an investigation into this law, which it terms “anti-Catholic”.Teenage TikTok star in Pakistan murdered by a man she reportedly rejected, authorities sayThe 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, who police say was shot by a man who broke into her home, is apparently already gettingblamed for her own murder.

This isself-delusion, not self-improvementSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 06.13 EDTShareAbout two years ago, a self-professed “goddess coach” called Jaelyn posted an eight hour-long “sleep affirmation” video which, according to many a satisfied viewer, has worked wonders for them. In a somewhat sultry, meditative voice she repeats mantras and welcomes her listeners to attract “the kind of men and people who will always treat you like a goddess”.Thevideo, boldly titled Attract Men Who Spend Money, Provide and Love You! is one of many in a genre of content that is booming on YouTube and social media. I call them “guru girlies”, and they are proving a force to be reckoned with. In their rather austere imparting of wisdom, guru girlies have become many young women’s go-to guide for all manner of modern conundrums.The spectrum of gurus is vast, but their advice is mainly focused on the idea of “levelling up”. From yourdiettodressing betterto your choice infriendsormen, if you want to live your dream life, self-improvement is the prerequisite; the comprehensive physical, financial and spiritualsine qua nonthat any woman needs to become her best and dream self.When it comes to the physical, gurus give detailed insight on how toglow upandrebrandyour life, often using themselves as examples of how, given the right mindset and Pinterest boards, they were able to lose weight, reduce acne, stay on trend and become a modern standard of beauty that social media sits before in awe.View image in fullscreenWhy Haven’t You Manifested Your Dream Life?, a video by @JillzGuerinPhotograph: @JillzGuerin/YouTubeSpiritually, guru girlies are invariably enamoured withmanifestation techniques,subliminal messagingand the universe’s seeming interest in giving us every abundance if only we’d ask it to. If you are feeling unfulfilled, it’s time to access your divine feminine energy.One gurudescribes this energy as “self-prioritisation”, performing ritualistic (and often costly) tasks of feminine self-care such as gratitude journaling, healthy eating and skincare routines, all in a bid to get back from the world what you put into it. How conveniently straightforward this all seems, and yet how odd that these young guru girlies are lauded as bringers of divine secrets in all matters feminine.Financially, gurus typically see men as a means to a life of wealth and abundance. Creators such as Leticia Padua, known by her devoted following asSheraSeven,claimsthat because all men cheat (“it’s just a matter of time”), it’s important for women to find the cheater with the most money. This financial levelling up – a mindset that involves distinguishing between high-value, provider men and what Shera calls “dusties” – has proved highly popular.And that’s because at the root of all this content is a brewing disappointment that many a young woman, scrolling through her social media and navigating a rapidly changing modern world, is bound to feel. A disappointment with modern love and prospects, with our unfiltered face and appearance, and with the fact that real life isn’t nearly as ideal as it is online. Guru girlies are there to bridge the gap between your disappointing reality and the ideal they purport to embody, right before you onscreen.This is done by submitting to the system, not as an act of defeat but as empowerment. Arguably the most well-known guru,Thewizardliz(known as Liz) is a case in point. “Start expecting good treatment, start expecting to be spoiled, start expecting him to give you money,” she instructs ina video. “Princess treatment” isn’t so much seen as infantilising or disempowering as it is heralded by many guru girlies as a righteous investment in becoming your highest, most feminine self, courtesy of a provider man. However just last week, a four-months pregnant Liz accused her “provider” husband, YouTuber and software CEO Landon Nickerson of messaging another woman.View image in fullscreenHow To Deal With Toxic People, a video by @TamKaurPhotograph: @TamKaur/YouTubeIn all of this, there is no doubt an addictive nature to self-improvement that explains why a new guru,delivering the same old message, seems to blow up every other week. In an age where ever-changing trends dictate our dreams and ideals, where there is always some undiscovered aspect of ourselves to improve on, we are conveniently primed to keep going back to these gurus in a vain attempt to change who we fundamentally are. “The internet is making us feel like there is always something we could be improving, and there’s a sense that we feel no choice but to try and keep up sometimes,” says former guru follower Just a Girl in Paris ina video critique.What’s fortunate for these gurus is that, becausethe onus of failing to self-improve isalways placed on you, your misery and dissatisfaction perfectly places you to keep returning to her either for advice or, increasingly it would seem, for comfort. Because the truth is, much of what makes these guru girlies convincing isn’t the success rate of their advice, it is the parasocial relationship they bring to the already toxic world of self-improvement and wellness culture.Audiences see their favourite influencer less as a guru than as a kind of ideal friend: the pretty, rich, self-confident and inaccessible woman who, in real life, would never actually be our friend. Many gurus have fostered a false intimacy with their audience that has become a given. “She’s literally like every girl’s older sister,” saysoneof Thewizardliz’s followers. “Sometimes I forget she is a famous influencer and not my best friend who gives me advice on FaceTime,” reads another of the countless adoringcomments.Viewers find comfort and ease in a superficial albeit meaningful relationship that isn’t rooted in the messy ups and downs of a real friendship. Their guru friend tells them everything they want to hear about creating their dream life, which only requires intangibles such as affirmations, cutting off disappointing people or a mindset shift. So even if taking all these steps proves to be joyless and wanting, at least your guru, ready with her next upload, will be there to be your ideal friend, all over again.Zandile Powell is a video essayist and writer.

Just ask Trump and MuskDave SchillingThe older I get, the harder it is to maintain ties – and a series of unhinged social media posts probably wouldn’t helpSat 7 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 14.24 EDTShareIhave a hard time maintaining male friendships these days. The older I get, the less time I have for the sorts of activities stereotypical American males enjoy: sporting events, competitive binge drinking and collecting rare coins in a dark basement. OK, maybe that last thing isn’t nearly as common anymore, but what is common (if you believevarioustrend piecesin newspapers and magazines) is the increasing rarity of long-lasting male friendships. Most of my guy friends keep in touch with me through group chats or the occasional solo check-in text. I have, by my count, at least 10 group chats with different circles of friends. All of them are organized around a unifying theme – Star Trek, movie industry gossip, the Los Angeles Dodgers, hating that one guy who wore flip-flops to my wedding. My whole social life revolves around screens now. I watch a show or a baseball game and then immediately retreat into my other, smaller screen to discuss what I just witnessed with people I almost never see in real life. I will give myself credit for at least trying to be social in between working and taking my son to karate lessons, but it is, in fact, the bare minimum effort that I’m exerting. It’s almost like a welfare check, these text messages: “He responded, therefore he is not dead or in a Salvadorian supermax prison awaiting a trial that will never happen.”Maybe this is a superior way of maintaining relationships, though. By only seeing my friends on very rare occasions, I can’t get sick of their personality quirks, their peculiar habits or their need to wear flip-flops to black-tie events. Seriously, no one wants to see your toes at a wedding, man. Cut it out.Friendship might be a social concoction that is best served sparingly. A healthy distance from someone you like makes it more unlikely you’ll start absolutely hating the sheer sight of them. Sometimes, a good friend can smother you, stifle your own identity or lack boundaries. I don’t need to know every little thing about a date you’ve been on or your trip to the podiatrist. Give me the highlights and move on. We might be seeing some of this in the rapid dissolution of the friendship (if one could call giving someone a ton of money in exchange for a job blowing up the government a “friendship”) of Elon Musk and Donald Trump. It might have been too much of a good thing for those two old scamps. It was only a couple months ago that Trump and Elon werefawning over a Tesla on the White House lawnlike two car salesmen during a particularly rivetingToyotathon. Both of them looked so happy then – beaming with pride as they extolled the virtues of owning an electric car. As we know, Trump is anexpert salesman, so he was clearly having a great time. And Musk is very proficient at standing, as he has demonstrated time and time again. It all seemed so perfect, but as is the case with any relationship, the reality is often a lot more complicated.The Guardian view on the Trump-Musk feud: we can’t rely on outsized egos to end oligopoly | EditorialRead morePerhaps this is just another case of “boys will be boys”, but in this case, the boys in question are accusing each other of deranged behavior. Trump and Musk seemed outwardly to be as close as two incredibly rich, famously grumpy people can be. Musk campaigned for Trump in 2024, donated millions of his personal dollars to the Maga cause and took a position in the Trump administration during the first few months of the GOP victory lap. The arrangement allowed them to indulge in some of their favorite hobbies: flying in expensive planes, posting invectives on social media and firing people. It all looked quite cozy.The Dear John letter in this breakup came in the form of a series ofincreasingly unhinged postsfrom both men. Trump says Musk went “crazy” over the removal of electric vehicle subsidies in his budget bill.Musk tweeted the Epstein thing, claimed Trump would cause a recession later this year and accused him of lying about how the whole breakup went down. Trumpthreatened to killMusk’s government contracts. Steve Bannon, a Trump adviser that the presidentstill seems to like, for some reason,suggested Musk should be investigatedand possibly deported. A couples counselor would say these guys need to do less talking and a whole lot more listening.Some friendships aren’t meant to last. In this case, it’s pretty clear there was a bit of a “marriage of convenience” flavor to it all. Trump needed money. Musk … also needed money. An ideal partnership. The only thing that could get in the way of that is, of course, also money. The death of the EV subsidies is existentially terrifying for a man whose fortune rests in the stock value of his automobile company. Trump, ever eager to look fiscally responsible, went after a budget item that most of his supporters either don’t care about or actively hate. This really isn’t that different from when a friend promises to Venmo me for their share of a dinner tab and takes a week to do it (and has to be reminded multiple times, naturally via text). In the case of Trump and Musk, the Venmo tab is in the millions.I still think the Musk-Trump alliance could be salvaged, though the deportation threats and the pedophile island accusation probably aren’t helping. Unlike most of my friendships, Trump and Musk’s partnership is highly transactional. They have and will likely continue to need each other in some way. I need you to pay me back for dinner, but I don’tneedit. Some of my male friendships fall away just out of mutual lack of interest. We both made a choice, consciously or unconsciously, to give up on a relationship. Trump and Musk will always need each other in one form or another. Their shared grift of the American government is simply more powerful and effective when the two of them are working together as the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of corruption. They might just need a little break from each other. When they’re ready, maybe they could take it slow and try a group chat.Well.Maybe not.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

NHS data suggests about 60% of people are currently seen within this time.NHS figures released last month showed the overall number of patients on waiting lists had risen slightly from 6.24 million to 6.25 million.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has acknowledged that she had been forced to rebuff requests for funding from some departments because of the tight economic situation. She has insisted the blame lies with Conservatives and has declined to reassess her self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.Speaking in Manchester this week, the chancellor said despite a £190bn increase in funding over the spending review period “not every department will get everything that they want next week and I have had to say no to things that I want to do too”. The Foreign Office and Department for Culture, Media and Sport are thought to be facing some of the deepest cuts.Economists have warnedthat the chancellor faces “unavoidably” tough choices when she sets out the departmental spending plans. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has said defence and the NHS will dominate on 11 June.The Home Office has been lobbying heavily for more funding, with Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, warning that cuts threaten progress towards two of the prime minister’s “missions” — halving knife crime and halving violence against women and girls.Police chiefs including Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police service, warned Starmer directly in a letter this week that they would face “stark choices” about which crimes they investigate if the Treasury pushes ahead with cuts.One of the areas in which the Home Office has sought to cut spending is onhotels to temporarily house asylum seekers in the UK.But according to figures published on Saturday, the department plans to spend about £2.2bn of foreign aid to support asylum seekers this financial year. This is only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024-2025.Asylum seekers and their families arehoused in temporary accommodationif they are waiting for the outcome of a claim or an appeal and have been assessed as not being able to support themselves independently. International rules allow countries to count first-year costs of supporting refugees as overseas development assistance.A total of 32,345 asylum seekers were being housed temporarily in UK hotels at the end of March this year, down 15% from the end of December. The Home Office said it was “urgently taking action to restore order and reduce costs”, which would cut the amount spent to support asylum seekers and refugees in the UK.Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingEconomic policyNHSHealthHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

And by the time [the water rose to my nose], I thought, ‘I’m sure this is not right’.“But then, of course, if you got this thing screwed on top of you, you can’t breathe. You can’t even make yourself heard, you know: ‘Get it off me!’” he added.Attenborough related how a testy director of operations refused to believe the equipment had a fault. “So he put it on and I’m happy to say he went under the water and came up even quicker than I did (“Blimey”, interjected the prince), because there was actually a fault.”Ocean with David Attenborough review – a passionate case against the ruination of the seasRead moreOcean, Attenborough’s new National Geographic documentary special, confronts the enormity of the loss in ocean life. It will become available for streaming globally on Saturday 8 June, World Ocean’s Day.In the film with the prince, publicising the documentary’s release, Sir David describes how the world knew very little about the intricacies of life in our oceans when he took his first dive.Attenborough spoke of how the experience was a “sensory overload”. But now, he said, the same dive in Australia’s shallow warm water cay is likely to look disastrously worse: globally, corals have suffered tremendous loss as a result of human-causedocean warming.“Dave, from what you’ve obviously seen over the years, what states would you say the oceans were in right now?” asked the prince in the film, which will shortly be posted on Kensington Palace social media platforms.“The awful thing is that it’s hidden from you and from me and most people,” replied Attenborough. “The thing which I was appalled by when I first saw the shots taken for this film, is that what we have done to the deep ocean floor is just unspeakably awful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Films like this can expose something new.”Prince William agreed that we must remain optimistic about ocean recovery: it is vital, he said, for stabilising the climate and securing a healthier future for us all.“I wonder whether this should be a moment for optimistic excitement for the next generation,” he asked Attenborough. “They can become bigger explorers and find more data.

He talked about closing the book on a squalid chapter for our politics – immigrants represent a squalid chapter. He talked about how he thought immigration has done incalculable damage to this green and pleasant land, which, of course, is nonsense – immigrants built this land. And, finally, he said we risk becoming an island of strangers.“I thought that was a fundamentally racist thing to say. It is contrary to Britain’s history. My parents came to this country in the 50s. They were not strangers. They helped to build this country.

People are really suffering because of it,” she said.She has friends who are disabled, who were “devastated” when cuts to personal independence payments (Pip) were announced. “It isn’t just about my friends, because if we only vote for the people that we know, we’re in trouble,” she added.Hardie was also dismayed over the prime minister’s widely criticised “island of strangers” speech, which was likened to the rhetoric of Enoch Powell.“There’s the problem of cuts and a problem with rising hate in this country and around the world,” she said. “It’s not just financial, it’s also ideological and about how we treat each other.”She thinks the government’s current approach will bear little fruit electorally. “Why would you go and see a tribute band if you can get the real thing? It’s not gonna work, it’s ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenDaniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianDaniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “People are very disappointed in this government.

But this run was brand new. On a warm day in mid-May, he would be one of the very first to raft it with high spring flows.Last year, the final of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River were removed in thelargest project of its kind in US history. Forged through the footprint of reservoirs that kept parts of the Klamath submerged for more than a century, the river that straddles the California-Oregon border has since been reborn.The dam removal marked the end of a decades-long campaign led by the Yurok, Karuk and Klamath tribes, along with a wide range of environmental NGOs and fishing advocacy groups, to convince owner PacifiCorp to let go of the ageing infrastructure. The immense undertaking also required buy-in from regulatory agencies, state and local governments, businesses and the communities that used to live along the shores of the bygone lakes.As the flows were released and the river found its way back to itself, a new chapter of recovery – complete with new challenges – emerged.Among the questions still being answered: how best to facilitate recreation and public connection with the Klamath while recovery continues. There are hopes for hiking trails, campgrounds and picnic spots. A wide range of stakeholders are still busy ironing out the specifics and how best to define the lines between private and public spaces.It’s a delicate process. Not just the ecology is being restored; the Indigenous people whose ancestors relied on the river for both sustenance and ritual across thousands of years are also renewing their relationships with the land.More than 2,800 acres, some of which emerged from under the drained reservoirs after the dams came down,will be returned to Shasta Indian Nation, a tribe that was decimated when construction on the dams started in the early 1910s. Ready to be stewards, they are also now navigating their role as landowners in a recreation region.View image in fullscreenBill Cross takes a small crew down the Iron Gate run of the restored Klamath River on 15 May 2025.Photograph: Gabrielle Canon/The GuardianOn 15 May, the first opening day for new access sites on the Klamath, visitors got the first real glimpse of the extensive restoration efforts since demolition began in 2023. It also served as an early trial for how the public and an eager commercial rafting community might engage with the river and the landscapes that surround it.As the sun broke through a week of cloudy weather that morning, rafters readied their gear near an access now bearing the traditional name in the Shasta language, K’účasčas (pronounced Ku-chas-chas).“If we were here a little over a year ago, we would be standing on the edge of a reservoir,” said Thomas O’Keefe, the director of policy and science for American Whitewater, as he helped Cross and Michael Parker, a conservation biologist, ready their boat for a stretch of river above where the Iron Gate dam once stood. The Guardian joined them to try the section on opening day.O’Keefe has played a pivotal role in bridging recreation and restoration on the river. He hopes connecting people to the landscapes will encourage future care for them.“The vast majority of people want to do the right thing,” O’Keefe said, describing the extreme care taken towards ecologically and culturally sensitive areas. “We want to make sure we can define where that can happen.”Animated map showing the removal of dams leading to the reshaped flow of the Klamath RiverThere is still a lot of work left to do. Rustic roads that lead to the river’s edge are minimally paved and laden with potholes. It’s not immediately clear where visitors should park. Finishing touches are still being added on signs and infrastructure – from put-ins to picnic tables – with the completion of five new public recreation sitesplanned for 1 August.And for rafters, of course, the river itself must be relearned. Roughly45 continuous mileswere unleashed between the Keno and Iron Gate dams. Rapids long-dependent on artificial surges from the hydropower operations are at last being fueled by natural conditions.“We are kind of writing the book on it,” said Bart Baldwin, the owner of Noah’s River Adventures, a commercial outfit out of Ashland,Oregon, who has taken guests downriver for decades. While he admits the releases from the dams made for “world-class” rapids, he says the loss has created new opportunities.“The scenery is stunning and I think it’s going to be special.”‘Giving nature the kickstart to heal’The waters of the Klamath have burst back to life in recent weeks, spurred by melt-off from strong winter storms. The Iron Gate run bumps and sways through a mix of class II and class III rapids, enough for a fun ride that’s manageable for most experience levels. Upriver, theexciting and challenging K’íka·c’é·ki Canyon runwinds through more than 2.5 miles of class IV rapids, beckoning those with more expertise.As he called out paddling orders to navigate his boat’s small crew through splashy sections, Cross was relieved. In the years before the dams came out, he’d worked to outline the new river and its whitewater potential,armed with historical topographic maps, old photos and bathymetric data that showed depth and underwater terrain. Rooted in science, it requires a bit of guesswork. The volcanic geology here often comes with surprises.“I spent the first six months sweating bullets watching the water recede and the channel scour and wondering if there was going to be a waterfall I didn’t predict,” he said.Even with strong flows, there was space to breathe between more challenging sections. There were spots to beach boats for a picnic lunch, places to quietly float through the vibrant scenery.View image in fullscreenNoah’s River Adventures, a commercial rafting company, took the first group of guests down a restored section of the Klamath River on 15 May.Photograph: Gabrielle Canon/The GuardianVestiges of the recent past are still visible. Gradients of green shroud a scar left by the high-water mark of the reservoir. Columns of dried mud, remnants of the 15m cubic yards of sediment held behind the dams, are clumped along the river’s edge.But there are also signs of nature’s resilience. Swaying willows stand stalwart from the banks. Behind them, rolling hills splashed with orange and yellow wildflowers and ancient basalt pillars stretch to the horizon. Far from the hum of highway and roads, the silence here is broken only by the purr of the river as it rolls over rocks, accented with eagle calls or chattering sparrows who have already claimed sites along the water for their nests.Years before the dams were demolished, as teams of scientists, tribal members and landscape renovation experts tried to envision how recovery should unfold, there wasn’t a guidebook to go by. There weren’t records for how the heavily degraded ecosystems should look or function.“Creating the mosaic we are currently seeing out there has been a work of educated estimation,” said Dave Coffman, a director for Resource Environmental Solutions (RES), the ecological recovery company working on the Klamath’s restoration. “There’s nothing in that watershed that hasn’t been touched by some sort of detrimental activity.”In less than a year’s time, a dramatic reversal has taken place. Some spots have bounced back beautifully. Others had to be carefully cultivated to mimic what could have been if the dams never disrupted them. Native seeds were cast across the slopes, some by hand and others from helicopters. Heavy equipment trucked away mounds of earth. Invasive plants were plucked from around the reservoir footprint before they could spread across the barren ground.“We are giving nature the kickstart to heal itself,” said Barry McCovey Jr, the fisheries department director for the Yurok tribe. What he calls “massive scars” left by the dams “aren’t going to heal overnight or in a year or in 10 years”, he added. Giving the large-scale process, time will be important – but a little help can go a long way.In late November last year,threatened coho salmon were seen in the upper Klamath River basinfor the first time in more than 60 years. Other animals are benefiting, too, including north-western pond turtles, freshwater mussels, beavers and river otters.It took mere months for insects, algae and microscopic features of a flourishing food web to return and sprout. “It’s amazing to see river bugs in a river,” he said. They are good indicators of water quality and ecosystem health.View image in fullscreenBill Cross and Thomas O’Keefe stand in the footprint of what was the Iron Gate Reservoir looking out at the newly restored Klamath River.Photograph: Gabrielle Canon/The GuardianIt might seem like a happy ending. McCovey Jr said it’s just the beginning. “We are going to have ups and downs and it will take a long time to get to where we want to be,” he said.Ongoing Yurok projects will focus on making more areas “fish-friendly” and closely monitoring aquatic invertebrates in coordination with the other tribes, researchers and advocacy organizations, and the Klamath River Renewal Corporation thatwas created to oversee the project.Klamath River dam removal: before and after images show dramatic changeRead moreThere are also far-flung parts of the watershed they are still working to restore. Close to47,000 acres of ancestral Yurok homelands in the lower Klamath basinwill be returned to the tribe this year after being owned and operated for more than a century by the industrial timber industry. Considered the largest land-back conservation deal in California history, the work there will complement and benefit from what’s being done upriver.Even as recovery on the riverremains perhaps at its most fragile, most people who have been part of this enormous undertaking are looking forward to welcoming the public.“I think one of the biggest fears of this project is that it wouldn’t work,” Coffman said. “I am excited for more folks to get out here and see what we are capable of.”‘It’s huge for our people’The work goes beyond the water line. The lands that hug this river have had their own transformation, along with the people who once called them home.“People are really focused on dam removal and fish and recreation – and those are all great things – but it is a very personal story for us,” said Sami Jo Difuntorum,cultural preservation officer for the Shasta Indian Nation. As the tribe returns to their ancestral lands, they are envisioning ways to introduce themselves to a largely unfamiliar public.Their story is laced with tragedy, but also resilience. Shasta Indian Nation is not federally recognized, largely because they were massacred in the mid-19th century when gold-seeking settlers poured into the region. Their villages and sacred lands were drowned in the damming of the river. But the people tied to these lands have largely remained close by; many still reside in the county.As the waters of the reservoirs receded, it revealed a place held at the heart of their culture for thousands of years.View image in fullscreenThe Iron Gate Dam in Hornbrook, California, in 2023.Photograph: Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images“The return of our land is the most important thing to happen for our people in my lifetime, for the generation before and the generation ahead,” Difuntorum said, standing on a quiet overlook watching the river course through the sacred K’íka·c’é·ki Canyon. This steep basalt chasm was left dewatered while the river was rerouted to the hydroelectric plant.“There are so many things we are learning, like how to coexist as future landowners with the whitewater community, the local community, the fishermen – and then all the tribes,” she added. “It’s a lot – but it’s all good stuff. It’s huge for our people.”Looking ahead, plans are being made both for public use and for tribal reconnection. There will be access trails across their lands and efforts to plant traditional medicinal and ceremonial plants. Old buildings that provided electricity from the plant will be converted to an interpretive center. Places have been picked for sweat lodges, an official tribal office and the area where the first salmon ceremony will be held in more than century. Difuntorum’s grandsons – ages nine and six – will be dancing in that ceremony this year.For the tribe, reconnecting to the river has provided an opportunity to reconnect to their culture and history.Part of reconnecting comes through reintroducing their language. James Sarmento, a linguist and tribal member, is helping Shasta people learn and use pronunciations for recovered places as they were once known along with the stories of creation tied to them. The public will learn them, too.View image in fullscreenMichael Parker on the Klamath River.Photograph: Gabrielle Canon/The Guardian“It’s about making a relationship and having conversations with the land,” Sarmento said. “These are landscapes that we are not only working to protect – we are working to speak their names out loud.”The darker moments in the tribe’s history live on. Remnants of the now-inoperable hydroelectric plant still sit solemnly on the embankment: coils of metal, enormous pipes, nests of wires that connect to nothing. A cave, tucked into the steep slopes among ancient lava fields where 50 or so Shasta people sought refuge in the mid-1800s, still bears the violent marks of a miners’raid that left five people, including women and children dead.Difuntorum said it used to be hard for her to see it all. “I don’t feel that now,” she said. “Of all the places I have been in the world, this is where I feel the most me – out here at the water.”‘This river will go on forever’Cross, O’Keefe and Parker pulled up their paddles to ease into the final float of the run, gliding through the channel that once propped up the Iron Gate dam. Overhead, an osprey settled into its nest with a large fish as a throng of small birds scattered into the cloudless sky.There are sure to be challenges ahead. The climate crisis has deepened droughts and fueled a rise in catastrophic fire as this region grows hotter. Habitat loss and water wars will continue as city sprawl, agriculture and nature increasingly come into conflict.For now though, the river’s recovery is a hopeful sign that a wide range of interests can align to make a positive change, even in a warming world.“I never thought I would see the run under reservoirs be revealed,” Cross said, smiling as he packed up his boat. As a new chapter begins, the Klamath has already become a story of what’s possible, fulfilling the hopes that the project could inspire others.And, after decades of advocacy and years of work, “we have salmon and beaver and poppies,” he said. “This river will go on forever.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaRiversWaterOregonWest CoastBiodiversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Up to80% of Kabul’s groundwater is deemed unsafe, with high levels of sewage, salinity and arsenic.Water access has become a daily battle for people in Kabul. Some households spend up to 30% of their income on water, and more than two-thirds have incurred water-related debt.“Afghanistan is facing a lot of problems, but this water scarcity is one of the hardest,” said Nazifa, a teacher living in the Khair Khana neighbourhood of Kabul. “Every household is facing difficulty, especially those with low income. Adequate, good quality well water just doesn’t exist.”Someprivate companies are capitalising on the crisisby actively digging new wells and extracting large amounts of public groundwater, then selling it back to city’s residents at inflated prices.“We used to pay 500 afghanis (£5.30) every 10 days to fill our cans from the water tankers. Now, that same amount of water costs us 1,000 afghanis,” said Nazifa. “The situation has been getting worse over the past two weeks. We are afraid it will get even more expensive.”Kabul’s sevenfold growth from less than 1 million people in 2001 has drastically transformed water demands. A lack of centralised governance and regulation has also perpetuated the problem over the decades.In early 2025, the UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs announced that itspartners had received just $8.4m(£6.2m) of the $264m required to implement planned water and sanitation programming in Afghanistan. A further $3bn in international water and sanitation funding has been frozen since the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021. The US’s recent move tocut more than 80% of its USAID fundinghas compounded the crisis.“Everything is so aid-dependent,” said Curry. “We can throw millions of dollars at short-term water fixes and say we’ve addressed the need, but that need will continue until there’s better investment for longer-term solutions. And that’s where foreign governments are stopping short at this point due to political dynamics.”Nazifa said: “Water is a human right and natural resource of Afghanistan. It is not a political issue. My heart bleeds when I look at the flowers and fruit trees in the garden, all drying up. But what can we do? We are currently living in a military state, so we can’t exactly go to the government to report the issue.”The Panjshir River pipeline is one project which, if completed, could alleviate the city’s over-reliance on groundwater and supply 2 million residents with potable water. The design phases for this were completed in late 2024 and are awaiting budget approval, with the government seeking additional investors to supplement the $170m cost.“We don’t have time to sit around waiting for budgets. We are caught in a storm from which there will be no return if we don’t act immediately,” said Dr Najibullah Sadid, a senior researcher on water resource management and member of theAfghan Water and Environment Professionals Network.“Those in Kabul are in a situation where they have to decide between food or water. And yet, the locals we’ve spoken to are still willing to invest what little they have towards a sustainable solution. Whichever project will bring the most immediate impact is the priority. We just need to start somewhere.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanWaterClimate crisisSouth and central AsiaTalibanAidnewsShareReuse this content"

A dream, he says, that will “change how humanity sees, understands and relates to Antarctica”. The vast frozen continent –home to emperor and Adélie penguins, leopard and Ross seals, and feeding grounds for orcas, beaked whales and albatrosses – should be recognised as an autonomous legal entity “at least equivalent to a country”, says the environmental lawyer.And this week that dream became one step closer to reality as judges awarded Cullinan theShackleton medal for the protection of the polar regions.The prestigious prize, worth £10,000, shines a light on people who have shown “courage, determination, ingenuity and leadership” in their work to protect the polar regions, indicating Cullinan’s radicalplan to adopt and implement an Antarctica Declarationis gaining momentum.Cullinan, who is based in South Africa and was once an anti-apartheid activist, achieved recognition for his work fighting, often successfully, for legal systems to recognise the rights of rivers, forests and things “other than human beings” so they could be defended in court cases. The idea of giving species and places legal “personhood”, outlined in his 2002 book, Wild Law: A Manifesto for Earth Justice,became part of awider global movement recognising rights of nature and animals.Cullinan is now arguing thatAntarcticaas a whole should have this legal personhood, preferably at state level. “We have to shift how people relate to Antarctica,” he says. “It’s absolutely essential to protect it, not just for itself, which is obviously valid, but also for humanity.”Instead of being treated by the international community and law courts as a “territory claimed by a number of countries that stuck flags in the ice a while ago … at best, a laboratory and at worst, a potential source of oil, gas, minerals and krill”, he wants Antarctica to be legally protected as “an astounding living community” and “a being in its own right”.View image in fullscreenSunset over Peltier Channel, Antarctica.Photograph: Posnov/Getty Images“It should be obvious that Antarctica is far too wild and fierce for humans to rule,” he says. “It should be seen as what it is: sovereign unto itself.”Antarctica is governed by the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), a framework created in 1959 and signed by 58 countries. This guarantees that the continent is used exclusively for peaceful purposes, such as science and conservation. It was a great achievement at the time, Cullinan says, when there were proposals to mine Antarctica and countries in conflict over their competing claims.It could have a seat at the table, it could initiate lawsuits or join lawsuits to prevent further greenhouse emissionsCormac CullinanNow the key challenges Antarctica faces arise from the climate crisis, something caused by activities far outside its geographical boundaries.At the same time, countries such asChina and Russia have consistently blocked conservation measuressuch as the creation of new marine protected areas. “There’s impasse within the system, Cullinan says, while from an ecological perspective, the situation is deteriorating very fast and scientists are saying we have to take urgent, decisive action.”The purpose of declaring Antarctica a legal entity and setting out its rights is to create corresponding obligations for other countries – and international organisations such as the UN – to respect those rights. “An iceberg doesn’t really care whether you think it has rights or not. The issue is: are there human duties to respect the integrity of the ice-sheet fields?”View image in fullscreenChicks and adults of the busy emperor penguin colony at Snow Hill Island, Antarctica.Photograph: David Merron Photography/GettyIf the Antarctic ice sheet melted entirely,it would raise global sea levelsby about 58 metres. In 2020,an article in the journal Natureestimated that even a 1-metre rise would put “48% of the world’s land area, 52% of the global population and 46% of global assets” at risk of flooding.“It can’t be left to a small group of countries to make decisions about Antarctica,” says Cullinan, who helped to draft the 2010 Universal Declaration of Rights of Mother Earth and co-founded the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature.“If human beings lived there, who were indigenous to Antarctica, they would have a government who could represent them in climate change negotiations or biodiversity conventions. And that government would be a powerful voice, because Antarctica and the Southern Ocean covers a 10th of the surface of the planet.”But Antarctica has no voice, he says. “It’s not represented in these decision-making bodies – and the countries that govern it under the ATS still argue from a national perspective, and take decision-making positions for their own national interests, while scientists and other people who really love Antarctica and are deeply committed to protecting it get blocked.”‘He took five bullets and returned to work on plankton’: the double lives of Ukraine’s Antarctic scientistsRead moreThe Antarctica Declaration would, by contrast, recognise that all Antarctic beings have rights that humanity must respect and protect. People around the world are being invited to support it and declare a new legal status of “personhood” for Antarctica. “It could then be represented,” says Cullinan.“It could have a seat at the table, it could initiate lawsuits or join lawsuits around the world to prevent further greenhouse emissions.”The award will help raise much-needed awareness about the Antarctica Declaration, he adds. “It will bring this initiative to the attention of people in a way that would have otherwise taken us years to achieve, and connect us to a network of polar explorers and Antarctic experts we can perhaps persuade to join us.“We’ve got a very strong core group, but we need to build a global movement around this – we need to show that Antarctica is everybody’s concern.”Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaSeascape: the state of our oceansPolar regionsEnvironmental activismEndangered habitatsConservationWildlifeClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Below me, the West Allen Valley holds deeper colours, the land green and bounded with stone walls or dotted with small woods. Shadows thrown by the early evening light pick out every feature: streams, cleughs, barns and farms, mining spoil and ruins – a record of the land.The wind is warm, buffeting the cottongrass that stretches across the boggy ground and along the roadside ditch. It’s a boom year for this beautiful plant, perhaps due to the dry spring putting the plants under stress. A sedge rather than a grass,Eriophorum angustifoliumflourishes in its harsh moorland environment, sending out underground rhizomes where few other plants will grow; a line of snow poles shows what the winters are like. The plant’s ability to survive here gives it the alternative name of bog cotton.View image in fullscreen‘Sending out underground rhizomes where few other plants will grow’ Cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium).Photograph: Susie WhiteToday, the wind sets every fluffy seedhead in bobbing motion, dancing with light like the choppy scintillations of waves. The discreet greenish flowers could be easily missed. It’s those downy cottonwool plumes that enable wind dispersal that have been used to stuff pillows and make candle wicks, and dress wounds during the first world war.Plug plants of cottongrass are being planted by the North Pennines National Landscape to restore degraded blanket bog. Binding the surface of the peat together with their wandering roots, they prevent further erosion. In other benefits, the female black grouse that I occasionally see up here feed on the flower heads, giving them a source of protein and energy before laying eggs in spring. The larvae of large heath butterflies feed on a similar species, the hare’s tail cottongrassEriophorum vaginatum.For a brief time, the moor is transformed in white and I come up here to revel in the spectacle and feel the peace. Swallows swoop to pick up insects off the road. A hare lopes through the tussocks as a lark delivers a stream of notes above. Then a curlew lifts off, beats its wings before gliding, its ecstatic bubbling song ending in a drawn-out plaintive note.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsPlantsCountry diaryRural affairsSpringBirdsNorthumberlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re a building of teachers and nurses, key workers and young professionals. I know for myself and for a number of people those bills would not have been payable.“We are pleased that NHG and United Living have at last done the right thing, but disappointed it took so long. We bought our homes in good faith and were devastated to discover they were not safe because of cost-cutting construction.“We have had to live in unsafe homes for many years and are relieved that we can now start putting this behind us.”Taylor, who has lived in the development since it was completed in 2014, and has at times spent 40 hours a week on admin connected to the case, said he was pleased the terms of the settlement were not confidential.“It was really important for me, from the perspective of public interest, that we could be an example for people that it is possible to win on the basis of truth and reality and what’s correct and just, but also to inspire some [other] people to go for it.”The compensation will go to 76 leaseholders and independent freeholders and the terms of the settlement mean that none of the works or legal costs can be passed on to any future leaseholders or residents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It comes with Donald Trumpdefunding soft power institutionsbacked by the US, just as Russia and China spend billions to increase their influence and bring countries into their orbit.How China is using AI news anchors to deliver its propagandaRead moreVivienne Stern, the chief executive ofUniversitiesUK, who sits on the council, warned that when compared with China’s soft power efforts “through investment and things like scholarships, media, music and cultural efforts, you just think, we’re asleep at the wheel”.“We’ve got this position which we have inherited, which we believe to be our divine right – it’s not,” she said. “You have to work to maintain it. I’ve benefited from having the British Council’s support around the world as the university sector tries to extend its links. Yet we’re knocking lumps out of it. We need to wake up.”Tristram Hunt, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum and another council member, warned the British Council, which boosts Britain’s cultural and educational relations overseas, was facing an “existential crisis” exacerbated by a £200m Covid-era government loan.“It is crippling its ability to promote UK soft power around the world,” he said. “Similarly, cuts to the [BBC] World Service, at a time when Russia and China and other actors unfavourable to the west are increasing their interventions and energies, also seems self-defeating.”Gen Sir Nick Carter, the former chief of the defence staff, warned the US under Trump was “vaporising its soft power” and creating “greater opportunities for our autocratic rivals to take on the space that formerly we filled with ease”. He added: “Those of us who still believe in this should be leaning in even harder.”Despite the concerns, there are fears that soft power institutions could suffer in next week’s spending review, which sets out public spending until the end of the decade. Both the Foreign Office and the culture department are unprotected, meaning they could have their budgets raided to make savings.Having risked my life in war zones for the BBC, I know this: cuts to the World Service will be disastrous | Martin BellRead moreThe Guardian has already revealed that the Foreign Office has asked the World Service to draw up plans for eitherflat or reduced public funding. Sources said the demands would prove “disastrous”, coming as Trump attempts to remove funding from US institutions tackling disinformation, such as the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.The chief executive of the British Council, Scott McDonald, has warned it isat risk of disappearing in two years. The institution has faced a collapse in revenues and must repay its government loan. Whitehall sources said the loan was given on commercial terms and ministers had a “duty to the taxpayer” to recoup it.Meanwhile, ministers are being warned that almostthree in four English universitiesare expected to be in the red in 2025-26, hit by increased national insurance payments and significantly diminished tuition fee income. While fees will increase with inflation in September, it comes aftera long freezethat has meant their value decreased in real terms.UK universities are seen as a driver of soft power. Recent research suggests they educatedmore national leaders than any other countryin the world. However, Stern and Sir Peter Bazalgette, the chancellor of the University of the West of England and former ITV chair, warned the government’s immigration planswould restrict overseas students.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also acknowledged the tough economic choices faced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. However, several called for ministers to prioritise soft power.Bazalgette, another council member, said the “absolute gold-plated priority is the BBC World Service” in terms of maintaining soft power. He said it was “the jewel in our crown”, alongside the British Council and universities. “I’m hoping that we don’t diminish the World Service any further, and that we find ways … of actually funding it further.“There’s no point in pretending these [funding] tensions aren’t there. We have to have some sympathy for the government. All we can do is make the very best argument.”Lord Neil Mendoza, the provost of Oriel College, Oxford and chair of Historic England, said Britain has an “incredible opportunity” amid the US retreat from the world stage. “Although we have a very difficult financial situation, which will impinge on budgets, there’s now a soft power void,” he said. “It’s a good moment for people to make these arguments.”Dr Sara Pantuliano, the chief executive of the thinktank ODI Global, said: “I’m hoping that we will continue to make soft power central to decisions related to spending as well, although we know the mantra is that we don’t have enough money overall as a country, so there are difficult choices.”A government spokesperson said the UK’s sport, arts, culture and education sectors were “world-class” and it was “totally committed to doing all we can to further their reach, as well as promoting the English language overseas”.“While we wouldn’t get ahead of the spending review, our track record on this is clear,” they said. “Despite the tough fiscal situation, we continue to back the British Council, with over £160m in 2025-26 alone, and are providing the BBC World Service with a large uplift of over £32m, taking our total funding to £137m.“The foreign secretary also launched the UK soft power council in January, alongside culture secretary Lisa Nandy, to further strengthen our support for British soft power.

Termination laws differ across Australian states, but if pregnant women in offshore detention were prohibited from accessing abortion services in Australia until after 20 weeks, it would be far more difficult to access those services at all.‘We just sit here’: the broken men Australia’s offshore detention regime left behind in Papua New GuineaRead moreA handwritten note by Morrison, on a document dated June 2014, stated: “I would also like advice on denying transfer pre 20 weeks for pregnant women.” In the same document, Morrison specified that women should only be transferred to Brisbane, not South Australia, the Northern Territory or Victoria for abortion services.Morrison did not respond to requests for comment, and Guardian Australia cannot confirm what advice he received.View image in fullscreenA handwritten note from Scott Morrison when he was immigration minister, dated 25 November 2014. The note reads: ‘There are to be no transfers to Victoria, SA & NT. Transfer should be to Brisbane, with no further transfer.’ It continues: ‘I would also like advice on denying transfers pre 20 weeks for pregnant women.’Illustration: Department of Home AffairsIn the case of a woman, who was not identified in the redacted documents, medical advice recommended she be transferred to Victoria for an abortion, over Brisbane where she would have had to have waited a week for a hospital ethics panel to consider her case. That policy was in place in Queensland for women seeking a termination after 20 weeks’ gestation. In Victoria, a woman could seek a termination without approval of a hospital ethics board until 24 weeks.Guardian Australia understands the woman was taken to Brisbane, rather than Melbourne, where the panel deliberated on her case.One senior source, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, said Morrison did not specifically target abortion access.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDavid Manne, a prominent refugee advocate and lawyer, said in his view the broader immigration policy at the time was part of an “extreme deterrence agenda”.“Inherent in the [broader] policy was conscious, calculated cruelty,” he said. “Clearly, [the policy] was far more than reckless indifference, it was deliberate.“[It was] part of a system that was underpinned by the extreme deterrence agenda … the basic rights and dignity of people subject to the policy were essentially irrelevant.”View image in fullscreenThe island of Nauru where the Australian government ran immigration detention facilities.Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The GuardianJana Favero, the deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), who was an advocate for the centre at the time, said the documents were “outrageous” and “consistent” with the ASRC’s experience trying to help asylum seekers get medical transfers.“It was extremely challenging and difficult for the medical transfer from people offshore, in particular women who were pregnant,” she said.Manne claimed the Abbott government was concerned asylum seekers and refugees were using medical transfers as a back door to get into Australia.Once in Australia, and in the Australian onshore detention system, an asylum seeker could go to the court to seek an injunction to prevent being sent back to offshore detention.“[They] could plead their case under law to resist being sent back toNauru, to further dangers of the kinds that they’d already faced,” Manne said.This wasn’t the only concern held by the government. Manne said the policy was based on deterrence, to stop others seeking asylumarriving by boat.“If we make some exception, if there’s a perceived crack of light in this policy, this could see the resumption of boat arrivals, that was clearly the thinking.”Later, in 2019, Peter Dutton, by then the home affairs minister in the Morrison government,accused women in Nauru refugee centresof using rape and abortion claims as a ploy to get to Australia.Over the 18 months from 1 January 2013 to 20 June 2014,IHMS, the government contracted healthcare provider for Nauru, said there were six pregnant transferees who were taken to the mainland for a termination. In June 2014, there were 289 women in detention on Nauru, according to data collated by the Refugee Council of Australia.Numerousinternal and external reviewsof offshore detention centres found instances of violence and traumatic living conditions, amid allegations and reports of rape, sexual assaults.An independent investigation, by the former integrity commissioner Philip Moss, commissioned by Morrison in October 2014, found evidence of rapes and sexual violence on Nauru and Manus Island, and said incidents were often under-reported.The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detentionRead moreIn 2016, Guardian Australia released theNauru files, a collection of 2,000 leaked incident reports detailing harrowing instances of abuse on the island between May 2013 and October 2015. More than half of the reports (51.3%) involved children, even though children made up only about 18% of those in detention on Nauru during the time covered by the reports.Favero said the ASRC had performed its own audit on medical transfers at the time, and said it sometimes took up to 18 months for an asylum seeker to get help on the mainland.“From the point where there was a [doctor’s] recommendation for a medical transfer, sometimes it took up to 12 to 18 months for that to happen, and it only happened as a result of a huge amount of pressure including legal action,” Favero said.In February 2019, five years later, after Morrison became prime minister, Labor and the crossbenchpassed the medevac bill, against the Coalition government, that established a medical panel to oversee medical transfers of people from offshore detention.That law lasted less than 10 months, before it wasrepealedby the Morrison government in December that year.“The decision [to transfer a patient] should have been in doctors’ hands not in bureaucrats and politicians hands which is what that legislation was,” Favero said.Explore more on these topicsScott MorrisonAustralian immigration and asylumAustralian politicsNauruAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

About half the tea consumed in the UK comes from Kenya.The widespread demand for ethical certification is linked to the reputational risk of sourcing from tea-producing regions with a long list of problems. These include low wages, unsafe working conditions, gender inequality and environmentally unsustainable practices.In addition, countries such as India andKenyaare grappling with climate crisis-related weather changes.However critics complain that while buyers for western markets only want to buy certified tea they rarely offer to pay a premium for it.While UK consumers are happy to splurge on coffee, the same is not true of tea. The average price of a teabag is “just 2 or 3p” despite the fact that the cost to grow and pick tea is increasing, according to a recent Fairtrade Foundation report on the subject.Although Rainforest Alliance facilitates certification, it does not set the fees charged by external auditors who evaluate whether growers meet its “sustainable agriculture standard”.The cost of certification depends on factors such as farm size, with growers often grouping together. For a smallholder-managed tea factory the annual cost is estimated to be about $3,000. This could come down however as a streamlined process that cuts the preparation work involved in an audit is being introduced this year.Ronoh said that as the Rainforest Alliance logo “had not demonstrated solid impact commensurate to the costs of implementation, the meeting resolved to suspend the scheme with immediate effect”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would likely have similar sustainability goals but lower compliance costs and less administrative complexity.A spokesperson for the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), an NGO focused on tackling problems in the tea sector, said it hoped the Kenyan suspension would be “short-lived and that a solution to this current impasse will be found”.Certification is a “critical tool to allow all stakeholders in the tea supply chain to ensure that the workers, farmers and communities who rely on tea for their livelihoods are being treated fairly”, the ETP added.Explore more on these topicsFair tradeKenyaTeaFood & drink industryAfricaFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Eventually implicated in anassassination plot, mass shootings and other actions in Europe, the Base went so far as to have a fortified compound and cell in Michigan, led bya US army dropout.Online evidence from its various accounts, several of whichlive on Russian serversto avoid censorship on American sites, shows the Base has real plans for a national gathering this summer where members intend to train in paramilitary drills as in years past.“The Base in [the] USA is preparing for an upcoming national training event,” reads one of its recent posts soliciting crypto donations. “This one might be our most attended training event in [the] USA in a while. We could really use some financial support to help our members with travel expenses.”The post continued: “When you donate money to the Base, you’re investing in a White Defense Force that’s aiming to protect white people from political persecution and physical destruction.”The Base then published a new photo of armed members claiming to be in the midwest, which follows a trend in 2025 of the group bragging about its unafraid American presence. As a sort of taunt to its enemies, on the day of Trump’s inaugurationthe Basereleased a photo of four members somewhere in Appalachia, in what was the largest number of American members in one photo in over a year.Alleged former members of neo-Nazi group claim its leader is Russian spyRead more“The upcoming national training event indicates that the group is seeking to grow and is willing to take the risk of advertising it publicly in advance,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, an analyst of far-right terrorism who has been following the Base’s movements for close to a decade. “The Base appears to be actively seeking to grow in the US.”Fisher-Birch notes that even if the gathering involves “fewer than 20 people”, it is by no means “low profile” and suggests the group sees momentum is on its side.“An event entails planning, coordination, travel and face-to-face meetings between different regional groups, indicating that they operate in an environment where they view the potential amount of risk as acceptable,” he said. “The group has previously stated multiple times that being a member or training with them is a risky endeavor; however, planning a meetup, which they will inevitably use for propaganda purposes, is a different approach than even a year ago, when the group advertised regional activities.”In response to queries about the Base’s latest movements, theFBItold the Guardian that it only investigates people who have or are planning to commit a federal crime and pose “a threat to national security”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet experts unanimously agree: it is the top domestic terrorism threat facing the country. Instead, Patel, the FBI’s director, has gone aboutremoving agents from pursuing the far right, while one of Trump’s first actions in his second term was toprovide unconditional pardons, en masse, to all of the January 6 insurrectionists.Fisher-Birch also pointed out that the Base had taken itself more seriously and upped its activities inUkraineto the tune of calling for the murder of government officials and acts of sabotage – with the clearly stated goal of forming a white ethnostate in the west of the country. Already, the Ukrainian cell has uploaded geolocated videos of some of these attacks, one showing the burning of a military vehicle and what looks like a government electrical box.In a video released on a Russian video-sharing site in mid-May, Rinaldo Nazzaro, the founder and leader of the Base, who is living in St Petersburg, released a video describing the importance of new training videos proving to potential recruits that his group is not just online, but in the real world.“It’s propaganda through actions, not just words,” he said.It isn’t clear where the paramilitary training will take place, but Nazzaro is known to have purchased land in the Pacific north-west that he intended to use as a headquarters for the Base and its activities.Explore more on these topicsFar right (US)Trump administrationFBIRaceUkraineRussiaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We hope to see the same in the NHS, which is why we’re part of the Blood Biomarker Challenge.”The Blood Biomarker Challenge is a multimillion-pound research programme supported by the Alzheimer’s Society, Alzheimer’s Research UK and the National Institute forHealthand Care Research. Its goal is to bring blood tests for dementia diagnosis to the National Health Service by 2029.Oakley said: “Blood tests will be critical to accelerate diagnosis and give more people access to the care, support and treatments they desperately need faster than ever before.“We must see long-term investment in the tools and workforce needed to ensure everyone living with dementia can get an early an accurate diagnosis, which is even more important with disease-modifying treatments on the horizon.”Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “We urgently need to improve how we diagnose dementia and it’s great to see international research working towards this goal.“Blood tests in this study look at p-tau217 and amyloid beta 42/40 and showed the tests offered high accuracy in confirming Alzheimer’s disease.“This study adds to the growing evidence that blood tests can detect the diseases that cause dementia in people with early memory and thinking problems.“An important point to consider is that people taking part in research don’t always reflect the full diversity of those affected by dementia, who might have additional conditions or other characteristics.“That is why work is needed to understand whether these blood tests work in a real-world setting.“In the UK, studies like the Blood Biomarker Challenge are helping to build this evidence. The study is testing blood tests, including p-tau217, in thousands of people from sites across the UK.“This work will be a crucial part of making diagnosis easier and faster, which will bring us closer to a cure.”Explore more on these topicsAlzheimer'sHealthMedical researchDementiaMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

She talks about her love of karaoke, working on a full-length opera and how to deal with fame at a young ageSat 7 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTShareViewers may find Rachel Jones’s paintings “beautiful”, but they should be warned: the artist herself doesn’t love that word.“In our culture, the idea of beauty sadly isn’t discussed in a critical, rich way – it’s much more reductive as a term,” says the 34 year old. “I hope that when people describe the work as beautiful, it doesn’t just stop there.” Her aim, she says, is to pull viewers in deeper, beyond the surface of the work.Despite her youth, Jones is already preparing to open a major retrospective. Her forthcoming show at Dulwich Picture Gallery will see her large-scale, gloriously colourful abstractions hung alongside works from the museum’s collection. It will be Jones’s first institutional solo show in the UK, and also the museum’s first solo show of a contemporary artist in its main exhibition space.“The opportunity I have to look at everything as a whole is incredible,” she says. “It’s not often that you get to do that at such an early stage in your career. It’s a real gift and privilege to look back at what I’ve done in the last six years or so.” After graduating from the Royal Academy Schools in 2019, Jones was picked up by Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, had a work acquired by the Tate, and was part of solo or group exhibitions at Chisenhale Gallery, the Hayward Gallery and the Hepworth Wakefield, as well as galleries and institutions around North America, Europe and Asia.In the past couple of years, though, she has slowed down. She is no longer represented by a gallery and has broadened her practice to include sound and performance as well as painting. “It’s good to learn those different ways of making and how they influence each other,” she says, telling me that sound practice has become more embedded in her day-to-day thinking. Her first big sound work, a short opera called Hey Maudie, was performed at St James’s Piccadilly in 2023. She is now working on expanding it into a full-length opera. “I also want to pour more energy into my karaoke performances,” she says, smiling. “In my personal life, I love to sing karaoke whenever I can, but it’s something I haven’t been able to explore as much as I would like to in my work.”Jones’s cosy studio in Ilford, east London, is stuffed with the accumulation of six years’ work. “Each series of paintings moves forward,” she says, “but it’s happening more drastically in the last year in ways that are quite surprising to me, but really exciting.” She frames such rapid change around learning: she is using colours she is less confident with to give herself a challenge, and pushing herself to be more comfortable using negative space in her paintings, where the canvas is left visible.View image in fullscreenWork by Rachel Jones for her show Gated Canyons at Dulwich Picture Gallery.Photograph: courtesy the artistShe works on raw linen now, rather than cotton canvas, giving her works an earthier, organic texture and tone. “Even if I don’t fully understand what I’m doing, I know to trust my impulses,” she says. “I can wrestle with the process more.” There is a sense of peeling back and then building from the ground up in Jones’s attitude, and in the work itself.When young artists receive the kind of immediate acclaim and scrutiny that Jones did after art school, it can be hard to find the space to reflect. Jones has worked hard to cultivate that space, and her experience of quick fame has trained her to articulate her practice carefully. “There’s a huge desire for artists to embed their work in a narrative,” she says. “I don’t think that’s as useful as people think it is.” As she tells me about the evolutions and experimentations in her latest work, for the Dulwich show and for a site-specific commission at the Courtauld Gallery opening in September, she talks almost entirely about formal elements, rather than storytelling: new ways she uses her medium of oil pastels or new intentions behind her mark-making, not her personal narrative.Rachel Jones: say cheeeeese review – mutating paintings put a grin on your faceRead moreBut there is also a bit of figuration in Jones’s largely abstract practice. From the beginning of her career, she has worked with the motif of the mouth. Her earlier works, such as lick your teeth, they so clutch (2021), now in Tate’s collection, are bright colour fields that use the outlines of teeth to frame form and colour. In the new work, the mouth has become a more defining form. “There is a little bit more vulnerability in the way that I’m using the mouth as a symbol now,” Jones says. Using cartoons as her main visual references, Jones sees the mouths in her latest work as open, maybe yelling or laughing or screaming or crying. “Those are quite extreme emotions,” she says, explaining the way mouths doing those things are usually attached to a body that is dysregulated or overwhelmed.Jones is so adept at describing her process and intention as an artist, but leaves the meaning of her work more open-ended. Each viewer will have their own response to the work: “My way is just one way,” she says. “So many people are intimidated by visual art. I want people to feel like the works invite them to speak.”Rachel Jones: Gated Canyons will be atDulwich Picture Gallery, London, 10 June to 19 October; her commission for theCourtauld Gallery, London, opens on 25 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designPaintinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

It just feels like terrestrial TVRebecca NicholsonSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn 1964, Andy Warhol shot the Empire State Building then turned it into an art film calledEmpire, which is more than eight hours long. I was reminded of this last Christmas when I let my nine-year-old niece choose what to watch on TV. She went straight to the YouTube app and pressed play on a video comparing US and UK chocolate bars. It went into such a tremendous amount of detail that I was mesmerised, not by the content but by how brazenly boring it was. It went on for what felt like hours. It might still be going on now.I wonder if this is what television natives get wrong about YouTube. In all the discussions about disappearing attention spans and “second screen” viewing – ie scrolling on your phone while leaving a single brain cell free to drool at whatever product placementEmily in Parishas just dropped into the “plot” – there is an assumption that online content has to be short and snappy. That might be more true of TikTok or Reels, but YouTube is a place that chews up time then swallows it. Do I know this because I have watched lengthy self-produced documentaries about complete strangers’ walking holidays? Look, in the 60s, it would have been art.View image in fullscreenFamily drama … Pinnock and Lee in Beth.Photograph: Channel 4This is what Beth, Channel 4’s “digital original drama”, is trying to contend with. TV has long been worried about the internet coming for its audience, and it’s true that you are about as likely to get a young person watching live terrestrial TV as you are to get them to pick up the phone and have a conversation with you. How can old-fashioned television begin to compete? Should it even bother trying? Channel 4 is giving it a go. It has already made Hollyoaks a “streaming-first” soap, sticking episodes online a day before they appear on E4. Now it is trying a new approach with drama.Beth will appear on YouTube in three 15-minute chunks from Monday 9 June, and on the actual telly as a single 45-minute episode, making it the skorts of the screen: why be one thing when you can be two? Beth is about a glamorous couple called Joe and Molly, played by Nicholas Pinnock and Abbey Lee, who are going through IVF treatment. We see the buildup to a much desired pregnancy, skip forward to the birth, then jump to a few years later, for reasons that would definitely spoil it if they were to be revealed here.This is a family drama. There are brief fantasy sequences, of the children the couple might have, and discussions about what it means for Joe, a Black man, and Molly, a white woman, to have a child who resembles them both. It is also a low-key thriller. There are tensions between the couple, both obvious and implied. Their IVF doctor is overfamiliar and too tactile. Molly’s mother is disproportionately rattled by a child’s simple drawing.View image in fullscreenIn treatment … Lee and Pinnock in Beth.Photograph: Channel 4To add to the genre pile-on, Beth is being billed as science fiction, but knowing this doesn’t do it any favours, because without that knowledge, it looks like a straightforward, if slightly stagey, drama for almost the entire duration. If you do know that it is science fiction, you’re left to constantly anticipate exactly when the science fiction will kick in. For me, that undermines the more weighty emotional scenes, because as Joe and Molly endure both hope and devastation, a nagging voice in my head is wondering if they are going to turn out to be aliens.It’s good that it doesn’t patronise viewers by assuming they won’t have more than five seconds of focus to spare. In fact, it’s so far from giddy that it is almost sedate. Nor does it go for the endless stretch that can afflict online content, where the time restrictions of traditional TV mean nothing, and you watch a man chew a Curly Wurly for what seems like many days. But that does mean that, ultimately, Beth feels like a one-off television drama, albeit one with an eyebrow-raising pivot towards the end. I can’t see what makes it so specifically digital.If one of the existential issues facing TV is how to get young people to pay attention to it, then a meditative drama about IVF, identity and parenthood isn’t necessarily going to solve the problem. But if the idea is to win back some of the older eyeballs who have been distracted by, let’s say (just plucking this out of thin air) an in-depth documentary about a niche ultramarathon, then it might be on to something.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDramaScience fiction TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His new film is a haunted, social-realist drama with elements of Mike Leigh but also moments of thriller and even horror. Williams isn’t shy of stabbing us with an old-fashioned jump scare towards the end, which in fact challenges the audiences with its refusal of categorisation. There are two superb lead performances from Andrea Riseborough and Brenda Blethyn and an outstanding supporting turn from Jason Watkins.Dragonfly is about loneliness and alienation and about the eternal mystery of other people, the fear of intimacy and the unknowable existence of urban neighbours. Elsie, played by Blethyn, is an older woman who is quite capable of independent living in her bungalow, but a recent fall and an injured wrist has meant that her middle-aged son (Watkins), all too obviously to compensate for not visiting that often, has paid for daily visits from a private agency nurses. They are overworked and not doing an especially good job. Really, she doesn’t need these nurses and by enduring them, Elsie is shouldering the burden of her son’s guilt.Meanwhile nextdoor neighbour Colleen, played by Riseborough, is a continuingly strange presence. She is a melancholy, withdrawn figure, evidently on benefits and living with her huge American bull terrier, uncompromisingly named Sabre. Williams shows us that she is effectively living in a kind of platonic relationship, ormariage blanc, with this dog; the film periodically gives us startling shots of Sabre’s colossal body in a kind of domestic nakedness sprawled on Colleen’s bed.In a manner that may be insidious or predatory or just friendly and compassionate, Colleen befriends Elsie; the latter overcomes her initial nervousness of Sabre and she appreciates Colleen’s forthright offer of help. Colleen goes down to the shops to get groceries for Elsie and after a few such trips they agree that what would be easiest would be if Colleen simply gets Elsie’s debit card and Elsie gives her the pin number. Of course, the film allows us to suspect the worst and then suspect the worst of ourselves for suspecting it. Colleen seems to be unhappy and damaged but well-meaning, especially when she (for a laugh) buys them both a two-way radio so they can easily keep in contact – but then uses this radio to talk to Elsie late at night and semi-intentionally to allow bewildered Elsie to hear what’s happening in Colleen’s house.It is a riveting dual portrait of two gloomy people who really have, in a strange and dysfunctional way, found a new way of interacting and – importantly – this is a triangular relationship: Elsie, Colleen and the vast Sabre. But with a terrible inevitability, Elsie’s uptight busybody son John (Watkins) arrives and there are awful consequences to a conversation he has with Colleen which Williams only shows us in long shot, withholding the truth about what he’s saying. It’s a stark, fierce, wonderfully acted film.Dragonfly screened at theTribeca film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAndrea RiseboroughTribeca film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been 25 years of GiffordsCircusand Tweedy the Clown is larking about with a deck chair. It’s all very silly and very British; an unassuming vaudeville act that takes great skill but mainly just feels full of joy. My four-and-a-half-year-old son, Benji, is up way past his bedtime but is having a ball watching a show that celebrates the tremendous skill of Giffords’ performers – but also their passion and commitment, which light up Laguna Bay with a special kind of warmth and magic.A feeling of family runs through all Giffords productions. Lots of the performers are related and most have been working in circus their whole lives. The show is also performed in memory of founder Nell Gifford, which imbues everything with a delicate sort of tenderness. The Ethio-Salem Troupe have been with Giffords Circus from the beginning and, in costumes that explode with colour, they bounce wildly about the circus tent. First they throw skittles. Then they throw themselves. Later they’ll jump through hoops and, finally, through fire. All of it feels effortless, somehow very human and full of love.Ahead of the show, Benji and I read the programme notes and come across Pablo and Vickki Garcia’s act, A Sensation in the Sky. I warn Benji there won’t be an actual plane. Same goes for Daniela Muñoz Landestoy andNoémi Novákovics’s hair-hanging act. They may not actually be hanging from their hair. But I’m wrong. The Garcias dangle from a plane the couple made themselves. At one point, Vickki Garcia seems to be holding on to the plane – and spinning wildly – with just her mouth. The hair hangers really do dangle from their hair. Benji cannot believe what he is seeing.View image in fullscreenHair raising … Daniela Muñoz Landestoy and Noémi Novakovics.Photograph: Spencer McPherson / stillmovingmediaThere’s so much more, in a night crafted with precision and ease by directorCal McCrystaland choreographer Kate Smyth. The show’s loose theme is 50s America, so there’s a bubblegum aesthetic to proceedings and a relaxed and romantic feel to the live onstage music. Nothing seems like hard work – even when aerial artist Randy Forgione Vega is soaring overhead (“He’s like Iron Man,” cries Benji) or the Garcia brothers (sons of Pablo and Vickki) are contorting their bodies in ways unimaginable, all while wearing silly pyjamas and cheeky smiles.Tweedy the Clown has been with Giffords Circus for more than 20 years and is a constant presence on stage, playfully undermining the acts and keeping things light. The night’s best skit doesn’t involve high-wire stunts, dancing horses or dazzling magic. It features giant tubs of fake ice-cream and lashings of water (mostly splashed over the audience). Another highlight sees Tweedy pull a white ribbon out of his mouth. Over and over again. Benji shouts out gleefully: “Will it go on for ever?” And if Benji had anything to do with it, that ribbon would just keep on spiralling, way past his bedtime and into his dreams.AtChiswick House and Gardens, London, until 22 June.

Theatr Clwyd’s bold redevelopment continues, but the main auditorium and light-filled foyers are already open (the stunning views from this theatre on a hill have never gone away). Kate Wasserberg, for her first production as artistic director, picks Jonathan Larson’s memoir musical: a show that refuses to apologise for the urgent necessity of making art.It’s New York in 1990: the city of scuzzy apartments and fragile hopes that Larson would immortalise inRent. Jonathan is living on a hustle and a dream, desperate to compose a Broadway show. As he turns 30, his unrealised ambition is all-consuming; he’s too tangled up in frets and feelings to be properly present for his girlfriend, Susan, and best friend, Michael.Curtain up! Meet the new artistic directors with great plans for British theatreRead moreTime is flying, everything is dying. A revolve neatly suggests Jonathan’s fear that he can’t set his own pace – life is going too fast, his career too slowly. This “pre-midlife crisis” could seem frivolous, but the heartbreak, the anxiety over health and money all feel real, especially in Wasserberg’s production, which is tender with the characters.Larson performed this as a solo; it was itself redeveloped after his death in 1996. His heady score is richly varied, from introspective ballad to guitar-hero antics, from zippy vaudeville to shimmering Sondheim homage. All arrive with gusto from the balcony band and tireless cast. Ryan Owen gives Jonathan restless fingers, taut smiles and a resonant sob of a voice. He bounces feelingly off Tarik Frimpong’s twisty, animated Michael and Christina Modestou’s terrific Susan, a performance of ample wit and warmth.This is also a soft launch for technical bells and whistles. Katy Morison’s lighting shifts from chill to flare (with a last neon flourish). Amy Jane Cook’s set design inserts evocative sections of rooms and roofs, and is as multitasking as the actors: a diner bar spins to become a BMW. With posters for Hair and Merrily We Roll Along on Jonathan’s wall, this show is a theatre kid’s apotheosis.It’s also a statement of intent.

A study found toxins in all the brands it testedChemicals found in the braiding hair have been linked to increased cancer risk and organ damageGloria OladipoSat 7 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 07.01 EDTShareIn recent years, personal care products marketed at Black women have received increased scrutiny for their toxicity, specifically chemical hair straighteners. These perms, also known as “relaxers”, have been condemned for causing severe health problems, including fertility issues, scalp irritations and increased risk of cancer.In light of this, many Black women have turned to natural hairstyles, including braids, as a way to avoid toxic chemicals. But recent research has revealed that popular brands of synthetic braiding hair, human-made extensions that are used in these protective styles, contain dangerous carcinogens, heavy metals and other toxins. Tested brands included in a recent study from Consumer Reports (CR) were Magic Fingers, The Sassy Collection, Shake-N-Go, Darling, Debut, Hbegant and Sensationnel, all mass producers of synthetic braiding hair.Accordingto the CR study, all tested samples of braiding hair containedvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), human-made chemicals found in paints, industrial solvents and other products. Exposure to VOCs can cause health problems, including respiratory issues, nausea and fatigue. Long-term exposure has been associated with increased cancer risk and organ damage.Contact with chemicals in synthetic hair doesn’t only occur when the hair is installed – exposure can take place under a variety of circumstances. For instance, synthetic braiding hair can be “brittle”, causing smaller pieces of hair to break off on to hands and be accidentally consumed, said Dr James Rogers, director and head of product safety testing at CR. “Even ingesting just a small amount of braiding hair material could possibly give you enough lead exposure to push you over the limit of what is considered safe,” Rogers said.Over 3,000 beauty products targeting Black women contain health hazards, study showsRead moreFor Black people globally, braids are among the most common and beloved hairstyles. Some braided hairstyles involve plaiting extensions into one’s natural hair to achieve a range of styles, such as box braids, knotless braids, twists, goddess braids and more. These styles, worn by people of all ages, typically remain installed for weeks at a time, acting as a low-maintenance hairstyle that can promote hair growth and combat breakage.Beyond convenience, braids carry cultural significance. Since the advent of the 1960s natural hair movement, braided styles represented an embrace of one’s afro-textured hair and Black identity more broadly, a political stance amid the popularization of relaxers.In recent years, new research looking into the health effects of chemical straighteners only boosted the popularity of braids. A 2022 National Institute of Environmental Health Sciencesstudyfound that perms increased the risk of uterine cancer. The revelatory study followed 33,497 US women between the ages of 35 and 74 for 11 years and assessed their cancer risks. For women who used hair straightening products frequently – more than four times in a year – their cancer risk more than doubled.The investigation unleashed a flood of public outcry and calls for federal regulation of chemical straighteners. Thousands of women who had used such productsjoined class-action lawsuits, alleging that they had contracted cancer from the hazardous hair products. But worries about synthetic hair raise new concerns about how Black women – both hair braiders and customers – can still be exposed to dangerous chemicals even when they opt for chemical-free hairstyles.What the study saidThe latest CR study first tested 10 of the most popular brands of synthetic braiding hair, said Rogers. Of the 10 brands tested, three contained benzene, a chemical linked to an increased risk of leukemia. Nine samples contained lead above the level deemed safe by experts. At least five samples contained more than 500,000 measurable VOCs; four samples had over 1m.Researchers then considered how exposure to chemicals on synthetic hair might take place to better understand the posed health risks. In addition to ingestion of the hair, a likely scenario with the most intense form of exposure, braids are typically dipped in hot water or singed with an open flame to seal in the style, offering another opportunity for chemical exposure.View image in fullscreenSonia Ekemon styles box braids for her daughter, Catherine, 12, at African Braiding Salon by Sonia Ekemon, her business located at Phenix Salon Suites in Meridian, Idaho.Photograph: Idaho Statesman/TNSThe CR report builds on limited research on toxins in synthetic braiding hair. A pilot studypublished in 2020by scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder identified at least nine types of VOCs in emissions produced by heated synthetic hair.Chrystal Thomas, a medical student at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, previouslypublished an articleon the topic in the Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal. Her particular interest stemmed from an adverse reaction she suffered after getting braids in 2023. Thomas said she immediately noticed that her braids had an odor, similar to “new car or mattress”. Thomas attempted to wash her hair multiple times, but could not get rid of the smell. She also began to experience a host of alarming symptoms. “I would have trouble breathing,” she said, after getting braids. “I thought my throat would be very dry and it would feel like it was [tightening] up.” Within a week, Thomas decided to take her braids out to gain some relief.Research on the subject was hard to come by, said Thomas, even asdozens of Black womenhave written about negative, physical reactions they had to synthetic hair. “Representation [in science] matters a lot. My experience is not unique,” said Thomas. “People who have been using synthetic braids have been speaking about this, but researchers haven’t necessarily had access to those voices.”The fight for an alternativeThe CR study results were unsurprising to Dr Kristian Edwards, a former public health professor at George Washington University. Edwards has tracked chemicals in Black beauty products for years, and in 2017,she founded BLK+GRN, a marketplace for Black-owned, non-toxic products.Ingredients listed on beauty products, including braiding hair, lack “transparency”, said Edwards, with consumers assuming that products being sold in stores must be safe. “It requires diligence on consumers to check and make sure that all products they are using are safe, which is disheartening,” she said.There has also been a stark increase in “undisclosed ingredients”, Edwards added. Ananalysis published last monthby the Environmental Working Group found that 80% of more than 4,000 beauty products geared towards Black women have at least one moderate hazard, with many brands not disclosing what was in their products.Current methods of regulation also aren’t as effective, Edwards said. Focusing solely on what ingredients are toxic “gives the manufacturer space to keep using ingredients that haven’t been researched as much, but may be just as toxic”, she said.Overall, researchers are calling for more research on the health impacts of braiding hair and testing of more products, including plant-based extensions and human hair. With investigations into synthetic braiding hair, many consumers have gravitated towards those options, but synthetic braiding hair alternatives still involve some chemical process.Explore more on these topicsWomen's hairBlack US cultureHealthBeautyWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I chase that feeling a lot in the kitchen, and it’s how I feel when I eat a great salad, all vibrant and energised, as if I’ve just cycled through gorgeous countryside or been on a hike. I find it hard to write recipes for such salads, though, perhaps because there are often so many ingredient variations and little precedence, but today’s one made the cut. If you make it, please let me know if it made you feel “perky” in any way.Black rice, red cabbage and tempeh saladTempeh is widely available in big supermarkets these days, and I like the ones produced byTibaandTofoo, but I also love the small-batch tempehs made byTempeh MeadesandClub Cultured.Prep20 minCook25 minServes4generously125g black rice(not glutinous)Fine sea salt3 tbsp toasted sesame oil4 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp white miso paste– I likeMiso Tasty2 limes, zested and juiced (to get 3 tbsp juice)2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced4cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated2½ tbsp maple syrup2 spring onions, trimmed, finely sliced, rinsed and drained60g whole almonds, roughly chopped300g tempeh, cut into 1cm-wide strips200g red cabbage, finely shredded2 pak choi(250g), washed and thinly sliced lengthways50g bunch basil, leaves picked to get 30gBoil the rice in salted water according to the packet instructions (as a general rule of thumb, I use a teaspoon of salt for every litre of water), then drain and put to one side.While the rice is cooking, get on with the rest of the salad.

Transfer to the plate and sprinkle with a big pinch of salt.Rinse out the pan, then heat the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil. Once it’s hot, lay in the tempeh strips and fry for three minutes on each side, until golden and crisp. Add the cabbage, cook for another three minutes, until wilted, then tip the lot into the dressing bowl. Add the pak choi to the bowl, too, toss to combine, then fold in the rice and basil leaves.Tip out in a big mound on to a platter and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkRiceSaladMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Watching her give birth sent his opinion of her stratosphericFind more stories fromThe moment I knew seriesAs told toDoosie MorrisSat 7 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 20.39 EDTShareIn 2018 I had just started lecturing in nursing at a university in South Australia. It was the start of the academic year and I was new to town, so a colleague and I decided to check out the open-day stalls. I’d been vegan for a few years and was hoping to meet some like-minded folk.A person in a Sea Shepherd hoodie pointed me in the right direction and I was immediately struck by this woman sitting in the middle of the stall. It’s a moment captured in resin in my mind – there was a crowd of people and cupcakes on the table. I would say I was 13 paces away from Laura when I first clapped eyes on her. She was just breathtaking; smiling, happily chatting to people. She seemed to have this immense gravity to her and I could feel myself getting pulled into her orbit. I chatted to her and a few others and left the encounter absolutely stunned. No work got done for the rest of the afternoon. I didn’t know what to make of it. It was a struggle to even accept she existed. I was in shock but I did my best to brush it aside.I was married at the time, but things weren’t going well. I definitely wasn’t looking for love, but I joined the Vegan and Vegetarian Club and we saw each other in passing over the next few months. During that time I discovered Laura was in a relationship too.View image in fullscreenAdam and Laura in 2019Six months later I was going through a divorce and I learned Laura had also separated from her partner. But her situation was a lot more complicated; not only was she still living with her ex to care for their three-year-old, she was also five months pregnant.It sounds absurd to say, but these details felt peripheral to me. Such was the chemistry between us that we managed to turn the famously unsexy annual general meeting of the Vegan and Vegetarian Club into our first romantic encounter. We kissed by the campus lake and I was a goner.We agreed that whatever we were getting into was temporary. With a preschooler and baby on the way, and life as a single parent to get used to, a new partner was a convolution she didn’t feel she needed. I knew I very much fell into the nice-to-have, not need-to-have category. I thought I was OK with that. I even tried to date other people. But being with Laura was like having the colours of the world turned up to 11. Every other encounter paled in comparison; I only had eyes for her.As her pregnancy progressed, I found myself helping her more and more. Each day we felt ourselves slipping into a relationship and each day she reminded me that we weren’t serious.When her waters broke six weeks early, I was the one who took her to the hospital and helped advocate for her. The midwives weren’t taking the situation seriously and from a professional perspective I knew they were dropping the ball. Eventually they conceded Laura was likely going to experience a preterm birth. The following days were intense, but I never left her side.In a gesture of what I’d like to think of as “radical acceptance” – and much to Laura’s chagrin – I installed a baby capsule in my car. Despite her protestations, I knew deep down I’d be the one to drive her and the baby home from hospital when the time came.View image in fullscreenAdam and Laura on a hike in 2024Not long after that, she went into labour. If I thought I found Laura impressive before, watching her give birth sent my opinion of her stratospheric. By the time the staff agreed to check how she was progressing, she was 10cm dilated and ready to push. By that point her confidence with the staff was at such a low ebb she rejected their offer of a wheelchair and instead elected to walk herself up a flight of stairs to get to the birthing suite. I was in absolute awe. Our daughter was born shortly after.The moment I knew: I was complaining about my mum, and his tender response changed my lifeRead moreOnce the pressures of having a baby in the neonatal intensive care unit had passed, I asked Laura when she wanted me out of the way. “If I wanted you gone, you wouldn’t be here,” she told me. “I don’t want you to go.”She was showing such vulnerability, and it wasn’t easy for her. But in that moment I could see her own radical acceptance had hit home. I knew all too well I was madly in love; it turned out I wasn’t the only one.Seven years later our blended family has grown to include two more children. In 2023 I proposed to Laura onnational television. She said yes.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

We look at the deals and explain why it’s worth saving up a 5% deposit or moreUK mortgage guarantee scheme due to endRupert JonesSat 7 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 03.09 EDTShareSaving up for a deposit is one of the biggest challenges facing would-be homeowners, who can find that each month pretty much all most of their money is being swallowed up by rent and living costs.No-deposit deals – known as 100% mortgages – can provide a lifeline, and in recent months a new crop have come on to the market.But in return for not having to put down a deposit, you will have to pay a higher interest rate. Also the affordability rules and lending limits that apply on these loans mean they probably will not be an option for many buyers in pricier areas such as London or for some people considering a larger property.This type of mortgage is controversial, too, because homebuyers who take them out are particularly vulnerable to house price falls, as they have no equity to cushion them if there is a drop in the value of their home. Even a small fall in prices could leave some owing more on their mortgage than their home is worth.We have looked at the details of each of the no-deposit deals. We also explain how, if you can manage to save up a deposit – 5% is good, but 10% is better – this will give you access to more competitive rates and reduce your monthly outgoings.100% dealsStandard home loans where the borrower does not have to put down a deposit used to be fairly common but disappeared after the 2007-08 financial crisis when lenders were concerned about the outlook for property prices.Two years ago, Skipton building society launched a 100% deal, called Track Record, aimed at people who are now renting, or were until very recently.Last month, two more lenders, AprilMortgagesand Gable Mortgages, launched their own no-deposit deals.It is very difficult to single out one 100% deal as “the best” on the market, says Mark Harris, the chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. “There are positives and potential drawbacks to every product. Every borrower’s situation is different and therefore different outcomes will apply.”At the time of writing, Skipton’s Track Record mortgage was offering the lowest interest rate. It’s only available as a five-year fixed-rate loan, and you can choose from two rates – 5.29%, or 5.39% with £1,000 cashback. There is no fee.Track Record “is ideal for renters with a proven history of paying on time”, says Nicholas Mendes at the broker John Charcol. You need to show proof of having paid rent for at least 12 months in a row on a UK property (with no arrears) in the last 18 months, and have not owned a UK property in the last three years.Since its launch, Skipton has loosened its affordability rules a little so that “in some circumstances” it will offer loans that have monthly repayments of up to 120% of the rent the customer has been paying. The maximum you can borrow is 4.49 times your annual income (for single and joint applicants), rising to 4.75 times if that income is more than £50,000.View image in fullscreenSkipton was the first in the UK to offer 100% mortgages again, and it’s Track Record product has the lowest interest rate among no-deposit deals.Photograph: True Images/AlamyA cap of about 4.5 times income is fairly standard when UK lenders are assessing what people can afford, but it means some house-hunters in higher-priced areas will not be able to borrow enough to buy.The Skipton deal could allow a couple with a joint income of £55,000 to borrow up to £261,250.For those looking to borrow more than 4.5 times income, Gable may be able to help. Its 100% deals are potentially the ones that will allow buyers to borrow the most, says Mendes. The lender will let individual key workers borrow up to five times income. For couples who are both key workers, applicants can borrow up to 5.5 times. Gable’s definition of key workers includes NHS clinicians (nurses, paramedics, doctors, etc), teachers and childcare providers, university lecturers, police officers and armed forces personnel.Gable offers two five-year fixed-rate mortgages aimed at first- and second-time buyers. Its rates are higher than Skipton’s: 6.29% for the standard deal, or 5.99% for those buying a new-build home from one of its partner developers.April Mortgages takes a different tack with its 100% deals: you have to take out a fixed rate lasting for 10 or 15 years. These are not cheap: the 10-year fix is priced at 6.29%, while the 15-year deal is 6.53%. But an unusual feature of this mortgage is that your rate gradually falls as you pay it off. April will automatically reduce the interest rate when the customer drops into a lower “loan-to-value” (LTV) band.The April deals are particularly suited to those who expect to make regular overpayments or plan to reduce their balance quickly, says Mendes. For example, someone expecting a pay rise or inheritance later down the line.April’s maximum loan is 4.49 times income, and it does not lend on flats or new-builds.View image in fullscreenAffordability rules and lending limits mean no-deposit mortgages are probably not be an option for many buyers in pricier areas.Photograph: Tony Tallec/AlamyNearly 100% dealsYorkshire building society offers the £5k Deposit mortgage, which, as the name suggests, requires a minimum £5,000 deposit. You can borrow up to 99% of the price of the property.The mortgage is a five-year fixed-rate deal, now set at 5.48%.The 3 & Easy mortgage from Vida Homeloans lets you borrow 97%. You have to fix for five or seven years, and the rates are definitely at the higher end – they start at 7.14% – but these deals are designed for borrowers who may not qualify for a standard home loan.“These 100% or near-100% LTV deals are not about chasing the cheapest rate – they’re more about access,” says Mendes. “They aim to support those who are financially stable month to month but haven’t had the means to save a large deposit, whether that’s due to high rent, childcare costs or lack of family help.”100% with helpFor those with parents or other family members willing and able to provide financial assistance, such as putting up security for the home loan, there are other no-deposit options.Lloyds Bank’s Lend a Hand mortgage and Halifax’s virtually identical Family Boost are available in England and Wales, and allow a first-time buyer to borrow between 95% and 100%. No deposit is required – instead, a family member has to put 10% of the purchase price into a three-year fixed-rate savings account to act as security.View image in fullscreenFor many first-time buyers, a fixed-rate deal is probably the way to go because it offers the certainty of set monthly payments.Photograph: ijeab/Getty ImagesIn both cases you have to sign up to a three-year fixed-rate mortgage, and at the time of writing, the interest rates were surprisingly competitive: 4.44% and 4.59% respectively. After three years, your family member will get back their savings with interest, as long as your mortgage repayments have all been made.Barclays has the similar Family Springboard mortgage, which is a five-year fixed-rate deal in which those borrowing 100% pay 5.29%. Other lenders offering deals of this type include Vernon building society.95% mortgagesIf you are able to pull together a 5% deposit – perhaps with help – that will give you access to a much bigger choice of deals, and more competitive interest rates.There were 462 deals that let people borrow 95% of a property’s value available last month, according to the financial data provider Moneyfacts. That is more than double the number you could choose from two years ago.Nationwide is worth a look because it will let eligible first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings when taking out a five- or 10-year fixed rate for up to 95% of the property’s value. This scheme is called Helping Hand and it means a couple with a joint income of £55,000 and a 5% deposit may be able to borrow up to £330,000 compared with the maximum £247,500 under Nationwide’s standard lending.This week, one of the cheapest standard 95% deals was a 4.75% five-year fix offered by Monmouthshire building society. For those looking for a two-year fix, the cheapest deals included one from the Co-operative Bank priced at 4.83%.For many first-time buyers, a fixed-rate deal is probably the way to go because it offers the certainty of set monthly payments. However, with most experts expecting more interest rate cuts, some borrowers may be considering a base-rate tracker so they can benefit from lower payments in future. With a tracker, the rate moves down, or up, in line with the Bank of England base rate. This week, one of the lowest-cost 95% tracker mortgages was a two-year deal from Newcastle building society where you pay 5.15% (base rate plus 0.9%). However, the deal had a £1,999 product fee.Alternatively, Furness building society had a two-year discounted rate deal at 4.99% (a 3.25% discount off its standard variable rate) with no product fee.90% mortgagesStump up a deposit of 10%-plus and there will be even more deals you can access. Last month, there were 876 mortgages on the market that allowed people to borrow 90% of a home’s value.Halifax has a scheme not dissimilar to Nationwide’s called First Time Buyer Boost that lets people borrow up to 5.5 times income, provided their total income is £50,000-plus and the amount being borrowed does not exceed 90%.This week, the cheapest five-year fixes at 90% included Leek building society’s deal priced at 4.38%, while the best-value two-year fixes included Furness building society’s 4.45% interest rate.All rates and product details correct at time of writingExplore more on these topicsMortgagesPropertyMortgage ratesBanks and building societiesConsumer affairsHouse pricesBankingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And, seemingly, a new national dress code.Since the release of the Cowboy Carter album, Beyoncé fans have been quick to adopt the rancher style, sparking a surge in interest for western-inspired fashion. On Vinted, searches for “western” are up by 16% year on year this month, with “rodeo” up 13%. Meanwhile, denim searches have risen 8%.At PrettyLittleThing, searches for “cowboy jackets” surged by more than 600% in May, and demand for cowboy hats and boots increased by 85% and 53% respectively.Beyoncé’s influence on fashion and buying habits is a reminder of how pop culture continues to shape consumer behaviour, said Candace Baldassarre, a senior analyst at market research firm Mintel.“Western aesthetics are experiencing a revival in fashion. This trend has been highlighted by high-profile cultural moments, such as Beyoncé’s embrace of western style, notably her ‘Canadian tuxedo’ [double denim] and her song Levii’s Jeans.“The impact of such celebrity influence has prompted brands like Levi’s to be playful and responsive on social media, even temporarily changing their name and logo to match Beyoncé’s stylisation.”View image in fullscreenBeyoncé fans heading to her concert in Inglewood, California, in May.Photograph: Juliana Yamada/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesIn the week after the album dropped in 2024,Levi Strauss & Co reported a 20% increase in footfall at its US stores, alongside a 20% rise in its share price. Meanwhile, searches for “women’s Levi’s jeans” on the John Lewis website in the UK have jumped by 263% in the same period.Levi’s later launched a campaign with Beyoncé, includingbaby tees with the artist’s stylised double “ii”on the brand logo.However, the renewed interest in western style is about more than nostalgia, according to Dr Elizabeth Kealy-Morris, a senior lecturer in dress and belonging at Manchester Metropolitan University. It reflects a reclaiming of narratives that have often been sidelined or erased from mainstream cultural memory.“The western genre, in literature, film and television enshrined the white cowboy as the symbol of national identity, masculinity, and resilience,” she said, though these were “manufactured artefacts” rather than historical truths.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She had other ideasPlus tips on travelling with dogsNick DuerdenSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhen, two years ago now, our dog sitters cancelled on us just 24 hours before we were due to go on our summer holiday, we felt more than a little put out. Aware that we couldn’t leave Missy, our border terrier, home alone with a tin opener, we sent out frantic texts and made urgent phone calls before at last finding someone, a friend of a friend of, I think, another friend, and simply hoped for the best. What else were we to do? The flights were non-refundable.It all turned out fine, but it was not an experience we were keen to repeat. And so, the following year, we took Missy with us.Dogsare portable, after all, and have a nose for adventure. Also, this was to be an extended holiday, away for a full month – working part time in order to fund it – and we couldn’t be apart from her for that long.Missy had grown bored with our local parks, so I thought she would enjoy the break. Isn’t hindsight a wonderful thing? My wife and I set off in a state of high excitement – our girls waving us goodbye, then promptly disappearing inside to plan illicit parties.View image in fullscreenNick Duerden and Missy in Saumane-de-Vaucluse.Photograph: Nick DuerdenAs we drove first to France, where we were to spend a week, and then to north-eastern Spain for three, the dog sat bolt upright for the entire journey, panting heavily, her tongue practically down between her knees. At each motorway pit stop, she pulled me towards unfamiliar smells with an urgency that bordered on the deranged, and then, once we had arrived, she remained in a state of perpetual confusion. If we were enjoying the novelty of a new neighbourhood, a new language, and alfresco meals that ran late into the evening uninterrupted by Netflix, Missy didn’t.Seeing her tail tucked tightly into her body, I became convinced she’d sunk into a depression. The dogs she encountered during our daily walks were baldly antagonistic towards her (revenge for Brexit?) and she took to hiding between my legs. This was not good. Just like Withnail and I, it felt increasingly as if we had gone on holiday by mistake.As we drove to France, the dog sat bolt upright for the entire journey, panting heavilyA decade into our first experience of dog ownership, we had come to feel a certain relief that Missy was one of the good ones: calm, not easily riled, gloriously uncomplicated. She had no separation anxiety, was good off the lead, and always happy. But when I speak to Simon Wooler, author of the dog training guideMore Than Just a Dog, he explains that travelling with animals is rarely straightforward. “There are a lot of issues that might not initially occur,” he says. “Like, does your dog travel well? Are they prone to travel sickness?”France, we were quick to learn, would prove hostile towards Missy, its green spaces flaunting NO DOGS signs, the locals frowning whenever she squatted to relieve herself. We were staying in the hilltop village of Saumane-de-Vaucluse, Provence, by a golf course we had no interest in using, but with a pool we very much did want to enjoy. Missy wasn’t allowed near the water, and so we left her indoors. That she refused the familiar parting gift of a meaty treat was surprising – she just pinned back her ears, and slunk away. She’d never done that before.View image in fullscreenThe writer and his dog in Peratallada, near Girona in Spain.Photograph: Nick Duerden“It’s the unfamiliarity of the place,” Wooler tells me. “It might have been causing her anxiety.”Clearly. When I went back to check on her, my walk was accompanied by the intriguing sound of howling, and I immediately came over all Chris Packham: were these French deer? A Provençal owl? An ancient tribe of Gallic wolves? I then realised that it was coming fromher, my inconsolablechienne.The next day, we set up Zoom on the laptop to monitor the situation. Again she refused the offer of a treat and, as we bid her goodbye, she walked off to face the nearest wall. Within 10 minutes of our departure, she began again to howl, like Kate Bush on Wuthering Heights, necessitating one of us to rush back to her, full of guilt and apology. We ended up taking turns staying in with her while the other went to the pool alone, which might have proved interesting if this were The White Lotus, or we were swingers, but it simply meant that we were spending most of our days apart. In the evenings, because she wasn’t allowed in restaurants, we took to eating takeaways on park benches.At night, riddled with insomnia, she would sit by our bed whimpering, then refuse any comfort we offered‘To me it’s a fad, a fashion’: rising demand for dog-friendly UK holidays divides opinionRead moreAs desperate people tend to do, we told ourselves that things would get better. We would be in Calella de Palafrugell, a pretty coastal town 80 miles north-east of Barcelona, for three weeks. Here, she would have time to settle; also, the imminent arrival of our daughters might help. But, no. She wasn’t permitted on the beach, and didn’t want to walk. The fierce breeze that whipped through the flat each afternoon slammed doors and shutters as it went. She did not like this. At night, riddled with insomnia, she would sit by our bed whimpering, then refuse any comfort we offered. The night a bat flew into the bedroom, sending each of us screaming in different directions, did not ameliorate the situation.View image in fullscreenMissy didn’t want to walk, and didn’t like being left at the house either.Photograph: Nick DuerdenOccasionally, we tried to behave like normal holidaymakers, visiting churches, cathedrals, shops. But each time, I had to remain outside with her. She didn’t like the pack parting, wanting us all to keep together. On the day we drove to nearby Girona, there was a sudden spike in the temperature – 38C said the sign outside the pharmacy – and so we searched frantically for shade, pouring bottles of water over her, while I Googled “dog heat danger death”. If each of us was counting down the days until our departure, Missy was counting them quicker.When at last we got back home, she made a beeline for the kitchen, and waited impatiently while I unpacked her cushion, then flopped down on it, curled into a comma, and let out the most operatic sigh.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No,” says Wooler, kindly. “Some dogs do enjoy going on holiday with their owners, but others might not. They may need medication first, or to go away for less time. They may simply be happier left at home, with friends or family. Remember that they won’t be missing out if you don’t take them with you.”This year, we’ll send postcards.Paws for thought: how to put your dog at ease before travellingTaking a dog on holiday is not wrong, but bear in mind that they will be in unfamiliar places, and might be feeling somewhat conflicted.If the holiday requires a long drive, then take a few preliminary drives first to gauge whether they get travel sickness. If they do, there is medication and sedatives you can buy.Do some trial runs to unfamiliar places, to see how they fare, and then extend those distances over time. This is much easier with a puppy, but not impossible with adult dogs.Make positive associations with new places by filling them with fun games and nice treats.Ultimately, whether your dog will enjoy the holiday as much as you depends on its personality.Dog essentials when taking your pet on holiday in the EU1 Microchip your pet.2 Vaccinate against rabies.3 Get an animal health certificate from your vet.4 Get tapeworm treatment for your dog.5 On arrival, go through a travellers’ point of entry, to show proof of each of the above.Simon WoolerPeople Who Like Dogs Like People Who Like Dogs by Nick Duerden is published by John Murray Press (£10.99).

The dog places its paw into my wife’s hand. ‘It is my mother!’Tim DowlingSat 7 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTShareThe new dog is now a year old, and her bedtime habits are firmly established: when I retire for the night I invariably find the dog already lying on my side of the bed, her chin resting on my pillow. At this point I usually push her off, whereupon she will retreat to her own – perfectly nice – bed, or sleep on the bare floorboards, depending on the night-time temperature.At around five the dog will leap back on to the bed and tunnel under the duvet head-first, stretching out between my wife and me, leaving only her back legs sticking out the top. That’s how things remain until one of us decides to get up. It’s not ideal, but it’s a routine.The daytime routine is looser. The general rhythm is well established – eat, walk, sleep, walk, eat – but there are random moments when the dog seems to require additional, unspecified engagement, when she sits down next to me on the sofa, places a gentle paw on my forearm and gives me a look that says: we need to talk.“I’m just watching this,” I say, pointing at the television. The dog turns to look at the screen, and then slowly rolls her eyes back toward me. It’s easy to read too much into a dog’s expression, but at times like these I sense deep wells of frustration. Maybe, I think, she just wants me to change the channel to a show with dogs in it.The next day in the park the dog is lively but obedient, off the lead but never straying out of sight, playful with other dogs but willing to take no for an answer. She behaves perfectly right up until the end, when we encounter a woman in a long coat with two dogs of her own. Shortly after we pass by, my dog suddenly stops, turns and hares off after them. I whistle and call her name, but the dog ignores me and follows the woman – a complete stranger – in the other direction, all the while staring up at her with a look of true devotion.The dog sits and looks up, staring at nothing with fearsome concentration“Well, we had some good times,” I say, twirling my lead. Eventually the woman is obliged to stop and head back towards me. We meet halfway, my dog still fixated on the woman, who smiles at me and shrugs.“It’s because I have …” I don’t quite hear the last word – something like “spraahtz” – which in the discomfort of the moment I take to be a foreign term for a powerful form of canine magnetism, perhaps as practised in remote parts of Belgium, or maybe Poland. Then the woman reaches out and hands me a tiny dead fish.“Oh, sprats,” I say.“They love them,” she says.That evening my wife, my oldest son and I are watching television, while the dog sits next to me and stares at my ear.“So the take-home message is: we need to get some sprats,” I say.“I’ve seen them in the pet store,” my wife says.“Apparently they can’t get enough of them,” I say.“Be quiet,” she says. “I’m trying to follow this.”Suddenly the dog barks once, leaps from the sofa, slides across the coffee table and lands on the other side.“What was that for?” says the oldest one.The dog sits and looks up, staring at nothing with fearsome concentration.“What is it?” my wife says.“It’s like she’s witnessing some kind of apparition,” I say. Perhaps an apparition holding a little dead fish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The dog takes two steps forward, and places its right paw into my wife’s outstretched hand.“It is my mother!” my wife shouts.The oldest one and I exchange a brief glance as if to say: bit weird.“Give me your paw again if she misses me,” my wife says. The dog obliges.“That dog only knows one trick,” the oldest one says. “And that’s it.”“A tiny hovering insect,” I say. “Or a baby spider floating on the draught from the windows.”“Thank you for the message from beyond,” my wife says. “Now go lie down, I’m trying to watch this.”The dog climbs on to the sofa and curls up next to me, wearing a look of profound dissatisfaction.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s an unseasonably warm spring afternoon and sunlight is beaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows of a north London photo studio. When I arrive,Little Simzis out on the balcony. Wearing chunky sunglasses, a skirt and comfy cardigan, she sits on a chair with her back to the sun, eyes on the horizon, and pulls her legs up, wrapping her arms around her knees in a defensive position that’s verging on foetal.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s curious body language for an artist at the top of her game. At 31, Simz is looking out at a city she can justifiably claim to have conquered since emerging as a teenage rapper more than a decade ago. But that’s not where she’s at right now. “I genuinely felt like I could disappoint everyone,” Simz says when I ask about the making of her sixth album, Lotus. She gives an impression of what she said to her team at the start of the process. “Sorry, everyone, this could be a big waste of your time, and if it is, I’m truly sorry, but I’m just not confident right now.”The crisis felt terminal, Simz tells me.It sprang from creative fatigue: six albums in a decade and relentless touring tends to do that to solo artists. That spark she naturally had in the studio just wasn’t there this time, perhaps exacerbated by a very public schism with her friend, collaborator and producer Inflo. They are now embroiled in amessy legal battleover an alleged £1.7m in unpaid loans. She’s explained the album title as a reference to “one of the only flowers that thrive in muddy waters”, but the seas she’s been swimming in appear shark infested rather than just murky.She was close to calling it quits. At one point Simz sat down with Lotus producer Miles Clinton James to lay her cards on the table. “I was just real with him. I said, ‘Look, whatever you think this Little Simz shit is … I can’t guarantee that’s possible because I’m not even feeling it myself.’“I just was a bit lost, to be honest,” Simz says.The first time I saw Simz perform was 11 years ago in a dark basement club in east London. She was still a teenager, making her live debut as a support act for the Atlanta rapper Future – tall, skinny and absolutely not fazed by a crowd made up of industry types as well as hardcore rap fans. Contemporary hip-hop can sometimes seem like a game of style over substance – more about the number of followers, the degree of posturing and the right connections than actual ability on the mic. Simz is an antidote to those excesses. Watching her at Glastonbury last year, she appeared with a backing band and little else, dropping into a cappella moments where her voice and lyrical ability were the only tools she needed. But even then, in that little basement back in 2014, she looked born to do it.Since that debut she has risen to become arguably the most exciting British musician of the last decade. There have been awards: aMercury prize, anIvor Novello, aBritand a handful ofMobos. All of her albums have been critically praised, but the last three have cemented her as a mainstream success and darling of the critics. This year she’scurating Meltdown, following in the footsteps of Grace Jones, David Bowie and Chaka Khan, and bringing herself, plus The Streets and Tiwa Savage, to London’sSouthbank Centre. She’s also shooting two films, both still under wraps. And there have been viral online moments, too: aChicken Shop datewith Amelia Dimoldenberg where she talked about her love of Bell Hooks and Muay Thai kickboxing; and a few weeks back shefreestyled with Usherafter one of his sold-out O2 shows.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Jacket:Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood. Knit, shirt and skirt:Miu Miu. Ring:Bunney.Socks:Palace SkateboardsWhat does she think young Simz would make of the artist she’s become today? “I think she’d just be proud,” she says, looking out over the London skyline. “Like, wow, you actually did it. You actually did what you set out to do.”Did she have an established list of goals? “Definitely playing the O2,” she says after a moment’s thought. “Even though that’s not happened yet, it’shappening.” Simz is set to play the venue in October, as part of a UK arena tour in support of Lotus. “Even that is a crazy thing to wrap my head around,” she says. “Or even just, like, going to the States and performing in New York, or curating Meltdown. I don’t even think I knew what Meltdown was back then.”Born Simbiatu Ajikawo in 1994, Little Simz was raised in north London by her Nigerian mother Tola and three older siblings. Her father broke up with her mum and left the family home, which soon buzzed with activity thanks to a steady stream of foster children. “I met so many different kids from all different walks of life who just became part of my family and who my mum nurtured and took care of,” Simz says. “It was really beautiful. I gained newfound respect and appreciation for my family, knowing that it’s not given that everyone has loving support … I never went a day without love.”When Simz won a Brit for best new artist in 2022, she brought her mum out on stage. “It just really felt like she won best album that night and I just went up there to support her,” says Simz, who seems genuinely in awe of her mother. “I thought, wow, you came to this country not knowing anyone, not knowing a word of English, and now your last born has just won a Brit … it’s kind of crazy.”View image in fullscreenLittle Simz with her mother at the Brits, 2022.Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images for Brit Awards LimitedGrowing up in north London, Simz experimented with various artistic disciplines. She danced (the hyperactive early 00s style known as krumping was a favourite); acted (starring in CBBC shows Youngers and Spirit Warriors); and rapped, appearing on stage at the O2 Academy aged 11, reciting her own work as part of a youth club also attended by Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke. The competing creative avenues were all maintained until she hit her mid-teens and a clear winner emerged.“When I was maybe, like, 14 is when music became my world. I was just so immersed in it. This is me. This is what I want to be when I get older,” Simz says. The artists she most looked up to were Missy Elliott and Ms Dynamite. “Watching early Missy videos … the beats were hard, so I always wanted to dance to them and make routines for them.” But what really impressed Simz was her artistry and uncompromising approach. Told by executives she wasn’t thin enough, Elliott shot videos with Hype Williams in billowing black costumes that made a feature of her body type rather than diminishing it.Simz has spoken before about industry figures encouraging her to wear sexualised outfits – something anathema to an artist whose lyrical ability is their superpower. “I don’t want to compromise on that, because at that point I’d stop being myself,” she says. “But maybe something that I wasn’t open to wearing when I was 18, I would now as a grown woman … It just has to feel right.”Like her other hero, Ms Dynamite, Simz addressed the absence of her father in her lyrics. While Dynamite didn’t pull her punches (“I spent 23 years trying to be the fucking man you should be / Taking care of your responsibility / Putting clothes on our back and shoes on our feet, no help” is how she addressed it on her song Father), Simz is more reflective, generous even, in her assessment of her dad, who she still has no contact with.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a new chapter in my life.’ Photograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Jacket, shirt and shorts:Burberry. Jewellery: Little Simz’s ownShe’s written about him before on I Love You, I Hate You, a standout moment from her Mercury prize-winning album from 2022, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. Did his absence complicate her happy memories of childhood? “It doesn’t affect the memories I have growing up. It just wasn’t meant to be between them … but I think there’s still a lot of love there, and I’m sure my dad respects mymum having raised his children, you know? Now that I’m older, I definitely just understand that parents are flawed as well, and I get it. I’ve tried to not hold on to the anger, maybe that I once felt, or like this deep resentment … I’m just trying to let it go.” Was that hard to do? “Definitely, 100%,” Simz says. “Especially when you just internalise a lot of it. Like, did you not love me? Like, did you not …” There’s a pause. “I don’t think it’s any of that. I just think it is what it is, to be honest. But I’ve forgiven him.”That grace isn’t something Simz extends to everyone. One issue that definitely isn’t resolved is her relationship with Inflo, real name Dean Josiah Cover, the producer she’s known since childhood and to whom she paid gushing tribute from the Mercury stage. (“I wanna say a thank you to my brother and close collaborator Inflo – Flo [has] known me since I was so young, he’s stuck by me, we created this album together. There were times in the studio I didn’t know if I was gonna finish this record, I was going through all the emotions … he stuck by me.”) The pair met at Mary’s Youth Club in north London and forged one of the most successful and close producer-artist relationships the UK has seen in the last decade. They didn’t just work on Little Simz records, they were also part of Sault – the mysterious collective that also includes Inflo’s wife Cleo Sol and Michael Kiwanuka. They didn’t play live. Albums were dropped without warning or promotion. They oscillated between R&B, neo-soul and funk, all underpinned by Inflo’s production, earning the group aMercury nominationin 2021. But it’s fair to say that a lot has changed in the last three years. Lotus feels like a breakup record of a sort, not romantic but still deeply personal, as the Simz/Inflo partnership is pulled apart and dissected.In late 2023, Sault put on agig at the Drumsheds. It’s a huge venue in north-east London that used to be anold Ikea store, which they filled with string sections, choristers and teams of dancers. Tickets were priced at £99 a pop, and sold out rapidly. One punter said it was like a mix of Kendrick Lamar’s performance at Glastonbury, a Punchdrunk immersive theatre production, the London 2012 opening ceremony and Talking Heads’ classic concert film Stop Making Sense, “and it was also like nothing you’ve ever seen”. The whole thing cost around £1m, which Simz claims she mostly bankrolled, lending the money to Inflo. Simz’s legal team says she also made significant payments to her former producer to cover recording costs. Inflo’s legal team disputes the details of the claims but he is yet to comment publicly; the case is ongoing.“Clarity” and “directness” are the two words Simz uses to sum up her mindset going into the recording process for Lotus. From the opening track Thief, it’s clear what she’s focusing on. There are barbs (“You talk about god when you have a god complex, when I think you’re the one who needs saving … ”), score settling (“We went for 100 down to nought, and yes it is all your fault … your name wasn’t popping until I worked with you”) and accusations (“This person I’ve known my whole life, coming like the devil in disguise. My jaw was on the floor, my eyes have never been so wide … ”). It’s all delivered with a snarl and a driving bassline that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Nick Cave murder ballad. Her track Lonely features the lines, “Team falling apart and I’m caught in the crossfire / You selling me lies and saying I must buy”; while on Hollow she raps, “You want the best for me allegedly / But all you got is evil eye and jealousy … You was moving like one leech.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Although Inflo isn’t mentioned by name, it doesn’t take a forensic investigator to figure out who the chorus “Selling lies, selling dreams … Thief!” might be aimed at, while “I feel sorry for your wife” appears to be a reference to Inflo’s partner, Cleo Sol. These areFleetwood Mac levels of animosity.Surely there must be huge anxiety before airing all these things in public? “I really just put my life out there and my diary essentially,” she says, sounding like rap’s answer to Rachel Cusk.View image in fullscreen‘Playing the 02 is a crazy thing to wrap my head around.’ Photographs throughout: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Styling: Keeley Dawson. Hair: Chantelle Fuller. Makeup: Nibras using Fenty Beauty. Set design: Elena Horn“I just wanted to be true to the emotion, what I was feeling, and document it, and not shy away from how I feel about stuff, because I don’t want things to eat me up and fester.” She emphasises that the desire for openness is about her mental health. “Because I do think they eat you from the inside out. So for me to not let that happen, I needed to talk about it in so many different ways … from a place of pure hurt and anger and frustration, to a place of sadness.”Simz hasspoken beforeabout her experiences with therapy, in order to cope with seeing friends go to prison, and after the2018 murderof the model Harry Uzoka – anotherchildhood friend, who was stabbed in west London. Simz stayed off social media in the hours after the news broke, instead choosing to go into the studio and write Wounds, an anti-knife crime track on her album Grey Area. Now it seems the place she’s working out her feelings is the recording studio. And she’s under no illusions that there’s a road back to working with Inflo or as part of Sault, who are still releasing new music (though the collective’s Michael Kiwanuka features on the title track, Lotus). “I’m really proud of myself that I was able to do that,” she says. “There’s a legacy built; amazing music was made and I will always love those songs.

About half the tea consumed in the UK comes from Kenya.The widespread demand for ethical certification is linked to the reputational risk of sourcing from tea-producing regions with a long list of problems. These include low wages, unsafe working conditions, gender inequality and environmentally unsustainable practices.In addition, countries such as India andKenyaare grappling with climate crisis-related weather changes.However critics complain that while buyers for western markets only want to buy certified tea they rarely offer to pay a premium for it.While UK consumers are happy to splurge on coffee, the same is not true of tea. The average price of a teabag is “just 2 or 3p” despite the fact that the cost to grow and pick tea is increasing, according to a recent Fairtrade Foundation report on the subject.Although Rainforest Alliance facilitates certification, it does not set the fees charged by external auditors who evaluate whether growers meet its “sustainable agriculture standard”.The cost of certification depends on factors such as farm size, with growers often grouping together. For a smallholder-managed tea factory the annual cost is estimated to be about $3,000. This could come down however as a streamlined process that cuts the preparation work involved in an audit is being introduced this year.Ronoh said that as the Rainforest Alliance logo “had not demonstrated solid impact commensurate to the costs of implementation, the meeting resolved to suspend the scheme with immediate effect”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would likely have similar sustainability goals but lower compliance costs and less administrative complexity.A spokesperson for the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), an NGO focused on tackling problems in the tea sector, said it hoped the Kenyan suspension would be “short-lived and that a solution to this current impasse will be found”.Certification is a “critical tool to allow all stakeholders in the tea supply chain to ensure that the workers, farmers and communities who rely on tea for their livelihoods are being treated fairly”, the ETP added.Explore more on these topicsFair tradeKenyaTeaFood & drink industryAfricaFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

People from another three African countries – Burundi, Sierra Leone and Togo – will be subject to partial restrictions, meaning they will not be able to travel to the US on certain visas.For Geraldo, an alumnus of the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders programme instituted by the Obama administration, the new restrictions compound the harm from Trump’s foreign aid cuts, which made it harder for her to access funding for social projects in the tiny west African state.Mikhail Nyamweya, a political and foreign affairs analyst, said the new travel bans and restrictions would “bring about a pattern of exclusion” and “may also institutionalise a perception of Africans as outsiders in the global order”. “In the short term, they will restrict access to education, innovation and professional mobility. In the long-term, they risk alienating African partners,” he said.The White House deputy press secretary, Abigail Jackson, said the countries on the list “lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates or fail to share identity and threat information”. “President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm,”she said on X, adding that the restrictions were “commonsense”.This interpretation was firmly rejected by Abby Maxman, the president and CEO of Oxfam America, whosaidthe ban “deepens inequality and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, racist tropes and religious intolerance”. She said: “This policy is not about national security. It is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the US.”The policy has deepened a cloud of uncertainty in the affected countries, especially after the US government announced in May that visa appointments for students wishing to study in its universities had been suspended pending expanded social media vetting.There is also fear across Africa about a proposed tax on remittances under Trump’sOne Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is under parliamentary review. If passed into law, the 3.5% tax could severely dent the GDP of many nations, for whom diaspora remittances are a huge contribution.Geoffrey Gichohi, a 34-year-old nurse working in Minnesota, recently sent money to his mother in Kenya – which is not covered by the travel ban – via an app to pay for a concrete wall and a metal gate at their home.Like many Africans abroad, he regularly sends money to his family members back home who rely on it for school fees, healthcare and other basic needs. A new tax – on top of sending and withdrawal fees – would make it more difficult, he said. “The parents back at home in Kenya are the ones who will suffer because they’ll have limited resources,” he said. “Personally, I hope the bill doesn’t get passed.”Human rights activists have criticised the restrictions and planned tax, saying they unfairly target citizens of countries in the global south. Other experts say the moves could further damage US-Africa ties in an era of rising anti-western sentiments on the continent.Feelings of despair are not universal, however. According to Jalel Harchaoui, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, many people in Libya will be unbothered by the new policies as the US is not a major travel destination for them.“It’s not good, but it’s not noticed as something catastrophic,” he said. “People are barely paying attention to [the travel ban] or the [proposed] remittance tax … if the same thing had happened to the UK it would be a major event, but not for the US.”Authorities in many of the affected countries are yet to respond. However, on Thursday afternoon the president of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Déby, suspended the issuance of visas to US citizens, citing the need for reciprocal action.“Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give, but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he said in a Facebook post, referencing Qatar’s controversial gift to theTrump administration.Over the last year, US and French troops have been forced to withdraw from military bases in Chad, which was previously a key ally in the Sahel for many western nations.The reaction from Sierra Leone, another US ally in west Africa, was much mellower. “We have taken note of this proclamation,” said the information minister, Chernor Bah. “Our understanding is that the decision is based exclusively on visa overstay rates and that it does not reflect the broader state of US-Sierra Leone relations, which remain from our perspective strong and productive.”Explore more on these topicsAfricaUS foreign policyTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Termination laws differ across Australian states, but if pregnant women in offshore detention were prohibited from accessing abortion services in Australia until after 20 weeks, it would be far more difficult to access those services at all.‘We just sit here’: the broken men Australia’s offshore detention regime left behind in Papua New GuineaRead moreA handwritten note by Morrison, on a document dated June 2014, stated: “I would also like advice on denying transfer pre 20 weeks for pregnant women.” In the same document, Morrison specified that women should only be transferred to Brisbane, not South Australia, the Northern Territory or Victoria for abortion services.Morrison did not respond to requests for comment, and Guardian Australia cannot confirm what advice he received.View image in fullscreenA handwritten note from Scott Morrison when he was immigration minister, dated 25 November 2014. The note reads: ‘There are to be no transfers to Victoria, SA & NT. Transfer should be to Brisbane, with no further transfer.’ It continues: ‘I would also like advice on denying transfers pre 20 weeks for pregnant women.’Illustration: Department of Home AffairsIn the case of a woman, who was not identified in the redacted documents, medical advice recommended she be transferred to Victoria for an abortion, over Brisbane where she would have had to have waited a week for a hospital ethics panel to consider her case. That policy was in place in Queensland for women seeking a termination after 20 weeks’ gestation. In Victoria, a woman could seek a termination without approval of a hospital ethics board until 24 weeks.Guardian Australia understands the woman was taken to Brisbane, rather than Melbourne, where the panel deliberated on her case.One senior source, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, said Morrison did not specifically target abortion access.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDavid Manne, a prominent refugee advocate and lawyer, said in his view the broader immigration policy at the time was part of an “extreme deterrence agenda”.“Inherent in the [broader] policy was conscious, calculated cruelty,” he said. “Clearly, [the policy] was far more than reckless indifference, it was deliberate.“[It was] part of a system that was underpinned by the extreme deterrence agenda … the basic rights and dignity of people subject to the policy were essentially irrelevant.”View image in fullscreenThe island of Nauru where the Australian government ran immigration detention facilities.Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The GuardianJana Favero, the deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), who was an advocate for the centre at the time, said the documents were “outrageous” and “consistent” with the ASRC’s experience trying to help asylum seekers get medical transfers.“It was extremely challenging and difficult for the medical transfer from people offshore, in particular women who were pregnant,” she said.Manne claimed the Abbott government was concerned asylum seekers and refugees were using medical transfers as a back door to get into Australia.Once in Australia, and in the Australian onshore detention system, an asylum seeker could go to the court to seek an injunction to prevent being sent back to offshore detention.“[They] could plead their case under law to resist being sent back toNauru, to further dangers of the kinds that they’d already faced,” Manne said.This wasn’t the only concern held by the government. Manne said the policy was based on deterrence, to stop others seeking asylumarriving by boat.“If we make some exception, if there’s a perceived crack of light in this policy, this could see the resumption of boat arrivals, that was clearly the thinking.”Later, in 2019, Peter Dutton, by then the home affairs minister in the Morrison government,accused women in Nauru refugee centresof using rape and abortion claims as a ploy to get to Australia.Over the 18 months from 1 January 2013 to 20 June 2014,IHMS, the government contracted healthcare provider for Nauru, said there were six pregnant transferees who were taken to the mainland for a termination. In June 2014, there were 289 women in detention on Nauru, according to data collated by the Refugee Council of Australia.Numerousinternal and external reviewsof offshore detention centres found instances of violence and traumatic living conditions, amid allegations and reports of rape, sexual assaults.An independent investigation, by the former integrity commissioner Philip Moss, commissioned by Morrison in October 2014, found evidence of rapes and sexual violence on Nauru and Manus Island, and said incidents were often under-reported.The Nauru files: cache of 2,000 leaked reports reveal scale of abuse of children in Australian offshore detentionRead moreIn 2016, Guardian Australia released theNauru files, a collection of 2,000 leaked incident reports detailing harrowing instances of abuse on the island between May 2013 and October 2015. More than half of the reports (51.3%) involved children, even though children made up only about 18% of those in detention on Nauru during the time covered by the reports.Favero said the ASRC had performed its own audit on medical transfers at the time, and said it sometimes took up to 18 months for an asylum seeker to get help on the mainland.“From the point where there was a [doctor’s] recommendation for a medical transfer, sometimes it took up to 12 to 18 months for that to happen, and it only happened as a result of a huge amount of pressure including legal action,” Favero said.In February 2019, five years later, after Morrison became prime minister, Labor and the crossbenchpassed the medevac bill, against the Coalition government, that established a medical panel to oversee medical transfers of people from offshore detention.That law lasted less than 10 months, before it wasrepealedby the Morrison government in December that year.“The decision [to transfer a patient] should have been in doctors’ hands not in bureaucrats and politicians hands which is what that legislation was,” Favero said.Explore more on these topicsScott MorrisonAustralian immigration and asylumAustralian politicsNauruAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He appeared in court on Friday to hear the charge and did not apply for bail.Hong Kong’s national security police said in a statement they had arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of the offence, as well as for “dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence”.We used to joke about Hong Kong’s terror laws, but now my friends and family have gone silent |  Alan LauRead moreAccording to the charge sheet, viewed by Reuters and Hong Kong Free Press, Wong is accused of conspiring with fellow democracy activist Nathan Law, who is in exile overseas, and others to ask foreign countries, institutions, organisations or individuals outsideChinato impose sanctions or blockades.He is also accused of conspiring to ask foreign parties to “seriously disrupt the formulation and implementation of laws and policies” in Hong Kong and China, “which was likely to cause serious consequences”, Hong Kong Free Pressreported.The charge comes under Hong Kong’s national security law, which was imposed on the city by Beijing in 2020 after the 2019 pro-democracy protests brought the city to a standstill.The law has beencriticised by foreign governmentsand rights groups as overly broad and ill-defined, and easily weaponised to crush the opposition by criminalising even benign acts of dissent. The Hong Kong and central Chinese governments reject the criticism and say the law was needed to restore order to the city.Wong is due to be released in January 2027. He is serving protest-related sentences, including a 56-month term for his role amongthe so-called “Hong Kong 47”group of politicians, activists, campaigners and community members who held unofficial pre-election primaries in 2020.The cohort were sentenced in November, at the end of Hong Kong’s largest national security trial. Just two of the 47 were acquitted.Human Rights Watch’s associate China director, Maya Wong, called the new charges against Wong “arbitrary, cruel and outrageous”.Hong Kong authorities trying to disrupt independent press with ‘strange’ tax auditsRead more“While imprisoned under one trumped-up charge, Joshua Wong has been suddenly slapped with yet another as the authorities appear intent on keeping one of Hong Kong’s most influential democracy leaders behind bars,” she said.Amnesty International said the new charges could see him given a life sentence if found guilty.“Hong Kong’s national security law is turning five years old at the end of the month, and these new charges against Joshua Wong show that its capacity to be used by the Hong Kong authorities to threaten human rights in the city is as potent and present as ever,” said the organisation’s China director, Sarah Brooks.“Once again, the vague and sweeping offence of ‘collusion with foreign forces’ is being weaponised to justify an attack on the freedoms of expression and association.“This latest charge against him underscores the authorities’ fear of prominent dissidents and shows the lengths they will go to keep them behind bars for as long as possible – in so doing, continuing a chilling effect on civic activism in the city.”Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He confirmed police had contacted Pheobe’s family.“We do hope that this development, coupled with the arrests in recent times, will bring some level of closure to Pheobe’s family so they can begin to move forward with their grieving process.”Police anticipated forensic investigations at the site would be finished today.“We will conduct our examinations with a view of trying to determine a cause of death, whether it’s able to be achieved is yet to be determined,” he said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailPolice continued to search for the 17-year-old’s luggage, Mansfield said.Pheobe’s mother, Kylie Johnson, was quick to share her grief on Friday.“I didn’t think my heart could break any more than it did when you went missing, or when the charges were laid but this! This is ripping me apart …” she posted on Facebook.A crime scene has been declared at the location and forensic examinations are continuing, police said.Police are continuing to appeal for any information in relation to Pheobe or the movement of a grey Hyundai ix35 between 15 and 18 May in the greater Gin Gin area.On Thursday, police charged Pheobe’s housemates with her murder.The housemates allegedly murdered the missing teenager before moving her body from a national park, police say.James Wood, 34, and Tanika Bromley, 33, will remain behind bars after their matters appeared in the Bundaberg magistrates court in southernQueensland.They have been charged with murder and two counts each of interfering with a corpse.They have been remanded in custody ahead of their next court appearance on 11 August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We just want her home,” Kaylea said.“She was loved, she’s missed dearly.”The Gin Gin community will hold a candlelight vigil on Sunday to pay tribute to Pheobe.Bundaberg mayor Helen Blackburn said it was very difficult to make sense of the tragedy.“We now need to come together as a community, support and care for one another as we try to move forward,” Cr Blackburn said.With AAPExplore more on these topicsQueenslandnewsShareReuse this content"

Neither Maison Canberra nor Shopify has responded to Guardian Australia’s repeated requests for comment.On 31 March Guardian Australia bought a blouse for $69.95 from Maison Canberra.

After seeing she had been charged international transaction fees of $17.18, researching the site and realising she had potentially been scammed, she lodged a dispute with PayPal requesting a refund.She said she had included “extensive documentation” including evidence of what she believed were “fake” tracking numbers.In two separate emails seen by Guardian Australia, Maison Canberra claimed her orders were “on the way” but sent tracking numbers beginning with “UK”. Australia Post declined to comment on whether they were valid.Guardian Australia looked up the tracking numbers on three third-party parcel-tracking platforms, all of which said the orders had been processed by a logistics company in China but had not progressed any further.Consumer experts have said Shopify and Metaneed to take more responsibility for enabling these sites and allowing them to run false advertising but that payment platforms including PayPal also play a role by allowing these sites to use their services.The Geelong customer said PayPal had denied her claim on 29 April and told her tracking information provided by the seller showed that the items had been delivered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she said she hadn’t receive a refund until 26 May, the day after she told PayPal she would escalate the issue to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority.She said PayPal maintained she had received items from the seller and that her refund had only been granted because they were “not as described”. The customer said she was “appalled by this misrepresentation”.“I strongly believe consumers deserve better protection, and someone must be held accountable,” she said. “It’s so distressing and so disappointing and frustrating.”She said PayPal should have a dedicated fraud or scam category in its claims process to help scam victims seeking redress.PayPal previously said all Australian sellers were verified when applying for an account, before conceding that this may not be the case for online sellers based in countries with different laws and regulations.A PayPal spokesperson said the safety and security of customers was its “top priority” and it invested “significant resources” into protecting them.“Under PayPal’s buyer protection policy, we will refund the full purchase price plus the original shipping charges for eligible claims,” they said.The Australian Financial Complaints Authority declined to comment, saying it could not disclose information about individual complaints.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which has previously said it is investigating ghost stores, declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsScamsRetail industryPayPalBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Polls show only a fifth of the Israel electorate favour a two-state solution and 56% of Jewish Israelis supported the “transfer of Arab citizens of Israel to other countries”.Israel has also approved plans to build a further 22 settlements in the West Bank–the biggest expansion in decades. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said it was “a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state”.Macron’s initiative has been described as “disastrous” by the Israel’s ambassador to France, Joshua Zarka.Recognition of a Palestinian state was previously seen as an outcome of a failed 1990s-era two-state plan. However, governments in Europe increasingly doubt Israel has any intention to ease its control over Palestinians and see recognition as a possible lever to force a change of thinking among Israeli officials.Ireland, Spain and Norway recognised a Palestinian statelast year. Macron has insisted he would only recognise a Palestinian state without Hamas–the same stance as the UK.Inan open letterto Macron, The Elders, a group of former senior UN diplomats, say recognition is “an essential transformative step towards peace” that should be taken as a matter of principle, divorced from negotiations over the ultimate form of Palestinian statehood and how and when Hamas should be disarmed.Anne-Claire Legendre, the president’s adviser on the Middle East, has said the conference “must mark a transformative milestone for the effective implementation of the two-state solution. We must move from words to deeds, and we must move from the end of the war in Gaza to the end of the conflict.”She met Israeli officials this week to discuss the conference and Israel’s often cloudy long-term vision for the region. She also met the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Mustafa. Israeli newspapers reported the travelling French officials as saying: “The recognition of a Palestinian state remains on the table, but not as a product of the conference. This will remain a bilateral subject between states.”The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, who is expected to attend the conference, is under massive backbench pressure to do more to punish Israel and is, at minimum, being asked flesh out the conditions for the UK recognition of a Palestinian state.Hamish Falconer, the Middle East minister, told MPs this week the UK thinking was evolving. “One reason that the traditional position of the UK government has been that the recognition of a Palestinian state should come at the end, or during, a two-state solution process was the hope that we would move towards a two-state solution,” he said. “Many minds have been changed because of the rhetoric of the Israeli government – the clear statements by so many that they are no longer committed to a two-state solution.”But the British are looking for firm undertakings at the conference on the future government of Palestine, including the exclusion of Hamas from any future governance of Gaza, which is something Hamas itself has appeared to accept in the various plans drawn up by Arab states.A growing number of Conservative MPs have broken with their frontbench on the issue and now back recognition, including the former attorney general Sir Jeremy Wright.France hopes that a group of western states recognising a Palestinian state could be counter-balanced by Muslim states normalising relations with Israel.However, Saudi recognition of Israel seems impossible. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the other co-host, has asserted repeatedly that Israel is committing a genocide, a view that is shared widely by Saudi public opinion.This article was amended on 7 June 2025. An earlier version said the location of the planned conference would be Saudi Arabia, rather than New York.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Up to80% of Kabul’s groundwater is deemed unsafe, with high levels of sewage, salinity and arsenic.Water access has become a daily battle for people in Kabul. Some households spend up to 30% of their income on water, and more than two-thirds have incurred water-related debt.“Afghanistan is facing a lot of problems, but this water scarcity is one of the hardest,” said Nazifa, a teacher living in the Khair Khana neighbourhood of Kabul. “Every household is facing difficulty, especially those with low income. Adequate, good quality well water just doesn’t exist.”Someprivate companies are capitalising on the crisisby actively digging new wells and extracting large amounts of public groundwater, then selling it back to city’s residents at inflated prices.“We used to pay 500 afghanis (£5.30) every 10 days to fill our cans from the water tankers. Now, that same amount of water costs us 1,000 afghanis,” said Nazifa. “The situation has been getting worse over the past two weeks. We are afraid it will get even more expensive.”Kabul’s sevenfold growth from less than 1 million people in 2001 has drastically transformed water demands. A lack of centralised governance and regulation has also perpetuated the problem over the decades.In early 2025, the UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs announced that itspartners had received just $8.4m(£6.2m) of the $264m required to implement planned water and sanitation programming in Afghanistan. A further $3bn in international water and sanitation funding has been frozen since the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021. The US’s recent move tocut more than 80% of its USAID fundinghas compounded the crisis.“Everything is so aid-dependent,” said Curry. “We can throw millions of dollars at short-term water fixes and say we’ve addressed the need, but that need will continue until there’s better investment for longer-term solutions. And that’s where foreign governments are stopping short at this point due to political dynamics.”Nazifa said: “Water is a human right and natural resource of Afghanistan. It is not a political issue. My heart bleeds when I look at the flowers and fruit trees in the garden, all drying up. But what can we do? We are currently living in a military state, so we can’t exactly go to the government to report the issue.”The Panjshir River pipeline is one project which, if completed, could alleviate the city’s over-reliance on groundwater and supply 2 million residents with potable water. The design phases for this were completed in late 2024 and are awaiting budget approval, with the government seeking additional investors to supplement the $170m cost.“We don’t have time to sit around waiting for budgets. We are caught in a storm from which there will be no return if we don’t act immediately,” said Dr Najibullah Sadid, a senior researcher on water resource management and member of theAfghan Water and Environment Professionals Network.“Those in Kabul are in a situation where they have to decide between food or water. And yet, the locals we’ve spoken to are still willing to invest what little they have towards a sustainable solution. Whichever project will bring the most immediate impact is the priority. We just need to start somewhere.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanWaterClimate crisisSouth and central AsiaTalibanAidnewsShareReuse this content"

Through the plan for change”, we are investing in Britain’s renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off.”Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, said: “R&D is the very foundation of the breakthroughs that make our lives easier and healthier – from new medicines enabling us to live longer, more fulfilled lives to developments in AI giving us time back, from easing our train journeys through to creating the technology we need to protect our planet from climate change.”Ministers said the investment would boost the life sciences industry in Liverpool, the defence sector in Northern Ireland and semiconductors in south Wales. It matches a commitment made by the previous Conservative government to spend £22bn a year on R&D.The seven mayoral strategic authorities in England – Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Liverpool City Region, North East and Greater London – will each receive awards of at least £30m each. The fund will also include a competition open to all other parts of the UK.The announcement was welcomed by Richard Parker, the mayor of the West Midlands, and Kim McGuinness, the north-east mayor. McGuinness said the funds would support the car and green energy industries in her region.The package also includes £4.8m for a partnership between Manchester and Cambridge to attract business investment.Alongside the spending review on Wednesday, Reeves is planning to announcean overhaul of the Treasury’s “green book”– the rules that govern how public investment plans are judged.

We have robust processes in place for this.”Warren Kirwan, media manager at disability equality charity Scope, said: “Attitudes and language like this are never acceptable.“It’s not just ignorant and hurtful to disabled people, it has wider consequences. Negative attitudes hold disabled people back in all areas of life, from getting a job to shopping on the high street.“Mr Borthwick needs to reflect on what he said, educate himself and do better.

Now I am aware, I am deeply embarrassed to have used the term and directed it in the way I did. It was wrong.“When I made the video, I was excited and caught up in the moment. Again, that is no excuse. But my regrettable actions are not a true reflection of my views, or who I am.“I enjoyed every minute of my time in the Blackpool Tower Ballroom and the town itself. The people of Blackpool have always been amazing with the Strictly crew, dancers and cast members. I know they will be again for this year’s show and those in years to come. I am truly sorry.”Wynne Evans, who also competed in last year’s edition of Strictly, said last week he had been dropped by the BBC, after apologising for using “inappropriate language” during the launch of the Strictly Come Dancing tour.The Welsh opera singer, 53, will no longer be a BBC Radio Wales presenter, he announced last week.Earlier this year, he apologised for language that he called “inappropriate and unacceptable” after the Mail on Sunday reported that he was heard making a remark to a woman in a video filmed during the Strictly launch event.It is understood Evans was given a warning over the remark by tour producers.In January, he said: “I’ve agreed with the BBC that I’ll take some time out from my radio show and the Strictly Live tour, as well as my other public commitments, to prioritise my wellbeing. I am deeply sorry for the pain my inappropriate actions have caused, and plan to take this time for self-reflection.”Explore more on these topicsBBCEastEndersStrictly Come DancingSoap operaTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

In Lambeth, as in other parts of London, local authorities have turned to holding large concerts and festivals in parks as a way to raise money, to the chagrin of some neighbors.Wolf Hall actor Mark Rylance, one of a group of local residents opposed to big events in Brockwell Park, is represented as “Mark Rylunch”, with an apple-carved head and satirical signs branding him a Nimby (“not in my backyard”) campaigner.“Every year, this is what we get so excited about, is the vegetable sculptures,” country show regular Maddy Luxon said. “It’s just so unique and just so witty and we love the political ones.”“And the puns,” said Marek Szandrowski, who was with her. “The vegetable puns, definitely.”Explore more on these topicsLondonVegetablesnewsShareReuse this content"

The date for the next king’s speech has not been set but several sources said it could take place in May 2026.Labour had originally planned to introduce a short, narrowly drafted AI bill within months of entering office that would have been focused on large language models, such as ChatGPT.The legislation would have required companies to hand over their models for testing by the UK’s AI Security Institute. It was intended to address concerns that AI models could become so advancedthat they posed a risk to humanity.This bill was delayed, with ministers choosing to wait and align with Donald Trump’s administration in the US because of concerns that any regulation might weaken the UK’s attractiveness to AI companies.Ministers now want to include copyright rules for AI companies as part of the AI bill.“We feel we can use that vehicle to find a solution on copyright,” a government source said. “We’ve been having meetings with both creators and tech people and there are interesting ideas on moving forward. That work will begin in earnest once the data bill passes.”The government is already locked in a standoff with the House of Lords over copyright rules in a separate data bill. It would allow AI companies totrain their models using copyrighted materialunless the rights holder opts out.It has caused afierce backlash from the creative sector, with artists including Elton John, Paul McCartney and Kate Bush throwing their weight behind a campaign to oppose the changes.This week, peersbacked an amendment to the data billthat would require AI companies to disclose if they were using copyrighted material to train their models, in an attempt to enforce current copyright law.Ministers haverefused to back down, however, even though Kyle hasexpressed regretabout the way the government has gone about the changes. The government insists the data bill is not the right vehicle for the copyright issue and has promised to publish an economic impact assessment and series of technical reports on copyright and AI issues.In a letter to MPs on Saturday, Kyle made a further commitment to establish a cross-party working group of parliamentarians on AI and copyright.Beeban Kidron, the film director and cross-bench peer who has been campaigning on behalf of the creative sector, said on Friday that ministers “have shafted the creative industries, and they have proved willing to decimate the UK’s second-biggest industrial sector”.Kyle told the Commons last month that AI and copyright should be dealt with as part of a separate “comprehensive” bill.Most of the UK public (88%) believe the government should have the power to stop the use of an AI product if it is deemed to pose a serious risk,according to a surveypublished by the Ada Lovelace Institute and the Alan Turing Institute in March. More than 75% said the government or regulators should oversee AI safety rather than private companies alone.Scott Singer, an AI expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “The UK is strategically positioning itself between the US and EU. Like the US, Britain is attempting to avoid overly aggressive regulation that could harm innovation while exploring ways to meaningfully protect consumers. That’s the balancing act here.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Peter KyleComputingIntellectual propertyRegulatorsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Yusuf tweeted on Thursday that Sarah Pochin, the Reform MP for Runcorn and Helsby, had been “dumb” toask Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questionswhether he would ban it.Hours later he announced he was quitting, saying he did not believe working to get a Reform government elected was a good use of his time.“When I pushed that tweet out it was a coming together of a bit of exhaustion and a feeling that all I got in return for it was abuse,” he said on Saturday. “I was doing so many things, in the foreground and in the background.”“What has happened since then is that I’ve been inundated with messages from Reform members and supporters who were saying they were devastated and heartbroken and asking me to really reconsider my decision.“I left my business interests behind, I’ve volunteered full-time, because I love my country and I believe the best way to save it and turn it into a great one is for Nigel to be prime minister.“It made me realise that in that moment I was turning my back on that – and I didn’t want to do that.”Yusuf, who is a practising Muslim, insisted he did not have “any strong views about the burqa itself” and said that “if there were a vote and I was in parliament, I would probably vote to ban it actually”.He described the fallout over Pochin’s comments as “an internal miscommunication issue” and said he had found out about her remarks for the first time on X. “I don’t mind saying that it frustrated me,” he said.He added that he did not think the issue of burqas “is one of the most important [to] British people when they go about their day-to-day lives”.Earlier on Saturday, Farage said: “When Zia says anything you cannot believe the absolute tirade of personal racist abuse that he gets … I just think he snapped.” The Reform leader told Times Radio the abuse came “from the very hard extreme right” and blamed “Indian bots”.Yusuf was brought in by Farage to be Reform’s chair last year, months after he donated £200,000 to the party.He iswidely credited within Reformfor having professionalised the party, hiring new people, setting up more branches and making it run in a more corporate way.However, he also rubbed some of the Reform old guard up the wrong way with his management style and by overseeing the departures of several long-serving former members of staff.Some of Reform’s members have turned against Yusuf over his role in thedeparture of one of the party’s most rightwing MPs, Rupert Lowe, after the pair clashed earlier this year.The Sunday Times reported that Yusuf’s former role of chair will now be split into two. There will be a front-facing chair tasked with touring the country and speaking to the media, and a deputy in charge of organisational matters.Ellie Reeves, the Labour party chair, said: “Reform’s revolving door shows that the party is all about one person – Nigel Farage. Zia Yusuf’s humiliating hokey cokey is laughable but there is nothing funny about Farage’s £80bn in unfunded commitments.”A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said: “It looks like Reform are playing musical chairman.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

According to the woman, Leto, who was seated with the actor Ashley Olsen, who was then 19, grabbed her arm.“I looked down and it wasJared Leto,” the woman told Air Mail, adding: “We had a quick conversation, and he got my number.” She went on to say that Leto called her home a few days later, recalling: “I don’t know if he was on drugs or what … It was the weirdest, grossest voice … [But] for me, it’s Jared, you know?”She said that Leto said he was hosting a party at his house that evening and that he invited her. The woman declined, telling the outlet: “I didn’t even have a driver’s license.” Nevertheless, she said, Leto kept calling her, “always at one, two, three AM”.“And the conversations turned sexual. He’d ask things like: ‘Have you ever had a boyfriend? Have you ever sucked a dick?’” she told Air Mail.Another woman, the model Laura La Rue, recounted a similar experience to the outlet, saying that when she was 16 years old in 2008, she was at an event in a private residence in Beverly Hills where Leto was “watching her so intensely”.“He asked how old I was. I said, ‘I’m 16. How old are you?’” La Rue told Air Mail. Leto, who was 36 at the time, proceeded to ask for her number. The two began an email correspondence, which eventually led to her visiting Leto’s home in April 2009, the outlet reports.“I remember him teasing me the whole time I was there,” La Rue said, adding: “He was flirting with me. He’d lean in close, then pull away, like it was a game.”In a statement to Air Mail, a representative of Leto said: “Their communications contain nothing sexual or inappropriate … and Ms La Rue later applied to work as Mr Leto’s personal assistant, further underscoring the absence of anything inappropriate in any of their interactions.” Air Mail reports La Rue denying ever applying for a personal assistant role with Leto.During a separate visit, La Rue said, Leto walked out of a room completely naked when she was 17 years old. “He just walked out, dick out, like it was normal … I thought maybe this was just what adult men do,” she told Air Mail.Another woman who spoke to the outlet said that she and Leto began a texting relationship while she was still underage. According to her, Leto would ask her inappropriate questions during her visits to his house, such as: “Do any of the little boys you hang out with fuck you?”The woman added that once, when she was 18, Leto “suddenly pulled his penis out and started masturbating”. She told the outlet: “Then he walked over, grabbed my hand, and put it on him. He leaned in and said: ‘I want you to spit on it.’”Another woman, Allie Teilz, a Los Angeles-based DJ and music producer, last month on Instagram reposted a 2012 Facebook status in which she had said: “Youre [sic] not really in L.A. until Jared Leto tries to force himself on you backstage… In a kilt.. And a snow hat,” Air Mail reported.In her Instagram stories, which Air Mail reviewed, Teilz said: “I was assaulted and traumatized by this creep when I was 17 … He knew my age and didn’t care. What he did was predatory, terrifying and unacceptable.”A representative of Leto has “expressly denied” the various women’s accusations reported in Air Mail, including Teilz’s, which the representative said were “demonstrably false”.Leto himself has yet to comment on the allegations.In the US, call or text theChildhelpabuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visittheir websitefor more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

Asked whether he thought their relationship was over, he said: “I would assume so, yeah,” and said he had no plans to speak with his erstwhile sidekick.“I’m too busy doing other things,” Trump said, adding: “I have no intention of speaking to him.”But he predicted that the spat had helped to unify the Republican party around him, saying the “party has never been united like this before. It’s never been. It’s actually more so than it was three days ago.”Musk’s opposition to the Republican budget bill, formally the “one big beautiful bill act”, would not, he predicted, affect its passage through Congress. The bill narrowly passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate. However, some conservative Republicans share Musk’s concerns about the need for significant spending cuts and are considering making changes.The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and includes new spending for border security and the military. Republicans aimed to offset these costs with cuts to programmes such as Medicaid, food stamps and green-energy tax credits.Projections from the congressional budget office and independent analysts indicate that the bill would add between $2.3tn and $5tn to the deficit over the next 10 years. White House officials contend that the economic growth generated by tax cuts will offset the increased spending.Still, Trump told NBC he is “very confident” that the bill will pass the Senate before 4 July.“I think, actually, Elon brought out the strengths of the bill because people that weren’t as focused started focusing on it, and they see how good it is,” Trump said. “So in that sense, there was a big favor. But I think Elon, really, I think it’s a shame that he’s so depressed and so heartbroken.”He also accused Musk of being “disrespectful to the office of the president”.“I think it’s a very bad thing, because he’s very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the president,” he said.Earlier, Musk deleted a post from X, the social media platform he owns, that asserted links between Trump and disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even Epstein’s lawyer said I had nothing to do with it. It’s old news.”Musk has also retracted a threat to begin “decommissioning” SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft used by Nasa to ferry astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.The original threat came after Trump suggested he might cancel SpaceX’s federal contracts. On Saturday, the president said he hadn’t given the subject any more thought.“I’d be allowed to do that,” he said, “but I haven’t given it any thought.”Earlier on Saturday, JD Vance told interviewer and comedian Theo Von that Musk was making a “huge mistake” going after Trump, but downplayed Musk’s attacks as being made by an “emotional guy” who got frustrated.“I hope that eventually Elon comes back into the fold. Maybe that’s not possible now because he’s gone so nuclear,” the vice-president said.But he added: “Look, it happens to everybody. I’ve flown off the handle way worse thanElon Muskdid in the last 24 hours.”“I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,” Vance said.David Smith contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskDemocratsRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Immigration advocates said the raids also included four other locations, including a doughnut shop.There has not yet been confirmation of how many people were taken into custody during the coordinated sweeps.At an afternoon press conference, Angelica Salas, executive director for the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights, said at least 45 people were arrested without warrants.“Our community is under attack and is being terrorized. These are workers, these are fathers, these are mothers, and this has to stop. Immigration enforcement that is terrorizing our families throughout this country and picking up our people that we love must stop now,” Salas told the crowd.The protest only grew as the afternoon wore on. By 6pm local time, hundreds of people assembled around the federal building in downtown Los Angeles, where those taken into custody during the raids are being held.1:20Protesters clash with police at federal detention centre after LA Ice raids – videoEarlier in the day, armed agents clad in heavy protective and tactical gear, including some who wore gas masks, could be seen on video and through aerial footage pushing individuals and trying to corral large groups that congregated to challenge the raids.Smoke grenades were reportedly thrown near the crowds and pepper spray was used as the federal officers attempted to clear the area. As the demonstrations continued into the evening,videosshowed officers firing less-lethal weapons toward protestors.View image in fullscreenCaution tape hangs outside Ambiance Apparel after immigration authorities raided the property.Photograph: Jae C Hong/APSome people in the crowd attempted to block large armored trucks carrying FBI agents as they departed. One person reportedly threw eggs at the vehicles.The Los Angeles fire department was called to the scene to administer aid to protesters injured by agents and officers, which included the president of the California branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), David Huerta. The organization said instatementhe was detained and called for his immediate release.Huerta, who was injured and detained, released a statement to the Los Angeles Times from the hospital,saying: “What happened to me is not about me. This is about something much bigger.”“This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice that’s happening. Hard-working people, and members of our family and our community, are being treated like criminals. We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice,” he added.“We call for an end to the cruel, destructive, and indiscriminate Ice raids that are tearing apart our communities, disrupting our economy, and hurting all working people,” Tia Orr, executive director of SEIUCaliforniasaid.“Immigrant workers are essential to our society: feeding our nation, caring for our elders, cleaning our workplaces, and building our homes.”The Los Angeles police department also assisted the federal officers in dispersing demonstrators, despite the department’s insistence that it is not involved in “civil immigration enforcement”, and would only have a presence to ensure public safety.Advocates used megaphones from the streets outside where the raids were occurring to remind workers inside of their rights, the Los Angeles Timesreported. Some called out individual names and demanded they be given access to lawyers.“The community is here with you,” one person shouted. “Your family is here with you.”Los Angeles leaders were quick to condemn the actions, which were part of a string of high-profile raids undertaken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement under orders from Donald Trump.In a statement on Friday, California governor Gavin Newsomsaid: “Continued chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel. Donald Trump’s chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America’s economy.”Newsom alsocondemnedHuerta’s arrest, saying: “David Huerta is a respected leader, a patriot, and an advocate for working people. No one should ever be harmed for witnessing government action.”“I am closely monitoring the Ice raids that are currently happening across Los Angeles, including at a Korean-American owned store in my district,” Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove said in a post on X, along with instructions on how affected constituents could reach her office for help.“LA has long been a safe haven for immigrants,” she added. “Trump claims he’s targeting criminals, but he’s really just tearing families apart and destabilizing entire communities.”Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that she was “deeply angered by what has taken place”, and that her office was coordinating with immigrant rights community organizations.“These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city,” she said. “We will not stand for this.”In response, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who has functioned as one of the chief architects of the administration’s draconian immigration crackdowns,wrote: “You have no say in this at all. Federal law is supreme and federal law will be enforced.”Los Angeles councilmember Eunisses Hernandez said in a statement: “These actions are escalating: agents arrive without warning and leave quickly, aware that our communities mobilize fast. I urge Angelenos to stay alert.”Meanwhile, the California senator Alex Padilla said: “The Ice raids across Los Angeles today are a continuation of a disturbing pattern of extreme and cruel immigration enforcement operations across the country. These indiscriminate raids prove once again that theTrump administrationcares about nothing but instilling harm and fear in our communities to drive immigrants into the shadows. It will not work.”He added: “This fearmongering is not going to change the fact that immigrants are valued members of our communities who contribute to our society and economy, and my office will demand accountability for today’s actions.”Similarly, the Los Angeles county supervisor Lindsey Horvathcalledthe Ice raids “acts of cruelty and bigotry, targeting our immigrant neighbors and tearing families apart”.Horvath added: “These actions are designed to instill fear in communities of color – but we will not be intimidated, and we will not be silent. I’m in direct communication with county, state, & community leaders to ensure that all available protections from LA County are activated immediately. We must remain vigilant. We must protect one another. And above all, we will stand together.”Maya Yang contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsLos AngelesUS immigrationTrump administrationUS domestic policyUS politicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Barack Obama andDonald Trumpcommitted to curtail the US national debt on their respective roads to the White House.And yet, no matter the party, Americans have been able to count on one thing above most: the national debt will keep climbing.And here we are again. With Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” threatening to add once more to the US’s huge debts, several Republican senators are threatening to block his current spending plans, with Rand Paul of Kentucky among those highly critical.Departing the White House, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, branded the bill a “disgusting abomination”.But this administration is not alone. For decades, economists have expressed concern about US debt. Politicians have repeatedly pledged to tackle it. All the while, the pile continued to swell.Back in 2008, when Obamadeclaredon the campaign trail it was high time Washington started “taking responsibility for every dime that it spends”, it stood at about $14.46tn.Graph of US debtBack in 2015, when Trumppromisedon the trail to “bring it down big league and quickly,” it stood at about $24.07tn. Last year, it rose to $35.46tn.On Wall Street, concern has been mounting to the brink of panic. Calling on Trump to reduce the deficit – the gap between what the US federal government spends and the money it raises, mainly via taxes – the billionaire investor Ray Dalio warned in March of a crisis within three years. “I can’t tell you exactly when it’ll come,” hetold Bloomberg. “It’s like the heart attack.”Trump appears to have paid little attention. While he dispatched the billionaire industrialist Musk to wield the axe across the federal government in the name of efficiency, Trump also pushed for sweeping tax cuts that impartial analystsestimatewill add trillions of dollars to the debt pile.A chart showing spending decreasing, but revenue decreasing more. The resulting gap is the increase in the federal budget.The anxiety stepped up a gear last month, when the ratings agency Moody’s stripped the US of its last major top-tier credit rating, and cited the size of the debt pile now – and how large it expects it will grow.“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,”saidMoody’s, predicting that “current fiscal proposals under consideration” would not lessen spending or reduce deficits. “Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.”There is technically a cap – known as the debt ceiling, or limit – on what the federal government can borrow. The first such broad limit, introduced in 1939, was set at a mere $45bn.Time and again, the US treasury department has been forced to ask Congress for the ceiling to be lifted, or suspended. This process has repeatedly sparked legislative battles on Capitol Hill in recent years, drawing in unrelated issues as the US drifted towards default on its debts, and prompting questions over the reliability of US debt as an investment – and calls for the limit to be scrapped altogether.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ratings agency expects the federal debt burden, equivalent to 98% of US gross domestic product (GDP) last year, to rise to 134% of GDP by 2035.“Talk is cheap. People can say a lot of things,” said Owen Zidar, professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. “It’s easier to see what the policies have actually been.”When faced with a choice between prioritizing deficit reduction or an expensive policy, such as Obama’s widening of health insurance coverage, “it’s not unreasonable to prioritize health insurance coverage”, Zidar suggested. “The key thing is to avoid big mistakes that are hard to reverse.”The Clinton administration made some “hard choices” about where, and where not, to spend, he said, adding that tax cuts and the Iraq war under the Bush administration in early noughties were “a big part of why we have debt and deficit problems today”.Presidents have historically managed to reassure investors, up to a point, that they shared their concern. “If we stay on the current path”, Obamasaidduring a debt ceiling battle in 2011, “our growing debt could cost us jobs and do serious damage to the economy.”But the volatility of Trump, who called himself the “king of debt” and once evenmootedonly paying back half during his first run for the presidency, has added a layer of doubt. “The Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe,” he wrote on Truth Social, his social network, this week.“An erratic administration that generates a lot of uncertainty and calls into question things that have been true for most of the western world, that is a frightening prospect when the fiscal fundamentals aren’t as good as they have always been,” said Zidar.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The highly public split included, among other highlights, the world’s richest person accusing the president of the United States of associating with a notorious sex offender. Trump said Musk had “lost his mind”.As Musk and Trump traded insults, each on his own social network, they also issued threats with tangible consequences. Trump suggested that he could cancel all of Musk’s government contracts and subsidies – “the best way to save money”, he posted – a move that would have devastating consequences not only on the tech billionaire’s companies but also on the federal agencies that have come to depend on them. Musk responded by announcing thathe would begin decommissioningthe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that Nasa relies on for transport missions, although he later reversed the decision.While the ongoing episode had the tenor of sensational reality TV, the fight between Trump and Musk once again exposed the danger of putting key public goods in the hands of private companies controlled by erratic billionaires. It highlighted how something like space travel, once a vaunted and collective national enterprise, can now be almost entirely derailed by the emotional whims of a single person.Musk and Trump’s partnership had already fueled months of concern about corruption and calls for investigations into the Tesla CEO’s use of his position in government to benefit his companies. The breakup has highlighted another risk of Musk’s deep ties with the government, where the services that he provides can now become collateral damage in interpersonal disputes. Tens of billions of dollars hang in the balance of their fight.The messy, public way that the clash has played out also serves as a reminder of how unpredictable their decision-making can be. Musk’s vow to sideline SpaceX’s spacecraft and his reversal, without which the US would have immediately been prevented from reaching the International Space Station (ISS), appeared, for instance, as an emotional lash-out amid a string of other insults against Trump, and it was nearly impossible to discern whether he was serious.“In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” Musk posted without warning on Thursday.“Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon,” Musk followed up less than a day later, responding to an anonymous user with about 5,000 followers who said he should “cool off and take a step back for a couple days”.If Musk and Trump’s fight ends up disrupting government services or further turning them into political leverage, it will not have come without warning. Ever since Musk refused in 2023 tolet Ukraine use Starlinkin Crimea to launch a surprise attack against Russian forces, governments have dealt with the uncomfortable reality of Musk’s control over global infrastructure. Musk’s claim thathe could hobbleUkraine’s “entire front line” by turning off Starlink caused a diplomatic incident earlier this year. Meanwhile, European governments have recentlyrushed to find alternativesto Starlink amid concerns over Musk’s unpredictability.While Musk provoked foreign governments and acted as an unaccountable global power broker, the US has by contrast continued to hand him contracts and increase its dependence on his companies. Space operations in particular have become practically synonymous with Musk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTrump and Musk’s very public feud is like Alien v Predator for political nerdsRead moreSince SpaceX won its first Nasa contract in 2006, the government has awarded about $15bn worth of contracts to the company and has come to depend on it for ferrying astronauts and cargo into space. Nasa has also contracted SpaceX for its planned crewed mission to the moon, as well as a mission to explore one of Saturn’s moons. Last year, the agency turned to SpaceX when it needed torescue two astronautsstuck on the ISS.The government’s reliance on Musk’s empire also extends beyond Nasa. The Pentagon has extensive contracts with Musk, using SpaceX to launch intelligence satellites. SpaceX wasalso the frontrunnerin the Trump administration’s plans to build a “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, which has become a US national defense priority. Starlink, Musk’s satellite communications service, had also made inroads into the government to the point that it was installed this year at the White House.Musk is still accountable to market forces and the investors backing his companies, as was made evident on Thursday after Tesla’s shares plunged roughly 14% during his dustup with Trump. Musk has previously stated that he is willing to lose money over his ideology, however, and his immense wealth somewhat insulates him against even large shocks to his companies. When Tesla’s shares dropped on Thursday, it wiped about $34bn off his total net worth in a single day – yet he remained the world’s richest person by a gap of more than $90bn.The extensive reliance on Musk and the privatization of government services has always drawn criticism from ethics watchdogs and some aerospace and defense industry experts, but it appears especially risky now that Musk has threatened to hold certain services hostage. It has also served as a counterpoint to the project of slashing and privatizing the federal government that Musk spent his tenure with the Trump administration carrying out. Musk has furiously campaigned against bureaucracy, courts and regulators as impediments to getting things done, but these also exist as a bulwark against exactly the kind of unaccountable personal power and erratic whims that both he and Trump put on display during their clash.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpSpaceSpaceXUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

She said that she struggled with anxiety and doubt in 2022, a complete contrast to the confidence she felt before this match.“I just remembered that ceremony when Iga won, I just remembered trying to take it all in and pay attention to every detail and just feel like I wanted that experience for myself,” said Gauff. “So when the anthem got played, I vividly remember watching her pretty emotional when the Polish anthem was played. I was, like, ‘Wow, this is such a cool moment’. So when the anthem got played today, I kind of had those reflections.“It was a tough time. I was doubting myself, wondering if I would ever be able to overcome it, especially my mentality going into that match. I was crying before the match and so nervous, and literally couldn’t breathe and stuff. I was, like: ‘If I can’t handle this, how am I going to handle it again?’ Then obviously the US Open happened, and now I just felt really ready today, and I was, like: ‘I’m just going to leave it all out there, and regardless of what happens, I can leave proud.’”View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka expressed her frustration in defeat.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesAfter also losing the Australian Open final this year in three sets to Madison Keys, Sabalenka is now 3-3 in grand slam finals.

The largest among them were quite basic. This team had, for most of its time under Mauricio Pochettino and at some points before that, showed a frustrating inability to seize upon moments, to impose themselves on games, to make other teams pay for their mistakes. In the few moments where they did grab momentum, they struggled to hold it for long.Saturday’s game againstTurkeywas just a friendly, but it was also a way to start allaying those doubts – a first step on the last summer slate before the World Cup, to show that the US were still capable of doing those things, no matter the personnel.In a 2-1 loss, the US failed to deliver in full.Within 60 seconds on a rainy, humid afternoon in East Hartford, Connecticut, the US gave fans a huge reason for optimism. Jack McGlynn, one of a number of players who aim to use this summer to make a case for themselves as part of next summer’s marquee group, caught the 34,023-strong crowd and the Turkish defense by surprise with a sight MLS observers are well used to by now: a curling effort from outside the box, nestled nicely into the far corner of goal. 1-0 up, not even two minutes in, the US had assuaged at least some of those nagging doubts.Then, over the next quarter of an hour, the gap in quality between a mostly first-choice Turkey and a very shorthanded US became apparent. The back four found themselves in regular retreat. At times, doubts about the ability to hold leads surfaced glaringly. Johnny Cardoso, caught in possession at his own penalty spot, somehow failed to read the pressure oncoming from Arda Güler, knocking his pass directly against the Real Madrid forward’s legs, which bobbled past a helpless Matt Freese for the equalizer.View image in fullscreenTurkey’s Kerem Aktürkoglü celebrates his goal during the first half of Saturday’s friendly against the United States.Photograph: Mark Smith/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty ImagesTurkey, content at this point to let the US come forward, regularly sprang attacks on transition. As one of them unfolded, Pochettino galloped along the sideline at the edge of his technical area, seemingly transmitting the energy and attention he hoped to see from his defensive unit. A minute later, the US failed to track an overlapping run, lucked out when two Turkish attackers missed on the resulting cross, failed to gather the ball on the other side, failed to effectively clear the second cross, and went down 2-1 when Kerem Aktürkoglü cleaned up the mess.The half-time introduction of Tyler Adams, one of the few undoubted first-teamers to be with the squad this summer, changed the US outlook for the better. So, too, did the continued hustle from Diego Luna, who led a fast break in the 60th minute that amounted to the best US chance of the night. Luna started the attack after the US backline effectively played through Turkey’s press, finding McGlynn in the right half space. McGlynn’s shot was blocked, but Adams’ recovery and hesitation to freeze his defender allowed him time to set up a cross to Malik Tillman. The resulting header was clearly just an attempt to make contact – in most cases, from that range, probably a fine approach. But not this time, as it went directly into the arms of Turkey goalkeeper Berke Özer.There were other chances, including a ball that fell to Chris Richards at the doorstep that got caught underheath the defender’s feet with just seconds to go. The final whistle blew soon after.What stood out (in a good way)?Max ArfstenThe Columbus Crew man got the start at left back and was effective going forward without sacrificing positional discipline. Turkey threw a lot of challenges his way and he seemed to be up for most of them. At the very least, he’s put himself in a position to be a depth option at fullback.Jack McGlynnAside from the goal, the Houston Dynamo midfielder found himself in a few other situations at the top of the box where he was more than willing to let rip from distance. That gave the Turkey defense something to think about, and as his time on the field went on their willingness to step to McGlynn helped to create a little bit more space for Agyemang to work.Tyler AdamsHis introduction changed the US outlook significantly, helping control the central areas where Turkey focused much of their attacks. He should have had an assist on Malik Tillman’s point-blank header as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was not an issue this time around. Several players appeared more than willing to mix it up with the opposition, tackles were made with conviction, and while the quality wasn’t always the best, the attitude was clearly much improved.What stood out (in a bad way)?Johnny CardosoOne of the weirdest conundrum’s of the current USMNT is how Cardoso can look so effective week-to-week with Real Betis, and then so pedestrian with the US. On Saturday, Cardoso was worse than pedestrian. His giveaway practicallywasthe equalizing goal, and his minute-to-minute work on and off the ball left much to be desired.Turkey’s approachThe Crescent Stars seemed largely content to cede possession to the US all the way up until the final third, which doesn’t say much for what they thought of the Americans’ ability to pick apart a defense. In fairness, this approach bit them a bit with McGlynn’s goal, but by and large it seemed to work.What’s next?The US head to Nashville to play a friendly with Switzerland, their last tune-up before the Gold Cup begins on 15 June against Trinidad & Tobago in San Jose, California.Explore more on these topicsUSATurkeyFriendliesUS sportsShareReuse this content"

One of the team’s players is a transgender girl.“This championship was hijacked,” Gaines wrote on X, referring to the student-athlete as “a boy” and ridiculing the league for disabling comments “lol”.Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all time with 11 Olympic and 30 world championship medals, had seen enough. In a rare foray into online confrontation, she reposted Gaines’ tweet and responded with a direct rebuke.“You’re truly sick,” Bileswrote. “All of this campaigning because you lost a race. Straight up sore loser.”@Riley_Gaines_You’re truly sick, all of this campaigning because you lost a race. Straight up sore loser.

Maybe a transgender…https://t.co/pjpzuZ0AlO— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles)June 6, 2025The post referenced Gaines’ performance at the 2022 NCAA championships, where she tied for fifth withLia Thomas, a transgender swimmer. Since then, Gaines has built a prominent public profile lobbying against the inclusion of transgender women in women’s sports, becoming a fixture on right-wing media outlets and appearing alongside Donald Trump ashe signed an executive orderbanning trans girls and women from competing in women’s sports.But Biles didn’t stop there.“You should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive OR creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports,” she wrote. “Maybe a transgender category IN ALL SPORTS!! But instead… You bully them… One thing for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around!!!!!”In a follow-up post, Bilesadded: “Bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male.”bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male@Riley_Gaines_— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles)June 6, 2025Gaines quickly fired back, calling Biles’ remarks “so disappointing” and insisting: “Men don’t belong in women’s sports and I say that with my full chest.”A 12-time All-American swimmer at the University of Kentucky, Gaines has used her race with Thomas as the basis for a national campaign opposing transgender inclusion in sports. She has frequently misgendered athletes in public forums and has drawn criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates and athletes alike for singling out individuals, often minors, by name on social media.In the case of Champlin Park, Gaines made multiple posts about the transgender pitcher, even mentioning the player by name and referring to her with male pronouns, despite the team’s vocal support for their teammate.

Outkick, the right-leaning sports outlet where Gaines is a regular contributor, called her remarks “self-contradicting”.Gaines reposted several replies from fans who echoed her position, arguing that Biles was undermining women’s sports and confusing the issue by suggesting a separate transgender category. “It’s not my job or the job of any woman to figure out how to include men in our spaces,” Gaines wrote in response.Other conservative influencers piled on, questioning why Biles chose to weigh in and accusing her of “siding with men” in women’s athletics. “If trans participation isn’t a big deal, why propose a separate division?” one post read, summing up a recurring critique in her mentions.Despite the backlash, Biles has not walked back her comments. Supporters praised her for using her platform to defend marginalized athletes and push back against what they view as a pattern of bullying and scapegoating by Gaines.Explore more on these topicsSimone BilesTransgenderGymnasticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

No previousEnglandmanager has ever begun with three successive victories to nil, but Tuchel was clearly very unhappy with the performance.Harry Kane saves listless England’s blushes as Andorra frustrate TuchelRead more“I didn’t like the attitude how we ended the game,” he said. “I liked the attitude how we started the game. But I didn’t like the last half hour. I think we lacked urgency and seriousness you need in a World Cup qualifier. I didn’t like the body language and it was not what the occasion needed.”What made it all the more frustrating was that there had been no indication of that flatness in the days leading up to the game during warm-weather training in Spain. “They were enthusiastic and they showed that as a group when they were in the camp. When we started the game, the attitude was right. We wanted to play according to our principals and to the plan.“Matches like this can become awkward when you don’t score. It can be stuck. Then it’s necessary to not get frustrated, to do the little things right. I had the feeling after 25 minutes we were a bit frustrated with the little things and everybody tried different things. Then it becomes freestyle and it gets slower. Everyone wanted the ball in to feet, and nobody was speeding the game up with runs. You need contra-movements and runs and if you don’t invest it becomes a stuck game.”Tuchel acknowledged that fatigue at the end of the season might have been a factor, but was determined not to offer that as an excuse.“The window is the window, so no excuses. I think the clubs don’t like the window and for the national team also it’s not easy because the players are coming from a long season. We can and have to do better for the 90 minutes. We created an xG of 3 and underperformed with one goal. Normally in games like this you overperform the xG because of greater individual quality. But we didn’t. We lacked the energy.

I don’t think we can blame them for that.”He said he was unaware of the offensive chanting about Keir Starmer. “If it happens, it is not acceptable, but I didn’t hear it,” he said.Fundamentally, though, this was a night of frustration. “It’s very hot here, dry pitch, probably similar conditions to next year at the World Cup,” said Kane. “We probably weren’t good enough on the ball – we kept giving it away, which gave them confidence and energy.

There is always a lot of emotion. That is both its appeal and why it is so difficult for those in the game to make decisions. Ange Postecoglou gave Tottenham one of the great nights in the club’s history whenthey won the Europa Leaguein Bilbao.A first trophy in 17 years. A first European trophy in 41. It’s easy to understand why the instinct is gratitude, to hope that somehow victory can be self-replicating, that silverware begets silverware and something fundamental in Tottenham’s being was transformed at San Mamés.Ange-ball was breath of fresh air but Europa League alone could not save him | David HytnerRead moreBut the question really shouldn’t be how you felt about Postecoglou at 11pm CET on 21 May, but how you felt at 9pm. It makes no sense for anybody to have changed their mind on whether Postecoglou should stay on the basis of a dreadful performance from Manchester United and a goal scrambled in off Luke Shaw’s arm.When Postecoglou said he always wins something in his second season, the underlying logic was that it takes that long for the players to absorb his principles and put them into practice. Was there any sense of that in the Europa League success? Did it feel Tottenham had slowly been building to that?On the contrary, the wins against Eintracht Frankfurtin the quarter-final, Bodø/Glimtin the semi-finaland then United in the final weren’t rooted in Angeball as we had come to understand it, but in sitting deep, playing without the ball and striking on the break. On the one hand, credit is due for adapting, albeit largely because the high-intensity football Postecoglou prefers became unsustainable with a squad of injured and exhausted players, but on the other that removes any argument that the Europa League win was the result of an ongoing process.View image in fullscreenSpurs fans embraced Ange Postecoglou winning a trophy but their Europa League glory did not suggest further success.Photograph: Chris Foxwell/ProSports/ShutterstockA case perhaps could be made that the new pragmatic Postecoglou would have prospered in the Premier League next season. He was unfortunate with injuries – while acknowledging the intensity of his style may have played a part in that crisis. He was dealing with a very young squad. But that requires a leap of faith Daniel Levy was not prepared to make. Who did not watch Paris Saint-Germainripping through Interin the Champions League and wonder with a shudder what that might look like against a Postecoglou defence in the Super Cup in August?Precedents in football should be treated with caution: there’s no reason to assume what happened with one particular manager at one particular club in one particular set of circumstances will necessarily repeat with a different manager at a different club in a different set of circumstances. But the memory of Erik ten Hag casts an unavoidable shadow: Spurs could not afford to find themselves in the position United did last October,sacking a managerthree months after allowing his ideas to shape summer spending and in effect writing off another season.Tottenham have their own precedents:Juande Ramos went eight monthsafter the2008 League Cup finalandMauricio Pochettinofive and half months afterthe 2019 Champions League final. Ramos’s side were bottom of the league, Pochettino’s 14th. Levy has experienced the cost of an autumn sacking.If there were doubts, best to act upon them; Levy signalled his intention fairly clearly in his programme notes for the final game of the season. And, for all Danny Blanchflower’s line that the game is about glory has been thrown at Spurs since the decision was taken, Postecoglou’s departure leaves the glory of Bilbao unsullied by future failure.There is a beauty in the simplicity of the narrative arc: glory at the last, delivering on the promise of a trophy in the second season (albeit a glory that owed a lot to having significantly more resources than most clubs in the competition). That Postecoglou was dismissed two years to the day afterhis appointmentwas announced underlined the sense of a cycle ending.View image in fullscreenDaniel Levy (right), the Tottenham chair, did not want to risk another mid-season sacking.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockThe question then is what comes next. Tottenham’s preference isfor somebody with Premier League experience, which is understandable enough. The league is uniquely relentless, as evidenced by Bruno Fernandes’s comment about Ruben Amorim’s surprise at how good Ipswich were. That presents particular pressures that cangrind managers down. It removes some of the risk to turn to a manager familiar with that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The level of scrutiny, the expectations, at Tottenham are far greater than those at, say, Brentford or Fulham. Another autumn sacking must also haunt Levy:that of Nuno Espírito Santo, whose reign lasted 17 games over four months. He never seemed the right fit for the club and had been undermined by so obviously being not the first, or even the second or the third, choice for the role.Thomas Frank seems the preferred option, but that would require paying compensation to Brentford in excess of £10m. Levy is renowned for his willingness for protracted negotiations, but this is a case where swift resolution should take priority, even if it ends up costing a couple of million more than it might.‘A Spurs legend forever’: players hail Ange Postecoglou in wake of sackingRead moreAlready there has been some online grumbling that Spurs should not be appointing from Brentford, which is absurd given the job Frank has done (Brentford finished the season 10th on the 19th-highest wage bill in the Premier League) and how things turned out with the two big-name managers Tottenham have recently appointed, José Mourinho and Antonio Conte.But Postecoglou has left a problem for whoever succeeds him, both in terms of style and achievement. If the new manager starts slowly, there will be immediate grumbles that they are not building on the Europa League success and that the football is not so much fun as it was under Postecoglou, the 22 league defeats last season occluded by the gleam of silverware. Does a trophy win outweigh finishing fourth-bottom of the league?Perhaps that’s not the right question. Personnel decisions should be based less on what has been done than on what is likely to be done and Levy evidently saw Bilbao as a glorious blip rather than a harbinger of a spectacular future. On that logic, change was the only option.Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouInside footballTottenham HotspurAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Speculation over the Portugal forward’s future intensified last month when the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said discussions were under way about Ronaldo playing despite his club side, Saudi Arabia’s Al-Nassr, failing to qualify.Football Daily | Spain, France and the unexplainable magic of the Nations LeagueRead moreAsked about the possibility of signing for another club in order to play Ronaldo said: “It’s irrelevant, at the moment it doesn’t make sense to talk about things other than the national team.“There has been plenty of contact [from clubs], I see things that make sense, others that don’t. You can’t go to all of them, you have to think short, medium and long term. It’s something that’s practically decided on my part, which is not to go to theClub World Cup, but I’ve had plenty of invitations.”Al-Nassr’s sporting director, Fernando Hierro, said last month they were negotiating with Ronaldo over a contract extension but faced competition from clubs eager to sign the five-times Ballon d’Or winner. Ronaldo added to the uncertainty, posting on social media: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written.”The 40-year-old scored the winner asPortugalbeat Germany 2-1 in the semi-final at Munich’s Allianz Arena – also the venue for the final against Spain on Sunday. The Portugal captain played down suggestions that it is a face-off between himself and the 17-year-old Barcelona sensation, Lamine Yamal. “It’s always been like that, whenever I’ve played football, whenever I’ve played a big game it’s always been Cristiano against this one, against that one,” he said.“It’s been twentysomething years and it’s still the same. It doesn’t keep me up at night any more, it’s a normal thing. “[We] are completely different generations, a generation that’s starting out, another that’s finishing, which is my case. In reality it’s not like that, it’s a team against a team. It will always be like that.“What I want most is for Portugal to be at a good level, confident that things can go well, that we can play a great game and win against a very good team, possibly the best in the world.”Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappé has insisted he was happy to see his former club, Paris Saint-Germain, win the Champions League for the first time after his departure last summer.PSG thrashed Inter 5-0in Munich last week to lift the trophy, 12 months after Mbappé left on a free transfer in acrimonious circumstances.

But I didn’t really want to do that.”That was when Mark Gillett stepped in. The Premier League’s chief medical officer took part in Tour 21 in 2022 when Thomas had to give up because of the chronic pain he was in. Gillett recommended a hydrogel injection called Arthrosamid, which was first developed for treating horses and is now being used for those suffering with osteoarthritis in the knee.View image in fullscreenGeoff Thomas is tackling the Tour at the age of 60.Photograph: Tour 21“You put the injection into the joint, and over three to six months, it gets incorporated into the joint lining and forms a physical barrier,” he says. “So it’s like a gel barrier, so that, whereas in arthritis the natural lining of the joint gets eroded and you get really sensitive nerve endings and bone on bone, you get that barrier between the two, so you’re not feeling so much pain.”The results have been spectacular for Thomas, who jokes that “it feels like polyfilla at times”, adding: “I could feel the knee not going through the same pain as it was when I was trying to get back on the bike. A couple of months later, I’m getting out there and doing 135-mile rides again. It’s allowing me to have that dream of doing the Tour again.”Thomas, who won nine caps for England, knows all about overcoming the odds. He was given three months to live when he was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia in 2003, a year after retiring from playing. But, after receiving a stem cell transplant from his sister Kay and undergoing treatment from Prof Charlie Craddock, he entered remission in January 2005.View image in fullscreenGeoff Thomas on Mount Ventoux, one of the climbs he will have to conquer again in this year’s race starting on 28 June.Photograph: Joolze DymondThe life-saving treatment motivated him to embark on his first Tour 21 a few months later to raise money for continuing research into the disease, with Thomas estimating that each edition has helped to raise more than £1m for Cure Leukaemia, which has also been adopted as the Tour de France’s official charity partner.“What the charity’s done from when I was diagnosed in 2003 … the chances of any clinical trials going on in the world of blood cancer was minimal,” he says. “It was Charlie who really had this vision of building an infrastructure that would accelerate trials through the system. That’s up and running now and people are surviving in bigger numbers.”Thomas interrupted his training to see Palace finally lift their first major trophy bybeating Manchester City– the club he supported as a child – at Wembley in the FA Cup final. It was 35 years after he had led them to their first final, before Palace finished third in the old First Division the following season. They were denied a place in Europe as English clubs were being phased back into European competition after being banned in the mid-1980s, and Thomas is hoping that the lure of a Europa League campaign under Oliver Glasner can persuade some of their best players such as Marc Guéhi and Eberechi Eze to stay in south London. “Hopefully times are changing and Palace will be able to build on their success,” he says.But it is the prospect of completing this year’s gruelling route – which will feature five mountain finishes including the famous Hautacam, Ventoux and the Col de la Loze summits – that will occupy his mind over the next few weeks. Gillett has full confidence that Thomas can overcome his knee issues and make it to the finish line on the Champs Élysées in mid-July.View image in fullscreenGeoff Thomas in action for Crystal Palace against Manchester United in the 1990. FA Cup final.Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock“I’m a very optimistic guy, that’s part of my job,” he says. “But probably two or three months ago, I was thinking, ‘I’m not sure he can do this’. But he’s got a really good chance. He’s done incredibly well.”For Thomas, finally completing the Tour for a seventh time would be a fitting way to round off his cycling career. “In some ways, I wish I had finished in 2021 because it was fantastic riding into Paris knowing that we had raised so much money. But I knew I had to do it again and now I want to finish on a high to help celebrate Cure Leukaemia and what they are going to be doing over the next five to 10 years.”Support Geoff and the Tour 21 team in changing the future of treatment for blood cancer patients across the globe by donating to theirJust Giving page.Explore more on these topicsFootballCrystal PalaceTour de FranceCyclingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Barça reclaimed the title as Madrid’s giants faltered while Athletic, Celta and Rayo shook up the European placesSid LoweSat 7 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 16.39 EDTShareThe day La Liga 2024-25 began, Wojciech Szczesny was sitting on the beach in Marbella lighting up a cigarette, enjoying his retirement.The night it ended, he sat in the dressing room in Cornellà, 1,000km round the coast, andlit up a cigar instead. He had walked away in August, at 35 years old, unwanted andhis heart no longer in it, or so he thought. Nine months on, here he was surrounded by kids half his age, a footballer again and winner of every trophy his new home country had to offer. He had not lost a single league match en route to becoming a champion.“I’ve arrived where even my imagination wouldn’t even dare to take me,” Szczesny had said when he retired. And if he hadn’t dared imagine that, there was no way he could imaginethis: a Copa del Rey, a Super Cup and aChampions League semi-finalto go with the title.Summer had started withKylian Mbappé finally arrivingat the Santiago Bernabéu. Madrid hadjust won La Ligaand theChampions League; now they had the world’s best player too, beginning what Marca werealready declaring“a dominance never seen before”. They were going to walk it, which was perhaps part of the problem.As for Barcelona, their new face on the first day at a stadium which still did not feel like home was the star of Four Weddings and a Funeral, and that was probably just because someone misheard Joan Laporta say they desperately needed a huge grant. The team wore last year’s kit, no deal reached on a new one; Dani Olmo was not out there becausethey could not register him; and Nico Williams was, but on the other team. So supporters whistled him, because it washisfault that Barcelona did not have the money to sign him and had to settle forthe best player in La Ligainstead. There were three 17-year-olds in the starting XI; three days later one of them, Marc Bernal, tore his ACL and did not play again. But Barcelona won then andevery week for seven weeks.When they defeated Real Madrid 4-0in the firstclásico, it came as proof that maybe Barcelonareally were going to be goodafter all. And that maybeMadrid really were not. Barcelona left the Santiago Bernabéu six points clear, having won 10 of 11 league games. But then came what the head coach Hansi Flick called “shit November”, and December was not much better, the advantage lost again.The league tablefrom weeks 13 to 18had Barcelona bottom, no wins in seven, and they were beaten three times in a row at home: byLas PalmasandLéganes– both would end up relegated –and then Atlético Madrid. Alex Sørloth striding, ice cool through the bodies left on the floor, the hitmanfinishing the jobin the 95th minute. This too felt like a confirmation. Atlético hadspent more than anyone, Julián Alvarez, Robin Le Normand andearly-season revelationConor Gallagher all arriving with Sørloth. It had taken a while to take shape, a few frank conversations too, but they were Spain’s winter champions and genuine contenders. Maybe even favourites: a team with talent, strength and variety in depth, and an ability to score late goals that made it feel like maybe, just maybe, things would fall for them this time.View image in fullscreenThings started to unravel for Atlético and Diego Simeone with defeat at Leganés in January.Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty ImagesInstead it all unravelled for Atlético, which it tends to do. Defeat to Leganés in January ended a run of 15 consecutive wins and began one of just two victories in 10. In a single week, they hadthatdefeatto Real Madrid in the Champions League and lost 4-2 to Barcelona in La Liga despite going two up, conceding in the 92nd and 98th minutes. It was the first time they had lost a two-goal lead in 14 years, 725 games, under Diego Simeone. “Football is brutal,” Szczesny said afterwards. So brutal that Atlético’s coachhad to escape to Argentinato clear his head. When he got back, they lostthe Copa del Rey semi-finalto Barcelona too, their season over in early April.Real Madrid, meanwhile, were back in it. “I’m a bit confused because I keep hearing that we’re playing badly, but we’re top,” Carlo Ancelotti said with just a smidgen of sarcasm in early January. The truth was their play was even less convincing than the weekly videos they dedicated to the referees, and Barcelona were back on top within a month. By the time it all ended, it was hard to think of a genuinely good Real Madrid performance against a genuinely good team, unless Manchester City counted. “Our season starts for real,” Ancelottisaid that night, but it did not and thesubsequent loss to Arsenalwas justthe way they were. At the end of the season, when Mbappé’s former club had won the competition no sooner than he had left, an old Marca cover from another of PSG’s European eliminationsinevitably reappeared, showing the France forward with the headline: “if you want to win the Champions League, you know what you have to do”.No one in Spain scored more goals than Mbappé, the best debut campaign a Madrid goalscorer has ever had, but his acceleration was late and unaccompanied. He admitted he hadhit “rock bottom” first, and his revival did not bring the trophies or the moments he came for. It was not all about him, of course, but his arrival hadbeen part of the shift, a symbol. The season that was always going to be his had been a failure. “When a player like me comes to a team, many things change,” Mbappé said, and not all of them were for the better.Madrid lost12times, their flaws never more clearly laid bare than in theclásico, which kept coming round and with the same result. When Barcelona put five past Madrid in January it did not just win them the Super Cup, it was the start of them taking back control in the title race too. On the way into the stadium that night, news came through the sports ministry would let them register Olmo despite Barcelona missing the deadline, Laporta heading up to the directors’ box where he told the president of the federation exactly what he thought, shouting, swearing and a few days later shrugging:“I am the way I am”. Saudi Arabia was also where Iñaki Peña arrived a couple of minutes late to a team meeting, the excuse for Szczesny to make his first start. They also went on to win 16 and draw one of their next 17 league games,all the way to the title, won the Copa del Rey next, and got within 42 seconds (and the width of a post) of a first Champions League final in 10 years.Madrid did at least compete in the firstclásicocup final for 11 years – once they haddecided to actually turn up– but they were beaten again, the way they completely lost it at full-time saying something about their mental state which went beyond just the players. As ice flew the referee’s way, Antonio Rüdiger’s self-proclaimed madnessno longer seemed so funny. When the fourth and finalclásicoof the season came two weeks later, it wasa last chance for Madridto salvage something. They went two up inside 15 minutes and Mbappé eventually scored a hat-trick but Barcelona scored four before half-time,the perfect storm. For 24 minutes Madrid did not get out of their half –yes, literally– and the league was as good as gone. Four days later, when Barcelona won at Espanyol, it really was.View image in fullscreenBarcelona’s Lamine Yamal celebrates scoring against Real Madrid with teammate Ferran Torres.Photograph: Lluís Gené/AFP/Getty ImagesBarcelona won the double andatreble.Thetreble slipped through their fingers in the semi-final at San Siro, lessons to learn and promises made: Lamine Yamalvowed they would be back, which felt believable now in a way that 12 months earlier it could not have. Domestically, Barcelona had been too good and so much fun. In the cup meetings withprimerateams there was a 3-2, a 4-4, a 5-0 and a 5-1. In the league, they went away to the teams that finished in the Champions League places and scored five at Villarreal, four at Madrid, four at Atlético, three at Athletic. Oh, and four more at Girona, who played in it this season. Barça beat Madrid in all four meetings, scoring four, five, three and four again.They reached 102 league goals and the last of them, the last of all 995 scored in this La Liga season, came from Olmo on the final Sunday in May, which felt symbolic: he had been sitting in the stands when it all began, wondering if he was ever going to get on, andthen went through it all againin January. The league said he should not, the federation did too, so did a couple of judges. The sports ministry, though, disagreed. Ultimately the system had been played. Barcelona had won it all, open-topped bus heading out across the city. On the top deck, in a straw hat and sunglasses, every bit the senior citizen, Szczesny lit up another cigar.Below them, Madrid, Atlético, Athletic and Villarreal took the other Champions League places. Athletic had missed what might have beenthe biggest moment in their history, playing a European final in their own stadium, and had to host thousands of Manchester United and Spurs fans instead – but qualifying for their first Champions League campaign in a decade wasa monumental achievement. Villarreal’s return was significant too,literally breaking the ceilingas they celebrated.The other European places went to three teams who made football fun, and to whom it meant the world. “We’re pissed off to lose but we enjoy playing and if you enjoy playing you’re going to be closer to winning; this will help us in the long run,” the Celta de Vigo winger Alfon had said when theywere beaten by Madridin October, and by May he had been proved right. This was football the way it is supposed to be, all about belonging too. A young, fearless local team, full of Galician academy products and led by the youngest coach in the league had beenexpected to fight for survivalbut Iago Aspas,the greatest player in their history, scored the goal at Getafe that secured seventh on the final day, his tearful promise to return the team to Europe finally fulfilled eight years later.Thirteen kilometres away, Rayo Vallecano were made to wait a little longer for afiestaof their own, players gathered round a phone at full-time, anxiously watching the end of Osasuna’s game, but they returned to Europe 25 years later. They had been led there by Iñigo Pérez, the coach who only ever wears a T-shirt no matter how cold it is and who the British Home Office saidcould not make a significant contributionto English football so was forced to make history in Spain instead. From the moment a proper pitch invasion began and thegoalkeeper Augusto Batalla lost his shorts, only 15 seconds passed. “Vallecas entera, se va de borrachera,” the chant ran: the whole of Vallecas is going on the piss. “My grandad used to say to me ‘effort equals reward’. That’s not always true, but I’m happy that tonight it is,” Pérez said.View image in fullscreenRayo Vallecano qualified for European football for the first time since 2001.Photograph: Oscar Manuel Sanchez/AFP/ShutterstockAt the other end of the table, Sevilla were anabsolute car crash of a club, but somehow finished a point above relegation. Valenciahad looked lost, relegation increasingly a reality, untilCarlos Corberán arrived. Girona turned to the 38-year-old Cristhian Stuaniin times of troubleand he scored five in the last seven to save them. Alavés gave away 11 penalties, let all of them in and managed only five home goals in 2025, three of those penalties. They missed a fourth with just aboutthe worst spot-kick you will ever see, yet finally secured safety with a week to go.Real Valladolidhad been down for agesby then: they lost 18 of their last 19 games, collecting a solitary point from 57, the most pitiful run in history. Fans at the José Zorrilla Stadium saw them score just 11 times all year, while the midfielder Mario Martín was sent off as many times as he won matches. They were joined in relegation by Las Palmas,seemingly rescued by Diego Martínezonly to collapse again. The manager went from 19 points in nine matches to 10 in 20 and the second division. He was right: he did not have a magic wand after all.All of which left Leganés and Espanyol fighting to avoid the third relegation place on the final day. Three-nil up against Valladolid after an hour, Leganés were staying up, but then news filtered through of a very generous penalty in Cornellà. Javi Puado scored with Espanyol’s first shot on target against Las Palmas; with their second, Pere Milla made them safe and his manager cry. “You have no idea how much we have suffered,” Manolo González said. Back at Butarque, Leganés had an idea, the final 20 minutes played out to a surreal silence. “It was like someone had died,” the Leganés coach Borja Jiménez said. His teamhad beaten Barcelonaand Atlético but still gone down. Forty points had been enough to survive in nine of the last 10 seasons, but not this time. If you had neverseen a grown cucumber cry, you have now.The season was virtually over, just one thing left to do. Four days later, Betis, who had come from what Manuel Pellegrini described as the worst days of his six-years in charge to beingthe best team in La Ligafor much of 2025, had a historic European finalto play in Poland. It was not to be: they became the first Spanish teamto lose a final to a foreign sidesince Valencia and Alavés in 2001. But do not think that the only winners this season were the team with the retiree in goal, because there is always more. So pick out your tux, climb aboard your private jet and welcome to the25th Spanish football awards. Or, if you did not win, youcouldjuststay at home in a huffinstead.Most harmonious clubValladolid, where Juanmi Latasa and Luis Pérez sat on the bench watching the final minutes of another humiliating defeat, the former pointing out that this was “shit” and the latter telling him to shut up.

It was a cold, wet January morning in Pamplona, and the car that was supposed to take 78-year-old Mari Carmen to hospital hadn’t turned up, leaving her stranded on the street. So Osasuna’s all-time top scorer, who just happened to be passing,took her instead.Worst injuryConor Gallagher hadjust got the equaliser at Rayowhen he stopped and sat on the pitch, something not right. Teammates came to his side, the referee did too, a hush falling, everyone fearing that he had broken something. Which, as it happened, he had: his hair band.Best cameoWith about 20 minutes to go andReal Madridbeating Alavés 3-0, the Bernabéu started chanting for Ancelotti to bring defender Jesús Vallejo on for the first time in two years, so he did. Six minutes later, Alavés had scored twice and were pushing for an equaliser. Vallejo did not play another minute until the title race was over.Most loquacious manager“If I say what I think they’ll stick me in a cage,” the Espanyol manager Manolo González claimed, but luckily that never stopped him. The man who claimed “the nearest thing some people have seen to a football is a shoebox”, insisting “I don’t go to the surgeon and tell him how to operate on me because I haven’t got a fucking clue, but saying ridiculous things comes free,” described his refusal to go all-out attack as “not just driving straight off a cliff without braking”, said he goes “from heart bypass to heart bypass every week”, reckoned he would apply hair gel to his bald head “in case it brings good luck”, and responded to one particularly wild evening by claiming: “All that was missing was me falling pregnant.” “One day,” he said, “you’re John Travolta, the next you’re Manolo González.”Most loyal managerThe 38-year-old club legend Cristhian Stuani had not started a match for 10 months when coach Míchel made him captain for Girona’s first ever Champions League game, and he did not start another for two months after it either, but a promise is a promise. It got amply repaid too.Most emotional managerDiego Simeone literally running away when he realisedhe was about to cry live on TVthe night he completed 700 games in charge of Atletico Madrid.Best signingSebastian Haller or James Rodríguez. Or Barcelonanotgetting Nico Williams. OK, OK,it’s Ayoze Pérez.Best gambleThe Valencia keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili betting Vinícius Júnior €50 that he would save his penalty at the Bernabéu was a nice little bonus. Or itwould have beenif the Brazilian had paid up.Best touchAntonin Panenka was invited to take the honorary kick-off at Real Oviedo, so of course he …performed a back-heel. Coral Gutiérrez, Gran Canaria’s Queen of the Carnaval, went one better, not just taking the honorary kick-off before Las Palmas’ game against Alavés butdoing it with arabona.Oh, andPedri.Best tackleThe Barcelona midfielder Gavi and the Real Betis defender Diego Llorente teaming up to stick it to the man, taking out the referee Jesús Gil Manzano. Accidentally of course.Best hat-trickPaulo Gazzaniga’s three penalty savesagainst Athletic Club.Second best hat-trickAthletic’s Oihan Sancetagainst Girona keeper Gazzaniga, the next time they met.Best assistsWhen Lamine Yamalbent the ball perfectly into Raphinha’s pathwith the outside of his foot from 40 yards against Villarreal, the Brazilian neatly lifting it over the keeper. AS called it “the assist of the century,” but he did it a bit more often than that. There weretwo in Mallorca in five minutes, spinning and sliding across the turf like a bowling ball, and the one he played for Olmo against Espanyol might have been even better.Villarreal’s Álex Baena created more chances than anyone, another ballreleased with the outside of the bootfor Nicolas Pépé against Leganés the neatest of an endless flow of perfect deliveries. Antony and Iscobecame best mates at Betisbecause ofmoments like this. Adnan Januzaj and Fábio Silva only connected to score once for Las Palmas,but what a once. Fede Valverde’sflick for Kylian Mbappéwas nice. Antonio Blanco’scross for Kike Garcíacouldn’t have been better placed, althoughIago Aspas to Óscar Mingueza probably was. The best of the lot though came from agoalkeeper.Andriy Lunin, we salute you.Best goalAll of those are candidates but there’s only one winner, or there would have been hadthis moment of magicfromSamuel L Jackson’s golf partner, Oli McBurnie, not come back off the bar. So let’s head to Cornellà: César Azpilicueta finally ended his 18-year wait to score in La Liga, and likethis:Also at Espanyol, Ivan Cardonaran from one area to the other, and then thought:why not?; where Giovani Lo Celso and Antony handed in their entries,just five minutes apart; and of course where Lamine Yamaldid the Lamine Yamal again, this time to win the league.Everyone loves a goalkeeper scoring, so how about two of them scoring two games in a row? Always watch Eibar. On 5 April,Jonmi Magunagoitia headed homein the 95th minute for them against Real Oviedo; seven days later, Gaëtan Poussin scored against them for Real Zaragozain the 92nd minute. There’s something wonderfully soft about Fran Beltrán’s shot,gently guided in on the bounceagainst Valencia. Luka Sucic’s first-time finish for Real Sociedad against Atléticowas just as smooth.Hit quite a bit harder, every Fede Valverde goal is a belter: there were nine of them this season, scored from a combined distance of about 2,000km away. Seen live and from right behind, the one against Celta was the most ludicrous. Leaning back like that, the flash of the boot so fast, the ball bouncing up a touch too high, it should have flown out the ground rather than into the net.Then there’s Simeone. No, not that Simeone.Not that one, either, noreven that one. Here’sGianlucaSimeone. From inside his own half, to take third-tier Rayo Majadahondato the playoffs. Thisturn and finish from Antoine Griezmannwas so glorious, so graceful it earned him an ovation – from the opposition’s fans. But the winner is this from Raúl García against Rayo. Just look at that first touch. And the second’s not bad, either.Best goal celebrationThere was just one problem when Manuel Pellegrini celebrated a goal at Alavés: the shot didn’t actually go in, so the Betis coach sheepishly folded his arms back up again and pretended it had never happened. Diego Simeone went running towards Alex Sørloth after his late winner at Montjuïc, only toturn round and run back again, like a man whosuddenly rememberedhe had left the oven on. Ayoze Pérez doeslove a nice cup of tea. There’s something in Lamine Yamal’s signalling the postcode of Rocafonda, an act of belonging however big he gets. And Griezmann’s shirt-raising momentgave itself to something cinematic. In the end though, there was nothing like the collective embrace of an entire community when César Tárrega, from the town of Aldaia, scored the first goal at Mestalla after the floods thatkilled over 200 peoplein the Valencia region, a moment that meant so many different things to so many different people and a reminder that youareallowed to enjoy, to live.In fact, you’re supposed to.Best title celebrationBetis after the derby, except that wasn’tactuallya title,it just felt like one.Nor was the whole of Vallecas going on the piss in a battered blue bus; it was something better. Barcelona’s Pedri, Olmo, Iñigo Martínez and Eric Garcíacycling up Avinguda Diagonal in the darkit is, then.Best gameRayo-Leganés was a free-flowing festival of football in which from 93:37 to 104:41, the ball was in play for four whole seconds. The winner though is Villarreal-Celta, just aboutthe silliest match you could imagine. Seven goals from seven different men, the score going from 0-1, to 1-1, 1-2 to 3-2, and then to 3-3. Celta had two one-on-ones to win it on 94 and 95 only for Villarreal to actually do so on 100, the game eventually concluded in a way that was appropriately absurd. Hugo Álvarez grabbed hold of Thierno Barry’s shorts outside the box but forgot to let go and was dragged far enough to end up inside it and give away a penalty. With what should have been the last kick, Dani Parejo’s effort was saved by Iván Villar; with what actually was, he put away the rebound. “It’s hard to explain,” Celta’s Borja Iglesias admitted but this was to be enjoyed, not explained. “If we’re going to lose, let it be like this,” he said.Manager of the year“I dreamed of one day seeing Vigo like this and of a group of mates taking Celta into Europe,” Claudio Giráldez said, andhe had made it so. Manuel Pellegrini might just be the best coach Villarreal, MálagaandBetishave ever had. Valencia announced the arrival of Carlos Corberán on 25 December and it turned out hereally was their Messiah. The amazing thing about it was that it was at 1.42am. There wasnogabarrathis time, but Ernesto Valverde took Athletic to the Champions League. And Iñigo Pérez isbringing Europe to thebarrio, whether Europe’s ready or not. But really,how can it not be Hansi Flick?View image in fullscreenCelta’s Claudio Giráldez and Iago Aspas soak up Europa League qualification.Photograph: Aitor Alcalde/Getty ImagesPlayer of the yearCome back in five minutes and the answer will have changed again. The candidates are clear, but choosing a winner messes with your mind. In the end, it comes down to three Barcelona players, although had Isco and Antony been at Betis all year that list might just be a little longer. No one played like Pedri, no onecanplay like Pedri.Raphinha was a revelation. AndLamine Yamal is ridiculous. Where did those fans go with their rock, paper and scissors? Come on, hurry up. Oh, OK. Raphinha.Team of the season4-3-3:Joan García (Espanyol); Andrei Ratiu (Rayo), Dani Vivian (Athletic), Iñigo Martínez (Barcelona), Óscar Mingueza (Celta); Pedri (Barcelona), Isco (Betis), Álex Baena (Villarreal); Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid), Raphinha (Barcelona).Subs:Sergi Cardona (Villarreal), Fede Valverde (Madrid), Ante Budimir (Osasuna), Ayoze Pérez (Villarreal), Mauro Arambarri, Luis Milla (Getafe), Mikel Jauregizar, Iñaki Williams, Oihan Sancet (Athletic), Julián Alvarez (Atlético), Antony (Betis), Carlos Vicente, Kike García (Alavés), Jules Koundé (Barcelona). Oh, and Alex Sorløth, of course.And finally, some words of wisdomAsked how many lives he has as he seems to get killed every week but somehow he’s still there, Carlo Ancelotti replies: “One, and I try to enjoy it.” Which is a nice place to leave it.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballReal MadridBarcelonaAtlético MadridLeganésCelta VigofeaturesShareReuse this content"

A lot of lies have been told’Tom GarryMidfielder on being left out of France’s Euro 2025 squad, her exit from Aston Villa and a new lease of life in San DiegoSat 7 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘I had hard times and this team really gave me back my love and motivation for football,” Kenza Dali says of San Diego Wave as she prepares to open up on a turbulent year.Over the course of a refreshingly honest conversation, the midfielder reveals why she left Aston Villa to move to the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) in January, details why she is enjoying working under Jonas Eidevall and discusses, for the first time, the grief that affected her participation in the Olympics. There is, however, one topic on which she is not quite ready to go into details yet.France drop Renard, Le Sommer and Dali in shock cull before Women’s EurosRead moreThe 33-year-old, who has 76 caps for France, was one of three experienced stars – alongside the former captain Wendie Renard and Eugénie Le Sommer – left out when head coach Laurent Bonadei named his squad for the European Championship. Dali is clearly saddened by the situation but does not want a war of words to distract her compatriots as they prepare for the tournament. “I will tell my side of the story after the Euros, for only one reason – it’s because I have too much respect for my teammates to put the spotlight on a decision that is difficult to accept because I think there are a lot of lies,” she says.“I really hope they do well. I have too much respect for the jersey to put out my side of the story now. I know it’s going to be everywhere and they are preparing for the Euros and I don’t want to disturb that. But it’s difficult for me because I’ve been playing maybe some of my best football. It’s really difficult to digest because there are a lot of lies in the story that’s been told but I will tell my side after the Euros.”Dali has good reason to feel proud of her form since moving to California. She has been a key player for San Diego this season, helping them to a flying start. The Wave are second in the table, a vast improvement on their 10th-place finish last term, under the guidance of the former Arsenal manager Eidevall, who was appointed head coach in January.View image in fullscreenKenza Dali says she is enjoying her football again in the NWSL.Photograph: Meg McLaughlin/NWSL/Getty Images“When I signed for San Diego a lot of people thought I was crazy,” she says. “They were like: ‘They had a terrible season last season, the environment isn’t great’ … I heard a lot of things. But I’m someone that wants to see with my own eyes and the work of the people behind the scenes has been incredible. The recruitment has been really, really good, and the appointment of Jonas was a massive difference too.“The funny part is, I heard a lot about Jonas in England and not always nice things. When I joined San Diego, people were like: ‘What is she doing? She’s going with Jonas!’ But I really enjoy the way he is working. He’s really tactical. He really works a lot and San Diego’s performances are credit to him. He built an identity in a short space of time. My relationship with him is great. I’m really enjoying every single minute.”Dali goes on to express how much she is enjoying coffee by the beach along the Pacific coast after her spells in England with West Ham, Everton and Villa. Her mood is good, which is a contrast to last summer as she competed at a home Olympics feeling upset following a family bereavement.“I lost someone that I was really, really close to, a member of my family,” reveals Dali, who scored in France’s group-stage victory over Colombia in Lyon to help them reach the quarter-finals.“I don’t want to say who but that really affected me personally. The Olympics were really, really difficult for me because this person used to be at all my national team games.View image in fullscreenKenza Dali in action for France in 2024.Photograph: Stéphanie Lecocq/Reuters“I didn’t want to play the Olympics because I was grieving and it happened two weeks before. My teammates convinced me to stay, Hervé Renard [France’s coach at the time] was amazing to me. I ate with the team and participated with training and meetings and then I was going to see my family. So the Olympics were really tough.”And then she returned to her club. “After the Olympics I got time off, because of my circumstances, and then I arrived at Villa. I was really happy to come back but the new manager [Robert de Pauw] didn’t want me there,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I was like: ‘Wow, this is a shock,’ because I had been really looking forward to [returning to] Villa.“I waited until the winter. Then they changed manager again [to Natalia Arroyo after Shaun Goater had briefly been in charge on an interim basis] and my contract was until the end of June, so I went straight to the club and said that I’m staying even if the offer from San Diego was massive [because], for me, Villa was home. But I didn’t feel the club wanted me to stay. They didn’t make me feel that I was a priority any more.”‘San Diego really put everything in for me to come and, after all that had happened for me, I really wanted to be in an environment that I was valued,” Dali adds. “This is a completely honest answer that I’ve never shared, this is what happened. Jonas really wanted me. He explained to me his gameplan and where he sees me in his system, and he convinced me. I had other offers but I picked San Diego. I’m glad I did it because I’m enjoying my football again.”View image in fullscreenKenza Dali says of her Aston Villa exit she ‘didn’t feel the club wanted me to stay’.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PADali, who helped France reach the Euro 2022 semi-finals, is not only enjoying playing for San Diego but, more broadly, playing in the NWSL: “The massive difference is the fact that every team is playing for a title,” she says.“In England you’re starting the league thinking: ‘I’m going to try my best to finish top five.’ The top four never really change. In America, because of the salary cap and everything that is different here, I feel like everyone has the same level. But I love English football, England is the country of football. That’s why it was really hard for me to leave.“When I start a competition, I want to win as many games as I can,” she adds. “I’d prefer to lose 5–0 but [know I] tried than to park the bus and concede three. This is not my vision of football.“Our first objective here was to qualify for the playoffs but, as a group, we want so much more. We’re kind of going step by step. It’s a completely brand-new team. With 11 or more new players, what we’re doing right now is unbelievable. I do think we have the team to compete for something big.”Explore more on these topicsFrance women's football teamNWSLAston Villa WomenWomen's footballUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Lambourn was not the first string in the trainer’s three-strong team – Delacroix, the 2-1 favourite with Ryan Moore in the saddle was only ninth – but like every other horse at the yard, he had been prepared like an Epsom horse from his first days at the yard.Like Minnie Hauk, Friday’s Oaks winner, he had also been sent to Chester’s May meeting, where the undulations and turns are similar to those at Epsom, to complete his preparation for Saturday’s race, and having been sent straight into the lead by Wayne Lordan, his jockey, he gained another length or two on his field with a slick, assured passage down the hill and around Tattenham Corner.Lambourn wins the 2025 Derby in dominant fashion: horse racing – liveRead moreLazy Griff, who was one and a half lengths behind Lambourn in the Chester Vase, had also been close to the pace from the off and briefly threatened to make inroads into Lambourn’s lead from three out, but Lambourn found more when Lordan asked for a final effort and he was nearly four lengths in front of Lazy Griff (50-1) and Christophe Soumillon at the line. Tennessee Stud, another outsider at 28-1, was third for trainer Joseph O’Brien, the winning jockey aboard Australia, Lambourn’s sire, in 2014.Lambourn, in fact, is a third-generation Derby winner for O’Brien, as Australia was sired by Galileo, the first of his record total of 11 Derby winners in 2001.“He’s a lazy horse, and Chester is always great place for putting an edge on a horse,” O’Brien said. “It makes them quick and wakes them up, there’s a great atmosphere there and there on the turn. So we always think Chester really sharpens them up, it gives them quick feet and we always send good horses there.“Lambourn was second to Delacroix [in the Ballysax Stakes] first time out, and we took him to Chester and Ryan loved him at Chester, but he couldn’t ride them all. I’d say he’s probably an Irish Derby horse [for his next race], but he will get further as well.“Ryan said he got taken out of his ground over halfway [on Delacroix] so his chance was over. Colin [Keane] said The Lion In Winter wasn’t going forward, so it was maybe the track or the ground.”For Lordan, who picked up the ride on Lambourn when Moore opted for Delacroix, this was a first Derby victory and as close to an armchair ride as it gets around Epsom.View image in fullscreenWinning jockey Wayne Lordan and trainer Aidan O’Brien celebrate with the trophy after sending out Lambourn to win the Derby.Photograph: Harry Murphy/Getty Images“He’s a lovely, genuine horse,” Lordan said. “When I jumped I just wanted to get him into a stride because he’s a horse that stays well, and races lazily also.“He was enjoying it in front and his ears were pricked and I was able to go forward good and early. I did feel [going into the race] that he was a bit underrated, because he’s not a flashy horse, he just goes on the bridle and does his own thing. The other horses are good travellers and quicken, mine is just genuine and goes with the flow, but when you look for him, there’s loads in there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has had well-documented struggles with her serve and forehand, and every step of her journey has been scrutinised. Regardless of the difficulties and setbacks, she just kept on working. At just 21 years old she is now a two-time grand slam champion.Since losing her first final at Roland Garros in 2022 aged 18, Gauff has won her two subsequent grand slam finals and now holds a 10-3 record in finals overall. “I was going through a lot of things when I lost in this final three years ago,” said Gauff. “I’m just happy to be here, a lot of dark thoughts. Just the fact that I stayed to it just means a lot.”This victory also underlines the importance of remaining patient. After a difficult start to the season, Gauff found her form on the red clay, reaching finals at the Madrid Open and Italian Open. Gauff lost to Sabalenka intwo tough sets in Madridbefore squandering a significant opportunity againstJasmine Paolini in Rome. In the biggest clay court tournament of all, she rose to the occasion. “I got the most important one, so I guess that’s all that matters,” she said.View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff celebrates winning the second grand slam title of her career.Photograph: Thibaud Moritz/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile Sabalenka has previously used humour as a coping mechanism after difficult losses, jokingly lambasting her team, her anger was plain to see after yet another edgy performance in a grand slam final. It has taken an immense effort for the 27-year-old to transform her game and mentality, an improvement underlined by her semi-final win over the four-time champion Iga Swiatek. But here she was overcome by her emotions in the most difficult moments.A tearful Sabalenka lambasted her performance and the conditions: “This loss hurts so much, especially after such a tough two weeks, I played great tennis. And in these terrible conditions, showed such terrible tennis in the final.”This occasion marked the first French Open final between the top two female players since 2012. Sabalenka and Gauff have built an intense rivalry over the last five years, contesting numerous dramatic three-set matches, including an unforgettable tussle in New York, whereGauff defeated Sabalenkato win her first major title at the 2023 US Open.Quick GuideKlugman's bid for junior glory falls shortShowHannah Klugman’s bid to become Britain’s first French Open juniors champion in 49 years ended in a straight-sets defeat to Austrian Lilli Tagger in the final. The 16-year-old was beaten 6-2, 6-0 by the17-year-old Tagger in front of a packed Court Simonne-Mathieu. Klugman, ranked 13th in the world junior rankings, was hoping to emulate Michelle Tyler, the last British player to win the girls’ title in 1976.Elsewhere, Alfie Hewett was beaten 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) by Japan's Tokito Oda in the men's wheelchair final. Hewett teams up with Gordon Reid later in the men's wheelchair doubles final, against Oda and France's Stephane Houdet.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Despite windy conditions from the opening point, Sabalenka struck the ball beautifully early on as she established a 4-1 lead. But then she fell apart. She struggled badly with the wind, losing control of her emotions and a rapidly rising unforced error count. With Sabalenka’s groundstrokes in disarray, a tenacious Gauff chased down every ball and gave nothing away. Down 3-5 in the tiebreak, Sabalenka regained composure and reeled off four consecutive points to take the set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, the emotional energy she used up seemed to leave its mark. While the Belarusian started the second set completely flat and increasingly frustrated by the gusty conditions, Gauff rose to the occasion.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka started the final well but as the match went on struggled with consistency.Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty ImagesIn stark contrast to Sabalenka, Gauff remained positive, cheering on her successful points while betraying minimal emotion when she faltered. She focused intently on chasing down every ball, extending every point and looking for opportunities to impose herself. She refused to lose her cool when the wind kicked up on key points.Gauff pushed Sabalenka back with her backhand and smothered her opponent’s second serve in the second and third sets. Her forehand, once a weakness, held up brilliantly, its heavy topspin kicking up out of Sabalenka’s strike zone. She found searing first serves when she needed them. In the most difficult moments, including a breathless final game that veered from match point to break point and back again, Gauff’s mental fortitude guided her through as she closed out the best win of her career.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenCoco GauffAryna SabalenkaTennisUS sportsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We will restore it – stronger, bolder, and with even more purpose. Black history is American history. And no spray paint can erase that truth.“Robinson broke the color barrier in Major LeagueBaseballwhen he took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. The Hall of Famer’s uniform No 42 is retired throughout the big leagues.Minoso, who was born in Cuba, also broke ground as the first Black Latino player when he played for Cleveland in 1949. He was inducted into Cooperstown in 2022.US representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat from Florida, called the vandalism a “vile act of hatred” in a statement Wednesday.“We must treat this for what it is: a hate crime meant to instill fear and division,” she said. “But we will not be intimidated. We will respond with unity, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to truth, justice, and the preservation of our history.”In 2024, a statue of Robinsonwas stolen from a park in Wichita, Kansas, and later found burned and dismantled.Explore more on these topicsBaseballMiamiMLBUS sportsShareReuse this content"

You’ll have to forgive the cliche, because it’s literally true. The author ofThe Anxious Generation, an urgent warning about the effect of digital tech on young minds, is based at New York University’s business school: “I’m around all these corporate types and we’re always talking about companies and their mission statements,” he tells me. So, he decided to make one for himself. “It was very simple: ‘My mission is to use my research in moral psychology and that of others to help people better understand each other, and to help important social institutions work well.’”This is characteristic of Haidt: there’s the risk that writing your own brand manifesto might seem a bit, well, pompous. What comes across instead is the nerd’s desire to be as effective as possible, combined with the positive psychologist’s love of self-improvement (one of his signature undergraduate courses is called Flourishing, which sets students homework such as “catch and analyse 10 automatic thoughts”).He is in London for a week or so and we meet in the deserted cocktail bar of a grand hotel off Whitehall at 8am (the early start makes me feel as if I’m being dragged into the orbit of a fearsome productivity routine). He speaks softly as a result of a vocal cord injury, which adds to an impression of scholarly courtesy – punctuated by bursts of excitement when he talks about, say, Socrates or the US constitution.It also belies the fact that he’s written a monster bestseller, and is now a busy campaigner. The Anxious Generation, out in paperback, follows books on happiness, political polarisation and campus culture wars. It’s an evidence-based but thoroughly mission-driven call to action: smartphones, he argues, are largely responsible for a collapse in young people’s mental health since 2010. The gloomy picture takes in increased anxiety, depression, even self-harm and suicide (with hard indicators such as an uptick in emergency room admissions for self-inflicted injuries meaning that it can’t be down to increased “awareness” or diagnosis creep). There are ways out of the mess, Haidt says, but time is limited, particularly if we want to avert the even greater threat posed by AI.View image in fullscreenJonathan Haidt.Photograph: Hayley BenoitThe book has sold 1.7m copies in 44 languages, capturing the attention of a different anxious generation – parents thankful they were born too early for the phone-based childhoods Haidt describes in dispiriting detail, but desperate for guidance now they have children of their own. His statement of the problem, and straightforward advice on what to do about it, has convinced policymakers, too. In Australia, where aban on social media for under-16swill take effect later this year, his work has changed the law. The wife of the politician who helped design the legislation was reading The Anxious Generation in bed, Haidt told one interviewer, “and she turns to him and says: ‘You’ve got to read this book, and then you’ve got to effing do something about it.’” The day before we meet, he attended a session in parliament organised by the crossbench peer Beeban Kidron, whose rules to protect children’s privacy on social media became part of the 2018 Data Protection Act (“she has been a force of nature”). And he’s in touch with UK government ministers as well: “I won’t mention names. I will be talking to a couple by Zoom.”So what is his prescription to reverse, or at least treat, what he calls the Great Rewiring of children’s lives? He sets out “four norms” that parents, and society at large, should adopt: no smartphones before the age of 14; no social media until 16; phone-free schools; and far more unsupervised play and childhood independence. Although The Anxious Generation has largely been seen as a book about digital devices, it’s as emphatic about that last point. Boomers, gen Xers and even millennials enjoyed plenty of free play outside when crime rates were much higher than they are now. Modern parents, exposed to a diet of constant bad news, are more paranoid. This stunts development, reducing the opportunity to learn skills such as cooperation and conflict resolution, to overcome fears and, well, to have fun.Essentially, he argues, we’re guilty of overprotection in one place (the real world) and underprotection in another (online). “I think that was one of the important points ofAdolescence,” he says, referencing the Netflix show that dramatised the influence of the “manosphere” on teenage boys. “We all freaked out in the 90s about the outside world. We all thought our kids are in danger if they’re not in our sight, and so we’ve stopped letting them out, and we thought: well, as long as they’re on computers, that’s good. They’ll learn to program. They’ll start a company. One of the poignant moments in [the show] was when the parents said: ‘We thought he was safe. He was just up in his room.’”The four norms look simple enough on paper. But what about the fiendish reality of enforcing them, particularly if your children are already extremely online? “What I found in the year since the book came out is that parents with young children love it,” Haidt says. “They’re excited, like: yes, we’re going to do this. Whereas parents of teenagers have more mixed reactions, for exactly the reason that all of us are already so deeply into this.”Haidt has two children of his own with artist and photographer Jayne Riew: a girl of 15 and a boy of 18. “The advice that I give to parents of teenagers is, if you recently gave your child a smartphone or social media, you can take it back. Give them a flip phone, a brick phone, a dumb phone. The key is you want your kids to be able to communicate with their friends, but you don’t want to give them over to for-profit companies [whose] goal is to hook your child.”“Now, if your kids are 15 or 16 and their entire social lives are on Instagram and Snapchat, it would be very painful to cut them off,” he says, “because they’ll experience that as social death. So the key strategy … is to help them take back their attention by creating large parts of the day where they’re not on it.” Ban devices in the bedroom, push for phone-free schools, do everything you can to expand the window of time spent away from addictive tech.Human consciousness is being changed at an industrial scaleBack in 2019, when he was laying down ground rules for his own children, the evidence pointed to social media as the greater evil, particularly for girls. So he banned that, rather than phones per se. “My daughter says she’s the only person in her high school who doesn’t have Snapchat.” Isn’t he worried about her being left out? “Her friends have compensated for it. They say when there’s something important going on that she needs to know about, they’ll text her so she’s not entirely out of the loop, and it’s been great, because she is really involved in the real world. She runs track, she does sewing and makes clothing.” Even so, he would do things slightly differently now: “The rule I wish I had followed was no screens in the bedroom, ever. My kids seem to need their computers and their phones more than they would have if I’d had a better policy.”Haidt clearly loves his job, and sets great store by what he regards as the truth-telling function of academic research. But with the book’s success, is there a risk he morphs into a kind of activist? Yes, he concedes, though he doesn’t seem unhappy about it. “Once I came to realise the full extent of what is happening to literally hundreds of millions of children – I mean, human consciousness is being changed at an industrial scale – and the fact that AI is not yet entangled in our world, but in two years it will be very hard to do anything – I [felt] a kind of a campaigner’s zeal to get this done, to get the norms changed this year.”When I mention a colleague who hears from her kids that “everyone does their homework using ChatGPT” he nods, and says “this is a potentially unsolvable problem for education. Like all teachers, we’re struggling to figure out what to do. It makes it easy for everyone to do their homework, but students need to learn how to dohardthings.”Does his newfound zeal mean it’s harder for him to admit he might be wrong? To give counterarguments their due? “Oh, yeah, I suffer from confirmation bias like everyone else. I have a whole book on confirmation bias, practically [2012’sThe Righteous Mind]. And so that’s why one thing that we’ve done from the very beginning is seek out contradictory views, talk to our critics, have them publish on the Substack.” Haidt, with researcher Zach Rausch, maintains a running commentary on the evidence base for the Great Rewiring atafterbabel.com. There, he posts “responses to sceptics” who question the link between screens and declining mental health. Some claim there are better explanations, such as Covid (though indicators of wellbeing started declining in 2010) or the climate crisis (though preteens, rather than more politically aware adolescents, seem to be particularly affected – the opposite of what you’d expect if climate worries were responsible).In March 2024, psychologist Candice Odgers wrote areviewof The Anxious Generation in Nature. She said: “Hundreds of researchers, myself included, have searched for the kind of large effects suggested by Haidt. Our efforts have produced a mix of no, small and mixed associations,” adding that “most data are correlative”. In other words: the problem may have coincided with the introduction of smartphones, but we can’t say that there’s a causal link. Odgers instead leans towards the idea that people with pre-existing problems use social media more, or in more destructive ways.Haidt comes out fighting, though, citing “dozens” of papers, including, for example, ameta-analysisof 26 studies that found the risk of depression increased by 13% for each extra hour spent on social media. “She accused me of not knowing the difference between correlation and causation. That has structured the debate ever since. And the strange thing about that review, I just looked back at it the other day, what I realised is there’s not a single word that indicates that she read past chapter one.” This seems hard to believe, but, Haidt says, “I had a long section in chapter six specifically titled ‘correlation versus causation’”. When I asked her to respond to this later, Odgers said: “The issue is not a failure to understand the distinction between correlation versus causation, it is the failure toapplythis understanding when making causal, and frankly damaging, claims about young people that will be heard by millions of people.”Companies have acknowledged that children are vulnerable in internal reports never intended for public consumptionOur conversation starts to go down a rabbit hole as Haid attempts to show me a long rebuttal document he’s writing on the five kinds of evidence of harm, with multiple subheadings, sections labelled “Exhibit A” etc. “I love debating and arguing, and that’s what drew me to academic life … but the accusation that I don’t understand the difference in correlation and causation, I guess that did get to me.”One important part of the puzzle, he says, is that companies have acknowledged that children are vulnerable in internal reports never intended for public consumption. Hecites one by TikTok, for example, admitting that the app was “popular with younger users who are particularly sensitive to reinforcement in the form of social reward and have minimal ability to self-regulate effectively”. When contacted by the Guardian, TikTok declined to comment.If the evidence is so strong, what does he think drives his critics? “I think some of them seem to be motivated by an admirable desire to defend the kids, to say, ‘Look, if this is what the kids are doing, we adults shouldn’t criticise’.” He claims that “some of the researchers are deep video gamers, and they went through this whole thing about ‘Do violent video games cause violence?’. So they seem especially primed to see everything as just a replay of previous moral panics.”I also wonder whether he’s got people’s backs up through his interventions in academic life, railing against what he sees as progressive overreach. His 2018 book with Greg Lukianoff,The Coddling of the American Mind, was based on an Atlantic piece of the same name, though it’s more careful and caveated than the title makes it seem (editor Don Peck zhuzhed it up from Arguing Towards Misery: How Campuses Teach Cognitive Distortions). The idea is that colleges have become highly risk-averse places, where students expect to be shielded from difficult ideas, and faculty and administrators live in fear of career-wrecking complaints based on offended sensibilities.There are many reasons for this turn, Haidt argues, some of which overlap with those set out in The Anxious Generation: overprotective parenting raising a generation of fragile, nervous kids, for one. He cites the expectation of good “customer service” driven by high tuition fees, and an administrative culture of “CYA” (cover your ass). But he also blames a lack of “viewpoint diversity” among faculty, leading to a moribund, timid intellectual environment and a failure to push back against overly empowered students.This argument hits a little differently in 2025, with the Trump administration carrying out an unprecedented assault on universities, and using “woke” culture on campus as its primary justification. Aletter sent by officialsmenacing Harvard specifically demands “viewpoint diversity in admissions and hiring”. Is it a case of be careful what you wish for? Or, more directly, did Haidt’s championing of this issue provide ammunition for the current war against academic independence?“I don’t think the fact that I’ve been calling for reform since 2011 should be used against me when the fact that therewasn’treform became a trigger for Donald Trump,” he says. Haidt believes the progressive monoculture that produced calls to, among other things, defund the police and abolish standardised tests alienated “normies” to the extent that Trump rode into office “on a wave of revulsion about what’s happening on campus and more broadly in society”. Surely inflation, the cost of living, played a larger role in voters’ rejection of the Democratic candidate? Haidt concedes that “it contributed”, but otherwise sticks to his guns in a way that, to me, suggests he’s a little too immersed in this particular debate to see thebigger picture. Which is not to say he isn’t outraged by the way things have unfolded. Still speaking softly and precisely, he unleashes the Haidtian version of a tirade.“Trump is a deeply unstable, narcissistic man who has a zero sum view of the world and a strong sense of vengeance. And now [he’s] using the power of the federal government and the department of justice to harass and harm his enemies … this is the most shocking transformation of America I’ve ever heard of. So while I have been a critic of schools like Harvard that, you know, was ranked as theworst university for free speechin the country … now everything is reversed.” He adds that “[Trump] is especially using antisemitism as a cudgel. I don’t think that’s his real motivation. And while I have always stood for the value of viewpoint diversity, so I think President Trump is not wrong to call for it, I’ve also always stood against government micromanaging what universities do.”In The Coddling … Haidt declared himself “a centrist who sides with the Democratic party on the great majority of issues” and said that he had never voted Republican for Congress or the presidency. More recently, he stated: “I was always on the left. Now, I’m nothing. I’m not on any team.” Either way, he has undoubtedly annoyed progressives who take a more instinctively tribal approach. A contrarian by nature, he also sees that instinct as an essential part of any intellectual’s toolkit. His postdoc supervisor, cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder, modelled “an incredible playfulness with ideas and a joy in intellectual perversity, which means his dictum was: if someone asserts it, deny it and see how that goes. And if someone denies it, assert it and see how that goes.”Does that make him a bit irritating? “Oh, yes, it does,” he says, without a trace of offence. That’s the point: “The founding story of the academic world is Socrates being a gadfly.” Does it ever bleed into his personal life? “My wife and I have long had a conflict of truth versus beauty, and in my view, she is willing to sacrifice truth for beauty. I have to have a footnote for everything. There has to be a source for everything. And that sometimes makes me annoying to her.”“Carried to excess it [has] the risk of know-it-allism, and I’ve been accused of that by my wife – and several ex-girlfriends. So yeah, I think my strengths are also my weaknesses. The same is true for everyone.”The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt – a pocket full of poisonRead moreThe Anxious Generation started life as a different book about the corrupting effects of social media on democracy. After he’d written one chapter, Haidt realised that the scale and urgency of the problem faced by children and teens meant it would have to be about them instead. He still has plans to go back to the first idea, but given everything that’s happened, he’s taking two or three years “off” to support the movement he’s started (“I don’t have to drive it, I just have to help it along”). He says he’s optimistic – “very optimistic that we’re going to, if not fully solve it, make enormous progress – we already are.”This is energising, but I note that, when discussing “green shoots” of hope back in 2018, he welcomed the new, socially responsible approach taken by Facebook and Twitter, including the latter’s commitment to “increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation”. “Yeah, that died. That green shoot did not go very far,” he sighs. And in a follow-up exchange, he strikes an even darker note. I ask about the broader picture – as a student of societies, is he concerned about … the end of civilisation as we know it?Somewhat alarmingly for a man who first made his name in the Pollyanna-ish field of positive psychology, he really is. “I am extremely worried about social collapse,” he emails. “Technology always changes societies, and we are just beginning the biggest technological change in history. It will only speed up as AI becomes entangled in everything. So we are headed into very dangerous times, especially for liberal democracies that require some degree of shared facts, shared stories and trusted institutions.“This is part of the reason I feel such urgency to protect kids now, this year, 2025. The next two generations may face challenges beyond anything we can imagine. They need to be strong, competent and in control of their attention.”The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt is published by Penguin.

The highly public split included, among other highlights, the world’s richest person accusing the president of the United States of associating with a notorious sex offender. Trump said Musk had “lost his mind”.As Musk and Trump traded insults, each on his own social network, they also issued threats with tangible consequences. Trump suggested that he could cancel all of Musk’s government contracts and subsidies – “the best way to save money”, he posted – a move that would have devastating consequences not only on the tech billionaire’s companies but also on the federal agencies that have come to depend on them. Musk responded by announcing thathe would begin decommissioningthe SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that Nasa relies on for transport missions, although he later reversed the decision.While the ongoing episode had the tenor of sensational reality TV, the fight between Trump and Musk once again exposed the danger of putting key public goods in the hands of private companies controlled by erratic billionaires. It highlighted how something like space travel, once a vaunted and collective national enterprise, can now be almost entirely derailed by the emotional whims of a single person.Musk and Trump’s partnership had already fueled months of concern about corruption and calls for investigations into the Tesla CEO’s use of his position in government to benefit his companies. The breakup has highlighted another risk of Musk’s deep ties with the government, where the services that he provides can now become collateral damage in interpersonal disputes. Tens of billions of dollars hang in the balance of their fight.The messy, public way that the clash has played out also serves as a reminder of how unpredictable their decision-making can be. Musk’s vow to sideline SpaceX’s spacecraft and his reversal, without which the US would have immediately been prevented from reaching the International Space Station (ISS), appeared, for instance, as an emotional lash-out amid a string of other insults against Trump, and it was nearly impossible to discern whether he was serious.“In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” Musk posted without warning on Thursday.“Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon,” Musk followed up less than a day later, responding to an anonymous user with about 5,000 followers who said he should “cool off and take a step back for a couple days”.If Musk and Trump’s fight ends up disrupting government services or further turning them into political leverage, it will not have come without warning. Ever since Musk refused in 2023 tolet Ukraine use Starlinkin Crimea to launch a surprise attack against Russian forces, governments have dealt with the uncomfortable reality of Musk’s control over global infrastructure. Musk’s claim thathe could hobbleUkraine’s “entire front line” by turning off Starlink caused a diplomatic incident earlier this year. Meanwhile, European governments have recentlyrushed to find alternativesto Starlink amid concerns over Musk’s unpredictability.While Musk provoked foreign governments and acted as an unaccountable global power broker, the US has by contrast continued to hand him contracts and increase its dependence on his companies. Space operations in particular have become practically synonymous with Musk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nasa has also contracted SpaceX for its planned crewed mission to the moon, as well as a mission to explore one of Saturn’s moons. Last year, the agency turned to SpaceX when it needed torescue two astronautsstuck on the ISS.The government’s reliance on Musk’s empire also extends beyond Nasa. The Pentagon has extensive contracts with Musk, using SpaceX to launch intelligence satellites. SpaceX wasalso the frontrunnerin the Trump administration’s plans to build a “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, which has become a US national defense priority. Starlink, Musk’s satellite communications service, had also made inroads into the government to the point that it was installed this year at the White House.Musk is still accountable to market forces and the investors backing his companies, as was made evident on Thursday after Tesla’s shares plunged roughly 14% during his dustup with Trump. Musk has previously stated that he is willing to lose money over his ideology, however, and his immense wealth somewhat insulates him against even large shocks to his companies. When Tesla’s shares dropped on Thursday, it wiped about $34bn off his total net worth in a single day – yet he remained the world’s richest person by a gap of more than $90bn.The extensive reliance on Musk and the privatization of government services has always drawn criticism from ethics watchdogs and some aerospace and defense industry experts, but it appears especially risky now that Musk has threatened to hold certain services hostage. It has also served as a counterpoint to the project of slashing and privatizing the federal government that Musk spent his tenure with the Trump administration carrying out. Musk has furiously campaigned against bureaucracy, courts and regulators as impediments to getting things done, but these also exist as a bulwark against exactly the kind of unaccountable personal power and erratic whims that both he and Trump put on display during their clash.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpSpaceSpaceXUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

What’s your emergency?”“Hello, I would like to report the fact that I am having a very heavy period. Can you send a police officer over right away to collect my menstrual matter and check whether I’ve broken any laws?”The above is not a transcript of an actual conversation in West Virginia but, the way things are headed, it could be a glimpse of what’s to come. The Raleigh county prosecuting attorney Tom Truman recently warned that women who have a pregnancy loss in West Virginiacould face criminal charges. To protect themselves, Truman said, women should call local law enforcement and report a miscarriage – which is the loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. “Call your doctor. Call law enforcement, or 911, and just say: ‘I miscarried. I want you to know,’” Truman told theoutlet WVNS 59News.Truman said he was personally opposed to prosecuting women who miscarry. But he warned that other prosecutors inWest Virginiahad indicated that they would be willing to file criminal charges against women who had lost a pregnancy via state laws related to the disposal of human remains. “I thought these guys were just chewing on a Dreamsicle,”Truman lamented. But, he added, West Virginia’s laws include definitions that are “pretty broad-ranging” and give law enforcement a lot of discretion to go after women who have had a pregnancy loss.A dystopian surveillance fear has become reality in Texas | Arwa MahdawiRead moreTo be very clear about the law: while abortion is all but banned in West Virginia, the pregnant person themselves can’t be prosecuted for having an abortion. Miscarriages also aren’texplicitlycriminalized. However, law enforcement can get creative and use legislation that governs the handling of fetal remains to punish women. And this sort of “creativity” isn’t just confined to West Virginia: following the2022 overturningof Roe v Wade, a lot of women who experience pregnancy loss in the US have been plunged into legal limbo.While it would appear that Truman was trying to be helpful, I should note that calling the police isn’t necessarily the best idea in a scenario where you have experienced, or suspect you’ve experienced, a miscarriage. “It’s always a mistake to invite law enforcement into your reproductive life,” Kim Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School,told CNN. “I understand the idea that caution is better than being caught up in something that you weren’t anticipating, but it is difficult for me to imagine any circumstance in which I would think it was safe for someone who miscarried to call the police.”If you are going to call the police, you might want to quiz them on their understanding of the female reproductive system before going into any details. After all, how many of the men salivating over the prospect of locking up women for miscarriages do you think actually know what a miscarriage is? How many of them do you think understand that anestimated23m miscarriages occur every year globally and about10% to 20%of known pregnancies end in miscarriages? Again, that’sknownpregnancies: a lot of miscarriages happen before someone even realizes they’re pregnant. We don’t have the full picture of why pregnancy lossesoccur, but they are quite often due to chromosomal abnormalities. They are often, in other words, completely out of the woman’s control. And a very early miscarriage (also known as a chemical pregnancy) can be hard to distinguish from a period. Sometimes the only way to tell the difference is via medical interventions like a blood test or an ultrasound.All that said, this does strike me as a situation where a little malicious compliance wouldn’t go amiss. I’m not saying women inWest Virginiashould call up the prosecutor’s office whenever they’re menstruating and ask to speak to someone about the size and consistency of their blood clots or inquire whether they’d like to send a police officer to examine the toilet before they flush. Nor am I saying that women in West Virginia should drop off their used sanitary items at their local police station so they can be thoroughly examined by the powers that be. But I’m notnotsaying that either!Trump rescinds guidance protecting women in need of emergency abortionsThe Biden-era guidance hadmade it clearthat hospitals in states with abortion bans cannot turn away pregnant patients who are in the midst of medical emergencies.Catholic bishops sue Washington state over law requiring clergy to report child abuseThe Trump administration has alsolaunched an investigation into this law, which it terms “anti-Catholic”.Teenage TikTok star in Pakistan murdered by a man she reportedly rejected, authorities sayThe 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, who police say was shot by a man who broke into her home, is apparently already gettingblamed for her own murder.

The older I get, the less time I have for the sorts of activities stereotypical American males enjoy: sporting events, competitive binge drinking and collecting rare coins in a dark basement. OK, maybe that last thing isn’t nearly as common anymore, but what is common (if you believevarioustrend piecesin newspapers and magazines) is the increasing rarity of long-lasting male friendships. Most of my guy friends keep in touch with me through group chats or the occasional solo check-in text. I have, by my count, at least 10 group chats with different circles of friends. All of them are organized around a unifying theme – Star Trek, movie industry gossip, the Los Angeles Dodgers, hating that one guy who wore flip-flops to my wedding. My whole social life revolves around screens now. I watch a show or a baseball game and then immediately retreat into my other, smaller screen to discuss what I just witnessed with people I almost never see in real life. I will give myself credit for at least trying to be social in between working and taking my son to karate lessons, but it is, in fact, the bare minimum effort that I’m exerting. It’s almost like a welfare check, these text messages: “He responded, therefore he is not dead or in a Salvadorian supermax prison awaiting a trial that will never happen.”Maybe this is a superior way of maintaining relationships, though. By only seeing my friends on very rare occasions, I can’t get sick of their personality quirks, their peculiar habits or their need to wear flip-flops to black-tie events. Seriously, no one wants to see your toes at a wedding, man. Cut it out.Friendship might be a social concoction that is best served sparingly. A healthy distance from someone you like makes it more unlikely you’ll start absolutely hating the sheer sight of them. Sometimes, a good friend can smother you, stifle your own identity or lack boundaries. I don’t need to know every little thing about a date you’ve been on or your trip to the podiatrist. Give me the highlights and move on. We might be seeing some of this in the rapid dissolution of the friendship (if one could call giving someone a ton of money in exchange for a job blowing up the government a “friendship”) of Elon Musk and Donald Trump. It might have been too much of a good thing for those two old scamps. It was only a couple months ago that Trump and Elon werefawning over a Tesla on the White House lawnlike two car salesmen during a particularly rivetingToyotathon. Both of them looked so happy then – beaming with pride as they extolled the virtues of owning an electric car. As we know, Trump is anexpert salesman, so he was clearly having a great time. And Musk is very proficient at standing, as he has demonstrated time and time again. It all seemed so perfect, but as is the case with any relationship, the reality is often a lot more complicated.The Guardian view on the Trump-Musk feud: we can’t rely on outsized egos to end oligopoly | EditorialRead morePerhaps this is just another case of “boys will be boys”, but in this case, the boys in question are accusing each other of deranged behavior. Trump and Musk seemed outwardly to be as close as two incredibly rich, famously grumpy people can be. Musk campaigned for Trump in 2024, donated millions of his personal dollars to the Maga cause and took a position in the Trump administration during the first few months of the GOP victory lap. The arrangement allowed them to indulge in some of their favorite hobbies: flying in expensive planes, posting invectives on social media and firing people. It all looked quite cozy.The Dear John letter in this breakup came in the form of a series ofincreasingly unhinged postsfrom both men. Trump says Musk went “crazy” over the removal of electric vehicle subsidies in his budget bill.Musk tweeted the Epstein thing, claimed Trump would cause a recession later this year and accused him of lying about how the whole breakup went down. Trumpthreatened to killMusk’s government contracts. Steve Bannon, a Trump adviser that the presidentstill seems to like, for some reason,suggested Musk should be investigatedand possibly deported. A couples counselor would say these guys need to do less talking and a whole lot more listening.Some friendships aren’t meant to last. In this case, it’s pretty clear there was a bit of a “marriage of convenience” flavor to it all. Trump needed money. Musk … also needed money. An ideal partnership. The only thing that could get in the way of that is, of course, also money. The death of the EV subsidies is existentially terrifying for a man whose fortune rests in the stock value of his automobile company. Trump, ever eager to look fiscally responsible, went after a budget item that most of his supporters either don’t care about or actively hate. This really isn’t that different from when a friend promises to Venmo me for their share of a dinner tab and takes a week to do it (and has to be reminded multiple times, naturally via text). In the case of Trump and Musk, the Venmo tab is in the millions.I still think the Musk-Trump alliance could be salvaged, though the deportation threats and the pedophile island accusation probably aren’t helping. Unlike most of my friendships, Trump and Musk’s partnership is highly transactional. They have and will likely continue to need each other in some way. I need you to pay me back for dinner, but I don’tneedit. Some of my male friendships fall away just out of mutual lack of interest. We both made a choice, consciously or unconsciously, to give up on a relationship. Trump and Musk will always need each other in one form or another. Their shared grift of the American government is simply more powerful and effective when the two of them are working together as the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of corruption. They might just need a little break from each other. When they’re ready, maybe they could take it slow and try a group chat.Well.Maybe not.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is what it means to hate the shape of your own skinElsie ThwaitesThere are sudden moments of ecstatic joy, but it’s terrifying to realise what you want to be and everything you’ve forced downSat 7 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTShareYou’re fairly sure your skin has always been a problem. A problem before you even realised, lurking in the background of your earliest memories. Never with a clear mark for when yourealisedit was a problem. (When you realised what it means, to hate your skin so much.) But with signs scattered throughout your life.The very earliest sign was swimming. Or clothes in general, really, but swimming was the easy one. When you swam, you always wore (and always still wear) a shirt, even though the males of your family don’t. More broadly, you refuse to ever be seen without one. You called it modesty, but now you know it as shame. Shame for your square-ish, flat, slightly hairy flesh prison. Because, even then, you knewyourchest should be covered up, even though your skin is flush against your ribs and males don’t need to cover up.(The thought makes you sick – not the unfairness of who should cover what, but that you don’t actually have to care. Youwantthe extra part of the dress code, the additional rule when swimming.) So despite the fact that you didn’t have to, you covered up. Refused to take off your shirt, anywhere, for any reason. Convinced that you were just being dumb.You were afloat, and now you’re drowning, and you don’t know if you’ll ever surface againAnd even if it was discomforting, it was so easy to write it off. So easy to shy away from the teasing about your modesty, so easy to pretend you were just a little odd and there was nothing else to it. Because as long as you’re just a bit odd, nothing could go wrong. Just push it down, just don’t think about it, just ignore the wrongness of your skin and the strangeness of your bones. Masking yourself as you masked your body, because you were safe if you didn’t think about it. If you ignoredwhyyou needed to cover up, you could pretend you were fine and normal and yourself.A sweet little lie.The most obvious sign, a little later than the swimming, was video games, and your refusal to play as a male. “Girls look better!” you might have said. But that wouldn’t explain the first-person games, the ones where you spent hours dressing up a character so unlike you, even though you would only ever see the results in menu screens. Even back then, playing games, having fun, there was a crushing sensation. A vague, growing envy. That even little digital pictures wore their skins better than you.That feeling – the crush, the envy, even a little hurt. It’s never left you. You find it in the mirror, in your head when you look down at yourself, in the back of your mind when you’re reading. It’s a second skin, a layer of disgust. You clench your hands and it’s there. You scrub yourself in the shower and it’s there. Rest your hands on your thighs and it’s there. You’re terrified that no matter what you do, the crush will never leave. That you willalwaysbe what you are, instead of what you want to be.The first time you showed off a bit – wore a sports bra, showed some skin – there was so much joy that it scared you. Because the one truth of you is that your skin disgusts you. But put a strip of fabric over your chest and suddenly your skin made you ecstatic.And from that moment, from seeing yourself in the mirror like that, you know something has changed. You realise that there’s a word for you, as your eyes trace the shape of the skin you suddenly want to keep seeing. A word that encapsulates so much but also so little, and you’re terrified of it. (You still are, if you’re being honest.) It settles over the crush and the envy and the hurt and, suddenly, there’s so much more of you than there was only a few days before. A cut in that second skin of disgust, showing something promising beneath.And then the crush comes, and you put a bandaid over that cut. The joy of your skin deserts you, and the disgust returns, because you know exactly what’s wrong when you look in the mirror now, and there’s no amount of pretending that can fix it. You stay up late with your best friend, and they help you find a name, and it is the warmest feeling in the world, and your skin constricts around you. Because names don’t fix the fact thatyou aren’t you. That your skin isn’t yours, and seeing your own face is like the sound of cracking glass turned into a feeling, and you begin to fear that you willneverbe fixed.Because you have lived in ignorant bliss for so long – simply calling yourself weird, simply swallowing it all down. There was peace in your lack of self, in not realisingwhyyou’ve slowly, unnoticeably grown addicted to skirts and long hair and bare strips of skin. Because as long as you didn’t think about it, it couldn’t quite hurt you. As long as you were strange little (not-)you, you were safe and you were normal and you were completely fine.And now you’re not.You’re not fine.And you haven’t been for a long, long time.Your safety, your peace, has been torn down so slowly you didn’t even notice, and now everything hidden behind it has come rushing out. Everything youwerehas been torn out and you don’t know how to rebuild yourself. You’ve lost every building block, and all that’s left is the hurt that you’ve spent your life crushing out. The hurt when you touch your face, when you see your hands, when you sit down with your thighs together.You’re terrified of what you want to be. Terrified because you finally realise it, finally see the shape of everything you’ve been forcing down.Terrified, because now you know what you are, and that knowledge is like an anchor with a too-short chain. Fine when you kept it up, but now you’ve let it drop, and it’s tugging you down with it. You were afloat, and now you’re drowning, and you don’t know if you’ll ever surface again.In Australia, support is available atheadspace.Other international helplines can be found atbefrienders.orgElsie Thwaites is a student and hobbyist writerExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionTransgenderMental healthHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Now the government must harness that to bring about real changeSat 7 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 06.41 EDTShareThe toppling of the statue of the British enslaver Edward Colston, five years ago today, felt like a historic moment. Bringing down this one statue and symbolically hurling it into Bristol harbour, protesters – predominantly white – drew international attention to the barbarity of African enslavement, its generated wealth that turbocharged the UK’s global power and the legacy of slavery, whose long historical tail had led to the murder of George Floyd less than two weeks before.Five years on, however, it seems fanciful that out of those protests a global reset on race could occur. Back then, structural race inequities were also laid bare by the Covid-19 virus. We watched our TV screens with dread as the kaleidoscope of Black and Asian doctors, nurses and other health workers were dying disproportionately. Those same minoritised communities were also more likely to be in precarious jobs, forced to travel to work as cleaners, care workers and security guards, and were thereby more exposed to the deadly disease.These two seismic occurrences sparked a discussion the likes of which we had never seen in the UK. Corporations held multiple staff meetings over what their response to the Black Lives Matter protests should be. I, along with other race equality activists, was often invited.The discussions would usually begin with the chief executive or a director leading the conversation, proclaiming their commitment to race equality with the usual caveat: “But we must do better.” Then would come the uncomfortable truth, from their own Black staff, who for the first time felt emboldened to speak truth to power.“I’ve been in your company for 20 years. I’ve lost count of how many white women I’ve brought in, trained up, only for them to be promoted and often become my line manager.”“Normally we don’t dare speak out. Managers quickly spread the word that Black people are trouble and are always complaining.”I witnessed one woman tell her boss: “I don’t care if you sack me. I’ve had enough. This charade, you being down with Black Lives Matter, is a bit like you showing up for 10 minutes to our Black History Month in-house event. It changes nothing.”These were difficult and chastening conversations, but with the prolonged Black Lives Matter protests they did bring about action that we hoped might create generational change. For example, company boards began to look at their desperate lack of Black members. Institutions appointed some Black men and women to top roles. And perhaps one of the most noticeable changes was the way that advertisers, along with TV and film producers, placed Black characters in “everyday” roles, away from the usual villainous or holier-than-thou stereotypes. It could be argued that this cultural normalisation of Black and Asian faces on our TV screens may yet play a significant part in bringing communities closer together.Educationally too, there was the beginning of what we thought would be institutional shifts. My own university, Cambridge, under the stewardship of the vice-chancellor Stephen Toope, had already begun itsfirst serious investigationinto its own slavery roots in 2019. After the toppling of Colston, many other universities, such as University College London, Newcastle, Nottingham and Nottingham Trent, opened up their archives. Others looked to broaden their curriculums, bringing in developing-world perspectives.Yet despite so much optimism, the national momentum began to slow down, came to a halt and, in many quarters, is now in reverse. The most significant blocker to change came from Boris Johnson’s government, which in the face of the Black Lives Matter protests was forced to set up a race inquiry. Led by Tony Sewell, this report into systemic racism in the UK is widely seen as one of the mostflawed race reports ever written. Despite all the evidence, Sewell questioned the level of systemic racism in the UK and also claimed there was a positivestory to tell about the enslavement of Africans“not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves”. Sewell was given a peerage by Johnson in 2022.Other factors that stalled the momentum included the rightwing attack on England football playerstaking the kneein support of Black Lives Matter. Then came theattacks on critical race theory, which examines the structural and systemic aspects to racial inequality. Fast forward to 2024 and the climate had gone from tackling race inequality to race hatred riots that sought to firebomb Muslims and refugees. The unprecedented scenes, whipped up by lies around the Southport killer but fuelled by years of Islamophobic and anti-migrant newspaper headlines, harked back to the Ku Klux Klan lynch mobs. And this year we have a US president who demands that businesses and all public institutions abandon their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes. Many of those institutions, in the UK and the US, which had been seen as allies for the Black Lives Matter movement, didn’t take much persuasion to fall into line and abandon their commitments.Five years on from that momentous day in Bristol, many of the hopes of generational and systemic change have evaporated. However, we can be somewhat hopeful that, while on the surface many companies have capitulated, some are covertly continuing with their DEI trajectory. Others, such as the Co-op, where I am a director, wear their DEI credentials as a badge of honour.I think the greatest hope will come from the tens of thousands of people, Black and white, young and old, who demanded change during the longest race equality protest ever seen. They have neither gone away nor lost their ideals. The challenge, then, for this government and others, is to reconnect and empower them to demand that historical change they still want to see.Simon Woolley is co-founder of Operation Black Vote and head of Homerton College, CambridgeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This isself-delusion, not self-improvementSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 06.13 EDTShareAbout two years ago, a self-professed “goddess coach” called Jaelyn posted an eight hour-long “sleep affirmation” video which, according to many a satisfied viewer, has worked wonders for them. In a somewhat sultry, meditative voice she repeats mantras and welcomes her listeners to attract “the kind of men and people who will always treat you like a goddess”.Thevideo, boldly titled Attract Men Who Spend Money, Provide and Love You! is one of many in a genre of content that is booming on YouTube and social media. I call them “guru girlies”, and they are proving a force to be reckoned with. In their rather austere imparting of wisdom, guru girlies have become many young women’s go-to guide for all manner of modern conundrums.The spectrum of gurus is vast, but their advice is mainly focused on the idea of “levelling up”. From yourdiettodressing betterto your choice infriendsormen, if you want to live your dream life, self-improvement is the prerequisite; the comprehensive physical, financial and spiritualsine qua nonthat any woman needs to become her best and dream self.When it comes to the physical, gurus give detailed insight on how toglow upandrebrandyour life, often using themselves as examples of how, given the right mindset and Pinterest boards, they were able to lose weight, reduce acne, stay on trend and become a modern standard of beauty that social media sits before in awe.View image in fullscreenWhy Haven’t You Manifested Your Dream Life?, a video by @JillzGuerinPhotograph: @JillzGuerin/YouTubeSpiritually, guru girlies are invariably enamoured withmanifestation techniques,subliminal messagingand the universe’s seeming interest in giving us every abundance if only we’d ask it to. If you are feeling unfulfilled, it’s time to access your divine feminine energy.One gurudescribes this energy as “self-prioritisation”, performing ritualistic (and often costly) tasks of feminine self-care such as gratitude journaling, healthy eating and skincare routines, all in a bid to get back from the world what you put into it. How conveniently straightforward this all seems, and yet how odd that these young guru girlies are lauded as bringers of divine secrets in all matters feminine.Financially, gurus typically see men as a means to a life of wealth and abundance. Creators such as Leticia Padua, known by her devoted following asSheraSeven,claimsthat because all men cheat (“it’s just a matter of time”), it’s important for women to find the cheater with the most money. This financial levelling up – a mindset that involves distinguishing between high-value, provider men and what Shera calls “dusties” – has proved highly popular.And that’s because at the root of all this content is a brewing disappointment that many a young woman, scrolling through her social media and navigating a rapidly changing modern world, is bound to feel. A disappointment with modern love and prospects, with our unfiltered face and appearance, and with the fact that real life isn’t nearly as ideal as it is online. Guru girlies are there to bridge the gap between your disappointing reality and the ideal they purport to embody, right before you onscreen.This is done by submitting to the system, not as an act of defeat but as empowerment. Arguably the most well-known guru,Thewizardliz(known as Liz) is a case in point. “Start expecting good treatment, start expecting to be spoiled, start expecting him to give you money,” she instructs ina video. “Princess treatment” isn’t so much seen as infantilising or disempowering as it is heralded by many guru girlies as a righteous investment in becoming your highest, most feminine self, courtesy of a provider man. However just last week, a four-months pregnant Liz accused her “provider” husband, YouTuber and software CEO Landon Nickerson of messaging another woman.View image in fullscreenHow To Deal With Toxic People, a video by @TamKaurPhotograph: @TamKaur/YouTubeIn all of this, there is no doubt an addictive nature to self-improvement that explains why a new guru,delivering the same old message, seems to blow up every other week. In an age where ever-changing trends dictate our dreams and ideals, where there is always some undiscovered aspect of ourselves to improve on, we are conveniently primed to keep going back to these gurus in a vain attempt to change who we fundamentally are. “The internet is making us feel like there is always something we could be improving, and there’s a sense that we feel no choice but to try and keep up sometimes,” says former guru follower Just a Girl in Paris ina video critique.What’s fortunate for these gurus is that, becausethe onus of failing to self-improve isalways placed on you, your misery and dissatisfaction perfectly places you to keep returning to her either for advice or, increasingly it would seem, for comfort. Because the truth is, much of what makes these guru girlies convincing isn’t the success rate of their advice, it is the parasocial relationship they bring to the already toxic world of self-improvement and wellness culture.Audiences see their favourite influencer less as a guru than as a kind of ideal friend: the pretty, rich, self-confident and inaccessible woman who, in real life, would never actually be our friend. Many gurus have fostered a false intimacy with their audience that has become a given. “She’s literally like every girl’s older sister,” saysoneof Thewizardliz’s followers. “Sometimes I forget she is a famous influencer and not my best friend who gives me advice on FaceTime,” reads another of the countless adoringcomments.Viewers find comfort and ease in a superficial albeit meaningful relationship that isn’t rooted in the messy ups and downs of a real friendship. Their guru friend tells them everything they want to hear about creating their dream life, which only requires intangibles such as affirmations, cutting off disappointing people or a mindset shift. So even if taking all these steps proves to be joyless and wanting, at least your guru, ready with her next upload, will be there to be your ideal friend, all over again.Zandile Powell is a video essayist and writer.

In most countries in the world, children could hope to live, on average, longer, healthier lives than their parents. This expectation is still true of the mega-wealthy. In fact,tech billionairesand multimillionaires have recently beenfixated on findingthe secret to longer life, convinced that with enough money, technology and cutting-edge science, they can stave off the inevitable for a few more decades to reach 120 or even 150 years old.But their efforts aren’t trickling down to the rest of us. The world’s health crises are getting worse, with life expectancygoing backwardsin several high-income countries, such as the UK and US. In Britain, stagnation started before the Covid pandemic and has decreased by six months, and in the US by 2.33 years.Obesity rates are rising – not just in wealthy countries, but also in places like Ghana, which has experienced a650% increase in obesitysince 1980. Not 65%; 650%. Clean air is a rarity in most places in the world. Mental health conditions like depression areon the rise, worsened by financial precarity and stress.We’ve been told for decades that if we just optimise ourselves, we can live longer, healthier lives. So how can we explain the gap between our growing knowledge about living longer and our collective health going backwards? Personally, I’ve set myself a suitably ambitious goal: to live to 100 with good health and to help others to do the same. According to theONS life expectancy calculator, I have a 9.3% chance of making it that long (although even more challenging is to have a quality life during this time).As someone who has a strong interest in and passion for health, I follow the latest research on superfoods and what to eat. I’ve tried sugar-free diets; I went vegan for a period. I’ve tried all kinds of different exercise regimes from running long distances to intervals to HIIT (high intensity interval training) toHyrox, outdoor bootcamps, spin, hot pilates, barre and paddleboard yoga. In my mid-30s, I decided to become a personal trainer to combine my interest in fitness, nutrition and wellbeing.However, every time my mind goes down the “optimisation” route, I’m reminded of my main job and lifelong career as a public health scientist, looking into the factors that affect how long we will live. Most of these are out of individual control and have to do with the country and community we live in. The truth is, this “self-help” narrative doesn’t reflect the reality of how health works. In fact, the focus on personal responsibility and self-improvement has distracted us from the real issue –the impact that public policy, infrastructure and community make in affecting our health chances and longevity.Environment more crucial than genes in risk of early death, study suggestsRead moreIn public health, research projects have studied places where people live significantly longer, healthier lives – think of Japan or South Korea, or within Europe, Zurich, Madrid or Sardinia. In these places, chronic diseases like heart disease and obesity are far less common.Take Japan, which has 80% less breast and prostate cancer than North Americans and half the risk of hip fractures.Much work has gone into analysing the behaviours of people living within these cities and regions. Based on this, we get lists of changes we could be making at an individual level to live longer, such as moving to a largely plant-based diet, sleeping seven to nine hours a night and exposing yourself to a certain amount of sunlight each day. These are of course helpful, but I suspect that hardly anyone in the areas above has read a self-help book or has a daily health “to do” list.What stands out about these places is that the people living there don’t just make individual choices that lead to better health – they live in places where healthy lives are normalised by government and culture.Take the issue of obesity: the UK isn’t fatter than Japan because it is a country filled with fundamentally different people who choose to be overweight or are lazy or stupid – that kind of logic is not only naive, but it stigmatises overweight people. In fact it seems like at the level of choice, the UK is more interested in dieting, with a diet industryestimatedto be worth £2bn annually and diet books selling millions of copies each year. In contrast, Japan’s diet industry is tiny,worth only $42.8m. The main difference is actually in the food environment – including affordable fruit and vegetables, nutritious school meals and support from the government – meaning that it’s far easier for an individual to stay within a healthy weight living in Japan. The odds are stacked against you in Britain.You can become the healthy “outlier” or bubble yourself off from larger societal challenges if you have wealth, time and resources. You can carry an air purifier, drink a matcha latte, swim in expensive leisure centres, even hire a chef to bake you fresh bread and prepare nutritious meals. There’s a reason that being a royal or marrying into royalty is one of the surest ways to live a long and healthy life. But for those of us who are commoners, there’s no fully opting out of the societal factors completely: we have to go outside to breathe air, walk and cycle the streets, drink tapwater and eat the foods available near where we live or at school.Life expectancy growth stalls across Europe as England sees sharpest decline, say researchersRead moreAs I talk about in my new book, if I’m going to live to 100, I need more than fastidiously counting my calories and posting pictures of myself exercising on Instagram (which I am guilty of). I need to live in a world where health is a collective responsibility, not an individual one. This means supporting policies that make us all healthier – and politicians who prioritise the conditions for good health such as nutritious food especially for children, active cities, clean air policies, preventive healthcare and public provision of water, which should be at the core of what a government provides its citizens. There are lessons in how to improve life in all of these areas across the world: these are places where good health is built into daily life.If we think of Ponce de León’squest for immortalityin the 16thcentury – at a time when life expectancy in his native Spain was just 25 to 30 years, perhaps the lesson is that the answer for longer, healthier lives wasn’t in a fountain of youth but in the rise of stable government, public services, science and community.

When I arrive,Little Simzis out on the balcony. Wearing chunky sunglasses, a skirt and comfy cardigan, she sits on a chair with her back to the sun, eyes on the horizon, and pulls her legs up, wrapping her arms around her knees in a defensive position that’s verging on foetal.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s curious body language for an artist at the top of her game. At 31, Simz is looking out at a city she can justifiably claim to have conquered since emerging as a teenage rapper more than a decade ago. But that’s not where she’s at right now. “I genuinely felt like I could disappoint everyone,” Simz says when I ask about the making of her sixth album, Lotus. She gives an impression of what she said to her team at the start of the process. “Sorry, everyone, this could be a big waste of your time, and if it is, I’m truly sorry, but I’m just not confident right now.”The crisis felt terminal, Simz tells me.It sprang from creative fatigue: six albums in a decade and relentless touring tends to do that to solo artists. That spark she naturally had in the studio just wasn’t there this time, perhaps exacerbated by a very public schism with her friend, collaborator and producer Inflo. They are now embroiled in amessy legal battleover an alleged £1.7m in unpaid loans. She’s explained the album title as a reference to “one of the only flowers that thrive in muddy waters”, but the seas she’s been swimming in appear shark infested rather than just murky.She was close to calling it quits. At one point Simz sat down with Lotus producer Miles Clinton James to lay her cards on the table. “I was just real with him. I said, ‘Look, whatever you think this Little Simz shit is … I can’t guarantee that’s possible because I’m not even feeling it myself.’“I just was a bit lost, to be honest,” Simz says.The first time I saw Simz perform was 11 years ago in a dark basement club in east London. She was still a teenager, making her live debut as a support act for the Atlanta rapper Future – tall, skinny and absolutely not fazed by a crowd made up of industry types as well as hardcore rap fans. Contemporary hip-hop can sometimes seem like a game of style over substance – more about the number of followers, the degree of posturing and the right connections than actual ability on the mic. Simz is an antidote to those excesses. Watching her at Glastonbury last year, she appeared with a backing band and little else, dropping into a cappella moments where her voice and lyrical ability were the only tools she needed. But even then, in that little basement back in 2014, she looked born to do it.Since that debut she has risen to become arguably the most exciting British musician of the last decade. There have been awards: aMercury prize, anIvor Novello, aBritand a handful ofMobos. All of her albums have been critically praised, but the last three have cemented her as a mainstream success and darling of the critics. This year she’scurating Meltdown, following in the footsteps of Grace Jones, David Bowie and Chaka Khan, and bringing herself, plus The Streets and Tiwa Savage, to London’sSouthbank Centre. She’s also shooting two films, both still under wraps. And there have been viral online moments, too: aChicken Shop datewith Amelia Dimoldenberg where she talked about her love of Bell Hooks and Muay Thai kickboxing; and a few weeks back shefreestyled with Usherafter one of his sold-out O2 shows.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Jacket:Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood. Knit, shirt and skirt:Miu Miu. Ring:Bunney.Socks:Palace SkateboardsWhat does she think young Simz would make of the artist she’s become today? “I think she’d just be proud,” she says, looking out over the London skyline. “Like, wow, you actually did it. You actually did what you set out to do.”Did she have an established list of goals? “Definitely playing the O2,” she says after a moment’s thought. “Even though that’s not happened yet, it’shappening.” Simz is set to play the venue in October, as part of a UK arena tour in support of Lotus. “Even that is a crazy thing to wrap my head around,” she says. “Or even just, like, going to the States and performing in New York, or curating Meltdown. I don’t even think I knew what Meltdown was back then.”Born Simbiatu Ajikawo in 1994, Little Simz was raised in north London by her Nigerian mother Tola and three older siblings. Her father broke up with her mum and left the family home, which soon buzzed with activity thanks to a steady stream of foster children. “I met so many different kids from all different walks of life who just became part of my family and who my mum nurtured and took care of,” Simz says. “It was really beautiful. I gained newfound respect and appreciation for my family, knowing that it’s not given that everyone has loving support … I never went a day without love.”When Simz won a Brit for best new artist in 2022, she brought her mum out on stage. “It just really felt like she won best album that night and I just went up there to support her,” says Simz, who seems genuinely in awe of her mother. “I thought, wow, you came to this country not knowing anyone, not knowing a word of English, and now your last born has just won a Brit … it’s kind of crazy.”View image in fullscreenLittle Simz with her mother at the Brits, 2022.Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images for Brit Awards LimitedGrowing up in north London, Simz experimented with various artistic disciplines. She danced (the hyperactive early 00s style known as krumping was a favourite); acted (starring in CBBC shows Youngers and Spirit Warriors); and rapped, appearing on stage at the O2 Academy aged 11, reciting her own work as part of a youth club also attended by Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke. The competing creative avenues were all maintained until she hit her mid-teens and a clear winner emerged.“When I was maybe, like, 14 is when music became my world. I was just so immersed in it. This is me. This is what I want to be when I get older,” Simz says. The artists she most looked up to were Missy Elliott and Ms Dynamite. “Watching early Missy videos … the beats were hard, so I always wanted to dance to them and make routines for them.” But what really impressed Simz was her artistry and uncompromising approach. Told by executives she wasn’t thin enough, Elliott shot videos with Hype Williams in billowing black costumes that made a feature of her body type rather than diminishing it.Simz has spoken before about industry figures encouraging her to wear sexualised outfits – something anathema to an artist whose lyrical ability is their superpower. “I don’t want to compromise on that, because at that point I’d stop being myself,” she says. “But maybe something that I wasn’t open to wearing when I was 18, I would now as a grown woman … It just has to feel right.”Like her other hero, Ms Dynamite, Simz addressed the absence of her father in her lyrics. While Dynamite didn’t pull her punches (“I spent 23 years trying to be the fucking man you should be / Taking care of your responsibility / Putting clothes on our back and shoes on our feet, no help” is how she addressed it on her song Father), Simz is more reflective, generous even, in her assessment of her dad, who she still has no contact with.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a new chapter in my life.’ Photograph: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Jacket, shirt and shorts:Burberry. Jewellery: Little Simz’s ownShe’s written about him before on I Love You, I Hate You, a standout moment from her Mercury prize-winning album from 2022, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. Did his absence complicate her happy memories of childhood? “It doesn’t affect the memories I have growing up. It just wasn’t meant to be between them … but I think there’s still a lot of love there, and I’m sure my dad respects mymum having raised his children, you know? Now that I’m older, I definitely just understand that parents are flawed as well, and I get it. I’ve tried to not hold on to the anger, maybe that I once felt, or like this deep resentment … I’m just trying to let it go.” Was that hard to do? “Definitely, 100%,” Simz says. “Especially when you just internalise a lot of it. Like, did you not love me? Like, did you not …” There’s a pause. “I don’t think it’s any of that. I just think it is what it is, to be honest. But I’ve forgiven him.”That grace isn’t something Simz extends to everyone. One issue that definitely isn’t resolved is her relationship with Inflo, real name Dean Josiah Cover, the producer she’s known since childhood and to whom she paid gushing tribute from the Mercury stage. (“I wanna say a thank you to my brother and close collaborator Inflo – Flo [has] known me since I was so young, he’s stuck by me, we created this album together. There were times in the studio I didn’t know if I was gonna finish this record, I was going through all the emotions … he stuck by me.”) The pair met at Mary’s Youth Club in north London and forged one of the most successful and close producer-artist relationships the UK has seen in the last decade. They didn’t just work on Little Simz records, they were also part of Sault – the mysterious collective that also includes Inflo’s wife Cleo Sol and Michael Kiwanuka. They didn’t play live. Albums were dropped without warning or promotion. They oscillated between R&B, neo-soul and funk, all underpinned by Inflo’s production, earning the group aMercury nominationin 2021. But it’s fair to say that a lot has changed in the last three years. Lotus feels like a breakup record of a sort, not romantic but still deeply personal, as the Simz/Inflo partnership is pulled apart and dissected.In late 2023, Sault put on agig at the Drumsheds. It’s a huge venue in north-east London that used to be anold Ikea store, which they filled with string sections, choristers and teams of dancers. Tickets were priced at £99 a pop, and sold out rapidly. One punter said it was like a mix of Kendrick Lamar’s performance at Glastonbury, a Punchdrunk immersive theatre production, the London 2012 opening ceremony and Talking Heads’ classic concert film Stop Making Sense, “and it was also like nothing you’ve ever seen”. The whole thing cost around £1m, which Simz claims she mostly bankrolled, lending the money to Inflo. Simz’s legal team says she also made significant payments to her former producer to cover recording costs. Inflo’s legal team disputes the details of the claims but he is yet to comment publicly; the case is ongoing.“Clarity” and “directness” are the two words Simz uses to sum up her mindset going into the recording process for Lotus. From the opening track Thief, it’s clear what she’s focusing on. There are barbs (“You talk about god when you have a god complex, when I think you’re the one who needs saving … ”), score settling (“We went for 100 down to nought, and yes it is all your fault … your name wasn’t popping until I worked with you”) and accusations (“This person I’ve known my whole life, coming like the devil in disguise. My jaw was on the floor, my eyes have never been so wide … ”). It’s all delivered with a snarl and a driving bassline that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Nick Cave murder ballad. Her track Lonely features the lines, “Team falling apart and I’m caught in the crossfire / You selling me lies and saying I must buy”; while on Hollow she raps, “You want the best for me allegedly / But all you got is evil eye and jealousy … You was moving like one leech.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Although Inflo isn’t mentioned by name, it doesn’t take a forensic investigator to figure out who the chorus “Selling lies, selling dreams … Thief!” might be aimed at, while “I feel sorry for your wife” appears to be a reference to Inflo’s partner, Cleo Sol. These areFleetwood Mac levels of animosity.Surely there must be huge anxiety before airing all these things in public? “I really just put my life out there and my diary essentially,” she says, sounding like rap’s answer to Rachel Cusk.View image in fullscreen‘Playing the 02 is a crazy thing to wrap my head around.’ Photographs throughout: Rosaline Shahnavaz/The Guardian. Styling: Keeley Dawson. Hair: Chantelle Fuller. Makeup: Nibras using Fenty Beauty. Set design: Elena Horn“I just wanted to be true to the emotion, what I was feeling, and document it, and not shy away from how I feel about stuff, because I don’t want things to eat me up and fester.” She emphasises that the desire for openness is about her mental health. “Because I do think they eat you from the inside out. So for me to not let that happen, I needed to talk about it in so many different ways … from a place of pure hurt and anger and frustration, to a place of sadness.”Simz hasspoken beforeabout her experiences with therapy, in order to cope with seeing friends go to prison, and after the2018 murderof the model Harry Uzoka – anotherchildhood friend, who was stabbed in west London. Simz stayed off social media in the hours after the news broke, instead choosing to go into the studio and write Wounds, an anti-knife crime track on her album Grey Area. Now it seems the place she’s working out her feelings is the recording studio. And she’s under no illusions that there’s a road back to working with Inflo or as part of Sault, who are still releasing new music (though the collective’s Michael Kiwanuka features on the title track, Lotus). “I’m really proud of myself that I was able to do that,” she says. “There’s a legacy built; amazing music was made and I will always love those songs. I’m super proud of that work, but it’s just a new time and a new chapter in my life.”Can she still listen to the music she made with Inflo as a solo artist and in Sault? “If you have a kid with someone and it doesn’t work out, you don’t just stop loving the kid,” she says after a few moments. “You can appreciate you’ve made something beautiful with someone and now grow in your separate ways.”Three things kept Simz grounded during the tumult of the last 18 months: family, God (she’s credited the big man with helping her get the album finished) and her partner, the model Chuck Junior Achike. You rarely hear Simz speak about her relationship: is that intentional? “I don’t think I get asked that much,” she laughs. “I do quite enjoy having that bit of privacy, but my partner’s not a secret.”Then there’s her favouite way to relax: Lego. “I haven’t done it in a while, but at one point I was banging them out in a day … just ordering bare Lego, getting a bit crazy with it.” How crazy? Did you recreate Middle-earth in your living room? “I had one similar to this landscape,” she says looking out toward the Shard and the city skyline. “I think it was, like, the London Eye, and I set up some nice bonsai trees, flowers and a jazz band.” What’s the appeal? “It just makes me feel like a kid,” Simz says. “I’m not really thinking when I do it … it just feels really peaceful. I just feel really calm.”Little Simz at Glastonbury review – triumphant coronation of a true UK rap greatRead moreCooking for loved ones (she makes a mean plate of jollof rice) and entertaining is another key part of the Simz downtime calendar, as well as taking photographs. “Photography is something I’ve loved for many, many years,” Simz says, beaming. “I like just going out and shooting stuff.” Like what? “Landscape stuff, or people, whatever. If I’m out in the middle of nowhere, I’ll just shoot some sheep.”“Sheep?”“Yeah,” she says. “They need to be represented, too!”We’ve swapped seats; she’s now looking out over the capital, sunglasses on to protect against the glare. Amid the jokes there’s a hard-won steeliness to Simz. Was it always there?Coming into the industry as a teenager, Simz says, she was “super trusting, very open, very vulnerable” and genuinely believed that people worked in the industry because they just love music. “That was my attitude towards things,” she says, laughing. “People are just trying to make good art, because music’s really gonna heal the world. Then obviously you get rude awakenings.”Lanre Bakare is the author ofWe Were There: How Black culture, resistance and community shaped modern Britain, published by VintageLittle Simz’s new album, Lotus, is out now and she is curating Meltdown, 12-22 June, at Southbank Centre, London.Explore more on these topicsLittle SimzRapinterviewsShareReuse this content"

She talks about her love of karaoke, working on a full-length opera and how to deal with fame at a young ageSat 7 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTShareViewers may find Rachel Jones’s paintings “beautiful”, but they should be warned: the artist herself doesn’t love that word.“In our culture, the idea of beauty sadly isn’t discussed in a critical, rich way – it’s much more reductive as a term,” says the 34 year old. “I hope that when people describe the work as beautiful, it doesn’t just stop there.” Her aim, she says, is to pull viewers in deeper, beyond the surface of the work.Despite her youth, Jones is already preparing to open a major retrospective. Her forthcoming show at Dulwich Picture Gallery will see her large-scale, gloriously colourful abstractions hung alongside works from the museum’s collection. It will be Jones’s first institutional solo show in the UK, and also the museum’s first solo show of a contemporary artist in its main exhibition space.“The opportunity I have to look at everything as a whole is incredible,” she says. “It’s not often that you get to do that at such an early stage in your career. It’s a real gift and privilege to look back at what I’ve done in the last six years or so.” After graduating from the Royal Academy Schools in 2019, Jones was picked up by Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, had a work acquired by the Tate, and was part of solo or group exhibitions at Chisenhale Gallery, the Hayward Gallery and the Hepworth Wakefield, as well as galleries and institutions around North America, Europe and Asia.In the past couple of years, though, she has slowed down. She is no longer represented by a gallery and has broadened her practice to include sound and performance as well as painting. “It’s good to learn those different ways of making and how they influence each other,” she says, telling me that sound practice has become more embedded in her day-to-day thinking. Her first big sound work, a short opera called Hey Maudie, was performed at St James’s Piccadilly in 2023. She is now working on expanding it into a full-length opera. “I also want to pour more energy into my karaoke performances,” she says, smiling. “In my personal life, I love to sing karaoke whenever I can, but it’s something I haven’t been able to explore as much as I would like to in my work.”Jones’s cosy studio in Ilford, east London, is stuffed with the accumulation of six years’ work. “Each series of paintings moves forward,” she says, “but it’s happening more drastically in the last year in ways that are quite surprising to me, but really exciting.” She frames such rapid change around learning: she is using colours she is less confident with to give herself a challenge, and pushing herself to be more comfortable using negative space in her paintings, where the canvas is left visible.View image in fullscreenWork by Rachel Jones for her show Gated Canyons at Dulwich Picture Gallery.Photograph: courtesy the artistShe works on raw linen now, rather than cotton canvas, giving her works an earthier, organic texture and tone. “Even if I don’t fully understand what I’m doing, I know to trust my impulses,” she says. “I can wrestle with the process more.” There is a sense of peeling back and then building from the ground up in Jones’s attitude, and in the work itself.When young artists receive the kind of immediate acclaim and scrutiny that Jones did after art school, it can be hard to find the space to reflect. Jones has worked hard to cultivate that space, and her experience of quick fame has trained her to articulate her practice carefully. “There’s a huge desire for artists to embed their work in a narrative,” she says. “I don’t think that’s as useful as people think it is.” As she tells me about the evolutions and experimentations in her latest work, for the Dulwich show and for a site-specific commission at the Courtauld Gallery opening in September, she talks almost entirely about formal elements, rather than storytelling: new ways she uses her medium of oil pastels or new intentions behind her mark-making, not her personal narrative.Rachel Jones: say cheeeeese review – mutating paintings put a grin on your faceRead moreBut there is also a bit of figuration in Jones’s largely abstract practice. From the beginning of her career, she has worked with the motif of the mouth. Her earlier works, such as lick your teeth, they so clutch (2021), now in Tate’s collection, are bright colour fields that use the outlines of teeth to frame form and colour. In the new work, the mouth has become a more defining form. “There is a little bit more vulnerability in the way that I’m using the mouth as a symbol now,” Jones says. Using cartoons as her main visual references, Jones sees the mouths in her latest work as open, maybe yelling or laughing or screaming or crying. “Those are quite extreme emotions,” she says, explaining the way mouths doing those things are usually attached to a body that is dysregulated or overwhelmed.Jones is so adept at describing her process and intention as an artist, but leaves the meaning of her work more open-ended. Each viewer will have their own response to the work: “My way is just one way,” she says. “So many people are intimidated by visual art. I want people to feel like the works invite them to speak.”Rachel Jones: Gated Canyons will be atDulwich Picture Gallery, London, 10 June to 19 October; her commission for theCourtauld Gallery, London, opens on 25 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designPaintinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

It just feels like terrestrial TVRebecca NicholsonSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn 1964, Andy Warhol shot the Empire State Building then turned it into an art film calledEmpire, which is more than eight hours long. I was reminded of this last Christmas when I let my nine-year-old niece choose what to watch on TV. She went straight to the YouTube app and pressed play on a video comparing US and UK chocolate bars. It went into such a tremendous amount of detail that I was mesmerised, not by the content but by how brazenly boring it was. It went on for what felt like hours. It might still be going on now.I wonder if this is what television natives get wrong about YouTube. In all the discussions about disappearing attention spans and “second screen” viewing – ie scrolling on your phone while leaving a single brain cell free to drool at whatever product placementEmily in Parishas just dropped into the “plot” – there is an assumption that online content has to be short and snappy. That might be more true of TikTok or Reels, but YouTube is a place that chews up time then swallows it. Do I know this because I have watched lengthy self-produced documentaries about complete strangers’ walking holidays? Look, in the 60s, it would have been art.View image in fullscreenFamily drama … Pinnock and Lee in Beth.Photograph: Channel 4This is what Beth, Channel 4’s “digital original drama”, is trying to contend with. TV has long been worried about the internet coming for its audience, and it’s true that you are about as likely to get a young person watching live terrestrial TV as you are to get them to pick up the phone and have a conversation with you. How can old-fashioned television begin to compete? Should it even bother trying? Channel 4 is giving it a go. It has already made Hollyoaks a “streaming-first” soap, sticking episodes online a day before they appear on E4. Now it is trying a new approach with drama.Beth will appear on YouTube in three 15-minute chunks from Monday 9 June, and on the actual telly as a single 45-minute episode, making it the skorts of the screen: why be one thing when you can be two? Beth is about a glamorous couple called Joe and Molly, played by Nicholas Pinnock and Abbey Lee, who are going through IVF treatment. We see the buildup to a much desired pregnancy, skip forward to the birth, then jump to a few years later, for reasons that would definitely spoil it if they were to be revealed here.This is a family drama. There are brief fantasy sequences, of the children the couple might have, and discussions about what it means for Joe, a Black man, and Molly, a white woman, to have a child who resembles them both. It is also a low-key thriller. There are tensions between the couple, both obvious and implied. Their IVF doctor is overfamiliar and too tactile. Molly’s mother is disproportionately rattled by a child’s simple drawing.View image in fullscreenIn treatment … Lee and Pinnock in Beth.Photograph: Channel 4To add to the genre pile-on, Beth is being billed as science fiction, but knowing this doesn’t do it any favours, because without that knowledge, it looks like a straightforward, if slightly stagey, drama for almost the entire duration. If you do know that it is science fiction, you’re left to constantly anticipate exactly when the science fiction will kick in. For me, that undermines the more weighty emotional scenes, because as Joe and Molly endure both hope and devastation, a nagging voice in my head is wondering if they are going to turn out to be aliens.It’s good that it doesn’t patronise viewers by assuming they won’t have more than five seconds of focus to spare. In fact, it’s so far from giddy that it is almost sedate. Nor does it go for the endless stretch that can afflict online content, where the time restrictions of traditional TV mean nothing, and you watch a man chew a Curly Wurly for what seems like many days. But that does mean that, ultimately, Beth feels like a one-off television drama, albeit one with an eyebrow-raising pivot towards the end. I can’t see what makes it so specifically digital.If one of the existential issues facing TV is how to get young people to pay attention to it, then a meditative drama about IVF, identity and parenthood isn’t necessarily going to solve the problem. But if the idea is to win back some of the older eyeballs who have been distracted by, let’s say (just plucking this out of thin air) an in-depth documentary about a niche ultramarathon, then it might be on to something.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDramaScience fiction TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well, you can! How tribute festivals ‘grew into a monster’More than 30 outdoor music events including Tribfest and Big Fake Festival are taking the UK by stormNadia KhomamiArts and culture correspondentSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 7 Jun 2025 02.01 EDTShareMatt Blumberg launched the tribute festival, GlastonBarry, in 2013 as a way of doing something positive and joyful for his hometown of Barry, Wales.But what started as a local festival of 500 people is today a three-day event attended by an audience of 18,000. “It started off as a community incentive, and a bit of fun, and it quickly grew into a monster. It’s bonkers,” the former primary school teacher said.GlastonBarry – a play on Glastonbury – is one of more than 30 outdoor tribute festivals that have taken the UK by storm. Others include Glastonbudget, Tribfest, and Big Fake Festival, which showcase tribute acts such as Oasish, Antarctic Monkeys, Coldplace, Badness, the Fillers, Stereotonics and Blondied.According to The Entertainment Agents Association [TEAA], tickets for tribute festivals have been “on the rise” over the past five years.“These events have seen a significant growth in popularity, with some festivals having to move to larger venues due to increased popularity,” said Paul Winteridge, immediate past president of TEAA.This week, Steps star Ian “H” Watkins wasforced to change the name of his Cowbridge tribute festival, Cowchella– where the likes of Harry Styled UK and Got to be Taylor Swift are due to perform – after organisers of the famous California event made an official complaint.View image in fullscreenIan ‘H’ Watkins of Steps.Photograph: Dymond/Talkback Thames/ShutterstockWatkins said he viewed it as a “massive compliment that they feel like our little festival is a little bit of a threat to their ginormous, juggernaut of a machine”.Winteridge said the soaring costs of concerts were one of the reasons behind the popularity of tribute events, especially during a cost of living crisis. There was also a nostalgia factor, as well as the fact that theywere accessible for families.At GlastonBarry, weekend tickets cost £65, making it great value for money, said Blumberg, who founded Mack Events with his cousin – a former aeronautical engineer. “We cram it with 22 acts in two days, and there’s literally something for everyone, from Eminem to Bad Manners.“A lot of the acts we book, like Queen, Bob Marley or George Michael, are tributing people you’re never going to be able to see live again. We don’t take it seriously, we even encourage fancy dress. We get a lot of hen dos and stag dos, as well as families bringing their kids.”Although tribute acts have been around since the 1960s, modern advances in lighting, stage makeup and sound technology means musicians can look more authentic now.They can even become huge brands in their own right, like the Bootleg Beatles and Björn Again, who have been paying tribute to Abba longer than the original band were together.“In the early days, we would get a lot of people saying: ‘Why would you want to go and see fake bands? Book some real acts’,” Blumberg said. “But that’s changing.“Some of the bands we’ve had are honestly amazing, like Oasish. I’ve seen the real Oasis a few times, and Liam Gallagher stormed off stage and didn’t come back. They played their latest album rather than crowd favourites. Whereas the tribute acts get everyone singing along.”Oasish formed in 2004 and were voted the UK’s official No 1 Oasis tribute band by TEAA. Paul Higginson, who plays Liam Gallagher, has been in tribute bands since 1999, when he performed as Kelly Jones in Stereotonics.“We play about 80 to 90 gigs a year,” Higginson explained. “It’s become like breathing. As soon as the wig and parka go on, and I take the first step on to the stage, the shoulders go back, the chest comes out, and the chin goes up in the air. The swagger comes out all of a sudden.”Higginson compared his performance to acting on any West End stage. “You play your role, you sing your lines. I never take the character home with me.”View image in fullscreenAntarctic Monkeys at Mosfest, Sheffield in 2017.Photograph: Glenn Ashley/Famous/AvalonThe band were even asked to play at Wembley Stadium on the day of the 2013 FA Cup Final when Manchester City were playing Wigan. “We were in the hospitality bit. I’m stood there singing Wonderwall, and both Noel and Liam Gallagher were going up the escalator. They leaned over and started clapping and cheering.”Higginson said the difficulty in securing tickets for the Oasis reunion concerts had driven ticket sales for his band. “We do get a lot of people saying: ‘We couldn’t get tickets to see Oasis, so we’ll go see Oasish instead.’”When Ed Faulkner, a member of the Beautiful Couch (a Beautiful South tribute band) started Tribfest, one of the UK’s first tribute festivals, in 2007, it was a “massive gamble”.“It didn’t help that that was the year of the floods in Hull, and we were up to our waists in water. We lost a lot of money. But I had a vision.”Within a few years Faulkner’s dedication started to pay off. “We’ve seen a gradual increase in ticket sales over the years. We’re licensed for 5,000 people and we got about four and a half last year,” he said.“We can keep control of things other festivals can’t, like toilets, showers, and security. We get a lot of families coming for that reason. They don’t go to Leeds any more, they come to ours, because there’s nobody setting fire to tents at the end of the weekend.”If Glastonbury is the Waitrose of the music festival world, Faulkner added, “then we’re the Lidl. I suppose me and my daughter Dempsey [who helps organise the festival] are the Michael and Emily Eavis of the north.”Faulkner also commended the quality of current tribute acts. “When people come to see them they’re just blown away. It’s like they’ve landed on the moon.“I remember we had a Muse tribute band from Holland, who were used to playing little social clubs in and around Amsterdam, and the lead singer came off stage and went: ‘Wow, this is like our Olympic Games.’”Explore more on these topicsFestivalsPop and rockOasisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His new film is a haunted, social-realist drama with elements of Mike Leigh but also moments of thriller and even horror. Williams isn’t shy of stabbing us with an old-fashioned jump scare towards the end, which in fact challenges the audiences with its refusal of categorisation. There are two superb lead performances from Andrea Riseborough and Brenda Blethyn and an outstanding supporting turn from Jason Watkins.Dragonfly is about loneliness and alienation and about the eternal mystery of other people, the fear of intimacy and the unknowable existence of urban neighbours. Elsie, played by Blethyn, is an older woman who is quite capable of independent living in her bungalow, but a recent fall and an injured wrist has meant that her middle-aged son (Watkins), all too obviously to compensate for not visiting that often, has paid for daily visits from a private agency nurses. They are overworked and not doing an especially good job. Really, she doesn’t need these nurses and by enduring them, Elsie is shouldering the burden of her son’s guilt.Meanwhile nextdoor neighbour Colleen, played by Riseborough, is a continuingly strange presence. She is a melancholy, withdrawn figure, evidently on benefits and living with her huge American bull terrier, uncompromisingly named Sabre. Williams shows us that she is effectively living in a kind of platonic relationship, ormariage blanc, with this dog; the film periodically gives us startling shots of Sabre’s colossal body in a kind of domestic nakedness sprawled on Colleen’s bed.In a manner that may be insidious or predatory or just friendly and compassionate, Colleen befriends Elsie; the latter overcomes her initial nervousness of Sabre and she appreciates Colleen’s forthright offer of help. Colleen goes down to the shops to get groceries for Elsie and after a few such trips they agree that what would be easiest would be if Colleen simply gets Elsie’s debit card and Elsie gives her the pin number. Of course, the film allows us to suspect the worst and then suspect the worst of ourselves for suspecting it. Colleen seems to be unhappy and damaged but well-meaning, especially when she (for a laugh) buys them both a two-way radio so they can easily keep in contact – but then uses this radio to talk to Elsie late at night and semi-intentionally to allow bewildered Elsie to hear what’s happening in Colleen’s house.It is a riveting dual portrait of two gloomy people who really have, in a strange and dysfunctional way, found a new way of interacting and – importantly – this is a triangular relationship: Elsie, Colleen and the vast Sabre. But with a terrible inevitability, Elsie’s uptight busybody son John (Watkins) arrives and there are awful consequences to a conversation he has with Colleen which Williams only shows us in long shot, withholding the truth about what he’s saying. It’s a stark, fierce, wonderfully acted film.Dragonfly screened at theTribeca film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAndrea RiseboroughTribeca film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Kate Wasserberg, for her first production as artistic director, picks Jonathan Larson’s memoir musical: a show that refuses to apologise for the urgent necessity of making art.It’s New York in 1990: the city of scuzzy apartments and fragile hopes that Larson would immortalise inRent. Jonathan is living on a hustle and a dream, desperate to compose a Broadway show. As he turns 30, his unrealised ambition is all-consuming; he’s too tangled up in frets and feelings to be properly present for his girlfriend, Susan, and best friend, Michael.Curtain up! Meet the new artistic directors with great plans for British theatreRead moreTime is flying, everything is dying. A revolve neatly suggests Jonathan’s fear that he can’t set his own pace – life is going too fast, his career too slowly. This “pre-midlife crisis” could seem frivolous, but the heartbreak, the anxiety over health and money all feel real, especially in Wasserberg’s production, which is tender with the characters.Larson performed this as a solo; it was itself redeveloped after his death in 1996. His heady score is richly varied, from introspective ballad to guitar-hero antics, from zippy vaudeville to shimmering Sondheim homage. All arrive with gusto from the balcony band and tireless cast. Ryan Owen gives Jonathan restless fingers, taut smiles and a resonant sob of a voice. He bounces feelingly off Tarik Frimpong’s twisty, animated Michael and Christina Modestou’s terrific Susan, a performance of ample wit and warmth.This is also a soft launch for technical bells and whistles. Katy Morison’s lighting shifts from chill to flare (with a last neon flourish). Amy Jane Cook’s set design inserts evocative sections of rooms and roofs, and is as multitasking as the actors: a diner bar spins to become a BMW. With posters for Hair and Merrily We Roll Along on Jonathan’s wall, this show is a theatre kid’s apotheosis.It’s also a statement of intent. Making art, like opening a theatre, is a leap of faith.Theatr Clwydlands triumphantly.AtTheatr Clwyd, Mold, until 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsTheatr ClwydreviewsShareReuse this content"

She had other ideasPlus tips on travelling with dogsNick DuerdenSat 7 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhen, two years ago now, our dog sitters cancelled on us just 24 hours before we were due to go on our summer holiday, we felt more than a little put out. Aware that we couldn’t leave Missy, our border terrier, home alone with a tin opener, we sent out frantic texts and made urgent phone calls before at last finding someone, a friend of a friend of, I think, another friend, and simply hoped for the best. What else were we to do? The flights were non-refundable.It all turned out fine, but it was not an experience we were keen to repeat. And so, the following year, we took Missy with us.Dogsare portable, after all, and have a nose for adventure. Also, this was to be an extended holiday, away for a full month – working part time in order to fund it – and we couldn’t be apart from her for that long.Missy had grown bored with our local parks, so I thought she would enjoy the break. Isn’t hindsight a wonderful thing? My wife and I set off in a state of high excitement – our girls waving us goodbye, then promptly disappearing inside to plan illicit parties.View image in fullscreenNick Duerden and Missy in Saumane-de-Vaucluse.Photograph: Nick DuerdenAs we drove first to France, where we were to spend a week, and then to north-eastern Spain for three, the dog sat bolt upright for the entire journey, panting heavily, her tongue practically down between her knees. At each motorway pit stop, she pulled me towards unfamiliar smells with an urgency that bordered on the deranged, and then, once we had arrived, she remained in a state of perpetual confusion. If we were enjoying the novelty of a new neighbourhood, a new language, and alfresco meals that ran late into the evening uninterrupted by Netflix, Missy didn’t.Seeing her tail tucked tightly into her body, I became convinced she’d sunk into a depression. The dogs she encountered during our daily walks were baldly antagonistic towards her (revenge for Brexit?) and she took to hiding between my legs. This was not good. Just like Withnail and I, it felt increasingly as if we had gone on holiday by mistake.As we drove to France, the dog sat bolt upright for the entire journey, panting heavilyA decade into our first experience of dog ownership, we had come to feel a certain relief that Missy was one of the good ones: calm, not easily riled, gloriously uncomplicated. She had no separation anxiety, was good off the lead, and always happy. But when I speak to Simon Wooler, author of the dog training guideMore Than Just a Dog, he explains that travelling with animals is rarely straightforward. “There are a lot of issues that might not initially occur,” he says. “Like, does your dog travel well? Are they prone to travel sickness?”France, we were quick to learn, would prove hostile towards Missy, its green spaces flaunting NO DOGS signs, the locals frowning whenever she squatted to relieve herself. We were staying in the hilltop village of Saumane-de-Vaucluse, Provence, by a golf course we had no interest in using, but with a pool we very much did want to enjoy. Missy wasn’t allowed near the water, and so we left her indoors. That she refused the familiar parting gift of a meaty treat was surprising – she just pinned back her ears, and slunk away. She’d never done that before.View image in fullscreenThe writer and his dog in Peratallada, near Girona in Spain.Photograph: Nick Duerden“It’s the unfamiliarity of the place,” Wooler tells me. “It might have been causing her anxiety.”Clearly. When I went back to check on her, my walk was accompanied by the intriguing sound of howling, and I immediately came over all Chris Packham: were these French deer? A Provençal owl? An ancient tribe of Gallic wolves? I then realised that it was coming fromher, my inconsolablechienne.The next day, we set up Zoom on the laptop to monitor the situation. Again she refused the offer of a treat and, as we bid her goodbye, she walked off to face the nearest wall. Within 10 minutes of our departure, she began again to howl, like Kate Bush on Wuthering Heights, necessitating one of us to rush back to her, full of guilt and apology. We ended up taking turns staying in with her while the other went to the pool alone, which might have proved interesting if this were The White Lotus, or we were swingers, but it simply meant that we were spending most of our days apart. In the evenings, because she wasn’t allowed in restaurants, we took to eating takeaways on park benches.At night, riddled with insomnia, she would sit by our bed whimpering, then refuse any comfort we offered‘To me it’s a fad, a fashion’: rising demand for dog-friendly UK holidays divides opinionRead moreAs desperate people tend to do, we told ourselves that things would get better. We would be in Calella de Palafrugell, a pretty coastal town 80 miles north-east of Barcelona, for three weeks. Here, she would have time to settle; also, the imminent arrival of our daughters might help. But, no. She wasn’t permitted on the beach, and didn’t want to walk. The fierce breeze that whipped through the flat each afternoon slammed doors and shutters as it went. She did not like this. At night, riddled with insomnia, she would sit by our bed whimpering, then refuse any comfort we offered. The night a bat flew into the bedroom, sending each of us screaming in different directions, did not ameliorate the situation.View image in fullscreenMissy didn’t want to walk, and didn’t like being left at the house either.Photograph: Nick DuerdenOccasionally, we tried to behave like normal holidaymakers, visiting churches, cathedrals, shops. But each time, I had to remain outside with her. She didn’t like the pack parting, wanting us all to keep together. On the day we drove to nearby Girona, there was a sudden spike in the temperature – 38C said the sign outside the pharmacy – and so we searched frantically for shade, pouring bottles of water over her, while I Googled “dog heat danger death”. If each of us was counting down the days until our departure, Missy was counting them quicker.When at last we got back home, she made a beeline for the kitchen, and waited impatiently while I unpacked her cushion, then flopped down on it, curled into a comma, and let out the most operatic sigh.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No,” says Wooler, kindly. “Some dogs do enjoy going on holiday with their owners, but others might not. They may need medication first, or to go away for less time. They may simply be happier left at home, with friends or family. Remember that they won’t be missing out if you don’t take them with you.”This year, we’ll send postcards.Paws for thought: how to put your dog at ease before travellingTaking a dog on holiday is not wrong, but bear in mind that they will be in unfamiliar places, and might be feeling somewhat conflicted.If the holiday requires a long drive, then take a few preliminary drives first to gauge whether they get travel sickness. If they do, there is medication and sedatives you can buy.Do some trial runs to unfamiliar places, to see how they fare, and then extend those distances over time. This is much easier with a puppy, but not impossible with adult dogs.Make positive associations with new places by filling them with fun games and nice treats.Ultimately, whether your dog will enjoy the holiday as much as you depends on its personality.Dog essentials when taking your pet on holiday in the EU1 Microchip your pet.2 Vaccinate against rabies.3 Get an animal health certificate from your vet.4 Get tapeworm treatment for your dog.5 On arrival, go through a travellers’ point of entry, to show proof of each of the above.Simon WoolerPeople Who Like Dogs Like People Who Like Dogs by Nick Duerden is published by John Murray Press (£10.99).

I chase that feeling a lot in the kitchen, and it’s how I feel when I eat a great salad, all vibrant and energised, as if I’ve just cycled through gorgeous countryside or been on a hike. I find it hard to write recipes for such salads, though, perhaps because there are often so many ingredient variations and little precedence, but today’s one made the cut. If you make it, please let me know if it made you feel “perky” in any way.Black rice, red cabbage and tempeh saladTempeh is widely available in big supermarkets these days, and I like the ones produced byTibaandTofoo, but I also love the small-batch tempehs made byTempeh MeadesandClub Cultured.Prep20 minCook25 minServes4generously125g black rice(not glutinous)Fine sea salt3 tbsp toasted sesame oil4 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp white miso paste– I likeMiso Tasty2 limes, zested and juiced (to get 3 tbsp juice)2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced4cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated2½ tbsp maple syrup2 spring onions, trimmed, finely sliced, rinsed and drained60g whole almonds, roughly chopped300g tempeh, cut into 1cm-wide strips200g red cabbage, finely shredded2 pak choi(250g), washed and thinly sliced lengthways50g bunch basil, leaves picked to get 30gBoil the rice in salted water according to the packet instructions (as a general rule of thumb, I use a teaspoon of salt for every litre of water), then drain and put to one side.While the rice is cooking, get on with the rest of the salad. In a big bowl, whisk the sesame oil, half the olive oil, the miso, lime juice, garlic, ginger, a tablespoon of the maple syrup and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Throw in the sliced spring onions and toss.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Have ready a plate to the side of the stove. Put the almonds in a large frying pan, turn on the heat to medium and toast, stirring regularly, for eight minutes, until fragrant. Drizzle over the remaining tablespoon and a half of maple syrup and stir for another minute, until caramelised. Transfer to the plate and sprinkle with a big pinch of salt.Rinse out the pan, then heat the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil. Once it’s hot, lay in the tempeh strips and fry for three minutes on each side, until golden and crisp. Add the cabbage, cook for another three minutes, until wilted, then tip the lot into the dressing bowl. Add the pak choi to the bowl, too, toss to combine, then fold in the rice and basil leaves.Tip out in a big mound on to a platter and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkRiceSaladMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
