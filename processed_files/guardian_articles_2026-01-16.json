This pledge seemed in keeping with the confused fatalism of the moment, but it turned out to be one of the few promises to myself I have ever kept.Since then I’ve become a fan of evidence suggesting that minimal changes to one’s lifestyle make a big difference to overall health, and this week there was more:a studyfrom the University of Sydney found that even small changes to three key behaviours – sleep, diet, and exercise – can have significant benefits. For those with the least healthy habits, an additional five minutes of sleep, two minutes more exercise and minimal dietary adjustments could add another year of life.Five minutes more exercise and 30 minutes less sitting could help millions live longerRead more“All those tiny behaviours we change can actually have a very meaningful impact, and they add up over time to make a big difference in our longevity,” said Nicholas Koemel, the lead author of the study.I’m all for barely perceptible lifestyle adjustments, but how easy are they to incorporate into a typical slothful day?SleepThe study’s least healthy cohort got just five-and-a-half hours of sleep a night, and recorded health benefits from an increase of up to three extra hours.I average six-and-a-half to seven hours, and could certainly benefit from more, but I’m reluctant to move my bedtime because I once spent a week going to bed at 9pm for an article, and it messed with my sleep patterns for weeks afterwards. I decide to tack on the extra minutes at the other end. Inevitably, I wake up at the normal time, will myself back to sleep, and overshoot.“Having a duvet day?” my wife asks, pulling open the curtains. She is already dressed to go out; it’s even possible she’s just come back.“I’m extending my life span,” I say. “As we speak.”While I could get used to rising at 9.30am every day, it does represent a material disruption to routine. Among other things, I miss my second cup of coffee.DietThe study used a “diet quality score” based on a 29-item questionnaire. The group with the lowest average score, 36.9 out of 100, needed only a five point top-up (alongside the extra shut-eye and exercise) to increase their lifespan by a year. Five points equates to an extra half-serving of vegetables per day.I’m hoping this also equates to a single apple I would never normally have, because there’s a bowl of applesright here in the kitchen. It is almost literally low-hanging fruit, and the point is not to make any effort.View image in fullscreenMy family get there before me: what had been five apples in a bowl in the morning is just two apples by the afternoon.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianWhere is this apple supposed to fit into my day? Eleven o’clock seems too early – I’ve only recently had breakfast and I’m already starting to think about lunch. It will have to wait until the afternoon.How to sleep well in 2026 – podcastRead moreMy family get there before me: what had been five apples in a bowl in the morning is just two apples by the afternoon. Both are suboptimal; one is soft and bruised, the other seems to be an improbable survivor from last month. I choose the least woolly of the two and duly collect my dietary quality points, but there’s no question: we have strayed into hardship.ExerciseHow do you incorporate an extra two minutes of exercise into a day that contains no real exercise?View image in fullscreen‘I can’t believe I’m going to have to do all this stuff for a whole extra year.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI own a posh skipping rope from a previous doomed fitness attempt. It came in a sack bearing the words: “Beast Your Goals”. Skipping seems like an easy way to jam in two minutes of exertion, at least until you’ve done one minute and realise another would be impossible without a day off in between.I decide the simplest thing to do would be to finish my grudging afternoon dog walk with a two-minute sprint. Unfortunately the dog has never seen me run before, and doesn’t know what to make of it: should she chase, or be chased? In the absence of clear orders she decides it’s safest to try to bring me down like quarry.Luckily it’s cold and raining, so no one is around to see. I can’t believe I’m going to have to do all this stuff for a whole year.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingSleepDiets and dietingFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why are so many silent on their plight?Jonathan FreedlandUS bombs are not the answer, but there’s much the outside world can do – starting with noticing the horror unfolding in TehranFri 16 Jan 2026 12.51 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 14.04 ESTShareDid you notice history being made this week? I am not referring to what may have been themost pathetic momentin recorded time – Donald Trump gratefully taking the Nobel peace prize medal from the woman who actually won it – nor thedefection of a politicianfrom one British rightwing party to another, but something grimmer. For this week witnessed what could well prove to be a landmark chapter in the blood-soaked history of the Middle East.Thanks to an information blackout caused by Tehran’s decision to switch off the internet, it is hard to be precise about what just happened on the streets of Iran. But one official has admitted to adeath toll of 2,000. CBS News putthe number of dead at 12,000, while some warn it could be many thousands more – all of them Iranian civilians, gunned down for daring to protest against their government and to demand a better life.The reports are horrifying and scarcely denied. Doubtless to frighten and deter the Iranian public, the regime itself has published pictures of morgues brimming with body bags. There are reports of security forces using automatic weapons on demonstrators, firing into crowds indiscriminately, mowing down their fellow citizens. Others speak of pellet guns discharging birdshot into the eyes of protesters in order toblind them.Those who took to the streets would have known the risk they were taking. After all, when Iranians protested the election that was stolen from them in 2009, when they complained about exorbitant fuel prices in 2019, and when they rallied under the slogan “Women, life, freedom” in 2022-3, the response was brutal each time. Knowing all that, they protested anyway. They did it in all 31 of Iran’s provinces, and from all parts of society. Not just middle-class urbanites, but young and old, women and men, the poor and the better off. This movement is not about a single, animating grievance, such as 2022’s rebellion against the compulsory hijabfor women, but rather an expression of all-out fury at the regime. And you can see why.The Iranian economy is broken, the currency all but worthless, the national income of a country rich in oil crushingly far behind the global average. Its wealth has been criminally wasted, diverted to the pursuit of regional superpower status, whether through a nuclear weapon or by the sponsorship of proxies abroad: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen. The result is a domestic infrastructure so parlous that last month the capital city came close torunning out of water.But the privations of Iranian life are not only material. Iranians are denied the essentials of a free life. People cannot choose those who rule them because democracy is a sham, with all but those loyal to the regime barred from running for office. They cannot speak their minds or hear the true views of their neighbours, because the censor shuts out criticism. They cannot love who they love, because same-sex activity is punishable by flogging and even death. As the New York Times put it, “Misogyny is official government policy” in a state where a woman’s word in court is officially worth less than a man’s, and where women are barred from singing alone in public. To the regime, life itself has little worth:in 2025, the state executed more than 2,000 of its own citizens. That’s an average of about six people put to death every day.So Iranians were not short of reasons to protest. But they were also explicitly urged on by the most powerful man in the world. “Keep protesting,” Trumpposted on Tuesday. “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” In a speech later that day, he told Iranians to “take over institutions”, to keep up their fight, safe in the knowledge that the US would come to the rescue. The US,he promised, was “locked and loaded and ready to go”.If Iranians thought that meant military action to oust the regime, they have so far been disappointed. In an echo of the first President Bush’s February 1991 exhortation to the Iraqi people “to take matters into their own hands” against Saddam – a plea that was heeded by Shia and Marsh Arabs, only for them to be slaughtered in immense numbers when Bush’s rhetoric proved empty – so far there has been no Trump rescue.To be clear, there are few reasons to believe that US military action would help. You only have to look at the catastrophic record of US intervention in the Middle East these past 25 years to reach that conclusion. Repeating this month’s Venezuela operation and forcing out Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, would give Trump a trophy but not much more. Even removing the entire top layer of leadership would not achieve much, so deeply entrenched is the theocracy that has ruled Iran since 1979, say those who know the country best. “This regime will simply replace itself,” said Suzanne Maloney, who has advised both Democratic and Republican administrations on Iran, when we spoke for theUnholy podcast this week. If US strikes did somehow topple the regime, it would leave a dangerous vacuum. After nearly half a century of the ayatollahs, there is no coherent alternative ready to step in.Still, there is much the outside world can do. Sanctions onIranare tight, but could be tighter still. When it comes to economic pressure, one very senior UN official says privately: “There’s still a long way to go.” That could translate into sanctions on named individuals implicated in this month’s bloodbath but also on core institutions. The EU could set a lead by sanctioning the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. All such moves would begin to change the calculus of key figures in the regime, making them wonder if their best interests are served by staying loyal or breaking away.Which is not to say there are not more direct ways to limit the regime’s ability to slaughter its own. Cyber operations have proven their worth in Iran before and could do so again, if aimed at those centrally involved in repressing the current uprising: say, themorality police and the despised Basij. And there are ways, through Starlink and the like, to provide internet service to ordinary Iranians so they are no longer kept in the dark.In the meantime, there is something small everyone in the world can do – and that is to give the battered and besieged people of Iran our attention. After the massacres, the protests seem to have reduced in intensity – the natural consequence of fear. But as they have receded, so has media coverage and political discussion, even as thousands of corpses from a colossal slaughter are barely cold. Many of those who usually pride themselves on their solidarity with the oppressed of the Middle East have been uncharacteristically restrained this time and oddly quick to move on, perhaps reluctant to be too hostile to an Iranian regime that defines itself as the foe of the US and Israel. Maybe they think that any enemy of Trump’s is automatically a friend of theirs. Maybe they fear it weakens their support for the Palestinians to oppose a regime that wants to see Israel destroyed.But shrugging as thousands of Iranians are gunned down in the streets is not a moral stance worthy of the name. It does not help the oppressed, but only their oppressors – those who flog and hang and shoot and blind their fellow citizens while the world looks on.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency.

Both are now favourites for theOscars.View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley and Paul Mescal in a scene from Hamnet.Photograph: Agata Grzybowska/APGold, meanwhile, hasbeen shortlistedin the inaugural best casting category for Hamnet at the Academy Awards, alongside other films including Sinners, Frankenstein, Marty Supreme and One Battle After Another. The category has been included after decades of lobbying for casting directors to be formally recognised.“I’m really thrilled, and slightly terrified,” Gold said. “It’s wonderful that casting directors are finally being recognised on the same playing field as our other creative colleagues in film-making. Because our tools are other human beings, it’s harder to pinpoint what the creative work actually is.”Gold has cast for some of the biggest films and TV shows of the past three decades, including last year’s big awards winner Conclave, as well as Game of Thrones, The Crown, Slow Horses, The Day of the Jackal and several Star Wars films. She cast for more than 10 projects in 2025 alone, and her accolades include multiple Emmys and a prestigious Bafta special award for her outstanding contribution to TV and film.There was no single formula to being a successful casting director, she said. “There’s an analytical side – shared qualities between actor and character – but ultimately it’s instinct. If you can get the actor and the character to intersect at exactly the right point, then it really is magic.”Gold grew up in Cardiff, the daughter of a schoolteacher and an academic, and studied at Cambridge. Her first casting job was recruiting extras for an AC/DC video, before years working in music videos and commercials.When she cast a 1992 McDonald’s advert directed by Mike Leigh, it changed everything. The pair became friends, and Leigh later hired her to work on Topsy-Turvy, her first major film. She has since cast seven of his films. “She has an uncanny ability to get it,” Leighonce said. “To differentiate at the most subtle and refined level between one actor and the next.”Gold has helped to launch the careers of Claire Foy, Eddie Redmayne and John Boyega, whom she cast in Attack the Block after spotting him in a small play at the Tricycle theatre. She cast Bella Ramsey and Maisie Williams in Game of Thrones when they were still part of local theatre groups. Williams won the part of Arya Stark after Gold saw about 200 hopefuls for the part.“You do a lot of combing and scouting all over the place, and sometimes you find someone amazing,” she said. “We cast Jessie Buckley in Taboo when she was quite fresh out of drama school, and later cast her again in Chernobyl. It’s really great watching people who have real talent grow and grow in their acting and career. I feel very maternal.”With persistent concerns about diversity in film and TV, Gold acknowledges the barriers. “If you’re British, even if you think you’re not thinking about class, it’s still subliminally part of your thinking about character and people,” she said. “Drama schools aren’t as diverse as they used to be because of cost, but there are still brilliant working-class actors out there.” She recently cast a new BBC show, Waiting for the Out, featuring predominantly working-class performers.View image in fullscreenWaiting for the Out.Photograph: Kerry Spicer/BBC/Sister Pictures/She said there had been “phases” when working-class actors dominated the industry. “At one point the most sought-after young actors of the moment were Gary Oldman and Tim Roth.”The industry, she added, had become increasingly risk-averse. “Names help get audiences and money, even if it’s not always the best way creatively. It’s demoralising to make something brilliant that no one sees.”Has she ever had to fight with a director over casting? “I couldn’t possibly comment,” she said with a laugh. “But film-making is a collaborative endeavour – ideally, we’re speaking the same language.”Explore more on these topicsHamnetGolden GlobesAwards and prizesOscarsnewsShareReuse this content"

These tips should help spice things up againA dry spell doesn’t necessarily mean it’s over, say the experts. They share their advice on how to restore intimacy, from changing venue to writing a ‘menu’ and finding your kinkLaura PotterFri 16 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 11.04 ESTShareKnow it’s normalFirst up, don’t panic! “Every couple goes through dry spells. It doesn’t mean either of you is broken, and is not an indicator that something is ‘wrong’,” says Dr Tammy Nelson, sex and couples therapist, author of Open Monogamy,and host ofThe Trouble With Sexpodcast. Dr Laurie Mintz, sex therapist and author of Becoming Cliterate: Why Orgasm Equality Matters – and How to Get It agrees: “The limerence stage, where you can’t keep your hands off each other, lasts six months to two years, then fades, but people think there’s something wrong with them or the relationship.”It’s just a phaseFor Dr Sara Nasserzadeh, social psychologist and author ofLove By Design, our careers, raising children, caregiving and health changes can all impact physical intimacy. “Simply acknowledging that many people go through this and naming it as a ‘season’ or ‘phase’, rather than a ‘failure’, can bring reassurance,” she says.Check you’re OK“Often the relationship a person has within themselves gets projected on to their partner,” says Dr Orna Guralnik, clinical psychologist and star ofCouples Therapy. “If someone is depressed, for example, that strips away the ability to take pleasure. That’s not about your partner or the relationship. Go back inside yourself and see what’s going on with you and what you need to take care of yourself.”Flip the scriptMintz says our sexual vocabulary is an issue. “We use ‘vagina’ for our entire genitals, linguistically erasing the part of women’s anatomy that gives us the most pleasure. We use the words ‘sex’ and ‘intercourse’ interchangeably, despite the fact most women don’t orgasm that way, and the word ‘foreplay’ suggests it’s the lead-up to the main event, all of which overvalues male sexual pleasure. If we overvalued women’s pleasure, we would call foreplay sex, and intercourse post-play.” And there’s a cohort heteronormative couples could learn from: “Women who have sex with women havemore orgasms,” says Mintz. Why? “They communicate more, take more time, and they don’t revolve the entire encounter around penetration.”Forget spontaneityStop chasing sparks, and lean into responsive desire, says Mintz. “You can have a great sexual encounter without being horny first. Say to yourself: this is the reason I want to have sex; it’s going to feel good when we get going; I’m going to feel closer to my partner – any number of reasons. Then start the encounter, and if it’s good when it gets going, it’s good sex!”Dan Savage,sex advice columnist and host ofSavage Lovecast, concurs, adding that when you feel as if you’ve got too much going on to have sex, you need to “block out time, turn off your devices and schedule sex. A lot of people think it has to be spontaneous, but swingers and people into kink reporthigher levels of sexual satisfaction, and swinger and kink parties are planned.”Hit the switch“If body positivity is failing you, turn off the damn lights,” says Savage. He adds that “blindfolds are a great sex toy”. Not into that? “If you don’t feel sexy in your own skin, but you’re working on it, don’t wait until you feel 100% comfortable naked in a brightly lit room before you have sex. Meet yourself – and your body – where you are right now by wearing sexy clothes, lingerie and/or fetish-wear.”Nelson reminds us that “your partner is not critiquing your thighs. They’re longing for closeness with you. Most people lose desire not because their body has changed, but because of the shame they carry about it. When we feel shame, we hide, which shuts down our capacity for pleasure.” The antidote? “Confidence grows through intimacy, not the other way around. Be gentle with yourself and watch how you criticise your own body.”Be open to suggestions“Be GGG,” says Savage. “Good in bed, giving of pleasure and game for anything … within reason. This is tricky advice to give, especially to women, who are socialised to defer to men and prioritise men’s desires over their own, but ‘never do anything in bed that you don’t want to do’ isn’t nuanced enough. Never do anything that turns you off, upsets or triggers you, or leaves you feeling dehumanised, of course, but be willing to do something that wasn’t your idea but your partner is interested in trying. And your partner should do the same for you.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Getty ImagesTouch without expectation“I often ask couples: ‘Do you touch each other daily?’ If the answer is ‘no’ or ‘little’, start with small touches here and there,” says Nasserzadeh. It’s key, though, that you don’t treat this as a means to an end. “Give affection not just as a prelude to sex or when you want more.” She says you can rebuild intimacy in four stages, “by starting small, making it pleasant, being consistent and allowing your bodies to refeel safety, connection and pleasure”.Define ‘sex’ differently“People have a narrow definition of what sex is,” says Guralnik. “Their expectation is, to put it crudely, intercourse where one partner orgasms. There are reasons people don’t necessarily have the mojo or the time to engage in that kind of sex, but there are other ways people can feel erotically connected; anything from a long kiss to holding hands on the train.”Savage agrees: “I’ve been shouting about this for 30 years; the more broadly you define sex, the more sex you’ll have. Oral or non-penetrative sex, mutual masturbation, outercourse, toys – they aren’t sad consolation prizes, they’re real sex and can be great.”Create a bridgeOverwhelmed? “Most of us don’t have a libido problem; we have a nervous system problem,” says Nelson. You need a transition. “Take a shower, step outside, play a favourite song, breathe for a minute, anything that signals, ‘I’m shifting out of go mode.’ Desire shows up when your body feels safe to relax.”Talk about itHere’s an irony, says Nelson: “It’s likely you talk the least about sex to the person you’re having it with. Try asking each other: ‘What did you like about the last time we had sex?’ ‘What would you like more of?’ Keep statements focused on appreciation, be positive, specific and curious. Conversations about sex should feel like an invitation, not a performance review.”Nasserzadeh agrees: “Start small and specific, and lead with something that is already happening (‘I loved it when you stroked my hair last night; could we do something like that more often?’).” If you feel shy, Savage suggests you “sit in a car and drive while you talk, so you don’t have to look into each other’s eyes”.Write a menuTo find new ways to be intimate, Nasserzadeh suggests “each partner lists anything they believe would bring pleasure and fulfilment, and shares it. At any time when they have energy and space, they can pick from the menu. The only requirement is that each person leaves the experience feeling fulfilled and wanting to come back, because if you do something once or twice and it’s not pleasant, you won’t revisit it.”Incorporate mindfulnessToo frazzled to contemplate intimacy? Mintz suggests “engaging in scientifically supported stress management techniques – exercise, journalling, yoga, deep breathing, mindfulness”. Start by practicing mindfulness outsidethe bedroom: “When you’re brushing your teeth, focus on the sensations, and when your mind wanders, bring it back.” Then apply that to the bedroom, “because the greatest irony of good sex with a partner is you are completely focused on your own sensations”.Set the sceneAfter a spell of low intimacy, a return doesn’t happen by accident. Create a little ceremony: “On Friday night we light a candle, put our phones away, sit opposite each other for five minutes and recall one thing that drew us together in the beginning,” says Nasserzadeh. “This signals to body and brain that something different is happening now.”Quit ‘Tuesday at 8pm sex’Bored of samey encounters? “Go somewhere else, change the time of day, go to a hotel. Wake up your sex life so you can see yourself and the other person with a new temperature around you,” says Guralnik. “I had a patient who would call it ‘Tuesday Sex’. Say: ‘I don’t want Tuesday sex, I want hotel sex!’”Savage agrees couples needlessly end relationships when the sparks no longer fly. To get the excitement – and danger – back, he suggests: “Get out of the house, have sex in your car, go to a club and make out on the dance floor. It felt like an adventure when you were taking a riskoneach other at the start. Get out there and take a riskwitheach other.” Another option? “Agree to have sex twice a week, but one person chooses the time and place. It will feel like an adventure you’re on together.”Never ignore pain“Desire sometimes decreases because you’re having lousy sex, and a huge driving force for women is pain,” says Mintz. “If sex hurts, seek help. A lot of that pain is probably medical or hormonal, especially if you’re around perimenopause.” She is also a big advocate of lubricant: “Vulvas and vaginas are not supposed to be touched or penetrated dry, and a lot of people don’t produce the natural lube – you can be excited about the sex and still not lubricate, and it will be painful.”Make a contractIf it’s been a while, any advance can feel overwhelming and off-putting.“That’s a very common problem,” says Guralnik. “The contract should be: ‘We’re going to do just as much as you want right now, and the moment you want to stop, it’s fine.’ Then all that pressure goes away. No resentment, no pressure.”Thinkkink (or don’t)To work out your kink, “Honestly ask yourself what turns you on,” says Savage. “But know that you don’t have to have kinks to be an interesting or sexually liberated person. For many people, kinks are extensions or exaggerations of something that already turns them on.” He gives an example: “If you like having your ass slapped, you might like having your ass paddled.”Mintz suggests toys. “A lot of women don’t orgasm unless they use vibrators,” she says. “That’s nothing to be ashamed of: we have things on our vulvas called Pacinian corpuscles, which respond to vibration.”Celebrate miniwinsFinally, if you’ve had a prolonged dry spell, don’t expect things to revert overnight, but acknowledge your progress. “If you touch for five minutes, celebrate it. If you pick an item from the sex menu and both feel good, cheer that,” says Nasserzadeh. “Over time these micro-victories build momentum.”Explore more on these topicsSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think he’s laid the markers down.“He’s told Denmark what he’s looking for, and now it’s a matter of having Secretary Rubio and Vice-President JD Vance make a deal.”Denmark announced it had agreed to provide support to help Greenland’s emergency preparedness.Torsten Schack Pedersen, Denmark’s minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, said: “It is important that we stand together.”Peter Borg, Greenland’s minister for fisheries, hunting, agriculture, self-sufficiency and environment, said his government “appreciates the support from Denmark to strengthen preparedness in Greenland”.This week, Greenlanders living in the capital, Nuuk, said they were so afraid of the threat from the US that they werewatching the skies and seas themselves. In the absence of emergency preparedness support from authorities, many said they had been left to work out their own plans on what to do in the case of emergency evacuation or capture by US forces.2:37What do people in Greenland think of Trump’s threats? – videoDuring the congressional visit to Denmark, for which the Greenlandic flag, Erfalasorput, was flown at Christiansborg Palace, the US lawmakers were due to meet other Danish and Greenlandic politicians as well as Frederiksen and Nielsen.Arriving at a lunch meeting at the Confederation of Danish Industry, the Democrat Steny Hoyer told TV 2: “Keep the faith. You’ve got a lot of people with you.”At a joint press conference, Coons thanked Denmark for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said they had a “strong and robust” dialogue about how to continue their relationship into the future.“There’s a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of reality” in Washington, he said, in discussions about Greenland. He added that they were hoping to use information from the visit to try to “lower the temperature” and have a “constructive dialogue” at home.Murkowski said the majority of Americans did not want a US takeover of Greenland, adding: “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset.”After Wednesday’s closely watchedhigh-stakes meetingbetween the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the US vice-president, Vance, and the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, the two sides gave starkly contrasting accounts of what was agreed.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Thursday claimed that a delegation from Denmark and Greenland had agreed to “continue to have technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland”.But Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Vivian Motzfeldt, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland respectively, contradicted her claims.Rasmussen said they had not made such an agreement, but had formed a working group to investigate whether it was possible to “accommodate” US security wishes for the Arctic region.Motzfeldt said Leavitt had not been at the meeting, telling the Greenland newspaper Sermitsiaq: “There is a lot of work ahead, the situation is still very uncertain, but we have a new channel, a place where we can talk directly to each other.”On Thursday, Frederiksen said Greenland’s defence was a “common concern” for Nato as international troops started arriving in Greenland from across Europe.A spokesperson for the German defence ministry said on Friday that the reconnaissance mission would assess the viability of deploying Eurofighter jets to the territory.“It is a matter of looking at whether the Arctic is secure and to what extent we can contribute to this together with our Nato partners,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkTrump administrationNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The signs are written in a different language. You’ve got burqas being sold in markets.” She said there should be “one civic culture” and it “should be British”.The former prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, herself a British-born Muslim of Egyptian descent, has beensubjected to Islamophobic abusesince it was announced she would lead the rightwing party’s local election campaign in London.The crossbench peer Shaista Gohir, who is the CEO of the Muslim Women’s Network UK, called Cunningham’s comments “dangerous” and a “dog whistle” to racists and said they would further alienate Muslim women, including the minority who wear a burqa.Gohir said her charity had been forced to remove signage outside its offices and picture profiles of staff because of a sharp rise in the number of abusive and threatening letters and emails it had received. “We’ve had letters sent about grooming gangs saying all Muslims are scum, Muslims are filth,” she said. “It is hateful stuff, so obviously people are fearful.”Gohir said that despite Cunningham’s background she was “sending a message to Muslims that they do not belong” and “emboldening people who already abuse Muslims and influencing those people who are reading this misinformation”.She said: “The number of Muslim women who wear the burqa in this country is tiny, and yet [Cunningham] has chosen to focus on that instead of the NHS, schools or the cost of living. Is she going to get the police to arrest wealthy burqa-wearing visitors in Harrods, or is it just women in Whitechapel?”View image in fullscreenKhan said it was the job of a mayor to bring people together, not sow division.Photograph: Yui Mok/PASpeaking on LBC after the comments,Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, said figures “trying to sow seeds of division” was nothing new and that it was the job of a mayor to bring people together.“Almost without argument, our city is the greatest city in the world because of our diversity,” he said. “I mean, how far back do you want to go in terms of freedom of religion, freedom of expression and so forth? These are quintessentially British rights that we’re so proud of.”Afzal Khan, the Labour MP for Manchester Rusholme, called Cunningham’s comments a “deliberate and cynical ploy”, adding: “This is all about divisive ideas being pumped into the society deliberately for electoral benefits.”He pointed to research that Boris Johnson’s commentscomparing veiled Muslim women to letterboxesled to a surge in anti-Muslim attacks and incidents of abuse.“There are consequences for the word that politicians use,” Khan said. “What anyone wears is no business of the state or the politicians. Individuals have the freedom to choose.”The issue of the veil has been a difficult one for Reform. Last July, Reform’s former chair Zia Yusuf described a question from the party’s MP Sarah Pochin calling for a burqa ban as“dumb”, as it was not party policy.

Papers they examined that compared health outcomes among children born to the same mother included 262,852 under-18s who had been assessed for autism, 335,255 assessed for ADHD and 406,681 assessed for intellectual disability.Khalil said: “The message is clear: paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided. This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever, and so they should feel reassured that they still have a safe option to relieve them of their symptoms.”Without naming Trump, the researchers categorically refute his remarks. They “hope that this gold-standard review will put an end to any scepticism on using paracetamol during pregnancy as avoiding paracetamol for significant pain or fever can expose both mother and baby to known risks, particularly untreated maternal fever”.Trump madehis interventionduring a press conference at the White House on 22 September. Referring to the drug by its name in America, he said: “Taking Tylenol is not good … All pregnant women should talk to their doctors about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant … Don’t take Tylenol. There’s no downside.”He said paracetamol in pregnancy was so dangerous that his administration planned to tell doctors in the US to advise expectant mothers to avoid using it.However, this new study has concluded that Trump’s statements were baseless. It identified no association between exposure to paracetamol in utero and a baby being autistic, having ADHD or an intellectual disability.“Familial and genetic factors, including the well-established tendency for autistic traits to run in families, are more plausible explanations for previously observed associations than any direct effect of paracetamol,” it says.The authors also raise the possibility that an ailment which prompts a woman to take paracetamol regularly during pregnancy may itself play more of a role in influencing a child’s neurodevelopmental status.“Paracetamol is typically used only intermittently, and its prolonged use raises questions about whether the underlying health condition prompting extended use might be more important in shaping neurodevelopmental outcomes rather than the drug itself,” they say.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, responded to Trump’s claims by advising women in the UK to ignore them. “I would just say to people watching: don’t pay any attention whatsoever to whatDonald Trumpsays about medicine,” he said on ITV the day after.Experts welcomed the Lancet study. “Expectant mothers do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far-reaching effects on their child’s health.Grainne McAlonan, a professor of translational neuroscience at King’s College London, said: “While the impact of last year’s announcement has been extensive, I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close.”Dr Steven Kapp, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Portsmouth, said: “An implication is that society needs to stop going down rabbit holes of seeking false prevention of developmental disabilities. Instead, we should focus on making the world a better place for disabled people.”Streeting said: “This major review can, yet again, reassure mothers-to-be everywhere that there is no evidence whatsoever to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism, ADHD or disabilities in their children.“Our country’s leading scientists, doctors, and the NHS are clear that paracetamol is safe to take when pregnant and in pain or suffering a fever.”Explore more on these topicsAutismMedical researchHealthDonald TrumpEuropePharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump himself will serve as chair, with further appointments expected in the coming weeks.“Each executive board member will oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization,”a White House statement said.“The United States remains fully committed to supporting this transitional framework, working in close partnership with Israel, key Arab nations, and the international community.”Blair’s inclusion is likely to prove contentious in the region. The former Labour leader remains a divisive figure in the Middle East for his role in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.Soon after leaving office in 2007 he became special representative of the Quartet, a group composed of the US, EU, Russia and the UN seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But he became seen as too close to the Israelisand stepped down in 2015.Acknowledging that Blair remains a divisive figure, Trumpconcededlast October: “I’ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he’s an acceptable choice to everybody.”The president also appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisers to the board to oversee “day-to-day strategy and operations”.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN envoy to the Middle East, will serve as the High Representative for Gaza.The list was made public a day after Trumpannouncedthe formation of the “board of peace” as part of phase two of the US-brokered plan to end the conflict in Gaza. Characteristically effusive, the president described it as the “Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place”.Its creation follows the formation of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee tasked with running day-to-day affairs in post-warGaza. The body will be headed by Ali Sha’ath, a Gaza native and former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority.The White House said: “Dr Sha’ath brings deep experience in public administration, economic development, and international engagement, and is widely respected for his pragmatic, technocratic leadership and understanding of Gaza’s institutional realities.”Trump has also appointed the former head of US special forces, Maj Gen Jasper Jeffers, to lead an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which is to oversee security across the territory.The US-backed peace plan, launched on 10 October, brought about the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas and a cessation of fighting between Israel and the militant group.The second phaseis now in motion, though reports of aid shortages and sporadic violence continue to cast a shadow over the process.Since the ceasefire, Israel has also demolishedthousands of structuresthat survived the war, including homes and greenhouses, in the part of Gaza is still controls.Hamas has yet to publicly commit to full disarmament – a key Israeli demand and one of the most contentious elements of the longer-term settlement.Rosa DeLauro, a Democratic congresswoman, said on Friday: “The success of phase two of the ceasefire in Gaza depends on full implementation of phase one, which is still lacking in several key areas, including delivery of humanitarian aid, cessation of Israeli military strikes, and the return of the final deceased hostage held by Hamas, Ran Gvili … The war must finally end before the peace can be built.”Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver, suggested that the board’s name was undermined by Trump’s bellicose actions. “I hope he can find time to attend Board of Peace meetings between meetings about invasions of Venezuela, Iran, Greenland, Canada, and Minneapolis,” Masketobservedon social media.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyGazaDonald TrumpMarco RubioTony BlairJared KushnernewsShareReuse this content"

Many question his level of popular support, even though his name has been chanted at some protests.Calling on the west to help unseat Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, Pahlavi said on Friday that the regime was nevertheless doomed to collapse with or without such assistance.3:05Reza Pahlavi: is the last shah's son a viable opposition leader for Iran? – video explainer“The Iranian people are taking decisive actions on the ground, it is now time for the international community to join them fully,” he told reporters at a news conference in Washington.He said foreign involvement did not require “boots on the ground” but instead “targeted intervention” that could weaken the regime’s repressive apparatus, such as targeting the leadership of the Revolutionary Guards.“What they need from the world is resolute, targeted support to protect lives, amplify their voices and hasten the collapse that is already on the way,” he said. “But let me be clear, with or without the world’s help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner, and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.”Pahlavi said 12,000 protesters had been killed over 48 hours as security forces conducted a bloody crackdown against demonstrations that have swept the country since 28 December. Human rights groups have confirmed lower figures but still put the death toll in thousands.Donald Trump had vowed that “help is on the way” if the regime continued to kill protesters, or carried out executions of those detained. But he retreated afterwarnings from the US’s Middle East alliesthat military intervention could trigger regional instability. Posting on his Truth Social network on Friday, Trump thanked the regime for allegedly cancelling a wave of scheduled executions.View image in fullscreenLarge-scale anti-government protests have been carried out across Iran since late last year.Photograph: AP“I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!” he wrote.Pahlavi spoke out after protesters chanted his name and “long live the shah” at recent protests – an ironic development given that the monarchical regime of his father, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown after months of similar mass demonstrations and complaints of torture and human rights abuses.He avoided giving a clear answer when asked by the Guardian if he intended to re-establish a monarchy, but said he had a “comprehensive plan for an orderly transition, which is ready to be implemented immediately”. It would include referendums to establish the form of a successor government, but he refused to rule out a monarchical restoration.“I am uniquely positioned to ensure a stable transition,” he said “That’s the verdict delivered loudly and clearly by the people in the face of bullets.”He claimed “large segments” of the security forces had already refused to fire on the population and “whispered their loyalty to me”.He referred to “the bond between me and the Iranian people” – a phrase redolent of his father’s rhetoric – and said: “It’s been with me since birth, and it cannot be broken, even in exile.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Also, having regard to the nature of these offences, the appropriate punishment must be by way of immediate imprisonment.”The trial heard that Brandt, who lived on theIsle of Wightat the time, failed to comply with a verbal warning by police as well as the terms of a conditional caution issued in April 2024 that required him to complete a victim awareness course and not to contact Mordaunt.The divorced father of two, who now lives in Lymington, Hampshire, then left two voicemail messages for Mordaunt. In one, he said: “I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.”In a victim impact statement, theformer Conservative party leadership candidatesaid: “I am completely exhausted due to the stress. Every time I step out of the building I am looking over my shoulder and checking to see if he is there.“I am living in a constant fear of a confrontation.”Brandt told the court he wanted to “congratulate her” and shake her “gold-plated and precious hand”, adding that his intention “was entirely political and entirely harmless”.He said he had been diagnosed as having ADHD and being on the autism spectrum.Timothy Dracass, in mitigation, said: “His responsibility is substantially reduced by reason of a mental disorder or learning disorder, namely his neurodiverse condition.”Explore more on these topicsPenny MordauntCrimeEnglandPortsmouthIsle of WightnewsShareReuse this content"

Several hours later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Machado “presented me with her Nobel peace prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect.”The Nobel Peace Center said on social media that “a medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel peace prize laureate cannot”. The organisers of the prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute, hadalready said that the prize“cannot be revoked, shared or transferred” when Machado first revealed her plan – a sentiment reiterated by the institute on Friday.When Machado wasawarded the prize in Oslo last monthafter making a dramatic, secret journey from Venezuela, the Nobel committee celebrated her long struggle for democracy against Nicolás Maduro’s “brutal, authoritarian state”. Since then, Trump has invaded Venezuela and removed Maduro, handing power to Venezuela’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez.0:40María Corina Machado says she presented Donald Trump with her Nobel peace prize medal – videoKirsti Bergstø, the leader of Norway’s Socialist Left party and its foreign policy spokesperson, said: “This is, above all, absurd. The peace prize cannot be given away.”Trump’s recent threats to invade Greenland, she said, demonstrated why he was not a worthy recipient. “Trump will no doubt claim that he has now received it, but it cannot be transferred, and Trump’s repeated threats toward Greenland clearly demonstrate why it would have been madness to award him the prize,” Bergstø said.Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of the Centre party, said: “Whoever has received the prize has received the prize. The fact that Trump accepted the medal says something about him as a type of person: a classic showoff who wants to adorn himself with other people’s honours and work.”Raymond Johansen, the Labour former governing mayor of Oslo who is now secretary general of Norwegian People’s Aid, said the situation was “unbelievably embarrassing and damaging”.He said Machado’s actions could damage the reputation of theNobel peace prizeand the Nobel committee.“This is unbelievably embarrassing and damaging to one of the world’s most recognised and important prizes. The awarding of the prize is now so politicised and potentially dangerous that it could easily legitimise an anti-peace prize development,” he wrote on Facebook.“I can’t believe she actually gave the prize to Trump. What on earth is the Nobel committee going to say?”The Norwegian foreign ministry declined to comment, saying the prize was independent of the Norwegian government and referred instead to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A photograph shared by the White House showed the US president with the gift displayed in a large gold frame alongside a text that read: “Presented as a personal symbol of gratitude on behalf of the Venezuelan people in recognition of President Trump’s principled and decisive action to secure a freeVenezuela.”Explore more on these topicsNobel peace prizeDonald TrumpMaría Corina MachadoVenezuelaNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Spokespeople for Uganda’s government and military did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.Wine has alleged mass fraud during Thursday’s election, which was held under an internet blackout, and called on supporters to protest. His party said on Thursday he had been placed under effective house arrest.A senior member of the Ugandan opposition earlier said security forces stormed his house early on Friday morning and shot dead 10 members of his campaign team.The NUP’s Muwanga Kivumbi told Reuters the incident happened at about 3am local time when security forces “broke the front door and began shooting” inside a garage where the people were waiting for the results of the election for his parliamentary seat to be announced. “It was a massacre,” he said.Lydia Tumushabe, a local police spokesperson, said she was unaware of an incident at Kivumbi’s house, which she said was close to the police station.She said machete-wielding opposition “goons” organised by Kivumbi had attacked a police station and vote-tallying centre, forcing security personnel to shoot in self-defence.Tumushabe told Agence France-Presse that “an unspecified number” of people had been “put out of action” and that 25 others had been arrested.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ugandan security forces patrol a street in Kampala this week.Photograph: Isaac Kasamani/EPAKivumbi said security forces had earlier dispersed crowds outside but disputed the police’s assertion that the deaths occurred during clashes between the two sides.He said he was “emotionally broken” by the attack, which occurred after hundreds of his supporters had gathered at his house after voting ended.Many fled as security forces stormed the compound, but officers fired through the door of the garage, where 10 campaign agents were hiding, his wife, Zahara Nampewo, a law professor, said.“I was very shaken personally,” she said. “Seeing fresh bodies. I mean, that is something that cannot easily go away.”The army later came to take away the bodies, the couple said.Wine condemned the incident and called on Ugandans to respond. “The criminal regime in its evening, has gone insane. This insanity will have to be met with RESISTANCE,” heposted on X.View image in fullscreenBobi Wine arrives at a polling station in Magere village, Kampala, on Thursday with his wife, Barbie Itungo Kyagulanyi.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/Getty ImagesWine hasalleged mass fraudduring the election, which was held under an internet blackout that authorities said was needed to prevent “misinformation”, and he called on supporters to protest.Late on Thursday, his partywrote on Xthat the military and police had surrounded his house in Kampala, “effectively placing him under house arrest”.Kituuma Rusoke, a national police spokesperson, said he was not aware of Wine being placed under house arrest.Wine, 43, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the main challenger to Museveni in recent years.

Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule. He told reporters after casting his ballot on Thursday that he expected to win with 80% of the vote if there was “no cheating”.As of Friday evening, Museveni held a commanding lead with nearly 74% of the vote, the electoral commission said. Wine trailed with 23% and the remaining votes were split among six other candidates.

Karos was born in Poland and raised in Italy, where her family still lived.He said: “I just want people to understand that Martina was a great person and just got stuck in a terrible place.”Peter Sigee, the area coroner for Greater Manchester West, concluding the four-day inquest into the deaths of the mother and daughter, said Karos had killed herself and Eleni was unlawfully killed by her mother.He said: “Ms Karos had deliberately placed herself and her daughter in an environment where they were overcome by the toxic effects of carbon monoxide with the intention and effect of ending both their lives.“Despite a high level of good-quality, focused support and care from family, her limited group of friends and professionals, including GP, specialised mental health services, social workers and carers, Ms Karos experienced feelings of extreme loneliness and isolation which overwhelmed her.“Ms Karos decided to end her life by suicide.”Sigee said Karos denied any thoughts of harming herself or Eleni and there was no “objective basis” to suspect she would do so, adding: “This tragic incident could not reasonably have been foreseen.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Watching attentively is the city’s mayor, Anatolii Fedoruk. The generator in his office is also frozen when the Guardian visits and he apologises for the lack of coffee.Four years ago, in the first days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Bucha and the neighbouring city of Irpinbecameemblematic of the brutalityof Moscow’s brief occupation of this area amid the murder of civilians.View image in fullscreenAnatolli Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, stands in front an emergency generator as the temperature hits -12C.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The GuardianWhile the buildings in Bucha have largely been repaired, and the Russians pushed away long ago, Ukraine’s long war is still very much being felt here – most profoundly after Russiaattacked energy infrastructureas temperatures dropped to almost -20C and a national state of emergency was declared.And while energy rationing was already in force in Bucha this winter, the latest attacks have exacerbated an already difficult situation. Arriving in the city on a day of harsh cold and falling snow, traffic lights are dark and residential blocks and many shops unlit due to the latest rolling power outage.In the Battkava cafe, Oleksandr Bartkov, 28, wearing a hoodie pulled up over his head and a ski jacket, is waiting for the generator to warm up before turning on the espresso machine to serve his first customer.Map of Bucha, Irpin and north-west Kyiv.“Recently, in the eight or nine hours we are usually open, we have three to four hours of electricity,” he says. “It’s being going on all winter. But after the last big attack [on 9 January] things have got worse. Then we had a day without any power at all. I don’t think it is even the worst place inUkraine. Everyone is struggling.“For small businesses the situation isn’t good. A lot have closed. I think more [will] shut even if it is only until the end of February.”View image in fullscreenOleksandr Bartkov waits for the generator to warm up before serving his first customer.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The GuardianA short walk away, Fedoruk is in his office in the municipal headquarters. While he admits Bucha is unable to keep to the power rationing schedule of three hours on and six off, he believes the situation is better than in some areas of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.“My children live in a tall tower block without power. They have been asking to come and stay with me,” he says.One issue, Fedoruk explains, is that in the more recently developed conurbations such as Bucha, cities have developed a distributed power supply system that is more resilient to Russian attacks.“The power systems in the cities were built during the old Soviet system with big power plants on which cities rely,” he says. A secondary issue, says Fedoruk, is that if they were built in the Soviet era, Moscow knows exactly where they are.“We’ve had issues with power throughout the war, but in the massive attack on 9 January, the Russians knew that a period of severe frost was coming and they wanted to hit the power plants,” he says.View image in fullscreenAn elderly man pulls a shopping cart through a frozen street in Bucha.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The GuardianRussia’s weaponisation of Ukraine’s winter against its own people – being repaid in kind by Kyiv’s strikes on Russian energy infrastructure – has meant some of the best-laid preparations have fallen short.In a prefabricated building constructed with the help of the Polish government to house displaced families, the heating is dependent on electric storages heaters. The fridges, cookers and hotplates in the communal kitchen all run on electricity. The walls are not thick enough to protect against a sudden loss of power amid the biting cold.It is warm during the Guardian’s visit, but the building’s manager, Vitalina Tsisar, 31, who was herself displaced from Kramatorsk, describes the fallout of a Russian air raid that cut mains power on 13 January.“It was one in the morning and there was an attack in the area. The electricity was turned off immediately. Within two hours it was freezing cold in here. It got down to 6C,” Tsisar says.View image in fullscreenTetiana Kharkivska serves stew to her seven-year-old son, Roman, in temporary housing for displaced people in Bucha.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The Guardian“The generator only has enough power to warm one radiator in the communal room. So at 6.30am we tried starting it but it was frozen because it was -20C. Finally we managed to get it going at 9am, but just to heat one room.“In the meantime, people came to sit with their kids in here; kids wearing their hats and coats. It made people afraid and panic-buy at the supermarket. If it is summer it’s a different situation, but when it is this cold outside you feel yourself freezing.”In the kitchen, Tetiana Kharkivska serves her seven-year-old son, Roman, some stew. Was he frightened? “I wasn’t scared,” he says. “But I was really cold.”As Russian drones and missiles continue to attack energy infrastructure, the government warned on Friday it had 20 days left of energy reserves, with officials ordered to seek more electricity imports.Ukraine war briefing: Russian attack destroys Kharkiv energy facility as UK pledges emergency supportRead more“This is an attempt to break people,” said Oleksandr Kharchenko, the director of the Kyiv-based Energy Industry Research Center in an interview this week with Agence France-Presse, adding that Moscow wanted to turn “a man-made disaster into an absolute crisis”.Ukraine’s state security service, the SBU, has called the continued Russian attacks on power and thermal heating plants “crimes against humanity”.The depth of the crisis has prompted Ukrainian citizens to criticise municipal authorities and recriminations among the political elite about the lack of preparedness for such a situation that had long been expected as Russia escalated its attacks on energy infrastructure.View image in fullscreenA tent is set up in a Kyiv neighbourhood where people can warm up after Russian air attacks.Photograph: Vladyslav Musiienko/APEven asVolodymyr Zelenskyyannounced a state of emergency, he blamed Kyiv’s civic administration, led by his political rival Vitali Klitschko, for allowing the capital to freeze under Russian bombardment.In a video address on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president said: “Far too little has been done in the capital.”In Bucha, the mayor has already witnessed his city weather one terrible crisis and is confident it can survive the latest. “Four years ago, Russia said it would take Kyiv in three days and failed,” says Fedoruk. “That’s when they realised the war would continue for a long time as they prepared to exhaust us.

In June last year, Kim Kardashian disembarked from a water taxi here and navigated its planks during thefive-day weddingof the billionaire Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, and Lauren Sánchez, a former TV journalist.The reality TV star was among the scores of celebrities and members of the world’s super-rich who had descended on the city to celebrate the nuptials, which included everything from pyjama parties to elegant dinners, and provoked widespread protests by anti-Bezos campaigners who threatened to disrupt the festivities by letting loose a convoy of inflatable crocodiles into the city’s canals.View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos leaving the Aman Venice hotel on 29 June 2025.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersThe event, which the Italian press called “the wedding of the century”, brought in about €957.3m to the local economy, according to estimates from Italy’s tourism ministry, the bulk of which is believed to have been derived from the huge hubbub created by the world’s media as it captured all the friction and frivolity.More than six months on, the fascination with the Bezos shindig shows no signs of waning as rising numbers of visitors seek peeks of the various places frequented by the bride, groom and their glitterati guests.Gone are the days when the top requests for Scomparin – a guide esteemed for his insight and intimate knowledge of Venice’s history, culture and traditions – involved visits to St Mark’s Square, the Doge’s Palace or the Rialto Bridge.Now his customers want to be taken off the beaten track, away from the crowds and, increasingly so since June, “they want to see where the Bezoses got married and where the celebrities ended up”, he said. “They saw all the media attention and now they are curious to see what these places are really like.”View image in fullscreenVenice tour guide Igor Scomparin shows tourists ‘goti de fornasa’ drinking glasses, which were among the gifts given to the Bezos wedding guests.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianA recent Bezos wedding tour began with a stroll along a street filled with designer boutiques where Ivanka Trump shopped, before the group stopped opposite the seven-star Aman hotel, famous for its frescoes by the Venetian master Giambattista Tiepolo, where the bride and groom stayed.“This whole area was full of paparazzi,” Scomparin said as he pointed towards the hotel. “People mostly want to know how much it costs. When I tell them prices start from about €3,500 a night for a basic room, they are not so much shocked, just interested to know about that kind of lifestyle.”Scomparin’s clients, mostly from the US, want to see San Giorgio island, where the couple exchanged vows, and the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, the majestic 16th-century building in the city centre where they had hoped to wed before the plan was scuppered by the threatened crocodile stunt. Then there is the Arsenale, a former medieval shipyard in an eastern district of the city where the afterparty was held.Alongside the key wedding locations there is high demand for rides on the wooden taxi boats that transported celebrities, among them Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as for visits to the piazzas where celebrities were spotted or where they took selfies, not to mention the now famous “Kardashian jetty”.View image in fullscreenBoats carrying Bezos and photographers travel past St Mark’s Square.Photograph: Luigi Costantini/AP“Teenagers especially tell me they saw the photos on Instagram of her arriving and want to go to that spot,” Scomparin said. “But when they see it they are a little disappointed because it’s not as chic as it looked. It’s just a regular, everyday jetty that locals use to get on and off boats.”People have been snapping up the two main gifts received by the wedding guests: Friuliane, the velvet shoes typically worn by gondoliers, and goti de fornasa drinking glasses, traditionally made on the island of Murano.An often impromptu bonus to Scomparin’s tours is if his customers get to see packages emblazoned with the Amazon brand whizzing along Venice’s canals as they are being delivered to their recipients.George and Amal Clooney got married in Venicein 2014, and three years before that elephants were brought to the city for a lavish Bollywood wedding. But neither attracted as much intrigue – or indignation – as the Bezos one. The protests were organised by various groups, from those fighting overtourism who accused local authorities of being hellbent on turning Venice into a playground for the rich, to climate activists and people appalled by Bezos’s support for Donald Trump.View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney and Amal Alamuddin on the way to their civil wedding in Venice in 2014.Photograph: Robino Salvatore/GC ImagesThe protests were noisy but marginal to the occasion, which took place without any issues, according to Michael Zennaro, a wedding photographer. “It was an opportunity to show off Venice across the world and to show that weddings can take place here – away from the crowds, in more private settings,” he said.Marigiulia Sella, a wedding planner, said there had been an increase in enquiries for high-end weddings. “Very often they want experiences that span multiple days.

Now she’s back in the new Tomb Raider – and a Die Hard-style thrillerFri 16 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareSophie Turner has a screwball comedy vibe in real life – elegant trouser suit, arch but friendly expression, perfect hair, she looks ready for some whipsmart repartee and a sundowner. She seems very comfortable in her own skin, which is unusual anyway when you’re not quite 30, but especially incongruous given her various screen personas: first, inGame of Thrones. Thirteen when she was cast as Sansa Stark, 14 when she started filming, she embodied anxious, aristocratic self-possession at an age when a regular human can’t even keep track of their own socks. Six seasons in, arguably at peak GoT impact, she became Jean Grey inX-Men: Apocalypse, a role she reprised in 2019 forDark Phoenix, action-studded and ram-jammed with superpowers.Now she’s the lead in Steal, a Prime Video drama about a corporate heist, though that makes it sound quite desk and keyboard-based when, in fact, it is white-knuckle tense and alarmingly paced. The villains move in a malevolent swarm like hornets; hapless middle managers are slain almost immediately; it’s impossible to tell for the longest time whether we’re looking at gangster thugs or hacking geniuses, motivated by avarice or anarchy. It’s a first-time screenplay by novelist Sotiris Nikias (who writes crime under a pseudonym, Ray Celestin), and it feels original, not so much in the action and hyperviolence as in the trade-offs it refuses to make: whatever explosions are going on, however much chasing around a dystopian pension-fund investment office, you still wouldn’t call it an action drama. It has a novelistic feel, like characters from a David Nicholls book woke up in Die Hard, and there’s a constant swirl, as you try to figure out who’s the assailed and who’s the assailant.The central point is Turner’s performance as Zara, office drone cum action hero – by turns petrified, sleuthing, exhausted, baffled. “There’s so much betrayal, the stakes are so high, you can’t prep the feeling,” she says, explaining that, however much research she does ahead, her decisions are always made in the moment. “I don’t even remember what happens in the script! You think you have a grasp on who is who, the power dynamics and who they are as a person, then the next episode, you’ve got it wrong, it’s a whole other game. It’s a constant puzzle-solver.”View image in fullscreenTaking office … Sophie Turner as Zara Dunnein Steal.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/PrimeHer character is so much more than a damsel in distress, with traces of nihilism and “a lot of rage and sorrow”, she says. “So many of the reasons why Zara does what she does is because she’s had to grow up with an alcoholic, abusive mother.” The director had a cat-and-mouse game going with the cast – the villains have elaborate but quite subtle prosthetics, so all their faces seem slightly off but it’s not obvious why, as if they were rendered by an amateur sculptor. The rest of the cast saw that disguise for the first time as they started shooting, and were as disoriented as the viewers, Turner says. The mood is one of deliberate, chaotic menace. “Take one was a surprise for all of us,” says Turner. “They wanted to get our genuine reaction. It was quite method. It was my first time really having that.”Without wanting to give too much away, wealth is as much the enemy as any character, which is pretty zeitgeisty. It’s interesting how bad guys used to always have a Russian accent, then they had to be Arabs, and now “it’s just rich people”, Turner says. “It’s much better, much less racist.”This is Turner’s first big role in a while, though she’ssoon to start filmingthe live-action Tomb Raider, made by Phoebe Waller-Bridge for Prime Video, playing Lara Croft. The training has been absolutely intense – eight hours a day, five days a week – since she finished shooting Steal. She’d never worked out before in her life – on Game of Thrones, the most physical thing she had to do was get beaten up. “It’s quite nice to learn how to throw a punch and not just take it,” she said recently.View image in fullscreen‘It’s nice to learn how to throw a punch not just take it’ … Turner as Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider.Photograph: Jay Maidment/PrimeGame of Thrones had been a trial by fire, though she describes it now with a marginally less painful-sounding “thrown in at the deep end”. Sansa Stark was a pivotal part – the eldest daughter of Sean Bean’s House of Stark head Eddard, she was on screen continually, a huge amount of dynastic drama hanging on the credibility of her turmoil. She’d never been to drama school, and even though she’d been a member of the children’s Playbox Theatre Company in Warwick, she still feels self-conscious about those first seasons.“I learned how to act on that set, and now I’m thinking: that’s not how to do it. That’s not what I do these days. It’s very embarrassing. Imagine if you were learning to sing, and all your lessons had been filmed and broadcast. It’s just an uncomfortable experience. I think the imposter syndrome remains. But I don’t think there’s any actor who doesn’t have that.”It was an incredible learning curve, given the quality of the cast, and that as many demands might be made of a 14-year-old who’s never done it before as of a 73-year-old who trained with Laurence Olivier. “Having an aristocratic background, as Sansa, and coming into a scene, having to command authority over these very seasoned actors, it was really funny. It felt so foreign and so wrong.”View image in fullscreenQueen of the North … Turner as Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones.Photograph: HBOEven before the show got its mass following, “there was such a fierce fan culture around it”, she remembers. (This was so marked that the author,George RR Martin, appeared at a book festival once and more than one of the audience questions was to the effect of: what are you doing wasting your time at a book festival? You’re not going to live for ever, and you need to write more books.) “The fans have a contagious energy,” says Turner. “Once you feel their enthusiasm, it makes you work 10 times harder than you would have done. You just don’t want to let them down.”Game of Thrones arguably defined the entire 2010s, and once it finished, Turner was considered box-office gold, but to a type: “I got sent so many period dramas, about princesses who start off weak and end up learning and developing and growing into strength. I had to separate myself from all that. After Game of Thrones finished, I didn’t know what was up and what was down. I needed to discover who I was.”At the tail end of that show, she was cast as Jean Grey in X-Men, and that, again, carried a huge weight of fan expectation, the world already built and people so invested in it. “Also a really important part of being an actor is to live a life so you have experiences to draw on. I remember having to act being in love before I’d ever been in love. I thought: ‘OK, I guess I’ll just do this.’ And then suddenly, when I’d been in love for the first time,thenI knew the feeling. That’s part of the job – to sit in the discomfort of feeling so that we can bring it to the table.”View image in fullscreenChit-chat … Turner with Archie Madekwe in Steal.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/Prime VideoShe got engaged to the American singer Joe Jonas when she was 21, moved to the US, had two children in an awesome hurry – her first daughter when she was 24, her second at 26. “It’s really nice,” she says. “I’m not worrying about my biological clock and all that sort of stuff.” At the time, she says, “it just felt like the right break to focus on me, because I’d been a character for so long. Nesting and being at home was amazing. But the flipside of it, and Covid didn’t help, was that this was a big break from the career. And I’ve had to try to rebuild, in a way. You don’t realise how important momentum is in a career, and I stalled it a bit.”She and Jonas divorced two years ago, and she and her daughters returned to the UK, just as green shoots started to appear in the film industry, after the post-pandemic, post-writers’ strike double whammy. “The state of our industry is slowly getting a little bit better, especially in the UK,” she says. As much as a return to the screen, Steal feels like a homecoming for Turner – filmed in east London, the down-at-heel streets strike a contrast against the shiny skyscraper backdrop, effortlessly making the wealth-is-decay point of the story, while also looking quintessentially British.As a viewer, Turner’s favourite genre is romcom, and she’s never really had a comic role, always “drawn to characters who are going through some sort of terrible anguish. The more high-stakes, the more high drama, the more I feed off it.” That’s what she wants to do next: “I actually think comedy is a lot harder than drama. With drama, you make it real for yourself then you just live in it. But with comedy, it’s about timing, delivery. There’s a certain way that it has to be done in order for it to connect. It is more scientific.” It’s hard to imagine hernotin a crisis, but in Steal – and I don’t think this spoils anything – life is tough but she’s tougher.Steal is on Prime Video from Wednesday21 January.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ward’s two-Michelin-starred establishment was given aone-star hygiene ratingin a recent inspection, which means it is operating below minimum legal standards.Ward reignited debate over fine-dining culture this week by claiming he was “not embarrassed” by the poor score, which he said was the result of inspectors’ concerns about the use of raw and aged ingredients.According to the report on theFoodStandards Agency website, Ynyshir’s management of food safety required “major improvement”. It said the cleanliness and condition of facilities and the building also needed “improvement”, and “hygienic food handling” was rated “generally satisfactory”.Ynyshir (pronounced Un-is-heer) serves a 30-course tasting menu starting at £468 a person, which changes daily but heavily features beef and traditional Japanese raw fish known as sashimi, as well as oysters, duck liver and caviar. Meals are served in a black-painted dining room, accompanied by occasional clouds of birch smoke and an in-house DJ’s techno mixes to “take diners on a playful culinary journey around the globe” over five hours.View image in fullscreenWelsh wagyu rib at Ynyshir.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianThe food critic Giles Coren sprang to Ward’s defence on Wednesday, telling the BBC that health and safety rules “don’t really apply” to elite restaurants such as Ynyshir, which was named the UK’s best restaurant in 2022 and 2023.“It’s not about your fridge and ‘have you put the roast chicken from last night next to the raw chicken’, which can lead to bacteria. It’s a different sort of world,” Coren said.“They are clearly doing enough to prevent the spread of bacteria but if you imagine a hygiene inspector, in his white coat, with his pen in his top pocket, expecting to see a neat provincial fridge, I can see that he would lose his mind.”Coren’s comments were met with outrage by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH), which said Coren risked giving the impression that food hygiene rules were “optional, subjective or old-fashioned”.Una Kane, CIEH’s food advisory panel chair, said in a statement: “Many restaurants offer a unique experience for diners while meeting the standards of food hygiene legislation … It’s insulting to those restaurateurs to imply you can’t do both. No food business should see itself as above the law.”Ward’s outspokenness has raised eyebrows before. He answered “fuck that” to the suggestion chefs should cook for customers, rather than themselves, and has defended his high prices by saying Ynyshir should “probably be more expensive”. In 2023, a diner claimed he had challenged her husband to a fight. The restaurant did not comment on the specific allegations, calling the boss “a gentle giant”.However, Ward has acknowledged that the food safety officers were “not 100% wrong”, and has since installed an additional hand-washing station in the fish preparation area. He also claimed overwhelming paperwork was part of the problem.Tomono Davies, the London-based founder of Tomono Sushi Party, which provides sushi-making experiences, said she found the UK’s food safety rules “shockingly difficult”, but sashimi preparation in itself should not affect a hygiene rating.“I don’t know whether the food rating was fair, I haven’t been there or talked to them, but I did find it strange when he mentioned it was because of handling raw and aged fish,” she said. “So many restaurants handle raw food, steak tartare has even stricter rules.“The regulations are much kinder in Japan than here. I think it’s a cultural difference, because the level of cleanliness and chef discipline in Japan is higher. Here, it’s more about saving yourself because you don’t want to get sued or go out of business.”James Lowe, the chef-owner of Michelin-starred Lyle’s in east London, which closed last year, said his establishment had once received a two-star hygiene rating.“One inspector was more senior, the other was introduced as a trainee. The trainee freaked out at a label on a cheese that said ‘unpasteurised’, she thought it was dangerous. That’s when I thought, ‘Oh my God, this is going to be difficult.’“Another time, after the cheese fiasco, there were five sheep carcasses hanging in the walk-in fridge and [the inspectors] refused to go into the fridge. They were also horrified by pork that had been aged in salt for two months. They told me to throw it away.”Hackney council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.For now, Ynyshir must follow Welsh law by displaying its one-star hygiene certificate in a prominent place in the entrance or dining room. The business said it has requested a re-inspection, but no date has yet been set.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsWalesMichelin GuideFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I can’t be alone, either: once the relic of grandparents’ bedrooms, hot-water bottles are having a revival. Maybe it’s the effects of high energy prices, or an increasing desire to achieve cosiness.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But how different can hot-water bottles really be? Fill them, hug them – job done, right? Well, yes and no. Since hot-water bottles have been trending, manufacturers have upped the ante. Yes, there are the traditional hot-water bottles sloshing about with bellies full of hot water, but there are also rechargeable hot-water bottles, which often stay warm for far longer. And, many people prefer the comforting weight and safety of microwavable “hot-water” bottle alternatives, often filled with natural grains, such as wheat.I’ve spent months at home with a thermometer and a stopwatch to find the best hot-water bottles. Do friends often comment on how weird my job is? Yes – yes, they do.

During that time I’ve tested alotof stuff, from kids’ toys to coffee machines and mattresses, so I’m used to putting products through their paces and investigating how a brand’s claims match up to the reality of using its product. I’ve tested hot-water bottles before, as well asheated throws and electric blankets, and I like to think of myself as an expert in keeping cosy during the winter months.How I testedView image in fullscreenAn infrared thermometer measured the surface temperature of the hot-water bottles at time intervals.Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianTesting hot-water bottles was a balance between cuddling and geeking out. I tested more than 20, pitting them against one another on how easy they were to fill or warm, how long they stayed warm, and how protective their cover was.I used an infrared thermometer to measure the surface of the hot-water bottle when it had been freshly made, then set a timer for 30 minutes to check the temperature again. I lined them up next to me, constantly rubbing their little tummies, then made a note of when they no longer felt warm to the touch.Geeky part out of the way, I also snuggled up with each one. I’ll level with you – when I started this article, we were in the middle of a heatwave, so I waited for cooler weather before I did too much comfort testing. I looked at how soft the covers were, and I wore any hot-water bottles that were designed to be worn for a full session; I wanted to eliminate any itchy ones. Although we’ve noted the full capacity on each, you should really only fill them three-quarters full.After testing was completed, any hot-water bottles that weren’t collected by their brands were donated toRefugease, a charity that provides emergency aid and long-term support for displaced people.The best hot-water bottles in 2026View image in fullscreenCan you feel the heat?

It’s like autumn sunshine, and makes it feel more cosy. It’s a simple design: an open funnel end, with a wide collar to make it easy to fill; there’s no need to awkwardly shove the bottle back in a cover.Why we love itThis hot-water bottle is gorgeously tactile – I couldn’t help but keep stroking the satisfying waffle as I cuddled it. The cover is made from cotton, and the wadding inside is made from 50% bamboo and 50% cotton.Both are breathable fabrics that will stop you feeling sweaty, and the bamboo is great at insulating. During testing, it took well over an hour to drop even 1C from the original temperature. Bamboo is a more sustainable option than many synthetic fibres.It’s a shame that…when you add the cost of shipping, this hot-water bottle gets a tad expensive.Capacity:2lRemovable cover:yesMachine washable:yes (delicate wash)Stayed warm for:2hrs 30minsCosyPandaMajestic mustard waffle hot-water bottlefrom£35£38.50 at Etsy£35 at AmazonWhat we loveCosy with long-lasting heatWhat we don’t loveShipping isn’t included, and it can get priceyBest budget:Argos hot-water bottle with chunky knit coverArgosHot-water bottle with chunky knit cover£10.50£10.50 at ArgosWhat we loveIncredible value without feeling cheapWhat we don’t loveThere’s only one colourPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The Guardian£10.50 at ArgosDressed in a little winter jumper of its own, this Argos hot-water bottle looks as cosy as can be.

I did a thorough check for frayed edges and pulled threads – it passed – and the washable cover didn’t feel scratchy or irritating to hug.It’s also a crowd pleaser – it’s inoffensive and fairly bog standard, so will suit anyone who wants a traditional hot-water bottle. The bottle inside is made from natural rubber, which is naturally insulating and will stay warmer than its synthetic counterparts. It reached 47C pretty quickly – one of the hottest I tested.

Although it comes in different covers, this fleecy one feels particularly snuggly for days when you need extra comfort. The fleece is as soft as a kitten, with no exposed stitching that irritates.The long body and robust strap mean you can tie it around your stomach, back or neck to make it wearable and hands-free. Or you can cuddle it flat for a fuller-length warming effect in bed. As well as using it for heat, you can freeze these water bottles and insert them in the cover to use for cold relief – a brilliant life hack in a heatwave.Why we love itThe fleece is so soft and strokable, and despite being made from synthetic fibres, it didn’t ever feel sweaty. A wide opening made it easy to fill, and a drawstring means you can tuck away the top afterwards. The fabric is thick enough to be warming without feeling alarmingly hot on the skin – and it got up to 47C when first filled.The well-made cover has a lining inside that does a good job of retaining the heat. The strap was well made and extra long, meaning most people could tie it around their stomachs without running out of flex. Another big tick for me is that the bottle is made from biodegradable natural rubber that’s sustainably sourced. Yuyu also offers two-year warranties on its bottles.It kept its temperature well – after 30 minutes it was 48C (presumably my body heat had actually warmed it up a degree), but it cooled rapidly – and had mostly cooled totally down (25C) around the 90-minute mark.It’s a shame that…it didn’t stay warm for longer.Capacity:1lRemovable cover:yesMachine washable:yes, at 30CStayed warm for:1hr 30minsYuyuLong hot-water bottle with luxury fleece cover£38£38 at YuyuWhat we loveLovely, strokeable cover with a flexible long bodyWhat we don’t loveIt cools down quite quicklyBest microwaveable hot-water bottle:Warmies highland cowWarmiesHighland cowfrom£19.99£19.99 at Superdrug£24.99 at DebenhamsWhat we loveAdorable design with a lovely aromaWhat we don’t loveIt’s more of a warm bottle than a hot onePhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The Guardian£19.99 at Superdrug£24.99 at DebenhamsHot-water bottles in the shape of highland cows are popular. Who knew there was such demand for bovines involved in keeping us warm? This cute little fella goes in the microwave and is filled with specially treated millet and French lavender, which gently warms when given a spin.Why we love itDespite not being a particular fan of highland cows (although I have no particular beef with them), it’s hard to deny how cute this is. The fur is soft, and the millet in the belly makes it pleasingly squeezable. Indeed, Warmies says its products are weighted for extra comfort, and it did feel calming to lie with it on top of me.I’m a huge fan of lavender, so I loved the aroma of this product – much better than the usual whiff of rubber. It was easy to warm: just stick it in the microwave for between 45 and 90 seconds, depending on your microwave, following the instructions on the sewn-in label. The cow then comes out warm without being hot – he was 33C after 60 seconds in my microwave. It did increase to about 35C after a minute or two out of the microwave, which is a much gentler heat than some others on this list.Now for the safety bit. When using a microwave hottie, always follow the heating timing and wattage instructions to the letter, being careful not to overheat, as this can be a fire risk. You should also store them in a cool, dry place. This model complies with BS 8433:2004 and European Toy Safety Standard EN71-1/2/3.It’s a shame that …it didn’t get slightly hotter, or stay hotter for longer.Capacity:not applicableRemovable cover:noMachine washable:noStayed warm for:45minsWarmiesHighland cowfrom£19.99£19.99 at Superdrug£24.99 at DebenhamsWhat we loveAdorable design with a lovely aromaWhat we don’t loveIt’s more of a warm bottle than a hot oneBest hot-water bottle for kids:Disney Stitch winter warmersDisneyStitch winter warmers£7£7 at AsdaWhat we loveA design that children will fight overWhat we don’t loveThe fleece could be thicker, as it gets hotter than somePhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The Guardian£7 at AsdaBang on trend (thanks to 2025’s live-action Lilo & Stitch), this Stitch hot-water bottle made my kids squeal with delight. With cute floppy ears and a cosy, fleecy body, it’s immediately recognisable to those in the know. This one is slightly smaller than the traditional size, which works well for kids.Why we love itIt was a huge hit with my young children. They argued over who got to use it – nothing is impervious to sibling rivalry when you’re under 10 years old.Stitch heated up well, reaching 44C, and faster than many others on this roundup. My mini testers loved the floppy ears and fur you can stroke, snuggling up to him during family movie nights. As a boring parent, I was more concerned with filling Stitch’s innards. The bottleopening is large enough to safely fill (for an adult) and the envelope cover opens and closes with Velcro, so the whole water bottle is tucked away during use to help reduce the risk of burns.It’s a shame that…the fleece isn’t slightly thicker, or the cover lined. This means our friend Stitch is hotter than many hot-water bottles. With that in mind, it’s always sensible to be extra vigilant with children using hot-water bottles and followsafety adviceto the letter (such as never leaving them unattended with the bottle).Capacity:600mlRemovable cover:yesMachine washable:noStayed warm for:2hrs 20minsDisneyStitch winter warmers£7£7 at AsdaWhat we loveA design that children will fight overWhat we don’t loveThe fleece could be thicker, as it gets hotter than someThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Looks like it might feel like a big hug’: the Caroline Gardner merino hot-water bottleWuka wearable hot-water bottleWukaWearable hot-water bottlefrom£24.99£24.99 at Bodykind£29.99 at WukaWhat we loveVersatile design for targeted heatingWhat we don’t loveThe tie strap could be a little longerPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The Guardian£24.99 at Bodykind£29.99 at WukaBestfor:your neckI suffer from occasional neck and shoulder pain, so I know there’s something soothing about applying heat to the area.

Plug in the cushion (there’s a discreet little input on the back of the label) and it charges an onboard battery. You then click the “on” button on the label, and it quickly comes up to temperature. There are three levels of heat you can choose from – the hottest got to 38C.I liked that you could control the temperature, and it would maintain that heat level throughout use. There’s about eight hours of battery life in the Heaty, but the hotter you have it, the more quickly it will burn through the charge. Still, it lasts much longer than a traditional hot-water bottle, and it’s reassuringly safe to use.

Check for the BS 1970:2012 safety mark (for traditional bottles) or BS 8433:2004(for microwavable warmers).This ensures the hot-water bottle meets strict British safety standards.Heat retention is important. During testing, I found that it’s more than a little disappointing when a hottie becomes a not-hottie within an hour. Thicker walls on the bottle and padded or lined covers will help lock in heat. A ribbed or textured surface on the bottle diffuses warmth gently and helps prevent burns.A comfortable cover is also desirable. Something that feels soft and cosy, but that won’t get all sweaty, is ideal. Moisture-wicking fibres, such as bamboo or wool, are great. Look out for washable covers so you can keep your hottie in good nick year after year (but you should replace the actual bottle every two years – more on that below).How long do hot-water bottles last?If you look after your hot-water bottle well – completely drying it out between uses and storing it in a cool, dark place – then most should last about two years. After this, the rubber or plastic could crack or leak. This degradation isn’t a definite, butaccident-prevention charitiesrecommend replacing hotties after two years. Look out for signs of wear and tear, such as cracks or splits, or hardened rubber, and always check that the stopper fits neatly before filling it.If you’re not surehow old your hottie is, all hot-water bottles in the UK should have a flower marking on them. The number in the middle of the flower is the year it was made; the number of “petals” with dots inside tells you the month; and the number of dots indicates which week. So if it’s 25 and there’s one petal with two dots inside, the bottle was made in the second week of January 2025.Could they just print the date on the water bottle? Sure, but where’s the fun in that?What’s the safest way to fill and use a hot-water bottle?Hold your hot-water bottle upright, holding it under the collar of the neck. Let boiled water cool for five minutes before pouring it into your hot-water bottle, and only fill it up to two-thirds full. Carefully let the air out before firmly screwing the stopper on.You should never sit on a hot-water bottle, nor use one without a cover. If you notice itchy skin or a net-like patterned rash when using a hot-water bottle, you may have “toasted skin syndrome”, AKAerythema ab igne. This can happen when you’re close to a heat source for too long. As soon as you notice these symptoms, remove the hot-water bottle and cool the area with running water.There’s nothing to stop you from using a hot-water bottle during pregnancy, but you may want to avoid putting it directly on your bump.For more ways to keep toasty for less, read the Filter’s guides on thebest electric blanketsandthe best electric heatersZoë Phillimore is a journalist and product-testing geek.

Burke and Collier, both then senior lecturers at St George’s, decided to blow the whistle. They publisheda paperthat led to aCommission for Racial Equality inquiry, and wholesale changes to the admission policies at medical schools across the capital. Burke knew the risk the pair were taking,saying it was“as though one had offended against the whole system; we were blamed, unfairly treated and made to feel that we were outcasts”.As thefirst Black consultant psychiatrist in the UK, Burke, who has died aged 82 of prostate cancer, was at the forefront of challenging mental health systems to treat Black people with fairness, and of supporting those caught up in the criminal justice system. The most notable case he worked on was that of the Rastafarian Stephen Thompson who, in 1980, was sectioned in Rampton secure hospital in Nottinghamshire because he violently resisted prison officers cutting off his locks, ignoring the religious significance of his hair. Burke was one of the independent psychiatrists who intervened, and he managed to have Thompson released after what he humbly called a process of “negotiation”.View image in fullscreenBurke as a young manAlready engaged in community activism, Burke was on the ground in the aftermath of the New Cross house fire in January 1981 that claimed the lives of 14 Black teenagers (13 on the night, and a survivor who later took his own life). Dubbed by many as theNew Cross massacre, it was one of the pivotal events in Black British history. The silence of politicians and the press in response to the tragedy sparked a mass protest movement including aBlack People’s Day of Actionthat saw about 20,000 people marching through London and the slogan “thirteen dead, nothing said”. Burke helped to set up a group for survivors and the community to process the pain and grief. He supported the survivors through both of the inquests (1981 and 2004), and as late as 2022 was still working with young people in the area.View image in fullscreenThe Black People’s Day of Action in London in March 1981, following the New Cross fire in January of that year. Burke continued to support survivors and their families into the 2020s.Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianBorn in St Elizabeth parish, Jamaica, Aggrey was the son of Edmund Burke, a senior civil servant who was sent to Britain in 1958 to ease tensions in the aftermath of the Notting Hill race riots, and Pansy (nee Balfour), a teacher. Along with Pansy and three of his five siblings, Aggrey, then aged 16, joined his father the following year, and they lived as one of the few Black families in Kew, west London. In Jamaica he had attended a number of government-run schools before winning a scholarship to the prestigious boys’ boarding school Jamaica College. His sister Marilia said that Burke “became aware of another world” at the school, which aimed to develop future leaders. This was in stark contrast to his schooling in the UK, at Shene grammar, where he felt that he was always on the outside and “could never feel part of the thing”.In 1962, Burke enrolled at the University of Birmingham medical school. He found respite from the predominantly white university campus by volunteering for the Harambee Organisation in the Handsworth area of the city, which then had one of the largest Jamaican populations in the country. Burke helped at the organisation’s “supplementary school” that aimed to give Black children the education that mainstream schools were failing to provide.During his studies Burke visited his parents in Ethiopia, who had moved there while his father was working for the UN, and visitedShashamane, the village set up for Rastafarians by Emperor Haile Selassie. After graduating from Birmingham in 1968, Burke completed his psychiatric training at the University of the West Indies in both Jamaica and Trinidad. By 1971 he was a registrar at the university hospital in Mona, Kingston, as well as teaching at the university. He returned to Birmingham University in 1972 for a research fellowship, before being appointed senior lecturer in psychiatry at St George’s hospital in 1976, progressing to consultant psychiatrist. No further promotion came before his retirement there, a fact that Burke felt was linked to his whistleblowing activities. Nevertheless, despite not receiving the formal title, he was affectionately referred to by many as the “people’s professor”. In2024, Birmingham awarded him an honorary doctorate.His commitment to the Black community continued throughout his life. In 1991 he was a co-founder and vice-chair of theGeorge Padmore Institute, an archive above Britain’s oldest Black bookshop,New BeaconBooks, in Finsbury Park, north London, and remained an active trustee until his death.He published countless articles on Black mental health and was a source of support and inspiration for those trying to break into and survive in the field. In 2019 Burke was honoured as one of the100 Great Black Britons, a list created to celebratehigh-achieving Black individualsover the past 400 years. The following year the Royal College of Psychiatrists presented Burke with its President’s medal, and in 2023 created theAggrey Burke fellowship for Black medical students.Marilia survives him, as do three nephews and two nieces.Aggrey Washington Burke, psychiatrist and academic, born 13 May 1943; died 21 December 2025Explore more on these topicsPsychiatryRaceobituariesShareReuse this content"

In the almost 13 years since Sir Alex Ferguson left, the club have struggled to find stability, with his shadow stretching down from the directors’ box to the dugout, emphasised by the stand named in his honour staring back.Manchester City arrive at Old Trafford on Saturday in the opposite position, having had Pep Guardiola in post for a decade, amassing 18 major trophies.Michael Carrick will take charge of Unitedfor the first time since being appointed until the end of the season at a club who appear to be without a functioning long-term plan. This will be a campaign of only 40 competitive games for United, their fewest since 1914-15, with some fans thankful for being able to cut down on trudging visits. So is this, in the post-Ferguson era, the lowest of the lows?Ratcliffe and Glazer family visit Manchester United training ground to support CarrickRead more“We’ve hit more rock bottoms and broken more unwanted records in the past few years than I’d care to remember, but I wouldn’t say this is the lowest point since Sir Alex retired,” says Rick Redman, a season-ticket holder. “That was the7-0 at Anfield, even though we finished above Liverpool that season. You could argue it was finishing 15th in the league andlosing a European final to a Spurs sidewho had already beaten us three times that same season. This shows the overall problem. There are too many to choose from.”Speak to United fans and the nadir varies from seat to seat. There is plenty to suit individual taste, including humbling defeats by Liverpool and City, missing European nights, a tedious style or entire managerial spells.Nostalgia lingers at Old Trafford, especially because celebrations have been in short supply. This is thesecond short-term managerial spell Carrickhas been thrust into. In times of crisis, the plan is often to find someone who knows the club, with talk of its DNA. Ryan Giggs,Ole Gunnar Solskjærand Ruud van Nistelrooy had their stints, and Darren Fletcher was in charge for the past two games. All sought the advice of Ferguson, ensuring a direct link between the old and the new in an attempt to go back to the future, but contemplating repeating those successes is preposterous. Instead, a realignment of ambitions has taken over the stands, if not the boardroom.Ferguson oversaw an aeon, whereas the successors have barely found time to fill a chapter. Thenine-month reign of David Moyesto start life post-Ferguson was a sign of things to come. It was never going to be easy to replace a legend but little has gone well.Louis van Gaal,José MourinhoandErik ten Hagran tight ships but they came with a shelf life.View image in fullscreenCan Michael Carrick and his assistant Jonathan Woodgate drive Manchester United to some kind of success in the rest of this season?Photograph: Martin Rickett/PANo one has survived three years in the role. Solskjær lasted longest, taking charge of 168 games, and finished second in the Premier League but won no silverware and lost five of his final seven league games. The Norwegian brought back Cristiano Ronaldo to amplify the feeling of days gone by, only for his return to be rememberedfor its explosive ending.James Starr, a lifelong fan, says: “Strangely, my lowest moment in recent history was either [Ralf]Rangnick’s tenure, which was defined by a dire run of results, or the second half of last season under [Ruben] Amorim. I don’t thinkAmorim should have been sacked; he had got rid of the deadwood and was starting to make small progress with this team. Another good summer of signings of the ilk of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and I think we’d have been around the Champions League spots again comfortably next season.”Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s investment was supposed to hail a new era but that optimism is diminishing, with the Glazers still at his side.Ratcliffe claimed Amorim required three yearsto prove his mettle as an elite Premier League coach but the Portuguese was gone within months of the co-owner’s comments. The chief executive,Omar Berrada, and director of football, Jason Wilcox, have come under scrutiny and lacked an obvious succession plan after Amorim’s demise. The suits have plenty to prove after numerous missteps.View image in fullscreenOle Gunnar Solskjær is one of many former Manchester United players brought back to guide the team as a caretaker manager. He assumed the permanent role but still ended up being sacked.Photograph: John Walton/PAStarr says: “It is difficult to have faith in the hierarchy when you look at the key decisions they’ve made so far: keeping Ten Hag after the FA Cup win just to sack him a few months later,hiring and firing Dan Ashworth, neglecting our glaringly lacking midfield, and now backing Amorim then firing him seemingly without a long-term plan B.”For all the faults in Amorim’s 14-month tenure, he left United in a promising position in the Premier League: seventh, three points off fourth. There is a clear opportunity to challenge for Champions League qualification with no distractions. Europe’s most lucrative competition has not visited this part of town for two years and the drop in revenue is critical for a club marketed as the biggest in the world butunable to get past Grimsby of League Two.With three wins in their past 13 matches there is an immediate problem facing Carrick in front of an apathetic crowd. A derby against bitter rivals could galvanise the fanbase or sink the mood to new depths. “I can’t see the derby being anything other than a thrashing,” says Starr. United’sFA Cup final victory over City in 2024kept Ten Hag in his job and offered hope but instability continued. Carrick is here to bring positivity as someone who won five Premier League titles at Old Trafford as a player.Redman says: “We have to look at this season – as shambolic as it is by traditional United standards – as slow progress in terms of the league. Some of the embarrassing defeats we’ve suffered have at least been through fine margins, or referees implementing the rules differently against us. Those are excuses we shouldn’t be making, and it’s depressing that we’ve seen off yet another manager.”Quick GuideNow for manager No 6.

Paul Pogba returned for £100m and Antony, Jadon Sancho and Romelu Lukaku each cost more than £70m but repaid very little of it before leaving. The ineptitude has been compounded by academy players being sold to make way for incomings, with Scott McTominay, Anthony Elanga and Dean Henderson going on to thrive outside the United bubble. The latest summer recruits – Cunha, Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens – have offered hope of evolution but nothing akin to a revolution.Carrick’s return marks the 12th permanent or temporary appointment since Ferguson’s retirement. Five trophies have been collected: two FA Cups, two League Cups and a Europa League. Under Ferguson, United never ended outside the top three in the Premier League but the past 13 years have brought eight seasons where they have finished fourth or below, culminating in coming 15th last May.“I keep thinking back toRalf Rangnick’s ‘open heart surgery’ comments, having analysed and explained the multitude of issues at the club,” Redman says. “His words still very much apply four years on. With the Glazers still being in power it’s more like we’ve had a pacemaker fitted, at best.” Another health check will be administered by Manchester City on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMichael CarrickfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In October 2024 Bencic had plummeted to a lowly spot as world No 1,213 when she stepped back on to court feeling secure that baby Bella was being looked after by her husband, Martin Hromkovic – who is also her strength and conditioning coach.On 11 January, 14 months since her comeback began,Bencic played Iga Swiatek in the final of the United Cup in Sydney. The world No 2, and current Wimbledon champion, won the first set but Bencic played supreme tennis as she swept Swiatek aside 6-0, 6-3 in the next two sets to seal her ninth consecutive victory of the week for Switzerland. Her imperious performance also meant that Bencic was back in the world top 10 again.Katie Boulter hires Sharapova’s former coach to revive career after dismal 2025Read moreOf course Bencic has been a fine player for many years. She won theOlympic singles titlein 2021 and has been ranked as high as world No 4, in early 2020, but the odds are always stacked against a mother trying to make a sustained impact on the gruelling WTA tour. The schedule is relentless, the demands of travel are challenging and the matches have become even more intensely physical and psychologically draining. But the friendly and intelligent 28-year-old has conjured up one of the great sporting stories of the last year with remarkable conviction.Bencic pauses when I ask her to explain why she believes her tennis has improved since she became a mother. “It’s difficult to say why but I’m definitely very focused on trying to make my game better. I’m also pushed to do this because everyone else is getting better too.Tennisis moving forwards and it’s getting more physical and just faster. But I also think my mindset is different. I’m focusing more on the process and not so much on the results – which is funny because the results are coming as well. Most of all, in the comeback, we really worked hard on my physical fitness and with my movement on the court. That has really made my game better.”She is also bolstered by the fact that Bella doesn’t care whether a tennis match has been won or lost. The little girl is just happy to see her mum when she comes off court. “It’s very true,” Bencic says with her familiar laugh. “I still try to win so much and I really put my heart into playing well and getting the goal. But then, if that doesn’t happen, my world doesn’t crash. I am able to leave everything else on the court and have a life without being measured by results.”View image in fullscreenBelinda Bencic at the United Cup, where she won nine matches in succession, in singles and doubles.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesDid Bencic always believe she could make a successful return? “Yes, for sure. I’ve done it many times and come back from injury. I was very positive that I could do it again and I feel like once you reach the top 20, top 10, multiple times, then you can always do it. That gives you belief and it definitely helped with everything.”She explains that “I didn’t really play in pregnancy. I didn’t really feel like it and I was a little bit scared, maybe. I was basically just enjoying my time off. After being three months pregnant I didn’t hit any more. And then I hit my first ball after three months postpartum. I took it really easy at first on a small court where I was just feeling the ball and then working more on fitness. I then built that up step by step.”Bencic and her team also made a crucial choice in deciding to return to competitive play in small Challenger events away from the main WTA tour. “Absolutely,” she says. “That’s what made me most comfortable because it’s really arrogant to think that you can just stop playing and then, right after pregnancy, get straight back to the level you’d been before. It doesn’t work that way. I don’t want to go to [WTA] tournaments and keep losing in the first round and then not have enough matchplay or enough confidence. It’s much better to start in smaller tournaments, just to test myself out, and see the level.“I was still breastfeeding in the first four tournaments I played and we had to figure out the schedule with Bella. How are we going to make this work? We didn’t really want to throw ourselves into the highest level of competing before trying these things out.It was a very different challenge as you’re feeling tired and you also feel you’re playing with a different body. And you have to work out all the timings. I once had to play three sets and I was stressed about having to let go of the milk and also that Bella was getting hungry.“But for me it was always most important not to sacrifice anything that Bella needed. She was always first in my priorities. If it hadn’t worked out I wouldn’t have done it – but we found a good schedule.”‘It’s a long and difficult dream’: João Fonseca on practice, patience and matching Sinner and AlcarazRead moreBella is with her parents in Melbourne but Bencic is emphatic when I ask if she has a big support team helping her prepare for the first grand slam of the year. “Actually, no, we don’t have anyone here. It’s just Martin looking after her and we have my coach [Iain Hughes] as well. So we’re travelling with just the three and a half of us at the moment. We really don’t want to take a nanny because we want to keep her close to us. We want Bella to grow up with us and not with anyone else. So that’s all good but it’s challenging – especially for Martin. But he is such a great father and he’s with her 24/7. He’s also working with me and so we take Bella to the gym with us. We somehow manage it. But we don’t really have a plan – we just do it day by day and we’re kind of winging it.”Bencic laughs again before explaining that whenshe faces Katie Boulter, in the first round on Monday: “Martin and Bella will come on site with me. We will do the warm-up together but then he will stay with her in the players’ area or the restaurant while I go out to play. If she’s sleeping then he can watch a little of my match.”View image in fullscreenBencic, with the Switzerland team, after winning the quarter-final against Argentina at the United Cup in Perth.Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesHas Bencic had time to absorb the significance of her dizzying climb up the rankings? “I didn’t have so much time yet to let that sink in and, to be honest, I don’t really want to focus on it right now. My main focus is theAustralian Openbut, once that’s over, we can take time to just say: ‘Well done – one year back and we made it to the top 10.’ Even last year, when I finished 2025 as No 11 in the world, I was emotional and proud.”She adds: “At the start you cannot really expect it to happen because it’s such a long way back. You wonder: ‘Hmm, can I really get to that level? How long is it going to take me?’ There are a lot of questions but it’s important not to focus so much on the long term. I had no expectations and I wasn’t putting myself under pressure in the timeline of my comeback. I just really enjoyed it and lived in the moment. And then when I started to play in the first couple of tournaments I realised that I still have the level to come back. But I was thinking about playing grand slams and maybe making the top 100, top 50. I didn’t know that it’s going to be a top 10 comeback. So it’s definitely also been a surprise to us.”Bencic played well in a series of taxing matchesat Wimbledon last summerand she reached the semi-finals – whereSwiatek beat her easily 6-2, 6-0. Memories of that defeat made victory over Swiatek last Sunday all the sweeter. “It was a big win for me,” she says happily, “because at Wimbledon she completely killed me. I really tried to find another way to beat her in Wuhan [in October] and I got a bit closer. She won 7-6, 6-4. And then last week I tried another different approach. I’m really glad that worked out and I’m able to challenge myself against her because Iga’s a really amazing champion.”View image in fullscreenBencic celebrates reaching the semi-finals after beating Mirra Andreeva at Wimbledon 2025.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBencic is on such a hot streak of form that some pundits have suggested she is a real contender at the Australian Open. Does she harbour similar hopes? “Yes, for sure. But it’s funny. Before every grand slam the media and tennis experts always talk about who has a shot and who doesn’t. And at the end it’s all different because you have to win seven matches in a row. You have to be completely sharp from the start and sometimes you can be in the best form of your life and then you play a match and your opponent is just better on that day. So I’m really cautious with predictions. Obviously, I can play great tennis and I’m on the same level with the top players. So that gives me a lot of confidence. But I really just want to focus on the first round and try to work myself into the tournament and keep winning.”After all she has achieved over the last year, as a restored top-10 player and such a fulfilled and happy mother, Bencic allows herself, just briefly, to look even higher. “Well, you know,” she says, almost shyly, “my dream of winning a grand slam still continues. So yes, I’m going to try to do that, with everything I have. We’ll see if it works out. I hope it does, and I do believe I can do it.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

There was never the slightest doubt his wish would be granted asBatheased to a comprehensive nine-try victory that guarantees pool winner status plus a home draw in the last 16 and, potentially, beyond.On this occasion Russell also had the luxury of an armchair ride behind a Bath pack who took an early grip on the contest and never let go. Even if Edinburgh had turned up in north-east Somerset with their best side, as opposed to resting a few senior men, they would have been hard pressed to put too many dents in the black-shirted tanks and electric sprinters parked up opposite.‘I was knocked for six’: Zander Fagerson on his Lions injury despair and Glasgow’s European questRead moreThere will be sterner tests ahead against stronger opposition but, first and foremost, there was no disputing the unflinching mood of Bath’s tight forwards or their forceful No 8 Alfie Barbeary. All three of the hosts’ starting front row registered tries from a collective range of about four metres and a close-quarters penalty try also summed up their hard-nosed modus operandi in the first half. Those who had paid to watch Russell run through his extensive range of tricks mostly had to wait until the final quarter for Bath to cut loose and allow their quality backs like Max Ojomoh and Henry Arundell to show their class.Bath’s head coach Johann van Graan is not a fan of the theory that his side have been playing less flowing and ambitious rugby since their former attack coach Lee Blackett left to join England at the start of the season. As long as his side keep winning it is not a significant problem and this was another of those nights when Bath’s forward power was unanswerable.Two tries within four minutes in the first quarter set the heavy metal tone, Thomas du Toit nabbing the first following a tapped penalty before a penalty try robbed Barbeary of the individual glory he thought he had claimed moments earlier. The No 8 looks fitter and more purposeful this season, both of which will be prerequisites if he is to give the England management a successful nudge.View image in fullscreenProp Beno Obano dives over for his try. All three of Bath’s prolific front row scored in the first half.Photograph: Manuel Blondeau/INPHO/ShutterstockEdinburgh were game but, aside from an early penalty from Ross Thompson, they were not frequent visitors to the Bath 22. It did not help when their Scottish international hooker Ewan Ashman departed injured inside the first half hour, robbing them of a gnarled campaigner with plenty of experience of playing in England.To nobody’s surprise it was the signal for Bath to start turning the screw. From another good close-range position there was no stopping Beno Obano from crashing over and, at 21-3, it was already case of damage limitation for the visitors. Who needs to attack endlessly out wide when the gate through the middle is proving so effective?That said, a balanced game will be required when the bigger knockout games come around. Bath, from that perspective, really should have had a fourth try when Ojomoh opted to go it alone rather than using Ben Spencer on his outside and were soon cursing their profligacy. A snaking break from the athletic Harry Paterson put Ben Vellacott into space at the other end and a smart angled line from Piers O’Conor earned Edinburgh a lovely try.It was just a temporary blip as Bath swiftly restored order in now familiar fashion. The visitors did their collective best to repel the onrushing waves on their own try-line but there was an inevitability to the eventual score by Tom Dunn, clearly keen to join his fellow front-rowers on to the scoresheet.The only question was whether Bath might look to widen their focus slightly more in the second half. They clearly have the players to do so and England’s coaches will have enjoyed the sight of Ojomoh throwing a sweet left-to-right pass out to Joe Cokanasiga, who spun out of the tackle for a cracking score.Cokanasiga, who finished with a brace of tries, also set up Bath’s sixth try, thundering through the middle before sending his skipper Spencer over untouched. The rest was a blur of one-way traffic by a home side who have the artillery to go much further this season if their key men can stay fit.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupBathEdinburgh RugbyRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Oliver Glasner, having confirmed that the captain Marc Guéhi’s move to Manchester City is poised to go ahead, had another bombshell prepared for his press conference to preview Saturday’s trip to Sunderland.Nearly eight months to the day since the Austrian led the club to their first major trophy bybeating Manchester City in the FA Cup final, his announcement thathe will leave Selhurst Park at the end of the seasoncame as no surprise. It rounds off one of the worst weeks in the club’s history after thehumiliating defeat by non-league Macclesfieldthat will be for ever an unwanted postscript to their victory.Oliver Glasner confirms he will leave Crystal Palace role in summerRead moreThe writing has been on the wall since Glasner revealed at the end of August deep frustration at Palace’s failure to reinvest the record £67.5m fee received from Arsenal for Eberechi Eze – the man who scored the winning goal against City – as they embarked on their debut campaign in Europe. Two days after their triumph at Wembley, and with the club yet to become embroiled in the dispute with Uefa over breaking its regulations on multi-club ownership that led to their demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League, the manager urged Palacenot to become “one-hit wonders”and insisted he was “100% here”.But Glasner, who clashed with the directors at Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt over transfers, has always worn his heart on his sleeve and could not hold back with his criticism of Palace’s lack of activity despite the last-minute decision not to sellGuéhi to Liverpool in the final hours of the summer window.A key figure at Palace had predicted a few weeks earlier that Guéhi’s future would be closely connected to the manager’s given that their contracts expired this summer. Glasner is understood to have been instrumental in the decision to keep Guéhi for the first half of the season when the defender appeared poised to move to Anfield. But with City desperate for defensive reinforcements after injuries to Josko Gvardiol and Rúben Dias, the chair, Steve Parish,accepted a fee of £20m– a £15m loss compared with what Liverpool had been prepared to pay five months ago.View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner led Crystal Palace to the first trophy in their history, with the win over Manchester City in the FA Cup final last summer.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APWith Guéhi on his way, Glasner could not keep his secret any longer. He revealed he had informed Parish in October of his desire to pursue a new challenge, when Palace had just set a club record of 19 matches unbeaten stretching back to the previous season. Glasner, who has expressed his ambition to manage a club in the Champions League again after reaching the last 16 with Eintracht in 2023, had been in favour of coming clean last month to avoid speculation that his departure was down to lack of investment in the squad.“I spoke with Steve, I wanted to maybe announce it before the transfer window because of these rumours about my decision being influenced, but we decided it wasn’t the best moment,” he said.Whether announcing he is leaving after a run of nine games without a win that has led to Palace plummeting down the table proves to be a better idea remains to be seen. Glasner said he hoped it could inspire a “turnaround” in fortune but replacing a player of Guéhi’s quality will be no easy task in a squad lacking confidence and resources.There are also doubts over the futures of several of the FA Cup winning side. The France striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has 18 months left on his contract and is wanted by Juventus, and Adam Wharton, Daniel Muñoz and Daichi Kamada are also coveted by bigger clubs. The Japan midfielder, who – like Muñoz – has been badly missed in recent weeks owing to injury, played for Glasner at Eintracht and is out of contract in the summer.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi was bound for Liverpool in the summer only for his transfer to fall through at the last minute.Photograph: Simon Dael/ShutterstockThe most important decision Palace must take is appointing their next manager. They have looked at Getafe’s José Bordalás and Iñigo Pérez of Rayo Vallecano as potential successors, although Parish is understood to have pushed for Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna before appointing Glasner to replace Roy Hodgson nearly two years ago and may try again. Brendan Rodgers could also be a contender despite taking over at the Saudi Arabian side Al-Qadsiah last month.None are likely to be as demanding as Glasner, although his track record in south London has confirmed he gets results. Palace became distracted bytheir battle with Uefa, and the arrival of the American billionaire Woody Johnson to replace John Textor as the biggest shareholder proved too late to supply the firepower needed to sustain a European campaign and satisfy their ambitious manager, whose exit was bizarrely not mentioned on Palace’s website on Friday.All roads could lead to Manchester United for Glasner, even if his most recent trip up the M6 was one he willnever be able to forget for all the wrong reasons. But after making history at Palace, he will relish the opportunity to test himself at Old Trafford or elsewhere.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceanalysisShareReuse this content"

Because during his darkest hours – and there have beena few of thoseduring a fraught first season at the club – he may also see a vision of his own future.The parallels between the two are clear and they are difficult to ignore as Nuno makes his return to Spurs with West Ham, desperate for a result to help lift the club out of the relegation places. When Nuno went to Spurs in 2021, he did so as a manager who had made his name in English football with Wolves, getting them promoted from the Championship and going on to enjoy success with them in the top division. Ditto Frank with Brentford beforehis move to Spurs last summer.Richarlison injury blow prompts Spurs to seek attacking reinforcementsRead moreNuno started brightly, recording a win against Manchester City. But then, as with Frank, there were dismal defeats against Chelsea and Arsenal, the booing of some of his substitutions and an overall feeling of frustration.Nuno was sackedafter 10 league games, his team having collected 15 points.There are obvious differences. Nuno had Harry Kane and Son Heung-min in their prime. Frank has missed the injured Dejan Kulusevki and James Maddison throughout his tenure and has only just got Dominic Solanke back after a long-term absence. Nuno also arrived at a club that was used to being up in the European qualifying places. Frank, meanwhile, inherited a team that had finished 17th.Nuno was given a two-year contract and there was a short‑term feel around his appointment, the sense that if a ready-made replacement became available – like, say, Antonio Conte – he could be vulnerable. Nuno was a long way down Spurs’s original shortlist and he was appointed after a 72-day search.Frank, by contrast, was the number-one choice. He was hired quickly and given a three-year deal. The talk around him has been of a long-term rebuild, with Spurs restructuring their ownership and making numerous head‑of‑department changes.Nobody likes to talk about transitional seasons in football. They have had to do so at Spurs. Yet there is one further similarity between Frank and Nuno that nags grimly, bringing worry to the Spurs fanbase, polluting the atmosphere, especially at home, where the team have won just twice in the league (only two clubs – West Ham and Wolves – have taken fewer points on their own turf). It concerns the playing style.Nuno brought with him a reputation for pragmatism, prioritising defensive strength, seeking to land his punches mainly on the counter. He was not associated with attractive passing up through the thirds. The same perception tracked Frank from Brentford and he has so far done little to alter it.The Spurs support are not famous for their patience and they will not tolerate a gameplan that lacks pace and excitement, attacking thrust or creativity. Nuno’s failure to provide one was the single biggest factor in his demise. It will do for Frank, as well, unless he can add fresh layers to his approach. What the eyes have seen so far under Frank is a stodginess to the buildup play, a predictability, a lack of options. They have been blunt and the statistics only reinforce things. According to Opta, no team in the league has played fewer through balls than Spurs, while only two have sent over more unsuccessful crosses in open play.View image in fullscreenThe return to fitness of Dominic Solanke (centre) could provide a timely boost to Thomas Frank at Tottenham.Photograph: Alex Morton/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockSpurs are 15th for shots on target; 16th for total shots and touches in the opposition box. An interesting detail is that they have massively outperformed their expected goals number in the league, which stands at 20.5. They have scored 30 times; no team has overdelivered by a greater margin. What happens when Spurs revert to the mean? It is also worth noting they are equal 17th for high turnovers forced and 20th for the number of shots resulting from such situations.Frank is well aware of the data, although he disputed the line about the high turnovers, believing his team are among the best in the division by this metric. He is supplied with incredible minutiae by his analysts. For example, one of them told him recently that Guglielmo Vicario was the goalkeeper with the most clearances with his weaker foot.Frank leans into this, saying during the preparations for West Ham that he was aware his team had made the fewest deep runs in behind opposition defences in the opening months of the season. That has been addressed. “In the last seven or eight games, we have improved this more and more, we are gradually moving up [this list],” says the Dane. “You need to run in behind if you want to score goals.”The bottom line is that Frank is reasonably happy with the defensive improvements he has overseen, together with those on set pieces, and is extremely conscious of the need to be better going forward. Solanke will help when he is fully fit, a proper pressing No 9 who can come short to link the play or run in behind, and thesigning of Conor Gallagherhas lifted the mood.Spurs are 14th, one place lower than they were at this stage last season, albeit three points better off. They have won three of their past 14 league games, they have justgone out of the FA Cup to Aston Villaand, from the outside looking in, it would be easy to think that Frank would be in big trouble if he lost to West Ham. Everybody knows how the Spurs crowd would react to that. But from the inside looking out, there is no sense that Frank is in immediate danger – and not only because nobody is going into the game thinking about a bad result. The hierarchy knows where the club are, the realities.Frank said the arrivals of Gallagher and the new assistant coach, John Heitinga, were “definitely a very good sign” of the backing he has at boardroom level, and he radiated confidence and calm, insisting he has seen positives in the past six matches; a decent half here and there, a greater ability to deal with setbacks, the culture within the squad getting stronger. Nuno’s unloved Spurs tenure, the lack of any connection with the fans, provides a warning. Frank does not need it.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both in the Long, Fast and Clever throw-in. No more comments at the moment.”Arsenal have scored more goals from set-pieces than any other team in Europe’s top-five leagues, with Ben White’s opener against Chelsea on Wednesday night in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final their 24th of the campaign. But while there has been marked increase in the frequency of Premier League goals coming from long throw-ins, with 18 already compared with 20 last season, Arsenal have still yet to score from one and Arteta revealed in December thatDeclan Rice has been working on developing the skill.Arteta refused to elaborate on the decision to hire Grønnemark, only going as far saying he believes he could make the difference as Arsenal seek to be crowned champions for the first time since 2004. “We try to improve every single area,” said Arteta. “Every single margin that we possibly can to be a better team and anybody can help us. We have many experts, many people around trying to help us to become as good as we can.”Statistics published by Opta this week show that the number of long throw-ins per match – defined as a throw that travels 20 metres or more – have risen from 1.52 last season to 3.97. That is more than double the amount of any of the previous 10 campaigns, with Brentford’s Michael Kayode the most prolific having taken exactly 100.Meanwhile, Arteta dismissed reports of a bust-up between Rice and his assistant, Albert Stuivenberg, at half-time of the 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge in midweek, insisting that any issues between them are now “all sorted”.Arsenal’s lead could be cut to three points by Manchester City if they can overcome Manchester United in the lunchtime derby at Old Trafford, with their trip to Nottingham Forest kicking off at tea time. Arteta is optimistic that his side can pick up where they left off against Chelsea. “I think we are building very good momentum and belief comes from performances and the level of consistency that we have shown throughout 32 games already this season and what we did at Stamford Bridge,” he said.“It should help us to be very convinced that we have the ability to do that, but the reality is that you have to show it in every game and there’s still so much to happen, but we are glad that we are still alive in the four competitions.”Ed Aarons2.Moyes needs faltering Barry to step upDavid Moyes has defended Everton’s signing of Thierno Barry but admitted he has needed to take “a bit of a gamble” on some transfers for financial reasons.Barry was signed for £27m from Villarreal last summer after Everton had negotiated down his €40m release clause, but took 17 games to score the first of his three goals for the club and has struggled to make an impact. The 23-year-old also had a weak penalty saved in last weekend’s FA Cup shootout defeat by Sunderland.Moyes was asked whether the striker was signed by Everton’s new football leadership structure – which gives him the final say on transfers – or was a recommendation by the former director of football Kevin Thelwell. The manager replied: “It came from us. We paid £27m and that is not a lot of money for a centre-forward. We didn’t have £50m-£60m to buy a centre forward and we probably couldn’t have got one at that price because those ones wouldn’t have come to the club with us having no European football.“We had to go early and we went for Thierno who had scored 14 or 15 goals in his first year in La Liga [it was 11 goals]. If we had waited until the second year and he had done the same then he probably wouldn’t have come to us or we couldn’t have got him at the cost he would have been. We need him to step up but he’s a first year in the Premier League from overseas so there is a bit of room to give him a wee bit of manoeuvre. Hopefully it will improve.”Everton are looking to sign a striker and have inquired about a loan for Fenerbahce’s Youssef En-Nesyri. The Morocco international has several options.Moyes insists Barry has the attributes to come good for Everton. “He’s got a physicality, he’s good in the air, he can run plenty, he helps us off the ball and his goals last year looked good enough to say that he’s going to continue that. And being young, a French under-21 international, there are a lot of good things about him in terms of potential.“As a manager sometimes these are the decisions you have to take. Some of them are a little bit of a gamble and while we’ve not got the big funds we are probably in a position where we are having to take a bit of a risk with quite a few players.”Andy Hunter3.Dyche seeks striker after Kalimuendo exitSean Dyche is seeking a striker in the transfer window since Nottingham Forest only have Igor Jesus available, with Chris Wood out following knee surgery and Arnaud Kalimuendo joining Eintracht Frankfurt on loan.Dyche said before Saturday’s visit of the league leaders, Arsenal: “The obvious one is the striker area because we are a bit short there. The club felt it was a really good deal for Kalimuendo to go out. We are looking at various options to bring in. That’s the obvious one that jumps off the page. You’ve got to be ready for the shifting sands of the market.“We’ve got to be proactive where we can be and reactive if things change. I think the club are well aware of that. I’ve had a good meeting from the owner all the way through the structure about what we think we’ve got and what we think we need. It’s aligning the right people and getting the deals done, which is often the hardest part – the actual process of getting the deal done and getting the player here.”PA Media4.Silva wary of Calvert-Lewin threatMarco Silva never had any doubts Dominic Calvert-Lewin could cut it in the Premier League. The 28-year-old is enjoying an impressive campaign for Leeds, having scored eight goals in his last nine appearances to help Daniel Farke’s side push themselves clear of the relegation zone. Calvert-Lewin played under Silva at Everton and will come up against his old manager when Leeds host Fulham at Elland Road on Saturday.“It is not the first time he has performed at this level. When you talk about performing, he is a striker who can score in many different ways,” Silva said. “When you look through his career, when he is playing, the numbers are there. Game by game, he is getting better and showing he is a proven Premier League striker.”View image in fullscreenDominic Calvert-Lewin has tallied an impressive eight goals in his last nine appearances for Leeds.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersFulham head to Leeds looking to extend their own impressive six-match unbeaten run in all competitions, but Silva knows just what a tough task that will be against Farke’s rejuvenated team. “It is never easy to play there,” the Fulham manager said. “To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means – the home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition. They have been very strong at home, [but also] achieving results away from home as well. They have the quality, the organisation, the manager and the individual players.”PA Media5.Nuno ‘cannot afford mistakes’ in windowNuno Espírito Santo has told the West Ham outcasts James Ward-Prowse and Callum Wilson to “go and pursue their careers” after being frozen out at the London Stadium. Wilson has not featured in Nuno’s last two squads and the former Newcastle striker is understood to be in the process of cancelling his contract amid links with Celtic and Everton.“We are working on both ins and outs,” said Nuno. “I feel that we need to rebalance our squad, so that means bringing more options to some positions, and finding solutions for the players who are not having so many minutes to go and pursue their careers. We are working very hard as a club to find the right players, in a very tricky transfer window. So, we have to make good decisions, and we cannot afford to make mistakes.”View image in fullscreenJames Ward-Prowse has been frozen out at West Ham.Photograph: Patrick Khachfe/Getty ImagesNuno has already brought in the strikers Taty Castellanos and Pablo Felipe at a combined cost of around £45m. Further evidence that the Portuguese coach is not in any imminent danger of the sack, even if West Ham are plunged deeper into relegation trouble with a defeat at Tottenham on Saturday, came when the club allowed him to appoint the veteran Spaniard Paco Jémez to his coaching staff.“It’s one more person to help us. The coaching staff now has more numbers, which means more ideas and more energy,” said Nuno. “Paco is an experienced coach, and he’ll bring something new to the set-up.”PA Media6.Iraola needs to plug leaky defenceAndoni Iraola admitted Bournemouth’s leaky defence away from home is giving him a headache. Bournemouth visit Brighton on Monday, having conceded 29 goals in 10 matches on their travels this season – the worst record in the Premier League. In their last three top-flight matches away from the Vitality Stadium, the Cherrieshave drawn 4-4 at Manchester Unitedand2-2 at Chelseaeither side ofbeing thrashed 4-1 at Brentford.Iraola said: “It definitely concerns me. We are a team that scores a lot of goals and concedes a lot of goals. If you want to be a very good team you cannot concede the number of goals we are conceding. This is the main reason we have not been able to get the results we want lately because we have been scoring a lot of goals and not getting the results.“It’s very difficult to do the things we do – to go to Chelsea and score two goals or Old Trafford and score four goals and not win. If you score two, three or four goals away, you should get more wins and we are not getting them because we are conceding goals. If we don’t improve this, it’s going to be difficult to get more wins.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talkArsenalFulhamBournemouthWest Ham UnitedNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

His impoverished childhood and the early death of his father forced him to grow up fast while still a teenager. To eat, he had to start working as a child. He was a bricklayer’s assistant, a fruit carrier at the market and a car washer … so many jobs that could have prevented him from becoming the Brazilian to make Premier League history with the most goals in a single season.Igor Thiago has 16 goals in 21 games forBrentford. There are still 17 more matches to go, the first against Chelsea on Saturday, but he has already surpassed such Brazilian luminaries as Roberto Firmino, Matheus Cunha and Gabriel Martinelli, all of whom scored 15 league goals in their most prolific season. How to describe this turnaround in his life? Igor Thiago has an easy explanation. “I would describe it as a lot of hard work. I think that everything God has planned for my life, has given me this year at Brentford, is something I hadn’t experienced yet in my career,” he says.As has been the case at many points throughout his life, the beginning of his time at Brentford was marked by difficulties and challenges. Two knee injuries kept him out for much of last season, to the point that he only played eight games in his first campaign.“I was really upset because I didn’t understand why this was happening to me. I even thought: ‘My God, will I ever be myself again?’ Until this year’s pre-season, I kept thinking: ‘Am I going to come back?’ I felt it a lot. My body had never been through that before.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Igor Thiago scores the first of his two goals past Sunderland’s Robin Roefs this month.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters“But in the end, it was a good thing for me. I also worked on other things. Other weaknesses, too. I had something that was lacking a little, that I might not have had time to work on if I hadn’t had that injury. So I worked harder. That injury taught me a lot.”The period away from the pitch enabled the forward to get closer to his young family and try to fill a void opened up by the death of his father when he was 13, due to problems with alcohol.“I learned to really value my family. To look at life differently, to enjoy football, to enjoy being on the pitch. To play with more love, not to think so much about mistakes. I realised that I had to enjoy my life as a footballer more, enjoy every minute on the pitch, not let the little things frustrate me or take me out of the game mentally. I had to enjoy every moment, both the good and the bad, because they are what make you grow.“I also became a father very young. I had to mature early. So, with the whole period of my father’s loss, life made me understand that I needed to be a man. Being a father is different from having a father. While my father was alive, I had many good memories with him. He was an alcoholic, but he was never an aggressive father. He was always very loving, caring. Because of the loss of my father, I had to grow up mentally. After his death, a lot of things started to be missing. So that pushed me even more to work.”I need to talk about my story. I understand that if I tell my story, I can inspire people around me.And things really started to fall short in Igor Thiago’s life. His mother – widowed with four children to care for – worked as a street cleaner in their home city of Cidade Ocidental, near Brasília, and life was tough for Igor Thiago and his siblings.“I had friends who wanted me to steal with them. They weren’t really friends, of course. They were acquaintances from the street, but they wanted me to use drugs, to follow the wrong path in life.“Many people in my city live a reality similar to or worse than mine at the time. Many people have alcoholic parents, who use drugs, who were abandoned. But I need to talk about my story. I understand that if I tell my story, I can inspire people around me.”Rejected by the biggest clubs in Brazil, Igor Thiago ended up in Verê, a city of 7,000 inhabitants. He was top scorer of the regional league, but what took him to Cruzeiro – in Belo Horizonte, the country’s sixth largest city – was a short video presented to the club’s board.Ricardo Resende, then coach of the under-20s, says: “Our football director, Amarildo, showed me a short video, 30 seconds long, and I liked it. It was beautiful goals, a different profile, he was a very high-quality player. We called him for a trial and in the first training session he made a run that impressed us. There was no way we couldn’t sign him.”Célio Lúcio, a former Cruzeiro player and general technical assistant for the youth teams, adds: “What impressed me most about Thiago was his potential to learn. I saw Ronaldo starting at Cruzeiro. I was a player at the club and saw his arrival in 1993. Ronaldo was a very persistent, hard-working guy. Thiago is similar to him in that sense. Of course, not the technique because Ronaldo is from another world, but Thiago was a talent that needed to be polished and wanted to learn.“I showed him the way and he followed it. He used to arrive 20 minutes before the training and stay another 20 minutes on his own after. He is an example to everyone.”Even with the praise at the club, Igor Thiago did not receive the recognition he deserved. He was sold for about €1m (£860,000) to the Bulgarian champions, Ludogorets, and while it was an important move in the transition to European football, it was to prove another challenging period when he was targeted by racists on social media.View image in fullscreenIgor Thiago at Brentford’s training ground: ‘This World Cup feeling is very exciting. I’m very hopeful about being part of it.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It was difficult, very difficult time in Bulgaria. I had to adapt to a culture that was totally different from what I was used to in Brazil. I had to live a different life, speak a language that wasn’t mine, I had to learn to endure the cold. I suffered a lot of prejudice, too.“There was a game where I scored a winning goal. I had never received a message on Instagram in Bulgaria. Suddenly, I started receiving a lot of private messages saying that I was a monkey, that my children were monkeys. It was an embarrassing situation, but I understood that it wasn’t about me. It didn’t say anything about me. It said more about them, frustrated people, people with problems of their own. I moved on in peace. That’s not going to shake me.”Back-to-back titles in Bulgaria and 21 goals in 55 games attracted the attention of Club Brugge in 2023 before Igor Thiago signed for Brentford in a club record £30m move in February 2024 and he claimed the goals record for a Brazilian in the Premier League after scoring twice in the3-0 defeat of Sunderland. Without forgetting the past, Igor Thiago is preparing to fulfil a childhood dream: to wear the national team shirt of Brazil.“This World Cup feeling is very exciting. I’m very hopeful about being part of it, I’ve always dreamed of playing in a World Cup. It’s something I only saw other people experiencing on television, but now I’m close to experiencing it myself.“God has a purpose in everyone’s life. If it is God’s will and [Carlo] Ancelotti’s will, it will be a pleasure, an honour, to represent my country. It is an indescribable feeling to represent my country, to be able to experience this moment. It will be something I can’t explain. No one from CBF [the Brazilian Football Confederation] has ever contacted me, but I have this expectation.”Despite the arrival of the former Real Madrid coach Ancelotti in May, Brazil are struggling. One of the team’s weaknesses is the No 9 shirt, a position Igor Thiago says he is ready to take on and bring home the trophy for the first time since 2002.“I believe I am ready. The only thing I know how to do in my life is score goals. God has prepared me for this moment, and if he allows me, we will bring the sixth World Cup title to Brazil.”Explore more on these topicsBrentfordBrazilinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The tush push on fourth down that propelled Josh Allen 10 yards andhelped secure Buffalo’s winover Jacksonville last weekend epitomised how the Bills dominated the game’s crucial moments. The Bills converted four of their five third downs with four yards or to go last Sunday, and they finished fifth in third-down rate in the regular season in the same situations. Denver were eighth this season in third-and-short defensive efficiency (50.6%). Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady will have to find ways to create leverage for Allen and the Bills in those vital moments to keep the scoreboard moving.Brilliant, battered and unkillable: Josh Allen lurches towards the Super BowlRead moreWhat the Broncos need to do to win:Copy the Jaguars (except the losing part). If James Cook, this season’s best running back, had been allowed to take off last Sunday, Jacksonville wouldn’t have kept the game so close. Cook’s meagre 46 yards on 15 carries meant the Jags almost pulled off the victory. Buffalo may struggle to establish the ground game even more against the Broncos: they lost their two best run-blocking receivers toACL tears against the Jags, Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers. Not that the Broncos’ rock-solid front needs too much help: they gave away the second-fewest rushing yards per game this season (91). If Allen is forced to throw, Sean Payton’s defense can feast. They have the most sacks and the highest rate of QB takedowns (68 at 9.7%) and allow the second-lowest pass completion rate (57.8%). Former Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib, who won a Super Bowl with Denver, is confident: “They sending Superman home,” he said this week.Key player: Nik Bonitto, edge, Broncos.Bonitto has cemented his status as an elite pass rusher with two brilliant seasons in Denver, earning 13.5 sacks in 2024 and 14 in 2025. He has the power to hustle, harass and help show Allen the door.Prediction:Bills over Broncos.San Francisco 49ers v Seattle Seahawks (Saturday 8pm ET/Sunday 1am GMT)What the 49ers need to do to win:Show no fear. San Francisco rolled into Philadelphia with a litany of injuries and proved that this team are so much more than the sum of their parts. You no longer feel that a key figure such as George Kittle landing on injured reserve with a torn achilles will slow them down. Adversity just keeps knitting them tighter together, so much so that, against the Eagles, journeyman receiver Demarcus Robinson produced his first 100+ receiving yard-game since November 2022. A large part of the 49ers’ fight comes from the ultimate underdog quarterback, Brock Purdy. His never-say-die attitude was crucial as he shook off two interceptions and backed his deep ball over a fierce Eagles secondary. If they bring the same fearless attitude to Seattle they can handle Sam Darnold,who says he will playdespite being listed as questionable with an oblique injury.What the Seahawks need to do to win:With Trent Williams back in at left tackle for the 49ers, the Seahawks will have a fight on their hands after a fairly straightforward 13-3 win over San Francisco in Week 18 of the regular season. A clear path to victory though lies behind punishing the 49ers’ weak run defense. In the Week 18 win, Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet’s combined 171 yards rushing yards were essential to keeping the Seahawks’ offense on the field as they chewed up the clock. The pressure told on Purdy, who had limited time to score while facing Seattle’s formidable defense.Key player: Devon Witherspoon, CB, Seahawks.Witherspoon does everything brilliantly, though you may not always know it as quarterbacks often avoid throwing in his direction. Behind Witherspoon, the Legion of Boom 2.0 conceded the fewest points per game in the regular season (17.2).Prediction:Seahawks over 49ers (all bets are off if Darnold doesn’t play though).Houston Texans v New England Patriots (Sunday 3pm ET/8pm GMT)What the Texans need to do to win:The Texans will expect their defense to make the Patriots suffer. Their offense is less of an asset and lost its best receiver, Nico Collins, to a concussion against Pittsburgh on Monday. Surprisingly, veteran receiver Christian Kirk stepped to lead the Texans to victory after doing next to nothing all season. Kirk made eight grabs for 144 yards and a touchdown and rapidly became Houston’s lone star on offense. In a perfect world, Collins makes it through concussion protocol –although that looks unlikely– if not Kirk needs to continue to do the heavy lifting.What the Patriots need to do to win:Attack Houston’s offensive line. The Patriots knew they had a huge advantage over the Chargers’ wafer-thin pass protection, and they subjected Justin Herbert to six sacks, 16 pressures and 11 hits. The Patriots need to blitz CJ Stroud as much as possible to force the quarterback into mistakes. The Texans’ offensive line had the 22nd-ranked pass block grade from Pro Football Focus this season. After dominating the Chargers, defensive end Milton Williams needs to be relied on once more to make sure the Patriots punch their ticket to the AFC championship game.Key player: Rhamondre Stevenson, RB, Patriots.Stevenson may not own the top spot in New England’s backfield for much longer but he showed how vital his versatility as a runner and receiver is in the win over the Chargers. He had 75 yards on three receptions while accounting for 30% of New England’s total offensive output. He is a workhorse whose all-round abilities will be crucial in trying to outfox Houston’s brutal defense.Prediction:Patriots over Texans.Los Angeles Rams v Chicago Bears (Sunday 6.30pm ET/11.30pm GMT)What the Rams need to do to win:The Bears love a comeback, so Sean McVay needs to use every play he has secreted away while leaning on his vast array of offensive weapons. Wringing every last drop of production from Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua is the first step to blowing the Bears out of the water. Stafford targeted Nacua 18 times against the Panthers last weekend, so he should at least be aiming for more than 20 on Sunday. When the Panthers didn’t show Nacua special attention he pulled off a string of chunk plays. He was also deployed as a runner, and bulldozed through three defenders for a touchdown. The Bears will always believe they can dig out a victory so the Rams should give them no hope whatsoever by spamming Nacua’s involvement until Chicago break.What the Bears need to do to win:Ben Johnson needs to be prepared for the Rams’ pass rush. Los Angeles have a key member of their secondary back: Quentin Lake, who freezes quarterbacks into holding the ball so that McVay’s heavy hitters, Jared Verse, Byron Young and Kobie Turner, can make a decisive sack. Johnson needs to scheme up the offense so they don’t get that chance. He should spotlight the out-of-structure playmaking of Caleb Williams – whose sack rate has dropped from 10.8% as a rookie to 4% this season – to stay one step ahead while using large doses of play action to draw the sting from blitzes. Williams needs to stay on his feet to get the ball out to his receivers who excel in yards after the catch. Rookie tight end Colston Loveland could be a huge headache for the Rams if he gets the targets.Key player: Montez Sweat, DE, Bears.The defensive lineman is surging at just the right time for Chicago. His three hits on Jordan Love earned him the game ball in the win over the Packers. The Bears need all of that and a few sacks to mitigate the danger of Stafford’s incredible array of receiving weapons.Prediction:Bears over Rams.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsDenver BroncosLos Angeles RamsChicago BearsSan Francisco 49ersSeattle SeahawksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pair endured several terse exchanges with Hamilton expressing frustration and confusion, notably in Monaco when he asked his engineer at the end of the race: “Are you upset with me or something?” He appeared to receive no reply.Hamilton dismissed speculation that the pair did not enjoy a good working relationship at the time as “BS” and said Adami had “been amazing to work with, he’s a great guy”.However, Hamilton went on to suffer the worst season of his career. He failed to claim a podium and finished sixth in the drivers’ championship, behind his teammate Charles Leclerc in fifth, while Ferrari were fourth in the constructors’ championship, 435 points behind the champions, McLaren.Hamilton has been outspoken in his dissatisfaction, describing last season as a “nightmare” at one point and, after being knocked out in Q1 at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, was at the end of his tether. “I don’t have the words to describe the feeling that I have inside,” he said. “An unbearable amount of anger and rage. There is not really much I can say about it.” He intimated in Abu Dhabi that he expected there to be changes made and was explicit that the team could not carry on as it was.“My surroundings in terms of personal personnel, team personnel, how you utilise people, whether people need to move into different positions to work better, all these different things need to be looked upon in my personal space so that we can optimise our teamwork,” he said.Adami had previously been race engineer to Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz, and being moved sideways from such a pivotal role suggests Ferrari is heeding Hamilton’s entreaties during the close season.Explore more on these topicsFerrariLewis HamiltonFormula One 2026Formula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Watch any reality TV show and it won’t be long before you hear the lead presenter talking about how each contestant has been on a journey. It’s as though we can’t survive without a narrative structure. An attempt to give emotional meaning to something fundamentally meaningless.It feels as if everyone has to be on a journey now. If you’re not, then you’re somehow less interesting. Only half a person. Even our politicians are no longer exempt. In the last 24 hours there have been any number of talking heads lining up to tell us that Robert Jenrick has been on quite the journey. His former Tory colleagues.His new tribe at Reform. Even Honest Bob likes to talk about his journey. Makes him feel special and different. Important.But what sort of journey has Jenrick really been on? Some of the externals may have changed, but the core has always remained the same – once an annoying, self-centred, man-child halfwit, always an annoying, self-centred, man-child halfwit. A politician whose eye has always been on his own ambition. The main chance. No more, no less.To recap. Back in 2014, when Honest Bob was first elected as MP for Newark, he was a wishy-washy Cameroon. Because that’s what he thought you needed to be to get on in the Tory party. He was a faithful remainer when he thought that was the winning side, and then became a committed Brexiteer in a heartbeat after the vote. Without even an attempt to hide the shamelessness.Then came his populist phase. No foreigner went unscathed. Especially all those brown and black faces in Birmingham. Because that’s where he thought the votes were. Everything he’s ever done has been to advance his career.If Jenrick has been on a journey, it’s been a circular one. The man with no qualities. No values. No beliefs. Just a needy homunculus for hire. Hitching his wagon to the highest bidder.On Friday he wasout and about, doing his best grift. Giving an exclusive interview to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg in which he tried to gloss things over. To put the best spin on how he was bounced into defecting to Reform the day before. He had always been planning to do this, he said. There had been many conversations with Nigel Farage. His mind had been made up since Christmas. Really? That’s odd. Because when the Tory chief whip had asked him if he was planning to defect he had replied: “Of course not. Nothing could be further from my mind. Wherever did you get that idea from?”Laura K sounded unsurprisingly sceptical. How on earth could anyone trust him again? Hurt face from Jenrick. Slapped puppy eyes. No one does this sort of thing lightly, he insisted. And really he had always intended to tell Kemi he was planning to defect, but somehow it was never the right time. If he had a fault it was that he was too kind. He didn’t want to disappoint his party leader because he knew how much she valued and trusted him. Yes, the actual defection itself had been a bit rushed, but it was all for the best in the end. Wasn’t it?Mystic Nigel has seen the future: a country run by his cabinet of taxidermied Tories | Marina HydeRead moreAnd when you came to think about it, he was really the most trustworthy of all the Tories. His honesty wasn’t in doubt. Because when Richard “Dirty” Desmond, the Tory donor and pornographer, had asked him to rush through a planning application to save him £45m, he had been only too happy to oblige. At least Honest Bob had been open about there being a “real possibility of bias”. Which was a form of honesty. Other Tory cabinet colleagues had pretended to have the country’s best interests at heart. He had never made that claim.Hmm. The Tories had broken Britain. Only Honest Bob was brave enough to say this. Every other Conservative was in denial. Maybe if there had been more people like him, things would have turned out brilliantly. He didn’t want to boast, but he had been exceptional in all the ministerial roles he had ever taken. If only the same could be said of all the other Tories. The country wouldn’t forgive them. Though obviously they should forgive him. Because he was King Baby.A byelection would be in no one’s best interests, he went on. Byelections were for the little people. And no one in his constituency wanted one. Apart from all the many thousands who considered his defection a major betrayal and had called for a byelection. Look me in the eyes, Laura. Laura looked. I am going to continue to represent Newark to the best of my ability. He had a pothole repaired in his own drive. What more could anyone ask for?Laura moved on to his relationship with Farage. Honest Bob had said Nige was unfit to run a school or hospital. Nige had called Honest Bob a liar and a fraud. So how was that going to work? Jenrick simpered. It was the tactics of a pickup artist. To neg the person you are in love with. The reason they had trash-talked each other was because they adored each other. They had a desperate attraction. Couldn’t get enough of each other. Loved each other’s casual racism. And yes there were one or two things they didn’t necessarily see eye to eye on. But Honest Bob could come round. Easy when you don’t believe in anything.Let this be a unifying moment, said Jenrick. Having just split the right down the middle. He hoped some of his former colleagues might join him in rallying around Nige. Though almost certainly not his former party leader. Kemi Badenoch had given her own interview in which she couldn’t have sounded more thrilled tosee the back of Honest Bob. A brave face, maybe. Some might have been asking why she hadn’t sacked him sooner. After all, Jenrick has always been hiding in plain sight.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickThe politics sketchReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Think about it. You never see Reform’s defectors after the initial unveiling press conference, and I’m beginning to wonder what happens to them. I think Nigel amateurishly embalms them or stuffs them with horsehair and sackcloth, then seats them round a “cabinet” table in his cellar, where they all silently agree with him at all times, and never interrupt him.But look, I’m prepared to consider more outlandish fan theories too, particularly after the sheer farce ofRobert Jenrick’s defectionon Thursday. If Nigel’s sloppy-seconding carries on at this rate, the Reform/Conservative party differentiation is going to feel a lot like it did when Bucks Fizz factionalised and split, then mounted rival tours of the UK. Neither music nor the United Kingdom was the beneficiary.For now, Farage is really leaning into the enemies-to-lovers trope. On Monday hecosied up to a manwho’d previously said of him: “Yr comments r offensive&racist. I wld b frightened 2live in country run by U.” On Thursday, he did it with a guy who he’d incredibly recently negged as “a fraud”. Personally, I have found both these episodes of Heated Rivalry the least appealing.Hopefully, though, one day someone will write an interior fiction novella that takes place within the five hours of limbo on Thursday when Jenrick was whereabouts unknown. During this period, he had been stripped of his home in the Conservative party, yet not granted citizenship of Reform – kind of an SW1 version of Shamima Begum. During these hours, something had to fill the vacuum, and there was much to enjoy in all the staged fretting from Reform about the threat of cultural pollution from outsiders. “The worries I get from within Reform,” confessed Farage of all these defections, “are …will they bring Tory infighting with them?” Listen, someone’s got to say it. If you allow these people in, they do bring their primitive, vicious culture with them.Although this was not how Kemi Badenoch framed it in herviral video message. Incidentally, one of multiple problems with Kemi is that she seems to have stolen her act off Dolores Umbridge. Even the voice, with that treacly-steely delivery, is straight out of the Ministry of Magic’s supply teacher department. Or, even worse, the shadow Ministry of Magic’s supply teacher department.Anyway, on both off- and on-the-record briefings, theConservativeshave been keen to play this as a double-agent plotline, casting Jenrick as maybe the Ozempic Guy Burgess. As revealed by the Times, Badenoch had been informed by a mole that Jenrick was planning to imminently do one, and was furious that he “came to shadow cabinet and behaved as if nothing was going on”. I hope you love the idea that anything is going on at shadow cabinet. And are even more intrigued by reports that, the week before, Jenrick had “sat through a shadow cabinet awayday taking copious notes” about strategy. Wait – the Tories have a strategy? If so, Farage is very keen to tell them how it ends up panning out, constantly making reference to what happens “after the May 7th catastrophe”. A catastrophe which, given it happens on 7 May, can technically not yet be called, but in Nigel’s telling has already occurred. Then again, Farage undoubtedly has political gravity and momentum working for him, so there’s no reason to think he can’t master time as well.Given the reputation of “Honest Bob”, it remains unclear whether Reform will ever really trust Jenrick, or whether he will have to live under constant oppressive surveillance by the party’s security services/a disgruntled Richard Tice. A bit like when Lee Harvey Oswald went to the Soviets and he just got a load of monitoring and a factory job in Minsk. You get the feeling Jenrick wants more than a factory job in Minsk. Or as he put it yesterday: “I’ve put aside my personal ambition.” (Genuinely the most hilarious thing that was said yesterday.)As for the upshot of it all outside the Westminster dramasphere, you hear a lot from Reform about the uniparty, the epithet meant to embody the necrotic consensus between failed Conservative and Labour parties. But yesterday risked shifting the vibe to unichaos, in which Reform joined the big tent, too. Certainly, the lesson of the past 18 months in British decline is how easily the feeling of “same shit, different clown show” sets in, with even Farage now offering repeat variations on how short his notional period of grace with the British public will be.But why should anyone feel patient? To pick just one example, it is stunningly appalling that thousands of people cursed with living under South East Water have nowbeen without waterin their homes for a week, after having already suffered repeated outages since November. The government has asked the regulator to “review” South East Water’s licence, but it has emerged that even if they did want to terminate it, they would have to give the firm 25 years’ notice. You read that right: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS. This is one of many, many reasons why people have had it with the current system, and why many will give Farage a chance. It doesn’t, however, make him the answer. I am sure Farage has the will and possibly the ability to tear dysfunctional things down. It’s the fixing them or building them back up I just cannot see, no matter how many “gamechanging” press conferences he calls. After all, if Nigel’s allowed to report back from the future, so are we.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionRobert JenrickReform UKKemi BadenochConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Last time around, this was when the Washington “grownups” debated his capacity to be president, notably in the final fortnight of his presidency, after theJanuary 6 Capitol insurrection. Under the constitution, a president can be replaced should the vice-president and a cabinet majority decide their leader is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. The trouble today is that there are no grownups.The US president’s designs on Greenland are clearly mad. He claims Russia and China are scheming to seize the island and that Denmark should be forced urgently to transfer its sovereignty. Denmark had long allowed the US extendedmilitary access to Greenland, but Trump seems to want to own it. None of his staff has been able to say why.Until now it would have seemed a comic satire for Norway, Sweden, France and Germany to be sending troops to Greenland, pending a possible US attack. Yet that is the absurd prospect happening this week. Britain even sent a military officer. This has come within weeks of Trump’s leadership putsch in Venezuela, and within days of his threatened military assault on Iran. In the latter he appeared to claim victory, saying Iranhad stoppedusing its armed troops to suppress street protests. It happens that Trump has effectively been doing the samein Minnesota. He has had a hectic fortnight.There is no justification for Trump’s attempted grab ofGreenland. Under the Nato alliance there is full defence cooperation between the US and Denmark, as with Canada, which he has also threatened. Trump appears to be like a shoplifting addict who cannot resist a quick grab – an oilfield here, a critical minerals mine there. It is hard to believe he will not back off, but when?View image in fullscreenMembers of the Danish armed forces on a military drill in Greenland, 17 September 2025.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersWise leaders have advisers. Reckless ones have sycophants. Most American presidents claim to be non-interventionists, but when dressed in the robes of military might they find it hard to resist flaunting them. As with George W Bush in Iraq, Trump’s “mission accomplished” press conference after Venezuela two weeks ago clearly exhilarated him. His army had just reportedlykilled more than 100 peoplein Caracas, but he looked as if he had won the lottery.When the US decides to set the world to rights, no one but the US can stop it. But the rights seldom emerge as such. They more often end as a vast expenditure of blood and money, justified by senseless talk of freedom and national security. This is despite the fact that, of all countries, the US must be the most unthreatened.Sooner or later the US’s antique but resilient constitution will exert itself. Its central curb on presidential power remains the term limit. In three years, Trump will be gone. Before then, this year’s midterm elections seem certain to bring Congress some revival of confidence and thus balance of power. Assuming no 25th-amendment moment, Trump’s remaining years are likely to be dominated by an ever more eccentric vanity and growing domestic antipathy.Meanwhile, what allies should not do is fall into Trump’s own trap, relying on the vacuities of national security to seal every argument and jeer every opponent. China and Russia may persist in their neurotic “grey-zone” aggressions, but the glee with which western defence lobbies use them to talk up the prospect of a “third world war” merely raises the temperature and generates fear.China does not pose an existential threat to Britain. It never has and I cannot believe it ever will. Meanwhile, Russia’s borderlands have always been unstable. Before the current war, Russia had attacked Georgia and Ukraine in the past 20 years, without the west reacting militarily. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was outrageous and the west was right to help it defend itself. But that is quite different from declaring Russia a threat to Britain’s territorial security.As Henry Kissinger and many Kremlinologists warned, Nato’s decision to advance its umbrella to Russia’s borders after the collapse of the Soviet Union was a severe test of Russian paranoia. Yet Russia has never responded by invading a Nato country, despite the incessant warnings of the defence lobby that it still might. The efforts of the former British army chief, Lord Dannatt, and others to portray Ukraine as just an overture toa third world warmerely adds to Russia’s belligerence. I sometimes feel the military establishment craves war.This is why Greenland matters. Clearly east-west relations – or rather emotions – are at an alarmingly tender stage. But portraying Russian tanks as about to race acrossEuropewill hardly reduce the tension. A dispute over Greenland could split Nato and severely weaken it. If ever a crisis merited stalling and slow diplomacy, this is it. When tub-thumping generals and politicians seize the microphone from diplomats and peacemakers, all sanity vanishes.In the past four years Ukraine has turned its border with Russia into a global battlefield between tyranny and freedom. But its dispute with Russia need have nothing to do with Nato. Of course Britons may want to assist other countries when fate or geography leads them into harm. But this has nothing to do with Britain’s national security. Defence is so expensive it should at least mean what it says on the tin.Keir Starmer has promised to divert billions of pounds from his domestic budget intohiring soldiers and buying weapons. This is in order to send soldiersto Ukraine(and possibly even Greenland) so he can look good on his next foreign trip. He should not do so. They have nothing to do with the defence of Britain.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist and the author ofA Short History of America: From Tea Party to TrumpExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGreenlandDenmarkEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

The truth is that governments don’t tackle the problem because they don’t want toFri 16 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 13.27 ESTShareThere is one political problem from which all others follow. It is the major cause of Donald Trump, of Nigel Farage, of the shocking weakness of their opponents, of the polarisation tearing societies apart, of the devastation of the living world. It is simply stated: the extreme wealth of a small number of people.It canalso be quantified. The World Inequality Report (WIR) 2026 shows that about 56,000 people – 0.001% of the global population – corral three times more wealth than the poorest half of humanity. They afflict almost every country. In the UK, for example, 50 familieshold more wealththan 50% of the population combined.You can watch their fortunes grow. In 2024, Oxfam’s figures show, the wealth of the world’s 2,769 billionairesgrew by $2tn, or $2,000bn. Thetotal global spendingon international aid last year was projected to be, at most, $186bn, less than a tenth of the increment in their wealth. Governments tell us they “can’t afford” more. In the UK, billionaires, on average, havebecome more than 1,000% richersince 1990. Most of their wealth derives from property, inheritance and finance. They have become so rich, in other words, at our expense.The issue affects every aspect of policy. Trump is notseizing Venezuela’s oil wealthfor the sake of the US poor. He couldn’t give a damn about them, as his “big, beautiful bill” –robbing the poorto give to the rich – revealed. Hecovets Greenlandon behalf of the same elite interests, of which he is the avatar.When the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, helped destroy the lives of the world’s poorest bytearing downUSAID, he did so on behalf of his class. The same goes for Trump’sassaults on democracy, and his war on the living world. It is the ultra-rich who benefit most from destruction, in making money and in spending it. The WIR shows that the richest 1% of the world’s population account for 41% of greenhouse gas emissions arising from private capital ownership: almost twice that of the bottom 90%. And through their consumption, another study shows, the 1%produce as many greenhouse gasesas the poorest two-thirds.Inequality damages every aspect of our lives. Decades of research by Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson shows thathigher inequality, regardless of absolute levels of wealth, is associated with higher crime, worse public health, higher addiction, lower educational attainment, worse status anxiety (leading to higher consumption of positional goods), worse pollution and destruction, and a host of other ills.Extreme inequality creates an “Epstein class” of global predators,exploiting the restfinancially – and in other ways. It creates an ethos that no longer recognises our common humanity, that sees other people, asMusk puts it, as “non-player characters”,and believesthat, “the fundamental weakness of western civilisation is empathy”.This is the metric by which you can tell who in politics are your allies and who are your enemies: whether they support or oppose the extreme concentration of wealth. In fact, the matter should be definitional. Those who support it (let’s call them Group 1) are the right. Those who oppose it (Group 2) are the left.As soon as you understand politics in this light, you notice something extraordinary. Almost the entire population is in Group 2. Polling across 36 nations by the Pew Research Center found that84% see economic inequalityas a big problem, and 86% see the political influence of the rich as a major cause of it. In 33 of these nations, a majority believe their country’s economic system needs either “major changes” or “complete reform”. In the UK, a YouGov poll revealed,75% support a wealth taxon fortunes above £10m, while only 13% oppose it. But – and here’s the astonishing thing – almost the entire political class is in Group 1. You can search the manifestos of major parties that once belonged to the left, and find no call to make billionaires history.Quite the opposite in fact. Even when politicians are forced to respond to calls for a wealth tax, they dismiss it, as UK ministers have done, with two excuses. The first is that it won’t raise much revenue. Maybe, maybe not: there’s a wide range of evidence on this matter. But revenue-raising is the least of its benefits. Far more important are two other issues. One is fairness. Asthe WIR reports, “Effective income tax rates climb steadily for most of the population but fall sharply for billionaires and centi-millionaires.” This undermines trust in the tax system and politics in general. The other is reducing the power of the ultra-rich over our lives. To restore democracy and create a fairer, safer, greener world, we must bring the ultra-rich to heel, cutting their fortunes until they canno longer bludgeon us.The second excuse is that the uber-rich will flee the country. There are three possible responses to this claim. The first is thatthere’s no evidenceto support it. The second is, if true, good riddance: they do us more harm than good. The third is to say: then the obvious solution is a global tax-avoidance measure. So guess what? While 125 nations supported this approach, Keir Starmer’s government wasone of ninethat opposed it. Our government doesn’t tax the ultra-rich enough not because it can’t, but because it doesn’t want to.It’s not just politicians. Almost all the media belongs to Group 1. As the wealth and power of the proprietor class becomes ever greater and harder to justify, the views expressed in their outlets become ever crazier. Immigrants, asylum seekers, Muslims, women, transgender people, disabled people, students, protesters: anyone and everyone must be blamed for our dysfunctions, except those causing them. Ever more extreme “culture wars” (a euphemism for divide-and-rule) must be waged.It’s also why imaginary threats (Venezuela, “cultural Marxists”, “domestic terrorists”) must constantly be drummed up. You cannot have both a free market in media ownership and a free market in information and ideas. The oligarchs who dominate the sector stifle inconvenient thoughts and promote the policies that protect their fortunes.No one would claim that taking on extreme wealth is easy. But the battle begins with political parties spelling out this aim, clearly and unequivocally. Either they represent the great majority, or they represent the tiny minority: they cannot do both. So where, we might ask, are our representatives?George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsThe super-richOpinionInequalityTax and spendingEconomic policyGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

(Dutch police told his inspectors that they deployed 1,200 officers, had reports regarding one flag and one taxi driver, and that a Maccabi fan was in fact thrown into a canal, seemingly by members of a pro-Palestinian group).Though nobody disputes it was a violent night that might well have shaped police desire to ban Maccabi fans, at best they made a worryingly sloppy case for it, including references cribbed from an unreliable AI tool to a football match that did not actually exist. But perhaps most damaging is the finding that by publicly downplaying reports of locals plotting to attack the visitors, the force overstated the threat posed by the Israelis and understated that posedtothem – an error with global consequences.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, who as a Muslim MP in Birmingham needs no lectures on the sensitivities, responded that by apparently trying to smooth community relations, the force had only made matters worse. Now the city faces a toxic row over so-called two-tier policing, reactivating both incendiary rightwing claims of thepolice going easy on Muslims for fear of looking racist and complaints that, if anything, the reverse is true, which does little to reassure either British Jews or British Muslims fearful for their safety in a febrile climate. Meanwhile, it was left to the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation,Jonathan Hall, to ask why,if the police were aware of threats to harm Israeli fans, they didn’t pursue the wannabe attackers instead of telling prospective victims of racially aggravated crimes to stay at home.For many British Jews, all this stirs deep-seated fears of being treated less as a persecuted minority than as the problem, obliged to retreat from mainstream spaces to spare everyone else the awkwardness of having to battle for their inclusion. Someone seeks to harm visiting Israelis? Well, maybe they just shouldn’t come. This fear of being squeezed out of public life is, for some, only intensified by a campaign to boycott Jewish public figures – from musicians and comedians to the MP and vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, Damien Egan,reportedly forced to cancela visit to a school in his Bristol constituency due to a threatened public protest – deemed by pro-Palestine activists to have insufficiently denounced the war on Gaza, or to have too close a relationship with Israel. (Egan has reportedly visited the country since the war broke out, a red flag for the boycott movement.)Though activists insist they’re not boycotting anyone just for being Jewish, it is not hard to see why a vulnerable minority would fear being singled out for political purity tests, or held unfairly to account for the actions of a foreign government over which they have no control. Arguing over whether this is or isn’t antisemitism seems less productive than figuring out how to stop Britain sliding into the kind of mutually hostile and distrustful cultural ghettoisation that extremists find only too easy to exploit.The school says it hasrescheduled Egan’s visit, which is reassuring: MPs should be able in a democracy to move freely around their own constituencies, and teenagers who will shortly be voters deserve the chance to meet – and sometimes challenge – their representatives. Meanwhile, a snap Ofsted inspection should get to the bottom ofnewspaper allegationsthat school staff, professionally obliged to be politically impartial, actively worked to keep Egan out.Yet it’s crucial that lessons are learned ahead of the next flashpoint, for sadly there will be more. Handled badly, they can only play into the hands of all those – from the nativist far right to fundamentalists demanding that Muslims leave the decadent west to build their longed-for caliphate – desperate to prove the old lie that Muslims and Jews cannot peacefully coexist, that liberal democracies can’t absorb these tensions, that mass immigration leads inevitably to the importing of distant conflicts and what Trumpworld calls “civilisational erasure”.Those of us who genuinely believe in the goal of a multicultural society, where people of all faiths and backgrounds learn to live together more or less tolerantly, have to accept that it won’t always be easy. Frontline professionals from politicians to chief constables, headteachers and people who never expected to find themselves navigating political minefields, will sometimes be called on to make difficult judgments – and when they turn to the police for impartial advice over handling these flashpoints, they must be able to trust it. That trust was badly damaged in the West Midlands, which is why the Cooke review hasbecome a resigning matter.But living together through times of war and tension also demands empathy and effort from the rest of us: a willingness to compromise, be generous and accept that tolerance isn’t just something liberals preach to other people, but something we must practise ourselves, even (or perhaps especially) when feeling morally righteous. It won’t be easy. But, trust me, it beats the alternative.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There’s a way to resolve this debate, and scientists must hurryDebora MacKenzieThis week’s furore is microplastics researchers’ ozone moment. If they fail, the powerful plastics lobby will step into the breachDebora MacKenzie is a science journalist and author ofStopping the Next Pandemic: How Covid-19 Can Help Us Save HumanityFri 16 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 12.03 ESTShareAre we being injured and killed by ubiquitous, teeny-tiny shards of toxic plastic? Or aren’t we? For many months, the Guardian hasreported a series of worrying scientific resultsthat our bodies are full of jagged microplastic particles that could be giving us everything from heart attacks to reproductive problems.But on Tuesday, the Guardian revealed that a significant number of scientists think many of these studiesshowed no such thing. Or maybe they did. The methods are new and riddled with problems, so we can’t always reliably tell.If you, like me, have spent the past few decades watching battle after battle over environmental pollutants – fromDDTto cigarette smoke, to ozone destroyers to greenhouse gases – it will all look familiar. New problems present new challenges, and science takes a while to work them out. But eventually, it does. Science’s unique and greatest strength is that it is self-correcting. The current battle among researchers of microplastics is the first salvo in that process.Here is how thedisputes arose. Similar to the earlier cases just mentioned, as a new environmental nasty emerged, a community of specialists developed delicate, precise techniques to track the nasties and measure their impact, beyond any reasonable dispute. Scientists are, with good reason, persnickety about exact measurements and experimental controls. The analytical specialists who chase sometimes tiny quantities of pollutants and pinpoint their effects are arguably the most persnickety of the lot.But as microplastics got more attention, along came a bunch of researchers who often weren’t even analytical specialists, but medical scientists used to dealing with very different complex systems such as blood or brains or hardened arteries. They knew microplastics were everywhere, so they went to the analytical literature for ways to measure them. Theythen used these methods to measure microplastics in thebiological systems they are familiar with. For instance, in one of the disputed papers, an Italian team found nearly five times more heart attacks and strokes in people with jagged microplastics in their hardened arteries than in those apparently without.But inevitably, the analytical researchers, mainly chemists, wrotehorrified lettersto journal editors. They contend, for example, that the methods being used can read ordinary bodily fats in a sample as plastics, potentially giving false readings; that there weren’t proper corrections for the amount of background plastic in the laboratory; and that more controls were needed.The clinical teams have replied that there is a steep learning curve, and that this sort of work hasn’t been donein biological material before. Maybe some more controls would help, but more background plastics wouldn’t account for some things, such as that five-fold difference in heart attacks. And it isn’t at all clear whether any of these methodological shortcomings mean that there aren’t microplastics in humans, or that they aren’t having ill effects. They just raise uncertainties.Eventually, the analytical experts will start working more closely with the clinical crowd, and they will all learn to measure microplastics robustly in human tissue and investigate possible impacts on health. That is, if the agencies that fund scientific research keep funding them.That’s why the uncertainties worry both sides. Anydispute over methods“only provides ammunition to deniers”, warns one analyst. And these days, there are plenty of science deniers around.We have seen this before.Naomi Oreskesand others haveabundantly documentedhow people who make money from some pollutant or other “manufacture” doubt about science, enough to block action. But the example I know best was also the one where scientists learned how to fight back.The few companies who made the CFC chemicals that destroy stratospheric ozone, allowing more, deadly UV light to hit our planet, pointed for years to methodological disputes among ozone scientists to claim that “the science isn’t certain enough to do anything drastic” – such as banning CFCs. It worked.But the world eventually banned CFCs, and the ozone layer is healing, becausein the 1980s a few scientists, headed, improbably, by a British expat at Nasa,Bob Watson, organised all the other scientists to summarise for governments what they agreed was true, and conduct experiments to resolve their disagreements. It was a specific project meant to resolve the “uncertainty” for the wider world–and unleash action. “It’s important to get everyone, the industry scientists and every country that does research involved,” Watson told me then. Italso worked.Microplastic and nanoplastic research now has to learn that lesson. We know there are problems, wrote one scientist in response to scathing criticism from analytical teams, but we’d be better off spending our limited funding developing better methods, rather than “continually engaging in a dialogue”. Wrong. Dialogue is how you’re going to get the methods.Agroup of biomedical researcherswant “interlaboratory studies” to compare methods “and learn from each other”, with multidisciplinary teams “ideally including industry scientists”.Others callfor “an international and interdisciplinary collaboration of experts” to improve research methods.That’s more like it. Cynics will roll their eyes at the bit about industry scientists, but I know Watson would say that’s what you need. Everyone. So science can do its thing, creating knowledge on the basis of real, robust data about the world, without disputes that block progress – or discourage funding for the needed research.And we need that sooner rather than later. Enough skirmishing in letters columns in journals. The plastics industry is more powerful than the CFC-makers were, and it has friends who know how to manufacture doubt. (Researchers I spoke to said that their papers have been denounced to journal editors by chemical industry figures who were not analytical experts.)This is your ozone moment, microplastics people. Time to see the bigger picture, and find a way to resolve this battle, keep public trust and move forward with this vital research.Debora MacKenzie is a science journalist and author ofStopping the Next Pandemic: How Covid-19 Can Help Us Save HumanityExplore more on these topicsPlasticsOpinionHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The HFPA was disbanded in 2023 after allegations of racism, but 95 former members retained voting rights and on Monday, the show went on.And what a year it was for the second Penske Media Golden Globe awards, featuring not only a commercial tie-in with the betting tool Polymarket (“integrated branding and real-time market insights designed to enhance audience engagement”) but a new category for poor-relation-to-the-screen, best podcast. Against stiff competition from Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy and The Mel Robbins Podcast, the award went to Amy Poehler’s Good Hang, a show in which she yuks it up with her friends to remind us how important Tina Fey was in their partnership.One Battle After Another and Adolescence dominate 83rd Golden GlobesRead moreIn the TV awards, meanwhile, there was well-earned recognition for the actor and thought leader Stephen Graham, for Adolescence, his Netflix show exploring the complexities of men’s rights, and I was happy HBO’s The Pitt won best drama, even though you still need a VPN to watch it in Britain. (I was also happy Michelle Williams won for Dying for Sex, a hugely under-rated FX show that wasn’t helped by its terrible title.)One thing that struck me as the camera swept over the audience during standup comedian Nikki Glaser’s affable opening monologue: is there any circumstance on Earth that would make these people skip this thing entirely? The HFPA was a joke, the awards then and now are a joke, but short of some kind of Pompeii-like event reducing nominees on the red carpet to ash, we have to assume they’ll keep turning up in their finery. I know, I know; it’s aboutthe work.TuesdayA low-key flex in New York used to be to say you saw Hamilton when it was on at the Public (I didn’t see it at the Public). The newest version of this is to claim you saw Oh, Mary!, the hit Broadway show that recently transferred to London, when it opened downtown at the Lucille Lortel theatre. (I didn’t see it at the Lucille Lortel. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything before everyone else saw it and told me to go.)I did, however, see Oh, Mary! this week at the Trafalgar theatre in the West End and it made me so happy I got off the tube at the wrong stop on the way home. Cole Escola’s starring role as a depressed, alcoholic, former cabaret star, Mary Todd Lincoln, is reprised by Mason Alexander Park and any concern that we’d missed the only version worth seeing evaporates in the first five minutes.Not everyone feels this way. Escola tells the story of hapless folk from New Jersey showing up to the Broadway production anticipating a sombre engagement with American history rather than a series of jokes about Abraham Lincoln being gay, and huffing out after five minutes. I don’t know if that has happened in London yet.But while the show here is sold out, there’s no question Oh, Mary! hasn’t had the same impact that it had in New York, partly, perhaps, because the American history part is off-putting and partly because London, in my view, is a much straighter town. I have heard more than one puzzled or disapproving reaction from Londoners who might have been happier at the Michael Jackson musical or Wicked. On which score I feel towards Oh, Mary! a certain combative protectiveness that makes me think if you didn’t like it, it wasn’t for you in the first place.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage: ‘Look, I can’t be a vampire, I’ve got a shadow.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWednesdayIf it’s risible to show up at the Golden Globes, how do you like AARP’s Movies for Grownups awards featuring – no stage too obscure, no appearance too lowly as long as there are cameras to record it – the former leading man George Clooney. It’s quite the turn up, isn’t it, that Noah Wyle, ever the bridesmaid on ER back in the day, has leapt over Clooney with his role in The Pitt, while Clooney is reduced to moping about in ponderous films by Greta Gerwig’s sad-looking husband, Noah Baumbach.Anyway at least someone at AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) liked Jay Kelly and this week Clooneyshowed upon stage to collect an award for it, during the course of which he defended Paul Dano from something Quentin Tarantino had said about … Oh, I can’t even bring myself to get into this.What interests me is the AARP itself, an organisation of immense if invisible cultural reach in the US. Like Costco magazine (circulation: 15.4m), AARP’s publications arm is one of the few juggernaut media enterprises that isn’t slowly circling the drain. It is a behemoth of a brand that reaches 38 million members in the US, has the highest circulation of any print media in the country and a readership at least partly made up of people with money. I take it all back; smart move by Clooney.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson: ‘My regard for Jeffrey Epstein was the size of a matchbox! Or a shoebox at most. Definitely not bigger than a shoebox.’Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/AFP/Getty ImagesThursdayI wouldn’t take a kid to see Oh, Mary!, obviously, but I’d also hesitate to take anyone under 15 to see Sondheim. Clever programming at the Barbican, however, means I might do it. News this week of a forthcoming production of Sunday in the Park with George featuring Wicked co-stars, Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey, is a clever piece of programming for the theatre’s 2027 season that will be even harder to get tickets for than Kenneth Branagh’s forthcoming The Tempest at the RSC.I have a soft spot for Grande after being made to sit in a room for what seemed like decades while Sam and Cat played in the background. But even the attraction of a former Nickelodeon star won’t take the edge off this hard sell. Sondheim is long, and to get my kids out of the house I’ll have to lie about the running time, again, despite poor results in this area. I told my kids Operation Mincemeat was only 80 minutes long and by the end of the pushing-towards-three-hour-long production on a school night there were some very cranky faces indeed.FridayLovely to read about Alan Rickman inall the tributes collated by the Guardianthis week to mark the 10th anniversary of his death. It sent me back to his diaries, one of the great reading experiences, in which Rickman is waspish, indignant, very pissy indeed and wonderfully, warmly entertaining. One anecdote that stayed with me: after attending a party thrown by the Guardian in the late 1990s, Rickman remarked that, even for an actor accustomed to this kind of thing, he had never seen a group of people more uncontrollably drunk and disorderly. Proud, yes, surprised, no.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekTelevisionTheatreAwards and prizesGolden GlobesTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

But we should not sleepwalk into a centralised systemFri 16 Jan 2026 13.20 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 13.36 ESTShareAfter refusing to walk, in a manner reminiscent ofStuart Broadbatting against the Australians in the 2013 Ashes, the West Midlands chief constable Craig Guildford has finally accepted the inevitable andretiredwith ill-concealed reluctance from his post. He had little alternative.On Wednesday the Home Office had releaseda critical reportby the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Andy Cooke, into the way West Midlands police supported banning Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from attending a fixture in Birmingham against Aston Villa. The same day,Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, told the Commons that she no longer had confidence in Mr Guildford. The chief constable tried to face down the criticism. But, on Friday, he quit.The case is important on two levels. One is professional standards. As the Cooke report shows, West Midlands police did an inadequate job weighing the case for a ban. It found that much of the evidence on which they based their decision was sloppily compiled, with an unreliableAI tool– leading the force to overstate the threat from the Israeli fans. For these reasons alone, Mr Guildfordwas rightto step down.Yet the case raises a wider constitutional questions about policing in Britain. Under a2011 act, Ms Mahmood has no legal power to sack Mr Guildford. That rests instead with the local police and crime commissioner, who had chosennot to use it. Ms Mahmood’s announcement has achieved its goal simply by political pressure.Such pressure has its place. But it is getting too common. It echoes two modern sackings of commissioners of London’s Metropolitan police. In 2008, the London mayor Boris Johnson withdrew confidence from the lateIan Blair. In 2022, Sadiq Khan did the same thing to removeCressida Dick. No mayor has absolute sacking power over the commissioner, but no commissioner can withstand the loss of mayoral support.Policing has become more party political. Sensitive reform of the 2011 act would aim to reduce that trend. The question is whether the government’s planto abolishthe PCCs and give sacking powers to the home secretary will now achieve that. Should police chiefs in high-profile posts have to suck it up when politicians turn on them as if they were football managers after a string of defeats?Throughout recent English history, policing has been an essentially local function, to be exercised and controlled locally. Fear of French-style centralisation meant relations between police constables, chief officers, local authorities, the magistracy and the Home Office evolved unevenly, with London always treated differently from the rest. A succession of statutes, most recently in 2011, have sought some consistency. But the tension is unresolved. Ms Mahmood’s language suggests her new bill, due soon, will be a centralising measure, at a time when local government is already being weakened and restructured.There is obviously a case for greater centralisation, or alternatively for regionalisation, of police. But the local system has survived because it can work and because it makes police, and police chiefs, more responsive. This can go wrong, as it did over the Maccabi ban. But it can also be improved. When such important issues are at stake, the country needs a careful debate, not a lurch into reforms that may be premature and open to partisan abuse.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The real danger is from his administrationFri 16 Jan 2026 13.21 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 13.36 ESTShareIn Minnesota, armed and masked agents areripping families apart. They are seizing parents while theywait with their child at a bus stop, going door to door seeking undocumented migrants and breaking car windows to drag people out. Last Wednesday an officer shot dead Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen. Her killing is a tragedyfor all who loved her, and most of all for the three children left motherless. It also marks her country’s crossing of a Rubicon.Where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) once preferred to keep a low profile, it now seeks publicity and confrontation – pumped up onbillions of dollarsin funding, the aggression and brazenness of the administration and thelicensing of bigotry.While statistics show that violent and property crime rateshave plungedsince the 1990s, Mr Trump has conjured a threat of American carnage, and an enemy responsible: undocumented migrants – and, increasingly, those who stand with them. Fear is an instrument. The administration will struggle to meet its target of removing 1 million undocumented migrants a year unless people are frightened into “self‑deporting”, and sympathisers are frightened out of offering support. Most Americans – and the majority of independent voters –think Mr Trump’s deportation drive is excessive. But Republican-aligned voters disagree, and a third think he has not gone far enough.Undocumented migrants are frightened to leave their homes, fearing they may not see their families again. US citizens of colour are increasingly affected, with a Septembersupreme court rulingseeminglyinterpreted by ICEas allowing detention solely on the basis of race and ethnicity. Racism, militarisation and the impunity of law enforcement are familiar themes: police killed 1,379 people in the US in 2024, and victims were almost three times more likely to be black than white. But this drive is all the more shocking because being an undocumented migrantis a civil not a criminal offenceand ICE officers have limited detention powers. It is not clear that theyeven had the authorityto demand that Ms Good leave her car.In smearing her as a “deranged leftist” and “domestic terrorist”,investigating herwidow, and claiming that there is “absolute immunity” for the officer who shot her, the administration is not only willing to vilify the apparently unlikely Republican targetof a white middle-class mother, but is exposing its broader political agenda. That videos lay bare the lies is irrelevant. Opponents need not believe – only comply.In Trumpism, rules and restraint are portrayed as a corruption of the people’s will instead of the essence of American democracy. A man who pardoned supporters for an actual insurrection seeking to keep him in power nowthreatens to invoke the Insurrection Actto quell protests. In October, the presidenttold generals: “It’s a war from within.” ICE has been transformed into a paramilitary force apparently answerable only to Mr Trump. Imagineits potential usesin future.Little wonder that Minnesotans say thisfeels like an invasion, and the state’s governor, Tim Walz, describes it as an occupation. The communities who are now defending and supporting each other are not only challenging the demonisation, mistreatment and removal of undocumented migrants. They are pushing back against the fear on which Trumpism feeds and the manufacturing of a crisis which would consume many more victims.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’m afraid he is, 13 January).Football managers are frequently the target for similar treatment. Like them, Starmer has to set his team’s strategy and tactics and produce results that please supporters.No matter that he saved his side from relegation and gained promotion last season, things are not going as well as expected – hence the abuse. In style and charisma, he may be more Sean Dyche than Carlo Ancelotti, and as an Arsenal fan, he should get some tips from Mikel Arteta.The season is less than halfway through. He has time to make better use of his left wing, bring through some of the talented younger members of his squad, be sharper on the counterattack and build a better rapport with his often impatient supporters.Dr Colin J SmithWest Kirby, MerseysideOh deary me. Jonathan Liew’s article is about as subtle as a brick. His notion thatKeir Starmeris responsible for his own demise, and deserves to be called a wanker is both obtuse and crass. Yes, if Starmer is replaced as leader of the Labour party and as prime minister, he will have brought it on himself – not because he’s a wanker, though, but because of this government’s myriad policy cock-ups and scandals.However, aren’t we better than the far-right, coke-snorting lager louts who think it’s coolly offensive to shout rude words in public about our prime minister?What’s happened to us as a society when a renowned Guardian journalist like Liew descends into the gutter? I take it Liew remembers how Starmer held it together for us all, post-Southport, in the face of the most appalling, disgusting violence? Liew realises tacitly condoning this verbal thuggery will only encourage more of the same, right?Desmond HewittMarlborough, WiltshireJonathan Liew thinks Keir Starmer is to blame for the crude songs. But who starts singing them? Who prints and distributes the stickers with anti-Starmer messages? Not people with any sympathy for improved public services, more progressive taxation, or rules-based international relations. Not anyone interested in serious political debate. Jonathan has fallen for propaganda from the government’s opponents.I had the luck last week to meet the prime minister when he visited my area. In a few minutes’ chat he came across as approachable and a good listener. He seems to prefer making good, well-considered decisions rather than pleasing any one group. I’ve been aLabourparty member since the days of Hugh Gaitskell, and never agreed on everything with any leader. But I’d much rather have Starmer than Johnson, Trump, Farage or Putin.Robert DimmickCaversham, BerkshireKeir Starmer is a working-class lad who worked hard, burrowed himself into a big organisation like many before him and made a success of himself. He has no illusions about the power realities in society or the need to compromise to get things done. An uncharismatic technocrat he may be, but he is a decent human being, which is why the populist right call him a wanker, and a grown-up, which is why some on the left loathe him. I just wish he would make more of the fact that by all accounts he is a decent midfielder and actually likes football.Colin JonesBirminghamThe extent of Keir Starmer’s unpopularity became apparent to me recently while driving through a prosperous Kent village. Someone had taken the trouble to print small posters inviting him to have sexual intercourse with himself and stuck them on to the street furniture. As none of the residents had taken the trouble to remove them, I guess they broadly agreed with the sentiment.Ralph JonesRochester, KentAs a great admirer of Jonathan Liew’s sports and opinion pieces, I find his latest deeply disappointing.

There was a predictable outcry against this decision, and I found myself confronted by angry protesters at a meeting chaired by the local MP, Keir Starmer.At that meeting, I decided not to carry on defending a policy I didn’t believe in, and managed to get the initial decision overturned (and the strength of feeling also led to Benugo pulling out). We brought in a consultant to conduct a full and inclusive consultation, and all the existing leaseholders were left to get on with running the cafes, at least for the time being.I always knew the subject would come up again as, despite popular belief, the City Corporation’s funds are not bottomless, and the cafes do need to pay their way. But I had hoped that our earlier experience of reversing a controversial policy might have alerted current decision-makers at the corporation to the dangers in allowing financial planners and their spreadsheets to trump every other consideration and that the consultation process we put in place in 2016 might have resulted in permanent improvements in communication and genuine listening to users of the wonderful heath and its unique range of cafes.Virginia RoundingBirminghamHow apposite that Ms Cosslett’s article should be publishedjust two days before BBC Radio 4 Extra’s repeatof the 1959Hancock’s Half Hour episode Fred’s Pie Stall, in which the lads fight against the enforced closure of that Cheam institution. Spoiler alert: Fred ends up selling saveloys and champagne, and builds himself a £10,000 house with the proceeds.Bill McGinleyChesterRhiannon Lucy Cosslett rightly highlights the disastrous impact of corporate takeovers of local cafes, not just on Hampstead Heath inLondon, where four family-owned cafes are being taken over by the Australian-inspired chain Daisy Green, but across the country.Daisy Greenpublicly maintainsthat it’s not a chain, but it has around20 outletsand an annual turnover ofmore than £22m. It may not be Starbucks, but it’s still a big corporate, and far from the friendly, family-run cafes that heath users value so highly.Of course, the major villain is the City of London Corporation, which appears determined to turn the heath from a public benefit into a money-making enterprise, kicking out the family-run cafes as part of a plan to reduce the City’s funding and screw as much revenue as possible out of all those who enjoy the heath, its fresh air, ponds, cafes and health-giving properties. The corporation should be ashamed of itself and Daisy Green should do what another corporate,Benugo, did the last time the City tried this on: walk away from the contract immediately.Don KellerHarringay, LondonExplore more on these topicsGentrificationFoodCommunitiesLondonStarbuckslettersShareReuse this content"

I have been visiting Australia for many years – our son and his family live in Sydney. The locals, on hearing my accent, mostly respond by saying “Sorry about the cricket, mate.” It’s not in a gloating or superior way, but in a genuine sense of puzzlement at how when we have often promised a real contest we perform like a malfunctioning firework.As Emma observes, in Australia cricket is a national obsession and accessible to all, either to watch or to play. In England it has become elitist, with free-to-air TV coverage long gone, the cost of going to a game increasingly prohibitive and the county game’s importance as a place to learn having been eroded. In spite of a loyal and well-heeled bunch of supporters, epitomised by the Barmy Army, it has become a minority sport, and the poorer for it.Until cricket is opened up to all, our national team will continue to struggle; one day we may really be marking the death of English cricket.Chris SmithExeterEmma John’s analysis of how cricket is cherished in Australia while it withers on the vine here reflects a wider trend. I visited India in 2014, and every patch of wasteland was hosting a pickup game of cricket, with the outfield packed with 50-plus participants. In eight years of walking my dogs around my local park here in Manchester, the artificial cricket strip has been used fewer than four times a summer, while the football pitches are in constant use by boys and girls.Cricketin England is dying as a participation sport.Richard HoughtonManchesterEmma John’s enlightening article reflects well on Australian cricket from an outsider’s perspective, and is respectful. How many times did we hear “worst Aussie team ever” and “England 5-0” before the Test series? So many times England and their fans swagger into this country and carry on in a disrespectful manner. And who will forgetthe behaviour in the Long Room at Lord’sin 2023? There was no better feeling than sending them packing.Simon CavenaghSydney, AustraliaWhat a lovely article. Having immigrated from England 44 years ago, the cricket has been a constant delight. Summer would not be complete without it and yes, it is as present as the beach, or surfing, or barbecues. I love the vision of a late summer afternoon, golden light, long shadows and an Australian batsman striding into the middle at the SCG. It feels like home. Long may it continue.Anthony WoodSydney, AustraliaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The latter was shortlisted for an international literary award. That’s £1,500 earned in 10 years. Before turning to writing full-time, I worked in other areas: in local government, and as a teacher and academic.Writing novels requires just as much commitment and effort, but is abysmally paid in comparison. The problem is that the publishing industry has exempted itself from all labour laws: you work for years in the hope of future income, there’s no annual leave, no sick leave and you can be dismissed – without recourse to employment tribunal – if your agent happens to think you’re not earning them enough money.I operate in a rogue industry, and have to scrounge and lie and cheat to stay afloat. I am cut off from my former peers who still lead salaried lives, and feel closer now to my neighbours who live on benefits. I can’t afford to go to the theatre. I avoid exhibitions that are ticketed. I buy books secondhand. Reading novels might make you happy, but poverty can lie behind the richest of stories.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Downing Street made it clear Keir Starmer had lost confidence and fellow chiefs told him his clinging to office risked damaging the police’s reputation nationally.It also became clear to Guildford, who had a £220,000-a-year salary and will retire on a full pension, that the row would be a distraction for months. One senior policing source had described him after the report as a “dead man walking”.The deal for his departure was done on Friday with Foster agreeing to the decision, which crucially meant a potential legal battle would be avoided.The force had advised Birmingham’s safety advisory group in October thatMaccabi Tel Avivfans were too dangerous to be allowed to attend a 6 November Europa League game against Aston Villa.Bit by bit the intelligence case unravelled, but sources told the Guardian that the ousted chief constable still believed the decision had been “made on good grounds, and kept everyone safe”.The report by Andy Cooke, the chief inspector of constabulary, attacked the force’s credibility in trying to justify the ban, and the home secretary is expected to use a police reform white paper due out by 28 January to give herself power to sack chiefs she deems to be failing.Mahmood, having claimed a scalp demanded by the right as well as significant figures in her party, said:“The findings of the chief inspector were damning. They set out a catalogue of failings that have harmed trust in West Midlands police.“By stepping down, Craig Guildford has done the right thing today. I would like to acknowledge his years of service. And I pay tribute to the work of the officers in West Midlands police who keep their community safe every day. Today marks a crucial first step to rebuilding trust and confidence in the force amongst all the communities they serve.”Guildford, a police officer for 32 years, has been chief of the West Midlands force since 2022 and boosted its crime-fighting and service to the public. He said: “I have come to the conclusion that the political and media frenzy around myself and my position has become detrimental to all the great work undertaken by my officers and staff in serving communities across the West Midlands.“I have carefully considered my position and concluded that retirement is in the best interests of the organisation, myself and my family. With the force’s dedicated and hard-working workforce, together we have turned this force around.”Foster said Guildford’s retirement, first revealed by the Guardian, meant he had “acted with honour and in the best interests of West Midlands police and our region. I welcome his decision.”“I am pleased this outcome has been reached having regard to due process and the law,” added Foster, who had faced criticism from some for not immediately sacking Guildford after the scathing report. “That has prevented what might otherwise have been a complex procedure that would have caused significant distraction, impact and cost to West Midlands police and the wider West Midlands.”Foster will now have to find a new chief constable for the Birmingham-headquartered force. Scott Green, the force’s deputy chief constable, will step into the role temporarily.Senior sources accept there is a shortage of capable police leaders.Central to West Midlands police’s defence as they planned for the Birmingham game was information from Dutch police. The force said this intelligence led it to believe Maccabi fans had been perpetrators of violence during a match against Ajax in Amsterdam in November 2024.But Dutch police disputed this claim, saying the cause of trouble before the Amsterdam game was much more mixed, with Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian supporters provoking one another. Cooke’s report found that West Midlands police had “greatly exaggerated” the problems in Amsterdam.Police intelligence emerged showing Guildford’s force had been told some locals might arm themselves if Israeli fans turned up, which led to claims the ban amounted to caving in to antisemitism. News of it emerged a fortnight after a terrorist attack left two dead at a synagogue in Manchester.Guildford testified twice before MPs on the home affairs committee, with each appearance prompting further criticism. In the first hearing, he admitted part of a force dossier contained a reference to a Maccabi game against West Ham that never happened, and it had been gathered erroneously using artificial intelligence. The report from MPs is expected to be more savage than Cooke’s.Two of the most prominent Jewish groups, Campaign Against Antisemitism and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, backed Guildford’s departure, and the latter said it would work with Guildford’s successor “to restore confidence”.The independent Birmingham MP Ayoub Khan said: “Today an honourable man of integrity has been ruthlessly scapegoated and discarded in favour of appeasing hooligans and the very violence his actions prevented. This was not accountability, it was a witch-hunt.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceWest MidlandsBirminghamShabana MahmoodAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This variant cannot be spread to others, but it can turn into active, contagious TB in the future if it is not treated.Dr Roger Gajraj, a consultant in health protection withUKHSA, said it identified a small number of individuals at the site who were “responding well to treatment and are no longer infectious, so pose no onward risk”.“As a precaution, and in line with national guidance, we are offering testing to those who may have had closer contact with the affected individuals. The overall risk remains low,” he added.“TB is fully treatable with antibiotics. We continue to work closely with Amazon to monitor the situation.”Amazon said that after some cases were identified “we immediately followed guidance from the NHS and UKHSA and made all employees potentially affected aware of the situation. Out of an abundance of caution, we are currently running an expanded screening programme with the NHS.”A spokesperson said the company had briefed the whole site on the situation: “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our team members.”Amanda Gearing, a senior GMB union organiser for the site, called for “immediate and decisive action – including the temporary closure of Amazon Coventry” warehouse, until appropriate infection control measures had been implemented to prevent the further spread of TB.The GMB said multiple cases of tuberculosis had been reported at the site, with NHS staff attending this week to perform blood tests on members of staff.One Amazon worker said there were concerns that the high level of migrant workers at the site meant many people would be vulnerable because they would not have had vaccinations in their home country.The main symptoms of TB are a cough that lasts more than three weeks, exhaustion, high temperature, night sweats and unexplained weight loss. The disease is caused by bacteria and can spread through close contact with people who have TB with symptoms.A spokesperson for Coventry city council said: “We encourage all residents to be aware of the symptoms of tuberculosis following a rise in cases across the country. Our advice to people is that TB testing and treatment is free to everyone on the NHS, regardless of immigration status. Anyone experiencing symptoms should contact their GP or NHS 111 without delay.”In 2024, the number of people notified to have the disease rose by 13.6% to 5,490 people. The rate of notifications at 9.4 per 100,000 population, is now only just below the World Health Organization threshold of 10 per 100,000 for a low incidence country and continuing to rise, according to agovernment reportreleased in October.The warehouse in Coventry has been the site of industrial action; Amazonnarrowly defeateda recognition vote there in 2024.Explore more on these topicsAmazonTuberculosisHealthInternetE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

The hospital where he worked – OSF Saint Anthony medical center – has said it is cooperating with the investigation. He is currently being held after he waived his right to an extradition hearing Monday. His next hearing in Winnebago county, Illinois, is scheduled for 23 January.Elaine Bryant , the Columbus police chief, said in an Associated Press interview on Wednesday that authorities now believe McKee was the person seen walking down a dark alley near the Tepes’ home in video footage from the night of the murders. His vehicle has also been identified traveling near the house, and a firearm found in his Illinois residence also matched evidence at the scene, she said. Authorities have not disclosed what type of firearm was used in the killing.View image in fullscreenMichael David McKee walking into the courtroom on Monday, 12 January 2026, in Rockford, Illinois.Photograph: APHis arrest attracted national attention across the US, capping off nearly two weeks of speculation surrounding the Tepes’ killings.

Police also said no weapon was found there, and murder-suicide was not suspected.Nothing was stolen and the couple’s two young children and their dog were left unharmed in the home.Byrant said police are encouraging the public to keep the tips coming. She said emails, phone calls and other messages left with Columbus police helped them to gather enough evidence to make an arrest.“We want to thank our community specifically for stepping up, reaching out, giving us the information and being open to sharing that with us,” she said. “It has been tremendous.”Explore more on these topicsUS crimeOhioIllinoisnewsShareReuse this content"

It is already prescribed more widely inScotlandand Wales, a disparity charities said had created a postcode lottery.The NHS said the rollout in England had been secured with the support of campaigners including ProstateCancerUK. The decision means about 8,000 men will be eligible for the drug each year, and within this group it is expected to reduce deaths from prostate cancer from about 1,900 to fewer than 1,000.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, affecting one in eight in the UK, with about 55,300 new diagnoses and 12,200 deaths a year.Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director atNHSEngland, said thousands of men could “kickstart their year with the news that they will have a better chance of living longer and healthier lives”.He said: “The NHS will continue to work hard to offer people the most effective and evidence-based treatments, with several new prostate cancer drugs rolled out over the last five years.”Abiraterone will be given in combination with a steroid, prednisolone, and standard treatments including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy.A clinical trial led by researchers at University College London and the Institute of Cancer Research found the drug could halve the risk of prostate cancer coming back and reduce the risk of death by 40% when the disease had not spread beyond the prostate.Prostate Cancer UK estimates the decision will save more than 3,000 lives over the next five years.Amy Rylance, an assistant director of health improvement at the charity, said: “This decision is a momentous, life-saving victory for the thousands of men whose lives will now be saved.“Until now, men in England have found themselves in an impossible situation. It’s terrifying to be told you’ve got a cancer that’s likely to spread – to then find out you can’t access the treatment that science has proven to be your best chance at surviving is completely devastating.”She added: “We refused to accept this outcome for men and we didn’t stop until we changed it..”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said he was “delighted” by the decision, adding that abiraterone “significantly improves survival rates and can give patients precious extra years of life”.He added: “We’re backing the best clinical evidence, making smart funding decisions and ensuring patients get the care they need when they need it most.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerCancerNHSMen's healthHealthEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

She recently raved about a dinner there that included langoustine and scallops with Rangpur lime and Spanish sweet limetta, and a “heavenly” guava roll with Shikuwasa mandarin.When Slotover visited the Todolí farm, he was awestruck. “It was like the Garden of Eden”, he said. “I just cannot tell you what the experience was like … I knew about oranges and lemons and limes and grapefruit. I didn’t know about tangelos and finger limes and citrons and pomelo.”He tries to source most of the food on his European-inspired menu from the UK. “But citrus is too good to miss,” he said, during a visit to the Oxford RealFarmingconference earlier this month. He teamed up with other chefs to bring over some rare varieties from the farm, and they became so popular he passed distribution over to the organic food supplier Shrub, which sells them to chefs across London.Finger limes, also known as caviar limes, frequently feature on Slotover’s menu. They contain zesty pearls that burst in the mouth and have a fragrant sweet-and-sour flavour.View image in fullscreenFinger limes.Photograph: ShrubThe citrus collection had no commercial purpose before the chefs discovered it. “When we first approached the owner Vincente [Todolí, the former Tate Modern director], he said: ‘We don’t really sell it. We give it to friends, we have an Italian guy who makes ice-cream with it.’ And what we’ve been doing with it since has been really helpful to the farm,” Slotover said.The foundation’s technical director, Óscar Olivares-Fuster, said it operated differently to the commercial farms nearby.“Spain is the world’s largest exporter of fresh citrus,” he said. “We at Todolí do organic, we don’t use pesticides, we work with nature. Our climate, the cold nights, warm days and sea breeze help us with all our varieties, more or less.”Rather than using artificial irrigation, which is water-intensive, they have learned from the ancient Arab practices and use irrigation ditches and ponds, which are not only attractive to look at but store water very well.They have also created a haven for songbirds previously linked to Valencia’s citrus groves but which have been wiped out by herbicides and insecticides.“We have a bank of genes here, with hundreds of varieties of citrus. This is something unique to study,” Olivares-Fuster said. “Investigating these will be key for citrus to survive all the challenges that are coming, including climate change. Eventually, citrus will be grown north of the Pyrenees and we might struggle in the south.”View image in fullscreenThe foundation offers tours of the farm by appointment.Photograph: ShrubOne of his favourite varieties to grow is the trifoliate orange. It is a small, very sharp fruit used mostly in jams and marmalades or as a substitute for lemon zest in recipes.He said it was interesting because unlike other citrus varieties “it will shed its leaves in winter. This means it can be very resistant to cold”. Perhaps scientists could use this genetic trait to help other citrus varieties survive in colder climates, he suggested.The farm grows 40 Japanese citrus varieties, including the Kiyomi tangor, but also the Valentine pomelo, a sweet fruit often grown in California. Chefs are keen on calamansi, a small, sour fruit originally from the Philippines, and the fragrant Borneo lumia.Explore more on these topicsFarmingFruitSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The subsequent “rapid increase to high flow again” could have dislodged part of the fatberg accumulated behind the bulkhead door.A similar drop and then increase in pressure, this time “due to wet weather”, occurred on 11 January 2025.“This rapid change in instantaneous flow could also have given rise to the debris ball landings in January 2025,” the report states.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe report notes “this area is large enough to hold a sufficient quantity of FOG that could generate the debris ball landings in October 2024 and January 2025”.Sydney Waterinitially denied its sewerage system was responsible, stating in November 2024 that “there have been no issues with the normal operations of the Bondi or Malabar wastewater treatment plants”.“Sydney Water acknowledges the tar balls may have absorbed wastewater discharge, which was already present in the water while forming, however, they did not form as a result of our wastewater discharges,” a spokesperson said at the time.View image in fullscreenMysterious black ball-shaped debris first washed up on Coogee beach in October 2024.Composite: Randwick City councilThe EPA admitted in November last year – after Guardian Australia reported ona separate secret oceanographic modellingstudy – that evidence “collected by Sydney Water … narrowed the origin of the debris to within the Malabar system”. The Malabar outfall started operating in 1990.The latest report reveals “Sydney Water’s working hypothesis is that a significant amount of FOG has accumulated in the intersection chamber between the DOOF bulkhead stopboards and the ocean outfall tunnel over time”.The bulkhead door is usually under water, and can only be opened at low tide and during low flows in the system. The report states it is impossible to safely go beyond the stopboards. The huge fatberg is thought to be in a 300 cubic metre chamber beyond the stopboards.Sydney Water is now regularly cleaning the accessible part, which is “an extremely risky operation”. In April 2025, it removed 53 tonnes of accumulated FOG, including debris balls, the report states.“This material had not consolidated into a large single mass such as that seen in sewer networks and commonly referred to as ‘fatbergs’ but rather could be broken up.” But, the report notes, “an accumulation of FOG in this area is possible”.The cause of the debris balls was likely that “FOG had accumulated on the landward side of the intersection chamber and that this build up had been captured in a quiescent zone”.Then, “the sudden drop in flow followed by the sudden increase in flow drew this material into the main flow path and pushed it through the DOOF exiting from one or more risers, diffusers and nozzles”. The debris ballsincluded human faeces.Unlike most cities, Sydney only does primary treatment of its sewage – straining out the solids. Elsewhere, secondary treatment uses settlement tanks and disinfection techniques before releasing the wastewater or recycling it.Singapore, for example, treats its sewage to such a high level that it can be reused in the drinking water system.The August report reveals that FOG in the Malabar wastewater system have risen by 39% over the past 10 years. Volatile organic compounds – including cleaning products, cosmetics, paint, fuels and other chemicals – have risen by 125%.“The current best thinking is that concentrations are so high in the system that there has been a significant increase in accumulation and that FOG is now escaping wherever possible, often in wet weather events through hydraulic relief structures in the network and less frequently from the deep ocean outfall,” the report states.Poo balls mapFatbergs have caused problems in other cities – but in different ways.In London in 2017, a fatbergweighing the same as 11 double-decker buses and stretching the length of two football pitches was found to be blocking a section of London’s ageing sewage network.The congealed mass of fat, wet wipes and nappies took three weeks to remove.New York City spends about $19m a yearremoving fatbergs from its sewers and is running a campaign “trash it, don’t flush it”.Sydney Water’s options to deal with its potentially huge fatberg are limited. The corporation told the EPA it plans to continue cleaning the part of the bulkhead it can access, while devising campaigns to try to dissuade Sydneysiders from putting FOG down the drain.It plans to initiate a trade waste program for food businesses. It estimates up to 12,000 retailers could be operating without waste approvals in the Malabar catchment, and they might be “significant contributors to FOG loads”.View image in fullscreenWastewater systems in greater Sydney.Illustration: Sydney Water“We are reviewing operational and maintenance practices, including regular inspections of accessible areas, and strengthening fats, oils and grease management through ongoing cleanouts, trade waste customer engagement, source control reviews, and community education on proper disposal practices,” a Sydney Water spokesperson says.“The EPA has advised that all Sydney Water facilities involved were operating in compliance with their environment licences during the events. Any regulatory outcomes, including potential penalties, are determined independently by the EPA.”The state water minister, Rose Jackson, announced on Friday – after Guardian Australia asked questions about the findings of the secret August report on Thursday – a “Malabar system investment program estimated at $3bn over the next 10 years”.“[It] will reduce the volume of wastewater that needs to be treated and discharged via the Malabar deep ocean outfall,” Jackson said in a statement.NSW regulator chose to reveal content of Sydney’s mystery beach balls on day of US electionRead moreBut some say it’s time for a fundamental shift in thinking.“The outfalls are old school technology, and our sewerage system needs tobe modernised,” the Total Environment Centre’s Jeff Angel says.“This should mean a higher level of treatment, but also and importantly, much more recycling, so there is less being dumped into the ocean and to conserve our water resources.”Guardian Australia reported 12 months ago that Sydney Water planned to spend about $32bn to improve the city’s sewerage system over the next 15 years, butwaste would continue to be pumped into the oceanoff its famous beaches.A spokesperson for the EPA said this week it was working closely with Sydney Water to establish a program for the removal of built-up fats, oils and grease from the bulkhead area at Malabar.“As part of Sydney Water’s environment protection licence review, we are considering this build-up in consultation with the wastewater expert panel,” they said. “We expect to finalise licence variations by mid-February.”Do you know more?

Photographs by Wara VargasFri 16 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareIn the small town of Chipaya, everything is dry. Only a few people walk along the sandy streets, and many houses look abandoned – some secured with a padlock. The wind is so strong that it forces you to close your eyes.Chipaya lies onBolivia’s Altiplano, 35 miles from the Chilean border. The vast plateau, nearly 4,000 metres above sea level, feels almost empty of people and animals, its solitude framed by snow-capped volcanoes. It raises the question: can anybody possibly live here?“We are the first inhabitants of South America,” says Flora Mamani Felipe, Chipaya’s first female mayor. “We arean ancient culture, and we’re now in danger of extinction. There are no jobs; people are migrating to Chile.”View image in fullscreenFlora Mamani Felipe, mayor of Chipaya, in her office in the townThe Indigenous leader – whose full title is Langsni Pagh Mä Eph of the Uru Chipaya people – is sitting in her office next to the town’s central square. Even this part of Chipaya feels empty, its offices mostly deserted.The Uru Chipaya are at risk of extinction asthe climate crisis dries up their landand their way of life. Once known as the “people of water”, they have seen drought, rising salt levels and migration push their traditions to the brink.An interactive ‘slider’ showing satellite photos of a lake drying up almost entirely  between 2013 and 2016Lake Poopó, once Bolivia’s second-largest lake and an important fishing resource for local communities, has dried upThe nearby Lake Poopó, once the second largest in Bolivia,has vanishedand crops are failing. As a result, most of Chipaya’s2,000 inhabitantshave left for Chile to work. Local leaders say poverty, cultural erosion and health problems from salty water threaten those who remain.Gabriel Moreno, an anthropologist at Bolivia’s Technical University of Oruro, says: “TheUru Chipaya are part of Bolivia’s cultural heritage. It’s one of the oldest Indigenous cultures in Latin America, dating back 3,000 to 4,000 years. And at the moment, there is a project intending to declare the Uru Chipaya as the oldest living culture in the world. It will be presented to Unesco in 2026.”Moreno works on projects in Uru Chipaya territory, including cultivating thetotorabulrush reed as alternative animal fodder – crucial during drought to reduce food insecurity and climate vulnerability.View image in fullscreenSevero Paredes Condori rears sheep on land he inherited from his grandparents. He says his animals are suffering because the earth has become more salineSevero Paredes Condori, 63, is Uru Chipaya like his ancestors – but perhaps his descendants will not be. Living conditions, he says, have grown harsher. “There are no jobs here, you can’t live here any more.”View image in fullscreenParedes lives in a round clay house that is typical of the Uru Chipaya people, who fear their culture is dying outEach year, he adds, they wash the soil to reduce salinity so crops can grow – but the effect lasts only 12 months. “We can cultivate quinoa, but after a year comes the salt, and the ground gets white, and then it doesn’t fit for quinoa. Too much salt destroys the grass for the animals.”Paredes lives in one of the round clay houses typical of the Uru Chipaya, about 30 minutes from town, and herds sheep. Once, people here cultivated quinoa and grass for livestock. Now, drought, floods, frost and ever-rising salt levels kill llamas and sheep and wipe out quinoa.The challenge of salt extends far beyond Chipaya, says Mohammed Mofizur Rahman, an environmental researcher from Bangladesh based at thePotsdam Institute for Climate Impact Researchin Germany. “This situation parallels the rice crop losses in the Asian mega-deltas, where high salinity in soil and water severely undermines agricultural productivity.”View image in fullscreenParedes says there are no jobs in Chipaya. As a result, many inhabitants have left the town for ChileAccording toChipaya mythology, the Uru Chipaya have always lived near water. Moreno says: “The Uru Chipaya have climate resilience. They know how to divert water from the Lauca River, an impressive example of ancestral water management engineering. It is not for nothing they were called the men of water.”‘The Dubai of South America’: how the promise of riches from lithium mining turned to dust in BoliviaRead moreYet the water is vanishing. The ground around Chipaya glows white, as if dusted with snow – a thin crust of salt that signals deeper trouble. Already saline, the soil is becoming even more salty.Mamani says: “There are no birds any more. We used to fish for trout in this river, but there are no fish now. Climate change brings floods and droughts. We’re desperate.”Most families have relatives inChileand an estimated 60% of people in Chipaya hold Chilean nationality, according to Mamani. Migration brings cultural loss: people face discrimination or stop practising their rituals, speaking their language and wearing traditional clothing when they leave their territory.View image in fullscreenMamani visits the Ayparavi community to check the water supply“There is a lot of migration to Chile,” says Mamani. “The children who study there no longer speak our language, only Spanish. My daughter also speaks very little now. The history of Uru Chipaya is sad.”Paredes says: “I have grandchildren in Chile. They don’t even have a Bolivian identity card, just a Chilean one. I only see my son once a year. They are growing vegetables and earning money. Without work, one cannot live.”Poverty has long been severe among the Uru Chipaya peopleand the country’s 2024 censusshows 67.12% of Chipaya today are considered poor.That Chipaya still exists is almost a miracle, says Moreno. “If it weren’t for school and college in Chipaya, the Uru Chipaya people and culture would disappear. Only elderly people are staying, and there are only children and teenagers because of the schools. They are the ones sustaining the population.”View image in fullscreenSebastián Quispe Lázaro is in charge of tourism management in Chipaya and runs a hostel. He says fewer and fewer people are comingSebastián Quispe Lázaro, 67, Chipaya’s tourism leader, has witnessed the change brought about by the climate crisis. “When I was a child, the sky was always blue this time of the year. Now we have all four seasons in one day. The weather has changed completely,” he says.“With this frost, it’s damaging the grass; it has no vitamins left. Animals stay thin when they eat that grass. And in September and October, they die.”He talks of the rituals that have allowed the Uru Chipaya people to coexist with this harsh environment for thousands of years – but rituals cannot halt salinity.“Pastures are gone. With the humidity and the cold, the salt is coming out, burning the grass,” he says. “And I must use boiled water from a special well because the normal well is already salty. Too much salt causes diarrhoea in the animals, and they die.”View image in fullscreenLucia Felipe Mamani from Chipaya cleans quinoa. She says the winds are getting stronger and the quinoa is blown away. She can no longer clean it without losing someHumans suffer similar effects. Juan Condori, 42, has worked in health in Chipaya for 15 years. “There is quite a change in the diseases. Now people come a lot with diarrhoea and coughs,” he says.Rahman adds: “Diarrhoea from consuming saline water is only the tip of the iceberg. Evidence from other parts of the world links high salinity to eclampsia and hypertension, which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Further investigation in Chipaya could reveal the full extent of these unknown health impacts.”People’s diets are changing too, says Condori. “People used to harvest quinoa and eat it. But salt burns the quinoa. Now people buy pasta and rice in the city. They eat chicken and french fries and that stuff.”For Moreno, rescuing this ancient culture is a matter of urgency. “The Uru Chipaya people have suffered cultural loss – oral memory, territory and sacred spaces,” he says. “We must protect their oral memory. We must strengthen the bond between elders and young people to work on this.”View image in fullscreenAntonio Alave Lopez is a leader in the village of Ayparavi.

Photograph: Oded Balilty/APArchitects and designers have recycled ancient practice of collecting rainwater to make buildings ecologically friendlyByAmy Hawkins, senior China correspondentFri 16 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 11.29 ESTShareWhen the legendary Taiwanese rock band Mayday were due to perform in Beijing one evening in May 2023, some fans were worried that the rainy weather could affect the show. Mayday were taking to the stage inBeijing’s National Stadium, also known as the Bird’s Nest, built for the 2008 Olympics. Like the real-life twig piles that give the building its nickname, the stadium is built with an intricate and highly porous lattice, made of steel.“Don’t worry too much,” reassured an article published by the official newsletter for China’s ministry of water resources. “The Bird’s Nest also has its ‘secret weapon’!”View image in fullscreenA worker sweeps the track at the National Stadium during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which was disrupted by heavy rain.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe secret weapon is a network of capillary-like tubes that weave through the Bird’s Nest’s outer lattice, which are specifically designed to siphon away rainfall. The pipes channel rainwater into one of three underwater storage tanks, where it is filtered and prepared for recycling within the building. According to the water resources ministry, at least 50% of the stadium’s water needs – from flushing toilets to washing the running tracks to watering the lawns – can be met with the reused rainwater. In total, the water system surrounding the Bird’s Nest can treat 58,000 tonnes of rainwater each year.The Bird’s Nest is one of the most pioneering examples of China’s focus on the practice known as “urban rainwater harvesting” (URWH), but it is not the only one. All over China, major buildings are constructed with a focus on URWH.Across the road from the Bird’s Nest, the National Aquatics Centre is covered with a specially designed rainwater harvesting system that can collect approximately 10,000 tonnes of rainwater a year, equivalent to the amount used by 100 households.View image in fullscreenThunderstorms over the Aquatics Centre in Beijing, which was designed to collect up to 10,000 tonnes of rainwater a year.Photograph: CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesAccording to the Beijing local government, the city reuses 50m cubic metres of rainwater each year. Along with other sources, such as runoff from bathrooms, more than 30% of Beijing’s water needs are met by reused water.It is not just public infrastructure that uses URWH. In 2022 the drone company DJI unveiled a shiny new headquarters in Shenzhen. The two office blocks are topped with sky gardens and include an integrated rainwater harvesting system for irrigating the lawns.View image in fullscreenThe roof gardens of the headquarters of DJI in Shenzhen, where water is collected and used to irrigate the plants.Photograph: Xinhua/AlamyChina’s use of URWH is intimately linked to the “sponge city” concept, anurban planning strategybased on ancient water systems that was brought into the modern era byYu Kongjian, a landscape architect who founded the influential architecture firm Turenscape.Sponge citiesuse green spaces, wetlands and permeable paving, along with traditional drainage systems, to help mitigate flood risks, especially in China’s humid south.But the concept of reusing the rainwater that is captured in sponge city designs is particularly pertinent in China’s dry north, which is blighted byseasonal droughts. Managing water flows across the country haschallenged China’s rulers for millennia. From as early as the Qin and Han dynasties, there are records of ponds being constructed to store domestic rainwater.View image in fullscreenA wet evening in Shanghai.Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy“China has a special affinity for rainwater,” says Wang Dong, the director general of the ecological city studio at Turenscape. In traditional Chinese homes, buildings are situated around a central courtyard. Wang explains that in ancient times the rooftops of the buildings were designed to collect water, which represented wealth, and divert it into the home’s interior rather than letting it flow away. In this way, wealth from all directions could be stored in the family home.“Chinese people have long highly valued the utilisation of water resources, it is deeply embedded in our DNA,” Wang adds.In 1995 the Chinese Communist party (CCP) hosted China’s first modern-day national seminar of rainwater utilisation in Lanzhou, a dry northern city that abuts the Gobi desert. In the following decades, URWH started to be incorporated into official engineering codes, with the 2008 Olympics being the perfect opportunity to showcase these designs. As Yu’s “sponge city” concept grew in popularity in the 2010s, and was adopted as an official strategy by the Chinese government in 2014, URWH became fundamental to China’s national planning. Now, the government’s official target is for 70% of rainfall in sponge cities to be reused.According to Chinese media reports, the size of China’s URWH industry, including products such as storage tanks and filtration systems, reached 126bn yuan (£13.5bn) in 2023, with further growth expected.View image in fullscreenIn China, creating buildings that reuse rainwater is a fundamental part of the development process.Photograph: German Vogel/AlamyReusing the rainwater is not as simple as collecting it and pumping it into the building’s pipes. Effectively storing, treating and repurposing the water requires designing buildings with a parallel “grey” water system to keep the recycled fluids separate from purified drinking water.But it is a challenge that architects relish. In China, designs that absorb and reuse rainwater effectively are “absolutely fundamental to the development”, says Dan Sibert, a senior partner at the architecture firm Foster and Partners, who has worked on several projects in China that incorporate URWH, such as the DJI headquarters in Shenzhen. “It’s not a sort of add-on that comes a bit later on.”He says: “For us as architects, what’s really exciting is how do you utilise the thing that could be a constraint to make the lives of the people in the buildings and around the buildings much better?”As well as being good for the environment, Sibert says URWH enhances the experience of people using China’s modern buildings, because they feel they are in an ecologically friendly space. “If you’re flushing the toilet using grey water, it’s good that people know that,” he says.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsThe alternativesWaterChinaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in a retrial in Decemberhe was found guilty of her murderafter their child came forward with new evidence under double jeopardy rules.Rhodes cut Dawn’s throat in the kitchen of their family home in 2016 after he found out she was having an affair with a work colleague. He had plotted the murder for months, and duped their child – who was under the age of 10 – into helping him carry out the fatal attack.Rhodes, a carpenter, then spun a web of lies to pretend he had inflicted the fatal wound to his wife in self-defence and “gaslit” his child into supporting his false story. He was acquitted at an Old Bailey trial in 2017 but, in 2021, his traumatised child told a therapist and then the police what had really happened.After murdering his wife, Rhodes had stabbed himself and slashed his child’s arm in an attempt to bolster his self-defence claim.At the Inner London crown court on Friday, Mrs Justice Ellenbogen sentenced Rhodes to life in prison for the murder with a minimum term of 29 and a half years.Rhodes was also found guilty in December of two counts of perjury for false evidence at his Old Bailey trial and in the family courts in 2018, perverting the course of justice, and child cruelty. The judge imposed concurrent jail sentences for those charges.He refused to come to court to face his sentencing hearing, and instead sent a message through his lawyer saying he “maintains his innocence”. The judge branded Rhodes a “coward” for refusing to leave his prison cell, saying this added to his existing list of “malignant characteristics”.“You brutally murdered your estranged wife, Dawn Rhodes,” said the judge, concluding the motive was sexual jealousy. “Your wicked and callous acts have had a devastating and divisive effect on Dawn’s family and your own.”At the hearing, the child – who cannot be named for legal reasons – told the judge they had been left with lifelong mental health struggles and a scar on their arm inflicted by their own father. “While the symptoms can be managed, the traumatic experiences Robert Rhodes put me through will never go away,” they said.Dawn’s mother, Liz Spencer, told the court in an impact statement: “I have waited nearly 10 years for this result. I don’t look upon the result as justice, but I feel for the first time my daughter’s voice is being heard.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It stemmed from their objection to another nurse, Rose Henderson, a trans woman, being allowed to use the women’s changing facilities.In a judgment handed down to the parties on Friday, Judge Sweeney said: “The trust subjected the claimants to harassment related to sex and gender reassignment by permitting the claimants’ biological male, trans woman colleague to use the female changing room and requiring the claimants to share that changing room without providing suitable alternative facilities.”The ruling said the trust also subjected the nurses to harassment by not taking their concerns seriously. “This included referring to the need for the claimants to be educated on trans rights and to broaden their mindsets, the later provision of inadequate and unsuitable changing facilities for those who objected to sharing the female changing room with that colleague.”Sweeney said: “The above conduct had the effect of violating the dignity of the claimants and creating a hostile, intimidating, humiliating and degrading environment for them.”The nurses claimed during the tribunal hearing in Newcastle that Henderson stared at them, and one of the nurses alleged that Henderson asked her three times if she was going to get changed.The tribunal dismissed as “not well-founded” complaints about Henderson’s conduct, saying she “did not behave improperly whilst using the changing room”.But it said that “in no way diminishes these very real and genuine perceptions of the claimants, all of whom were fearful of the risks at the very least, to their dignity, bodily integrity and privacy”.Henderson, an operating theatre practitioner, in her evidence described how “upsetting” it had been to see “hordes of people” posting insults online after the case came to public attention.After the judgment, Bethany Hutchison, the nurse who led the claim, which was backed by the Christian Legal Centre, said it was a “victory for common sense”. She said: “Today the tribunal has confirmed what we have said from the beginning, that requiring women to undress in front of men is not equality, it is a violation of our dignity.“This judgment recognised the intolerable and degrading situations women have been placed in.”She added: “Today is a turning point, but it is not the end. AllNHStrusts across the country must urgently review their policies and ensure they are lawful and protective of women.”At a press conference in Newcastle, the women said they had compassion for Henderson. Lisa Lockey, one of the claimants, said: “We never wanted to hurt Rose,” and blamed the NHS trust for Henderson being put in that situation.Lockey said women needed to be listened to. “We’ve experienced such a silencing, that we weren’t allowed to complain and we were gaslighted by our trust,” she said. “I felt like I was such a terrible person for having the audacity to complain about this.Womenshouldn’t be made to feel like that. It’s wrong.”Ministers have said they will not be rushed into giving guidance on same-sex spaces but Hutchison said they needed to speed things up. She said: “They’re clearly dragging their feet and they need to pick up the pace. This is not a difficult thing to work out. It’s pretty simple and I think this ruling has shown that.”Lockey said: “We hope that the rest of the NHS follows suit with dealing with the situation, with making safe spaces for women. Obviously we are aware that it’s happening elsewhere.”Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, said there should be no further need for legal cases on the subject: “It’s clear here – biological men are men, women are women, and that should be clearly recognised by the NHS policy.”The 134-page ruling said Henderson was the only trans woman at the hospital to use the women’s changing rooms. It said no one in management or human resources “had any discussion with Rose about the appropriateness of using the female changing facilities, either during Rose’s time as a student or at any time after Rose became an employee of the trust”.The ruling said: “From the outset and throughout, it was simply accepted by management that Rose would use the changing room of Rose’s choice as Rose was transgender.”The tribunal also upheld the nurses’ complaint of indirect sex discrimination in that women were more likely than men to experience fear, distress or humiliation if they were required to change in front of a member of the opposite sex.The panel ruled that the trust had breached health and safety regulations and “had infringed the claimants’ right to respect for private life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights”.A spokesperson for NION (Not in Our Name) Women, a collective of women in support of the trans community, said77,000 women had signed a supportive letter.“A key message being put out in relation to the outcome of this case is that it should be a lesson to organisations to ‘listen to women’. However, it is crucial to note that not all women feel trans people should be excluded from gendered spaces.“The 77,000 signatories to our letter know that you can support women’s rights and be inclusive of trans people – the ideas are not contradictory.”The trust said: “We are taking time to review the judgment carefully and will comment further once we have had the opportunity to consider it in full.”Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawEmployment tribunalsWomenGenderTransgenderNHSNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Several changes were made to Wikipedia pages by a network of editors, allegedly controlled by a contractor working on Portland’s behalf.According to an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), Portland outsourced Wikipedia editing relating to some of its high-profile clients, including the state of Qatar.TBIJ said it had evidence of alleged Wikipedia edits made on behalf of Portland between 2016 and 2024. Between 2016 and 2021, many were made by Web3 Consulting, which is run by a consultant allegedly used by Portland to make edits.Portland was founded by Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, in 2001. There is no suggestion that Allan personally ordered any changes to be made or was aware of them. He sold most of his shares in the company in 2012 and left Portland in 2019. He was contacted for comment.A spokesperson for Portland said: “Portland does not have a relationship with the firm mentioned and has a policy of strict adherence to the guidelines on all social media platforms.”A Portland employee said: “If anyone who worked here in the past did this, they were foolish. For sure nobody does it today.”TBIJ said some of the alleged edits were designed to improve Qatar’s image by burying references to critical reporting before the 2022 World Cup.The intermediary is alleged to have removed suggestions that a billion-dollar philanthropy project linked to another Portland client had failed to achieve its mission.TBIJ found other subtle changes, such as relegating unwelcome information about clients under descriptions of their philanthropic work, or swapping out critical news references to articles with something more positive.Undisclosed paid advocacy on Wikipedia, also known as “black hat” editing,violates the terms of use set out by The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit body that supports the online encyclopedia.The practice of institutions, states and individuals finessing their Wikipedia pages to improve their image is frowned on by the PR industry.Guidelines on the use of “dark arts” in relation to Wikipedia, written by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), state: “Intentional deceit and anonymous or incognito activities are breaches of professional codes of conduct.” The CIPR is a voluntary members-based association to which Portland has not signed up.The rise of AI chatbots and summaries have made Wikipedia pages even more influential, as they are often a source for the tools.Portland has a history of making Wikipedia edits. In 2012,it was found to have made alterationson behalf of the company that produces Stella Artois, removing references on Wikipedia to an unwanted nickname, “wife beater”.At the time, it said the changes had been made openly and within Wikipedia’s rules.However, former employees told TBIJ that Portland instead began to contract out edits of Wikipedia, with one telling its reporters: “No one said: ‘We should stop doing this’. The question was how we could keep doing it without getting caught.”Several of its sources claimed Portland commissioned a web consultant, Radek Kotlarek, whose network of accounts made Wikipedia changes. TBIJ said seven Portland insiders said Kotlarek’s services were used.Kotlarek was contacted for comment, but did not respond.The TBIJ’s investigation claimed to have identified a network of 26 accounts making edits. They were linked to Web3 Consulting, Kotlarek’s company. TBIJ said that while its sources were confidential, it had been able to corroborate their information using the public record of Wikipedia edits.All accounts in this network that were still active in 2024 were blocked by volunteer Wikipedia editors, who investigated their activity.Six former Portland employees involved in some of the Qatar work reportedly said that Wikipedia edits were a common request. They claimed that Portland hired subcontractors to target pages related to Qatar’s human rights record, particularly around World Cup stadium-building.Some changes were performed by accounts outside the Web3 network.Companies other than Portland also worked on major accounts such as the Qatar government’s public relations.Allan has faced controversy since becoming Downing Street’s executive director of communications at the start of September, as part of Starmer’s attempt at a government-wide reset. Heretains a financial stakein another PR firm, Strand Partners, but has said he will not to take dividends or become involved in running the company while in government. He also resigned as chair on his appointment to No 10.He has also pushed for sweeping changes to political journalists’ access to Downing Street,including scrapping one of the two daily briefingswith the prime minister’s official spokesperson.In an email last month, Allan said the changes were necessary because the media landscape had been “utterly transformed”, making existing arrangements “not fit for purpose”. The group that represents political journalists was not consulted on the plan.Journalists warned the move towards ad hoc press conferences could restrict access and scrutiny.Explore more on these topicsWikipedianewsShareReuse this content"

The work can be imposed for between 40 and 300 hours and requires an offender, usually wearing a hi-vis jacket printed with the words “community payback”, to work on projects within the local area.Plans to limit jury trials in England and Wales may be watered down after backlashRead moreOfficials said in September that they planned to give probation officers the power to take and publish the names and pictures of individuals ordered by courts to tidy grass verges, litter-pick and scrub graffiti. Nearly 5m hours of unpaid work was carried out in the year to April 2024.Amid a planned rapid expansion of “community payback”, officials argued that publishing the names and photos of offenders would demonstrate to the public that justice was being delivered.The powers were written into clause 35 of the sentencing bill, but has faced criticism from senior figures involved in probation. Martin Jones, HM chief inspector of probation, told the Guardian it could result in more offenders dropping out. “If offenders are turning up to do the work I do not see a reason why they should also have their images published,” he said.Ian Lawrence, the general secretary of Napo, the probation officers’ union, had said the change would bring shame on families of offenders, particularly children. “This proposed policy serves no value to the rehabilitation of offenders but could have potentially devastating effects on innocent family members, namely children,” he said.View image in fullscreenJames Timpson has said ‘unpaid work will continue to be tough and visible enough without the addition of this specific measure’.Photograph: Parliament TV/PAJames Timpson, the prisons minister, announced that the government would drop the policy as the House of Lords debated the bill earlier this month. He said: “I am satisfied that the current delivery of unpaid work, bolstered by the wider provisions in the bill, means that unpaid work will continue to be tough and visible enough without the addition of this specific measure.”The Labour government has faced criticism for chaotic mismanagement afterwatering down plansfor mandatory ID cards for working people, offering temporarysupport to pubsshortly after announcing plans to raise tax rates, and altering plans for a so-calledtractor taxon agricultural land.The bill will return to the House of Commons for final agreement. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The sentencing bill will make community sentences even tougher through increased tagging and restriction zones, with unpaid work ensuring offenders give back to society and benefit the communities they’ve harmed.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationLabourCrimeUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Mock-ups circulated by the company show the ads in a tinted box. They will be served to adult users “when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation”, according to OpenAI’s announcement. Ads will not be shown to users under 18 and will not appear alongside answers related to sensitive topics such as health, mental health or politics. Users will be able to click to learn about why they received a particular ad, according toOpenAI.Previously, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, expressed reluctance to introduce ads to the chatbot: “I kind of hate ads just as an aesthetic choice.” His company has made commitments to spend more than $1tn on infrastructure supporting AI in the coming years. Altman hassaidthat revenues are running at well over $13bn a year.“Maybe there could be ads outside the [large language model] stream that are still really great, but the burden of proof there would have to be very high. And it would have to feel really useful to users and really clear that it was not messing with the model’s output,” Altman said recently. “I think it’d be very hard, we’d have to take a lot of care to get it right. People have a very high degree of trust inChatGPT.”In a blogpost on Friday, OpenAI attempted to reconcile Altman’s distaste for ads with the need for revenue: “Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone. Once we begin testing our first ad formats in the coming weeks and months, we look forward to getting people’s feedback.”The company is also launching ChatGPT Go, which it bills as a low-cost subscription tier, for $8 a month.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTAdvertisingSam AltmanOpenAIAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

The news site says that officers found a 42-year-old man named Douglas Dietz dead in bed from a gunshot wound to the head.The victim was reportedly discovered in the bedroom he shared with his wife, which court documents say is connected to their son’s bedroom by a closet.The news outlet states that after investigating, authorities identified the man’s 11-year-old son as the suspect.Police reported it was the child’s birthday, and he had entered the bedroom shouting: “Daddy’s dead.” Troopers at the scene also reportedly said that they heard the son tell his mother: “I killed Daddy.”Police said the shooting occurred after the couple had gone to bed shortly past midnight. The child reportedly told authorities that he had had a good day with his parents, but the documents reportedly state that he became “mad” when his father told him it was time to go to bed.The affidavit, cited by WGAL News 8, reportedly states that when officers asked the boy what had happened, he replied: “I shot somebody.” The sworn police statement also said: “He admitted that he had someone in mind whom he was going to shoot, whom he identified as his father.”According to the news outlet, the court document says that the boy told police he found a key to the gun safe his father’s drawer in his parent’s bedroom. He reportedly unlocked it while attempting to locate his Nintendo Switch – which had previously been taken away from him – and found a gun.The son then allegedly admitted to “removing the gun from the safe, loading bullets into it and walking over to his father’s side of the bed”, according to the affidavit. “He pulled back the hammer and fired the gun at his father,” the affidavit adds.When asked what he believed would happen when he fired the gun, the boy responded that he was “mad” and that he had “not thought about that”, according to investigators.WGAL News 8 reported that the child was denied bail after being taken into custody. A hearing is tentatively scheduled for 22 January.Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Prosecutors in Albuquerque,New Mexico, where Busfield was charged, have asked that the Emmy winner be held in custody until his trial, though it is possible that he could be conditionally released on bond.A sworn police statement summarizing the accusations against Busfield, 68, said they involve two 11-year-old twin brothers with whom Busfield collaborated on the set of The Cleaning Lady, a TV series he directed and acted in.Identified by the initials SL and VL, the boys allege that Busfield touched them inappropriately, according to police. Police in Albuquerque – where much of The Cleaning Lady was filmed –obtainedan warrant to arrest Busfield on 9 January on two counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and one of child abuse.He turned himself over to police to be jailed on Tuesday, but he provided a video statement to the entertainment outlet TMZ in which he vociferously denied the charges.“They’re all lies,” Busfield said in the video. “I did not do anything to those little boys, and I’m going to fight it.”Despite his profession of innocence, Albuquerque prosecutors and police have cited what they portray as a pattern of sexual misconduct amid his work.Court filings after Busfield’s arrest recounted that a man came forward on Tuesday and accused the actor of sexually abusing his daughter while she auditioned at Sacramento’s B Street Theatre, co-founded by Busfield. The documents, as reported by the Sacramento news outletKCRA, said the matter concluded with Busfield going to therapy and the girl’s family agreeing not to take the matter to police.The B Street Theatre issued a statement to media outlets which said Busfield withdrew from being involved at the organization after “legal counsel … [conducted] an internal investigation” into that 2001 episode. The theater’s statement said it could not elaborate because of the criminal case in New Mexico.Court documents also mentioned two other allegations against Busfield that previously appeared in the sworn police statement preceding his recent arrest.In 1994, a 17-year-old extra on the movie Little Big League claimed Busfield assaulted her after serving her alcohol. Busfield – one of Little Big League’s stars – countersued for extortion and settled privately but was ordered to pay $150,000 in costs after he unsuccessfully argued that the allegations against him had been fabricated.Separately, in 2012, a 28-year-old woman alleged Busfield fondled her at a Los Angeles movie theater. Busfield asserted it was consensual, and there was neither a criminal case nor civil litigation brought.The Cleaning Lady’s four-season run on Fox ended in 2025. It was produced by Warner Bros, which has said it conducted its own investigation into Busfield but could not corroborate the allegations against him.Busfield’s acting credits include Revenge of the Nerds, Field of Dreams, The West Wing and Thirtysomething. His performance on Thirtysomething earned him an 1991 Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series.Gilbert, 61, and Busfield have been married since 2013. She apparently deactivated herInstagram accountas of Sunday. And her lifestyle brand, Modern Prairie, canceled a virtual question-and-answer session scheduled for Friday, with a statement reported by People saying that the decision was driven by Gilbert’s need for “privacy and space”.One industry peer offering her moral support was actor Glenn Scarpelli, who wrote on Thursday on Instagram: “Loving my Ol’ Friend Melissa Gilbert right now.

He also demanded the return of the remains of the final Israeli captive still believed to be held by the group, sharpening tensions at a fragile moment in the truce process.“Hamas must IMMEDIATELY honor its commitments, including the return of the final body to Israel, and proceed without delay to full Demilitarization,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “As I have said before, they can do this the easy way, or the hard way.”No agreement has yet been reached on the disarmament of Hamas, which remains one of the most contentious elements of the second phase of the ceasefire, alongside the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and the easing of restrictions to allow significantly more humanitarian aid intoGaza– measures that Israel has yet to fully implement.Hamas has so far refused to give up its arms.Trump has said that Hamas would be stripped of its weapons and its vast tunnel network would be dismantled with the backing of Egypt, Turkey and Qatar. However, it is unclear how such an objective could realistically be enforced.According to the plan, Hamas would give up its heavy weapons completely. As for smaller weapons, the US is considering launching a “buy-back” programme where rifles, pistols and machine guns will be handed over by the owners in exchange for money.View image in fullscreenHamas militants escort members of the Red Cross in Gaza City in November. The US is considering a ‘buy-back’ programme for small weapons.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersThe focus of the second phase has shifted from simply stopping the fighting to establishing transitional governance, demilitarisation, and reconstruction in the territory – a dramatic escalation of diplomatic ambition amid persistent violencefrom the Israeli military.At least 451 Palestinians have been reportedly killed since the ceasefire took effect in October last year.Trump has announced he will chair what is being called a “board of peace” to govern Gaza, tasked with supervising reconstruction, economic recovery, and the broader transition process across Gaza. The former UK prime minister Tony Blair is reportedly expected to join a separate executive board alongside Trump’s advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, with Nickolay Mladenov, a former UN Middle East envoy, playing a central on-the-ground role.The board will oversee a 15-member Palestinian committee that has been formed to supervise Gaza’s civil administration during the transition.Formally known as the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), it is meant to be apolitical and staffed by technocrats and experts rather than political factions. Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority, has been appointed to lead the group.Israel’s war in Gaza has created a “human-made abyss”, and reconstruction is likely to cost more than $70bn (£53bn) over several decades, the UN has said.View image in fullscreenTents housing displaced people in Gaza City.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockAfter visiting Gaza on Thursday, Jorge Moreira da Silva, a UN undersecretary general and executive director of its office for project services, said “the level of destruction is overwhelming”.“Homes, schools, clinics, roads, water, and electricity systems have been levelled or severely damaged,” he added. “Gaza has more than 60m tonnes of rubble: the capacity of nearly 3,000 container ships. On average every person in Gaza today is surrounded by 30 tonnes of rubble. It is likely to take overseven yearsto clear this rubble. I welcome the announcement of the second phase of the plan, this must finally mean the beginning of reconstruction. But meanwhile, early recovery must start right away including to restore access to basic services.”On Thursday, medical sources at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said six Palestinians were killed and others wounded in two Israeli airstrikes.Life in the territory remains precarious. While airstrikes and gunfire have slowed, they have not ceased. At the same time, recent storms have compounded the crisis, causing deaths and flooding in displacement camps already stretched beyond their limits.Strong winter winds caused walls to collapse on to flimsy tents housing displaced Palestinians on Tuesday, killing at least four people.The UN Children’s Fund (Unicef) said on Tuesday that 100 children had been killed since the beginning of the ceasefire in October, including six who died of hypothermia.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasPalestineDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

As Washington challenges the US Federal Reserve’s independence, sending jitters through financial markets, the price soared to a record $4,643 (£3,463) an ounce this week, and analysts have tipped it to break $5,000 this year.As Donald Trumpshatters the global rules-based order, official institutions (and private investors) are scrambling to buy gold: the share of the asset in central banks’ reserves has doubled in the past decade to more than a quarter, the highest level in almost 30 years.Although this partly reflects the soaring bullion price, experts say central banks are also stuffing their vaults as an insurance policy in a volatile world. Many are also rushing to repatriate gold stockpiles held overseas, and slashing their exposure to the US dollar.“We have moved from Pax Americana to global discord, geopolitically. It is the law of the jungle when we see what the US are doing,” says Raphaël Gallardo, the chief economist at the asset manager Carmignac.“Investors – private and sovereign – believe their strategic reserves are no longer safe in dollar terms, as they can be confiscated overnight. The dollar is losing the credibility as the nominal anchor of the global monetary system because the Fed is losing credibility, and US Congress is losing its credibility.”View image in fullscreenAs Donald Trump shatters the global rules-based order, the share of gold in central banks’ reserves has doubled in the past decade.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesOfficial reserves are a critical piece in the global monetary puzzle. Underpinning national currencies as a kind of safety fund, they are typically made up of currencies such as the dollar, euro, yen and pound, as well as gold, bonds and International Monetary Fund assets. They are used to help maintain investor confidence, and can be deployed to stabilise exchange rates in times of stress.For much of the past century the dollar has been the primary reserve currency of choice; the grease in the wheels of global finance and the medium of exchange in the majority of world trade.Bitcoin’s buzz is gone. Investors chose real gold in 2025 | Nils PratleyRead moreHistorically, the monetary system pegged currencies to the value of gold – with countries committing to convert paper money to a fixed amount; reflecting millennia of obsession with the precious metal. However, the link for the dollar – and with it other currencies pegged to the US currency under the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement – was severed in theeconomic upheaval of the 1970sby the then US president, Richard Nixon. Since then, exchange rates have floated on international currency markets based on supply and demand.However, the dollar’s status is dwindling; reflecting Trump’s erratic policymaking – including interference at the Fed and the fragile US public finances – as well as Washington’s readiness to deploy economic sanctions. This includes the targeting of Russian central bank reserves after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Still, the dollar is down but not out. From about 66% of total central bank reserves a decade ago, it has slipped to about 57%. Economists say this is because it lacks a clear alternative. Other fiat currencies – such as the pound, euro, yen or yuan – lack global scale. As a consequence, institutions are turning instead to gold – the world’s oldest reliable store of value.View image in fullscreenA currency dealer monitors exchange rates. For much of the past century the dollar has been the primary reserve currency of choice.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesAs a case in point, in June last year – fuelled by the soaring bullion price –gold overtook the euroto become the world’s second-most important reserve asset after the dollar.“There is no one to replace the dollar. So gold is shining by default,” Gallardo says. “People are returning to what [British economist John Maynard] Keynes called the ‘barbarous relic’, as it is nobody’s debt.”According to a survey of 50 central banks by the asset manager Invesco, about half plan to increase their gold allocation. Two-thirds also plan to relocate bullion stockpiles they hold outside their borders back to domestic vaults for safekeeping.“Gold has always been the ultimate safe haven. So in times of political uncertainty and instability you see gold spikes in terms of central banks. It’s a form of protection and a backstop if traditional fiat currencies fail,” says Rod Ringrow, the head of official institutions at Invesco.Gold price tops $4,000 for first time as investors seek safe havenRead more“The last four years have seen this whole concept of the weaponisation of reserves, after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. So central banks have started to look at that and say: ‘If I want gold reserves, am I comfortable with them in-country, or at other depositories?’. We’ve seen a shifting pattern in that regard.”Historically, many central banks have held their gold stockpiles in London, Switzerland and New York – the centres of the global bullion trade, with records of political and economic stability.The Bank of England is the world’s most important hub. Serving about 70 official institutions worldwide, its vaults deep under London’s streets contain about400,000 bars, worth more than half a trillion dollars.The clamour for central banks to repatriate their gold – and the difficulties it can involve – has recently come to the fore: Venezuela hasbars locked-up at the Bank of England worth $2bn, which it cannot access while the UK government refuses to recognise the Caracas regime. Russia has alsothreatened Belgium, where the bulk of Moscow’s frozen foreign-currency reserves are held.Alongside Serbia, governments that have sought to repatriate their gold reserves includeIndia,HungaryandTurkey.Polandhas brought back hundreds of tonnes of gold bars that it transported to London, the US and Canada amid the outbreak of the second world war.View image in fullscreenBank of England vaults, deep under London’s streets, contain about400,000 bars, worth more than half a trillion dollars.Photograph: Bank Of England/ShutterstockIn the 2010s,Germanywas an early pioneer of repatriation, amid political pressure to return thousands of tonnes of bullion from the US and France, where its reserves had been moved to because of fears of a Soviet invasion during the cold war.Economists say the most prominent countries hoarding gold are typically those most exposed to geopolitical tensions. Central bank purchases rose by 10% in the year to September, according to the World Gold Council, led by Poland, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and China.Beijing has been on a buying spree, amassing more than 2,000 tonnes – estimated to rank as the sixth largest in the world – in its attempts to rival Washington. Still, with more than 8,000 tonnes, the US is thought to be the world leader – even though the contents of its Fort Knox vault have not been officially audited since 1953.Other countries have gone in the opposite direction. The UK government was a notable seller during Gordon Brown’s time as the Labour chancellor in the late 1990s and early 2000s – disposing of 401 tonnes of gold out of its 715-tonne holding – at a time when gold prices were historically low.Some economists believe cryptocurrencies could grow in significance to rival traditional currencies and gold as a reserve asset. However, central banks have so far shown caution when it comes to a volatile and nascent market where security concerns remain, and where the most stable assets are still pegged to the value of the dollar or gold anyway.Jonathan Fortun, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, says although gold is ascendant, and crypto could come next, few assets are yet to rival the dollar.“I don’t think the dethroning of the dollar would be the main concern if we arrived to the stage where we were to be bartering in gold. That would be a second round effect – we’d have many other issues.”Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesEconomicsDollarEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The investigation will examine a range of problems, including “concerns raised in public reporting relating to the sale and bonuses awarded to its executives”.The inquiry was announced after the Guardianrevealed last month that City & Guilds executives received million-pound bonusesafter the charity privatised its business arm.The payments – understood to include a £1.7m award for Donnelly and £1.2m for Ismail – emerged after reports that the privatised City & Guilds business had also embarked on a£22m cost-cutting drive and was shrinking its UK workforceafter being sold by its charity owner to PeopleCert.Both executives had stayed with the business once it was sold by the charity to PeopleCert.A spokesperson for PeopleCert said: “An internal investigation, led by our legal representatives and non-executive board members, has been commissioned in order to fully understand events before and after the sale by City & Guilds of London Institute (Charitable Foundation) of its awarding, assessment and training business (City & Guilds Limited), including the individual conduct of executives.“In the meantime, Kirstie Donnelly and Abid Ismail, CEO and CFO of City & Guilds Limited respectively, will be absent from work. Their responsibilities have been assumed by other senior leaders to ensure we continue to deliver the best possible experience for partners, customers and learners.”Donnelly and Ismail have been approached for comment. The company has previously said that the bonuses were not agreed or paid by the charity, and that remuneration was a matter for the newly privately owned business.Founded in 1878 by the City of London and 16 livery companies, the original institute developed a national system of technical education, offeringqualifications and apprenticeshipsin fields ranging from manufacturing and mechanical engineering to hairdressing and horticulture. It was awarded a royal charter by Queen Victoria in 1900 and says it helps about 1.1 million people a year.The organisation has enjoyed a storied history, with alumni include the chefsJamie Oliver, Marcus Wareing and Gordon Ramsay, the former England football manager Gareth Southgate, the celebrity gardenerAlan Titchmarsh and fashion designer Karen Millen.The training and awards business was previously owned by the City & Guilds of London Institute (CGLI), the charity that announced in the autumn that it was selling the operation toPeopleCert.The charity, whichprovides grants to people in need of vocational training, said the sale gave it a cash windfall of between £180m and £200m. It said the proceeds would secure its long-term future, enable it to pursue its charitable objectives and provide increased investment and opportunities for the training business, now in private ownership.The Charity Commission is investigating events at the charity, not the private company.The trustees of the charity, CGLI, have said:“We acknowledge the Charity Commission’s statutory inquiry and are cooperating fully with their investigation. We remain confident that all actions taken by the trustees have been proper, transparent, and in line with our charitable purpose.“We are committed to maintaining public trust and will continue to act in the best interests of the charity and its beneficiaries.”PeopleCert added it would “cooperate fully with the Charity Commission’s inquiry as required” and that the plans to reduce its UK workforce would be achieved via “attrition”, rather than compulsory redundancies.Explore more on these topicsBusinessCharitiesVocational educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump had repeatedly threatened legal action.The justice department is now investigating the project, and whether Powell – who accused the administration of targeting him because the Fed has defied Trump’s repeated demands for drastic interest rate cuts – lied to Congress about its scope during testimony last summer.Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for the District of Columbia, has insisted her office takes decisions “based on the merits”. Trump claimed he did not know about the investigation before it was reported.Hassett, chair of Trump’s national economic council – and one of the US president’s top candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair, when his term expires in May – suggested on Friday morning that he believed Powell had told the truth about the renovation.In an interview with the Fox Business Network, Hassett said that he wished the Fed had been “more transparent” when it comes to Powell’s congressional testimony about the ongoing renovations to the central bank that are at the heart of the investigation.“All corners of government – the Fed, the White House, everything – we have a responsibility to the American people to be transparent,” said Hassett. “And I think that, if I were Fed chair, that I would insist on transparency. I probably would’ve answered the questions right away.“But the bottom line is, I expect – Jay’s a good man – I expect that there’s nothing to see here, that the cost overruns were related to things like asbestos, as he says. But I sure wish that they had been more transparent.”Every living former Fed chaircondemned the investigation this week, warning that similar prosecutorial attacks in other countries had led to “highly negative consequences” for the cost of living – and argued they had “no place” in the US. Central banks around the world alsoissued a rare joint statementoffering “full solidarity” to Powell.Hassett said that, if offered the job as Fed chair, he would take the job with a commitment to “independence and transparency”.“I think that’s something the Fed could have done better in the past,” he added.Later on Friday morning, at a roundtable event on rural healthcare at the White House, Trump praised Hassett’s earlier performance on cable news. “You were fantastic in television today,” Trump said, adding that he’s reluctant to let Hassett leave his role at the national economic council.“I actually want to keep you where you are if you want to know the truth,” Trump said. “You’ve done incredible. We don’t want to lose him.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS economyFederal ReserveDonald TrumpEconomicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But, accepting that, we have to call out messenger shooting.”Global central banks offer ‘full solidarity’ to US Fed’s Powell amid Trump threatsRead moreBailey was amonga group of 10 central bank governors– including the chair of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde – who this week offered “full solidarity” to the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, after he revealed he had been threatened with legal action.His comments also come amid rising geopolitical tensions and growing criticism of Trump after the USintervention in Venezuelaand the president’s threatsto take control of Greenland.In a speech delivered as world leaders prepare to head to Switzerland for the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos – widely seen as a critical moment for the future of international cooperation – the governor said countries turning inwards would undermine progress to raise living standards. “The rise of so-called populism makes the whole task harder,” he said.Economists and the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, have warned that politically driven attempts to influence the Fed and other leading central bankscould ultimately push up inflationand interest rates, adding to cost of living pressures on households.Bailey identified three defining features of populism: a tendency towards domestic production over international openness; attributing unfavourable conditions to “outside forces”; and fuelling decline in trust in domestic and international institutions.He said this included a populist tendency to deride domestic and international institutions as “distant, unresponsive and acting for the benefit of powerful and uncontrollable interests”.“For those of us who are institutionalised, the answer is that we have to challenge back, in deeds more than just words. But, we have to ensure our houses are in order too,” he said.The governor has previously faced criticism fromNigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing populist Reform UK party. Farage has called for politicians to have greater influence on the Bank of England, which was made independent in 1997 by the then Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown.Late last year, Farage suggested he could replace Bailey as governor if he became prime minister. He has also called Bailey a “dinosaur” over his views on digital currencies.Liz Truss, the former prime minister, has alsocomplained about UK institutionsincluding the Bank, Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility, accusing them of being part of a shadowy “deep state” apparatus.Bailey said the gains of global cooperation were clear. “The benefits of trade and openness in terms of specialisation and larger markets are very well known. So, too, is the need to have rules of the game and some form of commitment and coordination device to put these rules into effect and protect legitimate national interests,” he said.Economists typically view free trade as a cornerstone of long-term economic growth, arguing that it helps lower prices for consumers and supports productivity gains.However, the governor of the UK central bank, who also chairs the international Financial Stability Board – acknowledged that years of lacklustre economic growth and stalling progress living standards had made promoting global openness harder.“While it is true that openness supports growth and has reduced global poverty, it can have, and has had, distributional consequences in economies, and there has been an undermining of social capital so-called and domestic cohesion,” Bailey said.He added that the challenges facing the world could not be overcome through increasingly isolationist policies.Bailey said there were four substantial headwinds facing rich countries: a pause between productivity-enhancing technologies that was holding back economic growth; ageing populations; rising demands for defence spending; and the climate crisis.While describing these pressures as a “powerful force to complicate the operation of the international system”, he argued that countries could overcome them through “robust economic openness” and greater global trade and cooperation.“We must be clear and agreed that a world without effective institutions is unlikely to be stable,” he added.Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandAndrew BaileyEconomicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Paperwork and entry forms, for one. Signs warning that “aggressive behavior will not be tolerated”, a response to thereal uptick in violence against healthcare workers. A memorial plaque to the victims of the mass shooting at PittFest, which drenched the back half of the acclaimed HBO Max show’s first season in unbelievably harrowing, bloody, very American trauma. Labels on the many homeopathic remedies carried, in Ziploc bags, by a prospective patient deeply skeptical of western medicine and big pharma. Promotional literature on the larger hospital system, for which The Pitt is its cash-strapped, paint-stripped, constantly beleaguered front door.What the doctor ordered: how The Pitt became the TV show of the momentRead moreAnd, in its second season, which premiered earlier this month, so-called “patient passports” that supposedly help you understand the procedures and expected wait times at an urban emergency room. The leaflets are the brainchild of Dr Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi), the tech-affectionate, norms-challenging attending physician introduced this season as a foil to the more by-the-books Dr Michael “Robby” Robinavitch, the series anchor played by recent Golden Globe winner Noah Wyle. Dr Robby, the show’s raison d’être and the core of viewer sentiment, is skeptical of the patient passports, as he seems to be of most change at the Pitt; their introduction is one of many seeds planted in what will surely become a larger thematic battle between tradition and innovation, emotion and rationality, old, haunted attending physician and his upstart replacement.But I took to the risible passports, as somewhat of a metaphor for why the medical drama, with its jam-packed plots and real-time pacing and occasional didacticism, feels somehow fresher in its second season than its Emmy-winning first – as a viewer passport, of sorts, to the combustible, confounding world of US healthcare. A window into a constellation of work and care that is constantly in the news and yet difficult to understand, beyond personal contact with a system that will charge you an arm and a leg for even a brief visit.The Pitt has rightly beenheraldedas the most medically accurate drama ever developed for US television (though the bar is low), a show that largely does not sacrifice scientific realism for entertainment. Created by R Scott Gemmill and executive produced by ER showrunner John Wells, The Pitt finally cracked the code of a medical drama for the streaming era, seasoning the old recipe of network TV procedural with HBO-standard nudity, swearing and graphic detail; the recently aired second episode included the syringe drainage of a (visible!) eight-hour erection, the discovery of (real!) maggots living under an unhoused man’s cast and the relocation of a protruding arm bone that I watched through my fingers.But the show earned its following less for the copious (and convincing) fake blood than its attention to the mundane details and challenges usually cut for time, with a wider scope of the healthcare ecosystem than television usually allows – the traditionally glorified doctors, of course, but also nurses, administrative staff, custodians, EMS drivers and social workers. What other medical drama has devoted time to explaining, with compassion, the process of draining fluid from an alcoholic’s distended abdomen?Even in such quiet moments, the Pitt simmers with combustible anxiety: at any moment, something could go catastrophically awry, and it often does. Such is the nature of procedural entertainment, which even when striving for accuracy demands contrived stakes, juiced timelines and routine drama. But the makers of The Pitt, which openly advertises said accuracy, know that such also is the state of US healthcare, a perilously tenuous system where individual heroism and systemic cruelty exist side by side, whose inherent capriciousness has been supercharged by the current administration.View image in fullscreenIsa Briones, Ayesha Harris, Fiona Dourif and Ken Kirby in The Pitt.Photograph: Warrick Page/HBO MaxThe Pitt depicts realities of healthcare work that transcend nationality – the psychological weight of caring for another person, the routine presence of death – but it is, at its core, a show about the United States, where healthcare remains a for-profit system. The most medicalized country on Earth, which spends roughly twice per capita on healthcare than comparable countries, while excluding millions from it and suffering,across all income levels, from higher rates of disease and death. A country where tech companies and ungodly wealthy CEOs like OpenAI’s Sam Altman pour money into life-extension technology – some$12.5bn over the last 25 years– while the vast majority of Americans cannot afford an ER visit. A place where average life expectancy is shorter now than it was in 2010. A country facing animpending wave of hospital closuresin rural areas, and financial distress for urban“safety-net” ones. The Pitt’s second season premiered just as insurancepremiums soaredfor about 20 million people, following the Trump administration’s decision to end federal subsidies. US patients and providers endure, on a near daily basis,absolute chaos, with billions of critical funding – for mental healthcare, substance use programs and more – now political footballs subject toswift cancellation.All of this is largely outside the scope of The Pitt, which maintains focus on thesteadily droppingbottom floor of the system (literally – the Pitt’s affectionate moniker refers to its location in the basement of the larger hospital) and primarily serves as agitprop for the healthcare profession. But it very much informs the show’s overarching tension and larger project. After playing Whac-A-Mole with US societal issues in season one – state-level abortion restrictions, gun violence, medical racism and anti-vaxxers, to name a few – season two has settled two looming, long-term bogeymen: insurance and therapid adoption of generative AIin healthcare. The former, represented by Nurse Noelle Hastings (Meta Golding), a case manager at PTMC who navigates the distinctly American problem of finding patients a hospital that accepts their coverage; the latter, by Dr Al-Hashimi, who is bullish on AI transcription services’ potential tohelp with physician burnout, liberate them from documentation drudgery (the dreaded “charting”) and provide more face time with patients. (Or, as Robby points out, a reason for hospital administrators to demand doctors see evenmorepatients.)There’s something cathartic about seeing a TV show even attempt to address this colossal mess, ham-fisted as the AI conversation may feel (to be fair, that’s how any AI conversation feels). Like most Americans, I have friends and family in healthcare. I keep up with the news. I stress about the costs of routine checkups, medications and procedures, and endure the intentional frustration of insurance claims. I care deeply about the availability and affordability of healthcare in my country and about those who work in it. Yet there is so much I do not understand, on every level. So much is infuriating. It touches every facet of our lives – it is, literally, our lives – and still remains largely invisible, seemingly impossible. So I tune into The Pitt, as a passport to a million grittier and more complicated daily realities, a safe window into a strained system dressed up as entertainment. The simulation may be simplified, turbo-charged, glossy, but the anxiety coursing through it is hyper-real.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionDramaHealthcare industryHealthTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There is an apocryphal story of an ageing Orson Welles introducing himself to the guests at a half-empty town hall. “I am an actor, a writer, a producer and a director,” he said. “I am a magician and I appear on stage and on the radio. Why are there so many of me and so few of you?”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If a fantasy author were to dream up Welles’s psychedelic cousin, he’d likely have the air of Alejandro Jodorowsky: serene and white-bearded with a crocodile smile, presiding over a niche band of disciples. He has been – variously, often concurrently – a director, an actor, a poet, a puppeteer, a psychotherapist, a tarot-card reader, an author of fantasy books. At the age of 96, Jodorowsky estimates that he’s lived 100 different lives and embodied 100 different Jodorowskys. “Because we are different people all the time,” he says. “I died a lot of times but then I’m reborn. Look at me now and you see I’m alive. I am happy about this. It is fantastic to live.”Jodorowsky recently finished work on atwo-volume Taschen monograph, Art Sin Fin. That’s another rebirth, he says, although it also serves as an archive, a repository, a bulging bestiary of counter-cultural weirdness. Naturally, Art Sin Fin covers Jodorowsky’s brief 70s reign as the “king of the midnight movie”, the creator of the head-scrambling cult classics El Topo and The Holy Mountain, beloved by Dennis Hopper and John Lennon alike. But the retrospective roams much farther afield, leading us through riotous stage shows, outlandish comic-book panels and designs for grand productions (such as his long-cherished adaptation of Dune) that never saw the light of day.People say that I’m the world’s last crazy artist. But I am not mad. I am only trying to save my soulJodorowsky chose the images and artwork alongside the book’s editor, Donatien Grau of the Musée du Louvre. But the accompanying prose is inimitably his own and mixes metaphors and similes with a devil-may-care panache. On one page his brain is “like a canary growling like a whale”. On another it has become “two bicycle wheels fighting like dogs”. Jodorowsky’s work can be provocative, outlandish and sometimes wilfully shocking, geared towards themes of sex and death. But it has always carried a top note of outright silliness, too.In the beginning, before anything, there was Tocopilla, he says; a small port town on the rocky coast of northern Chile. That’s where he was raised, the square-peg son of a Ukrainian-Jewish shopkeeper, constantly dreaming of escaping to somewhere else. “Well,” he says, clarifying. “First I was one cell in the belly of my mother. Then I was working with my father from the age of seven, working behind the counter of this general store. I was the little young genius who was helping him every day. Now I am the little old genius who is talking to you.”Tocopilla, it turned out, couldn’t contain him for long. He jumped first to Santiago and then on to Paris, where he studied mime with Marcel Marceau and directed Maurice Chevalier in music hall. His 1967 debut feature – the surrealistic Fando y Lis – sparked a riot when it premiered at the Acapulco film festival. “In Mexico they wanted to kill me,” he says. “A soldier marched in and put a gun to my chest.”Jodorowsky shares a portion of Art Sin Fin with his second wife, Pascale Montandon. The couple like to paint together under a joint pseudonym, PascALEjandro, producing a series of jubilant watercolours that are one part Dalí to two parts Paula Rego. Montandon joins Jodorowsky on our Zoom call as well, gently chipping in to translate questions or correct her husband’s English.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Jodorowsky. Art Sin FinTASCHENPhotograph: Mark Seelen/© Mark Seelen“This is because I am a very old person,” he says. “Listen to this – I am nearly 100 years old. Soon I will die, that is the law of this planet. Maybe other planets as well. But my wife, she must not die. She is only 50 years old.”“I’m 54,” Montandon says.“She is 50,” he repeats. “That means she will live for another 50 years. And she will be here and think about me when I’m gone.”“You’re not dead yet,” Montandon says. “And I might die before you. People don’t know anything.”Jodorowsky insists he is an artist not a teacher, which means that there has never been any message or moral to his work. If his multi-hyphenate career is bound to anything, though, it is to the principles of a therapeutic practice that he calls “psychomagic”, which stirs Freud’s theory of the unconscious in with elements of shamanism and the tarot. For years Jodorowsky hosted regular free psychomagic sessions around Paris, where he lives, preaching the gospel and treating the afflicted. Nowadays he mostly counsels his patients via Zoom and sometimes wonders if he’ll have enough time to get through all his bookings. “Today,” he says. “Listen. There are 8 million people who are waiting for my help.”“Eight million,” echoes Montandon. It is not quite a question.“Yes,” he says firmly. “Eight million people, it’s true.”Among the many black-and-white photographs in Jodorowsky’s collection, one shows a wide-eyed teenager with a white-painted face. He is leaning into the arms of a raven-haired woman. “My first pantomime in Chilean theatre,” reads the caption. “Aged 17, made up as an old man of 90, experiencing an orgasm in the arms of death.”The artist squints at the photo. He is older today than the man he once played as a boy. “Another planet,” he says. “Another Jodorowsky. But maybe I am still the same person, deep inside. Maybe I only look different because I am in a different body.”He frowns, shakes his head and puts the picture aside. “Soon I will be in the arms of death,” he says. “I am ready to die and I will go with happiness, with a great orgasm. But listen, I will tell you, I have always been this way. Life for me is an adventure. We live in an eternal present. Life is action, action, orgasm, and we experience it all the time.”Endless art: the ages of JodorowskyView image in fullscreenAlejandro Jodorowsky’s film El Topo.Photograph: ABKCO FilmsEl Topo“It’s not a western, it’s an eastern,” Jodorowsky said of his 1970 breakthrough, a phantasmagoric Mexican odyssey that deliberately loses itself in the desert. The director plays the violent gunslinger in search of enlightenment while dragging his infant son, Brontis, along for the ride. El Topo’s US distribution was bankrolled by the former Beatles manager Allen Klein, who, urged on by John Lennon, would later agree to finance Jodorowsky’s 1973 epic, The Holy Mountain.Endless Poetry (main image)“My father was a monster and my mother was, too,” says Jodorowsky, who fled Chile for Paris and never saw his parents again. In his 80s he belatedly returned to shoot a pair of acclaimed magic-realist memoirs, The Dance of Reality (2013) and Endless Poetry (2016), in which he played the guardian angel of his younger self and arranged for his dad to be captured and tortured by Nazis. “People say that I’m the world’s last crazy artist,” he says. “But I am not mad. I am only trying to save my soul.”View image in fullscreenAlejandro Jodorowsky and Philippe Camoin’s Marseille Tarot, Arcane XV: The Devil.Photograph: Jodo CamoinMarseille Tarot ResearchJodorowsky was first turned on to the Tarot de Marseille by the French surrealist André Breton. He went on to produce his own interpretation of the original tarot family alongside designer Philippe Camoin. His 78-card deck is an “alphabet of the soul”, he says, with its major arcana (the Fool, the Juggler, the Devil et al) corresponding to individual human qualities. It is instead “a system for self-discovery and psychological healing”, he says.View image in fullscreenTeo Jodorowsky, died of an overdose at 24 years old, 2021.Photograph: pascALEjandroTeo JodorowskyJodorowsky’s son Teo – who played a dancing bandit in 1989’s Santa Sangre – died of an overdose at the age of 24. This family tragedy led to his father’s experiments with tarot-based psychotherapy and was later reframed in PascALEjandro’s jubilant image of an acrobatic Teo sitting astride the Grim Reaper’s shoulders. “Happy, my son goes down to his grave. I weep,” reads Jodorowsky’s accompanying caption.View image in fullscreenJohn Difool & The Plant Queen from Alejandro Jodorowsky and Moebius’s The Incal, 1980-88.Photograph: Humanoids.The IncalThe Incal – the centrepiece of Jodorowsky’s fabulous comic-book sideline – is a sprawling 1980s space opera, cooked up in collaboration with the artist Moebius and charting the adventures of John Difool (‘the Fool”), a feet-of-clay private eye. Its elaborate cyberpunk style influenced The Matrix and Luc Besson’s The Fifth Element.

But as American studios increasingly prioritise franchise sequels over serious drama, and European films vie for major trophies outside the “best international feature” silo, the EFAs are feeling emboldened about becoming a major tastemaker for grownup cinema.This year, the European Film Academy has for the first time moved its annual jamboree from December to the middle of the US awards season, right between the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards.“Hollywood has stopped making movies for adults, with a few exceptions”, said Scott Roxborough, European bureau chief for the Hollywood Reporter. “That leaves room for the Europeans, who only make films for adults”.View image in fullscreenStellan Skarsgård won a Golden Globe for Sentimental Value on Sunday. Will he be victorious again at tomorrow’s EFAs?Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/2026GG/Penske Media/Getty ImagesTaking place at Berlin’s House of World Cultures this Saturday, the awards’ 38th edition could be a night of triumphs for Norwegian director Joachim Trier’s family dramaSentimental Value, which is nominated in five categories including best European film.The meta-tale of familial estrangement and artistic competition has already scooped the Grand Prix at Cannes and a best supporting actor Golden Globe for Swedish veteranStellan Skarsgård, and is seen as a major contender at the Oscars in March. “It’s the kind of serious dramatic film that Hollywood is generating fewer and fewer of,” said Roxborough.After the Oscars expanded their best picture nominee count from five to 10 films in 2009, there has been a marked uptick in non-English-language films in the running. Swedish director Ruben Östlund’s Triangle of Sadness, French film-maker Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall, British director Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest and French director Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Pérez all gained best picture nominations in recent years.At the EFAs, Trier’s film faces competition from Spanish director Óliver Laxe’s Mad-Max-meets-Stalkerthriller Sirāt, with four nominations, and German newcomer Mascha Schilinski’s The Sound of Falling and Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi’s French co-produced It Was Just an Accident, each nominated in three categories.Saturday’s ceremony – which in place of a host will be “curated” by Irish documentary-maker Mark Cousins as a “live film essay” – is part of a long-held plan to to reposition the awards as a more glamorous event in the cultural calendar. Unlike in previous years, distributors have held special screenings of nominee films in order to canvas for votes, and Roxborough said there are signs that some European distributors were starting to shape their marketing campaigns around the awards.View image in fullscreenMad Max meets Stalker … Sirāt is nominated for three awards.Photograph: AP“European cinema has gone on the front foot and repositioned itself to take on Hollywood – by moving its dates this year to the middle of January,” said British producer Mike Downey, the outgoing chair of the European Film Academy. “Our major overhaul and rebranding radically boosts our profile and, indeed, European cinema’s importance in the international awards season.”While the EFA’s shortlisted films are resolutely art-house, Hollywood blockbuster productionscontinued to dominate the European box office in 2025. Yet strong showings for select homegrown productions are giving European distributors grounds for hope.“This year has given us irrefutable proof that German film shouldn’t make itself smaller than it is,”wroteGerman broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung at the end of last year.

So, there’s everything to play for.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAwards and prizesStellan SkarsgårdOscarsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hilarious. The plots are daft, the cameos are often left-field but work well, and it has loads of great nonsensical gags. It’s a shining example of a sitcom with an unlikable protagonist that you can’t help but root for anyway. I must have watched it from beginning to end at least 15 times. Every friendship and relationship in my life eventually reaches a crossroads: will they like Toast or not?Rhys, 24, CardiffLark Rise to CandlefordI discovered Lark Rise to Candleford just in time to take me away from the nightmare of living in the current political climate. I avoid all news programmes, reality shows, and prefer to settle down with a much simpler, kinder world.Tim K, 60, Brooklyn, New York, USMapp & LuciaThe 1985 adaptation of EF Benson’s novels have a cast that is impeccable. The location, sets and costumes are immaculate and the story so disconnected from modern life that it’s a perfect place to retreat to. I first watched it with my husband to be and we introduced it to friends. We must have seen it a dozen times over the 38 years we were together. Watching with a friend was comfort when I lost him to cancer two years ago. It still holds up. A perfect fictional retreat.Ben, BedfordshireSaving Lives at SeaView image in fullscreenStrangely relaxing … Saving Lives at Sea.Photograph: BBC/Lynsey MelvilleI find watching the RNLI docuseries Saving Lives at Sea strangely relaxing. It’s the combination of jeopardy – people underestimating or overwhelmed by the power of water and weather – with the bravery and commitment of the volunteer lifeboat men and women who, at least in the series, always dash there just in the nick of time to pull them out of the waves. The comforting sense that there are people out there ready to rescue you in extremis must be what appeals about all those hospital and ambulance reality programmes. The difference with SLAS is that I’m unlikely to find myself on a boat out in a storm any time soon!Maddy Paxman, 67, LondonDetectoristsView image in fullscreenAlways brings a lump to my throat … Andy (Mackenzie Crook) and Lance (Toby Jones) in Detectorists.Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC/Channel XEvery winter, my wife and I rewatch Detectorists religiously. When it’s bitterly cold and wet outside, it promises us the sights and sounds of long hot summer evenings in the country that seem so far away right now. It’s hard to analyse but the detail and humour is so rich, layered and nuanced that we often notice new visual gags and strands each time. It’s based on a slow humour that gently teases rather than abuses the eccentrics who pursue the escapist hobbies and eccentricities that we all have. The Suffolk countryside is a beautiful backdrop to Andy and Lance’s adventures and the brilliant Johnny Flynn’s theme tune alone always brings a lump to my throat.Sam, Ely, CambridgeshireSchitt’s CreekView image in fullscreenA gem … Catherine O’Hara in Schitt’s Creek.Photograph: APSchitt’s Creek is my perfect comfort show. I knew I would love it; Catherine O’Hara is always amazing. I started watching her and Eugene Levy in Second City Television (SCTV) in the 70s. I was in tears at the end of it, but good tears. I am amazed thatnone of the Guardian writerspicked this gem.Meg, 58, SussexAround the World in 80 Days with Michael PalinMichael Palin’s Around the World in 80 Days brings together a sense of adventure and nostalgia. When I first saw it 30 years ago, it held out the prospect to see places I had not yet visited or may never get to. Watching it now there is an obvious nostalgia for how travel was before the ubiquity of smartphones. The shot that captures it all for me is Palin watching the sunset over the Bay of Bengal trying to catch the football scores on BBC World Service. The beauty of the world and its mundane pleasures. A travelogue that feels more spontaneous than all of the imitators it spawned.Robert Smith, 59, Newcastle-under-LymePerry MasonPerry Mason (the original TV series, 1957-1966) is the template for most television legal dramas (especially Law & Order): suspects and murder in the first half-hour, courtroom drama in the second. The stories are generally intelligent and engaging, if formulaic, but the cast is wonderful. All had careers as supporting players in noir and B-movies and play their roles that way; that is, as though they’re all supporting players in an ensemble. All performances are in service of the story. And it doesn’t hurt that the truth always wins out and justice is always served. You know: a fantasy world.Phil Hundley, Chicago, USGilmore GirlsGilmore Girls arrived in my life, as many things do nowadays, via its relocation to Netflix. Snappy, sassy and only just past its prime despite some outdated references (though certainly fewer than Friends) it has strong yet brilliantly flawed women at its impossible-to-believe Connecticut heart. Pumpkins, picturesque winters, then the hopeful bright American sunshine take us through the years. Male leads waiting for these women to notice them are not diminished either. Fair, romantic and sure, it brings joy to both my daughter and I who are not remotely like the mother-daughter duo depicted but probably wish we were a little bit.Jayne Stead, YorkPoirotView image in fullscreenDavid Suchet as Poirot.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyWe have watched all the series of this TV adaptation of the investigations of Agatha Christie’s detective at least twice and are watching them again. There is always something else to look out for – Miss Lemon’s hairstyles, Hastings’ Shetland jumpers, Poirot’s moustache. The sets are wonderful. We can never remember who committed the murder, probably because sometimes that’s the least interesting part of the programme.Carol Bloomfield, 67, DurhamSuperstoreAs I mainly work from home, I have the luxury of being able to take a midday nap. I always put on Superstore and follow the pattern of watching one episode, sleeping through the second (about 20 minutes) and waking up in the third. Hearing those beloved characters talking in the background is so comforting and almost feels like having family close by. I wonder what the folks at Netflix would think if they found out there’s someone who has rewatched a show more than 60 times?Elisabeth Kaplan, Vienna, AustriaThe PlanetsI’m a sucker for any documentary about space, but find myself repeatedly going back to Brian Cox’s series. I think it’s the sense of wonder, that every time we learn more about these places we find that they’re more incredible, more diverse. They’re also tantalisingly out of reach. There’s also a contrast with nature documentaries (which I also love), which necessarily come with a sense of loss and guilt about what we’ve done to those habitats. The planets remain perfect and our exploration of them (at least so far) highlights the best of humanity – working together to reach out and to learn.Tom, 48, BrightonHow to With John WilsonHow to With John Wilson is a really original, unique and interesting documentary series that’s at times hilarious, philosophical, sad, whimsical and utterly bizarre. It’s never boring, despite its mundane, everyday topics. It looks so breezy and simple, but I should imagine there are hundreds of hours of footage to edit, and a lot of hard work to bring every single different topic to our screens. I’ve recommended it to everyone I know. I love it.Matthew Grundy, ManchesterFirst DatesView image in fullscreenFeel-good factor … Fred Sirieix on First Dates.Photograph: Channel 4I love watching Fred Sirieix’s dating show. It has the essential feel-good factor – it’s always such a relaxed and happy show, set in nice surroundings. You get to meet lots of different people from different backgrounds, and it reminds me of when I was younger and found my own first dates so exciting and happy. Not many activities match the excitement of a first date and the show captures that feeling, for me at least. Plus, you have the brilliant Fred and Merlin to take you through it.Laurie, West MidlandsFriendsView image in fullscreenMakes me feel less lonely … Friends.Photograph: NBC/Getty ImagesI don’t usually rewatch TV shows (or films) but I make an exception for Friends. Over the years I have caught re-runs on TV, and last year when I was going through a low time in my life, I rewatched all seasons from episode one on Netflix. I remember the first time I watched the pilot and thought it was silly, but I soon became a fan. Decades later, it made me feel less lonely, like having real friends around.Vanessa, DorsetTime TeamView image in fullscreenMy happy place … Time Team.Photograph: Channel 4I’ve always followed archeology.

Tommy Lee Jones’ shrieking, neon-splashed Batman Forever iteration turned the character into a dissociative identity slot machine, endlessly pulling its own lever, while Billy Dee Williams’ take in 1989’s Batman was a promise of future ruin. In Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, the downfall of Aaron Eckhart’s crusading district attorney signalled the dangers of placing too much faith in the moral resilience of a single individual, especially in a city where the very idea of justice is already under existential strain.With the news this week cautiouslyannounced in the Hollywood Reporterthat Sebastian Stan will be playing Dent in Matt Reeves’ highly anticipated forthcoming sequel to The Batman, it’s quite possible the new episode will be less interested in the masked theatrics of the 20th-century big screen caped crusader, and more in the idea that the very concept of justice is about to slowly disintegrate. In Stan, Reeves has an actor who excels at playing men whose morality erodes like damp plaster, which feeds beautifully into his vision of Gotham. In Reeves’ worldview, it is a city that is rotting politely from the inside, not one ruled by a carnival of freaks desperate for the spotlight. So it is hard to imagine this languid, gloriously doom-drenched Gotham giving birth to a Dent who goes down the rampant route of extreme, scenery-chewing theatricality.There is even the potential here to move on from the Nolan era, with its focus on symbolism and high-stakes ethical thought experiments. Eckhart’s turn is one of the greatest performances in any comic book movie, but by utilising the madness of grief to transform him into Two-Face, rather than relying on the incremental, constantly self-justifying slide into monstrosity seen in the best comics or the excellent 1990s Batman: The Animated Series TV show, something was lost. When he’s at his best, Dent doesn’t “snap”, so much as reason his way into villainy, seemingly convincing himself step by step that the law no longer works and that only he is strong enough to replace it. This Two-Face isn’t chaos dressed up as madness (like the Joker) but justice stripped of empathy, clinging to the illusion of fairness – the semi-ruined coin he still pretends represents due process. His descent into villainy feels almost inevitable in a town as violently decayed as Gotham, and his arrival on the scene simply confirms how impossible Batman’s job is.It might even be nice to see the new Two-Face hanging around Gotham for several movies, like a sort of lingering corruption designed to keep reminding Robert Pattinson’s caped crusader that he really can’t win in a world where doing the right thing and the wrong thing often look identical from a distance. Nolan’s films had Cillian Murphy’s Scarecrow as the last rat to leave Gotham’s ever-sinking ship, while it seems likely that Colin Farrell’s Penguin will be the resident cockroach in Reeves’ saga. That doesn’t mean there isn’t room for another famed member of Batman’s rogues gallery to remain forever lurking in the architecture.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekThe BatmanBatmanRobert PattinsonSebastian StanSuperhero moviesAaron EckhartcommentShareReuse this content"

But whose fault is it if you remain dry-eyed?Zoe WilliamsFri 16 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 03.22 ESTShare‘Is it porn or is it art?” A familiar, even dated question where nudity is involved, and (forgive thumbnail) pretty well-resolved– which is to say: we let the tastemakers decide, and it tips the scale towards “art” if one or both protagonists are not that good-looking.“Is it grief-porn or is it grief-art?” is a more vexed question. Grief-porn, in relation to cinema, would suggest that the film in question is emotionally manipulative, formulaic; grief-art would suggest the film unleashes feelings both universal and true.It’s curiously circular. In a film about grief, the valorised quality is depth of feeling; it stands or falls by how profoundly the hero(ine) experiences emotion, and the audience proves its acuity, buys itself into the imaginative contract, by its ability to mirror that profundity. You only get to decide whether it’s art if you’re already feeling it so deeply that it must be, in other words. If the death left you cold and you found the ensuing emotionality manipulative and domineering, this logic is quite annoying.I’m talking in the first instance, of course, about Hamnet, the dramatisation ofMaggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel.On paper, it must be art:Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescalare more than brilliant, they both have qualities of magnetism and believability that are always evident; they probably couldn’t switch those off if they tried. It’s visually sumptuous and the dialogue is contrastingly spare and intelligent.It can’t be a spoiler – but if you know nothing, look away now – to say thatHamnet, the only son of William Shakespeare and Agnes, née Hathaway, died of the plague at the age of 11. The death of a child is a peerless tragedy, so any observation about the onscreen charm of the actor – for instance, “I didn’t find him that charming, I preferred the daughters” – is verboten, and that’s fair enough.There are a number of principles of screen grief that give it intellectual heft, an agenda: the first is that women feel things more deeply than men, particularly their parental bond, but also their connection with the natural world, and with unspoken things, like magic. Buckley curls up in the roots of trees and sometimes can’t breathe with anxiety for her daughter, anxiety whose wellspring is maternal love spliced with witchy premonition. She has foreseen her deathbed, and it features only two children, therefore, having three, something terrible is bound to happen.View image in fullscreenOrnithological bond … Claire Foy in H Is for Hawk.Photograph: Roadside Attractions/Everett/ShutterstockThose womanly qualities also define the film adaptation ofHelen Macdonald’s memoir H Is for Hawk– again, two wonderful actors,Claire Foy and Brendan Gleesonas daughter and father, performing the only way they know how, which is to say, well. When her dad dies suddenly, Foy retreats into isolated commune with a bird of prey, a reach back to her ornithological bond with him, a stalwart refusal, via obsessive hand-feeding of Mabel the bird, and corresponding neglect of self-care, to let Gleeson be dead. True grief stops all the clocks, is the message, and only women know how to do that, partly because only women feel it truly, and partly because only they can mess with time.It feels a little dogmatic, but what makes it grief-porn is that you can only join the character in her mire; whether Buckley’s roaring or Foy’s eerie silence, the emotionality allows in no externality; you either unquestioningly feel it with them or you don’t understand.“Natural world” is a generalisation. What I’m really talking about is birds; Agnes has a hawk, and Shakespeare’s first dating overture is to make her a glove (he is from a glove-making family). Birders were vexed that the film used a Harris’s hawk, an ornithological impossibility in 1580s England (they weren’t introduced until the 1960s – why oh why couldn’t they have found a goshawk, other people, not me, have asked). In the book it’s a kestrel and it signifies Agnes’s soaring free spirit, defiance of convention; in the film, the winged creature performs a more Ted Hughes-lite role, as does the hawk in H Is for Hawk, the size-altering macaw in 2024’sTuesdayand the crow in last year’sThe Thing With Feathers. These birds, one way or another, are all death.View image in fullscreenJulia Louis-Dreyfus as Zora in Tuesday.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyTuesday starsJulia Louis-Dreyfusas Zora, the mother who cannot accept the impending death ofLola Petticrew’s extremely winning titular character. The Thing with Feathers is an adaptation of Max Porter’s extraordinarily movingGrief is the Thing With Feathers, which doesn’t come close to even reminding you of the power of the novella. As memento mori, birds no longer signify liberation, but rather, its opposite; the camera lingers on their eyes, their eerie watchfulness, their sudden movements – particularly in H Is for Hawk: all the bits about birds, in other words, that make you freak out if one flies into your house, because they’re disgusting.Again, there’s something prescriptive about the imagery in every case; if you don’t prefer feathers to fur, if you can’t see the majesty in a creature unless it will let you pet it, if you can’t tolerate its autonomy, love it and set it free, if you can’t relish it for its very ugliness, itsdeathiness,then you are missing some qualities of authenticity and of wisdom.Tuesday stands out among all these films for having a sense of humour: it got lukewarm reviews, which were fair, but also reflected the fact that nobody knew then that so many other bird-as-death films would follow that were worse. Louis-Dreyfus’s avoidance is genuinely funny; she is constantly embarked on some ridiculous, urgent task – selling her collection of taxidermy rats, needing a wee – as her daughter tries to get her attention in order to die.View image in fullscreenBenedict Cumberbatch in The Thing With Feathers.Photograph: Vue Lumiere/PAGenerally speaking, the grief film will brook no comedy; you’ll get the odd hackneyed nod to the hilarity of loss, classically (as in H Is for Hawk) the family getting the giggles as a funeral director shows them some trashy coffins, but the broader absurdity of mortality cannot be borne. Denial, delusion, avoidance, the brutal intrusion of trivial normality into moments of existential agony – it’s all pretty funny, as you’ll know from any lived experience of grief; but grief-porn can’t brook laughter any more than regular porn can. This might be the best single litmus test for whether or not it’s art.Hamnet review – Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley beguile and captivate in audacious Shakespearean tragedyRead more“Crow is everything to Dad,” saysBenedict Cumberbatchin the press notes for The Thing with Feathers. “He’s a provocateur. He’s an angry harbinger of grief and inadequacy. He’s the worst internal critic. He’s a guardian angel. He’s a protector.” The Thing is, of course, grief in a man, so when he’s inarticulate, that’s masculine shortcoming rather than feminine mystique, and when he attaches to his feathered phantasm, that’s his flag to pull back from the abyss, rather than a portal out of numbness, back into the world (as Mabel is for Helen).Men get quite a raw deal from grief-as-depth tropes, because it would be so unfashionable to find dignity in their inarticulacy.Chloé Zhao, Hamnet’s director, said that in its making she discovered that “feminine leadership – and that doesn’t mean just women, it means the feminine consciousness in all people – [draws] strength from intuition, relationships, community and interdependence”. Which, again, is a little circular, since Agnes’s grief cycle largely displays none of those values, yet they must be there, because a woman is feeling them, and if any man is feeling them, it’s because he’s tapping into his feminine consciousness.Whether it’s grief-porn or grief-art, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying it, by the way.

In the world of hip-hop, where even A-list stars such as Rocky’s friend and collaborator Tyler, the Creator are prone to releasing multiple albums a year, this is a lifetime. In the time since Rocky released his third album, 2018’s Testing, Kanye West has rebranded as a born-again Christian, swerved to the rightandreleased five albums. Rocky hasn’t been sitting around: he’s been a press mainstay, thanks to his relationship with pop superstar Rihanna, with whom he now has three children, and last year was acquitted of firing a gun at a former friend, dodging up to 24 years in prison. He has also found acclaim as an actor, starring opposite Rose Byrne in the lauded dark comedy If I Had Legs I’d Kick You and Denzel Washington in Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Don’t Be Dumb.Photograph: Publicity imageAside from a few one-off singles, such as the Tame Impala collaboration Sundress, Rocky has released music in fits and starts in recent years. (In terms of mainstream stars, perhaps only Rocky’s romantic partner outpaces him when it comes to leaving fans waiting: it has been a decade since Rihanna’s last record.) Testing yielded the Skepta-featuring hit Praise the Lord (Da Shine), but otherwise fell flat with mainstream audiences and critics alike, lacking the dynamism and potent charisma of his breakout albums. That album seemed to leave Rocky at a crossroads. Would it serve him best to continue exploring its slipshod experimentalism, or to make an attempt at retrenchment, and return to the more straightforward music that made him famous?Don’t Be Dumb, Rocky’s fourth album, attempts both options at the same time: Despite its hour-long runtime, it feels brash and fleet-footed, excising Testing’s ponderous avant garde samples and experiments with singing, and reigniting some of the fiery, shit-stirrer attitude that animated Rocky’s 2013 major-label debut, Long.Live.A$AP. But it’s hardly a slam-dunk. Some songs feel phoned-in lyrically, and others feel overstuffed with production elements; as is so often the case with years-in-the-making albums, an edit feels necessary. Even so, it’s coherent and plainlyfunto listen to: the guest list might feature everyone from Hans Zimmer to Tyler, the Creator to indie folk luminary Jessica Pratt, but Rocky is the star here, and he’s worth the price of admission.As ever, Rocky’s charisma knows no bounds. Stole Ya Flow is ostensibly a Drake diss track, but it succeeds because Rocky sounds like he’s having so much fun: “N***** gettin’ BBLs / Lucky we don’t body shame,” he raps, relishing in the line’s petty faux-altruism. (Drake has denied having some plastic surgery procedures.) On the warm, dazed Playa, Rocky sounds positively avuncular, rapping as if he’s giving advice to someone in love for the first time, though the advice is, admittedly, very specific and kind of callous: “No receipts, don’t text.” On Air Force (Black Demarco), he raps over the kind of harsh, glitchy beat that would feel at home on a Playboi Carti album, before a beat-switch into stoned psych-rock; it feels like a canny fourth-wall break, a sly taunt to anyone who trashed the indie-leaning Testing.A$AP Rocky: Helicopter – reviewThese sharper moments bump up against lyrics that can sometimes feel purely lazy: his observation on Helicopter that people would “do anything for a blue check” – as in, on X – is a potent reminder that Rocky is now a father of three. Later, on the Gorillaz collab Whiskey, he seemingly zones out into full-blown free association: “Tipsy, kiss me so wet, they make bridges / I don’t burn no bridges / Tryna hold it in, I don’t burn no friendships,” he mumbles, his lethargy so strong that it threatens to sink the whole record. These flabbier sections are, thankfully, outweighed by Don’t Be Dumb’s sprightlier moments: altogether, it’s Rocky’s strongest album since his debut, buoyed by a sense of playfulness he seemed to have lost for a second. Fans dumbfounded by Testing can breathe easy.Explore more on these topicsA$AP RockyRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

But a few years ago, the Los Angeles saxophonist Aaron Shaw realised he was becoming increasingly breathless. In 2023, aged 27, he was diagnosed with bone marrow failure, meaning he wasn’t producing enough oxygen-carrying red blood cells. A change of approach was required.Shaw had risen quickly. He studied withKamasi Washington, worked alongside Herbie Hancock and Anderson .Paak, and tutoredAndré 3000in music theory. Shaw works regularly with LA bandleaderCarlos Niño, and played on his 2024 new-age jazz album Placenta and last year’s collaboration with poet Saul Williams. In turn, Niño has produced and played percussion on Shaw’s forthcoming debut album And So It Is, which has something of the West Coast jazz haze you find in both Niño’s and Washington’s music. But Shaw’s sound is actually a lower, darker fog, which he navigates with quiet caution.Shaw mostly plays tenor saxophone and alto flute on the record. It is easier for him to play the latter – less breath is required – yet he persists with his original instrument, floating, Lester Young-style, over the top of Chick Corea’s Windows to the Soul, and battling through long sustains on Heart of a Phoenix. Throughout the record you hear a young musician coming to terms with the end of one musical road, and cautiously feeling around for what comes next. Intimate loops and unexpected flourishes on flute provide optimistic notes on this remarkably open record.Hugh MorrisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenKim Gordon.Photograph: Moni HaworthKim Gordon – Not TodayTo date Gordon’s solo career has been so abrasive and noisy that to hear her singing, quite forlornly, over warmer, racing synths rather than her usual industrial clatter is genuinely disarming.LSMorgan Nagler – Grassoline“I know Jesus ain’t gonna save me / And if he does that’d just be crazy,” the LA songwriter sings in an instantly indelible ode to green, all shambolic, endearing twang.LSRaf-Saperra – Butcher’s Scale (ft Benny the Butcher)Streatham Hill’s finest heads to the US, blending his Punjabi flow and instrumentation with boom-bap beats and a Benny the Butcher guest verse; Ghostface Killah is among the other guests on his new EP.BBTWu Lyf – Tib St TabernacleThe Mancunian rockers amassed cultlike fans in the 2010s, and this return could summon them all over again: it’s an 11-minute anthem that goes from spirited march to pell-mell gallop.

Homoerotic paean to Morrissey, anyone?Alexis PetridisThu 15 Jan 2026 19.01 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 13.02 ESTShareThe arrival of Robbie Williams’s 13th album has been a complicated business. It was announced in May 2025 and was supposed to come out in October, when its title would have chimed with the 90s nostalgia sparked by theOasis reunion. Williams spent the summer engaging in promotion, unveiling fake Britpop-themed blue plaques around London and staging a press conference at the Groucho Club. There was alaunch gig at storied Camden venue Dingwalls, at which he performed not just his new album in full, but his 1997 solo debut Life Thru a Lens.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for BritpopIt was a bold choice, given that Life Thru a Lens initially threatened to derail his solo career: at the time, the now nakedly obvious supernova hitsAngelsandLet Me Entertain Youwere overlooked while people criticised Williams’s muddled attempts to fit in with, well, Britpop. On stage at Dingwalls, he made the surprise announcement that the album now wasn’t coming out until mid-February, admitting with winning candour that he didn’t want to compete with Taylor Swift’sThe Life of a Showgirl. Now it’s suddenly appeared, without explanation, two weeks into January: presumably because Williams will have fewer competitors in the albums chart this week, giving him a greater chance at breaking the record he currently jointly holds with the Beatles for the most UK No 1 albums ever.It is all a little strange, but then theBritpopalbum itself feels peculiar. Williams has trailed it as “the album I wanted to make when I left Take That” and a celebration of “a golden age for British music”. Yet you wonder why he would want to revisit the mid-90s, a time when he was lost, in the grip of addiction, subject to a lot of pretty unpleasant public mockery, completely unaware that he was about to become the biggest British artist of his era. You could suggest it’s an act of closure, but you might reasonably have thought Williams got closure when he released Angels: one of the most-played songs on UK radio over the next year; a song so ubiquitous that it “evicted Wonderwall from the national psyche”, as John Harris put it in his Britpop history The Last Party, its success suggestive of a distinct sea change in popular tastes away from the at least putatively alternative to the unashamedly mainstream. Certainly, there were substantially more takers for Williams’s subsequent solo work than for the artists the music press predicted would rule 1998: Symposium, Ultrasound, Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s old band theaudience, and the Warm Jets.Robbie Williams: Spies – videoSo what is going on here? Initially, you get the impression that Williams thinks he has unfinished business with the sound he initially pursued as a confused ex-boyband member, returning to it with the confidence of a man who has sold 75m records and can call upon Black Sabbath guitaristTony Iommifor openerRocket. It doesn’t always work – the ungainly glam of Cocky sounds like Oasis, but alas Oasis circa Heathen Chemistry rather than Definitely Maybe – but when it does, Britpop makes Williams’ plan seem a good idea. There’s no mistaking who influenced the vocal intonation of All My Life, with its vowels drawled into multiple syllables, or the wall of distorted guitars onSpies. Like Liam Gallagher’s 2019 solo tracks Once and One of Us, Spies casts a ruefully nostalgic eye over mid-90s hedonism: “We used to stay up all night, thinking we were all spies, praying that tomorrow won’t come.” But there’s a swagger and sparkle to the melodies that shift these songs past the realm of pastiche, and the results are hugely enjoyable.Do you remember the first time? Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go awayRead moreJust as you think you’ve got the general idea of the album, it unravels. There is Morrissey, a jokey, faintly homoerotic synth-pop paean to the former Smiths frontman co-authored by Gary Barlow, which, if nothing else, wins points for sheer improbability. There is It’s OK Until the Drugs Stop Working, a track that, melodically, at least, sounds remarkably like the British bubblegum pop that briefly flourished in the charts between the end of the 60s and the rise of glam: the province of White Plains, Christie and Butterscotch, not artists anyone writing an album review in 2026 might reasonably have expected to invoke. And there isHuman, a beautiful, lambent electronic ballad about AI, featuring Mexican pop duo Jesse & Joy (Williams is famously a very big deal in Mexico, where 2005’s Intensive Care remains the eighth biggest-selling album of all time) as well as Coldplay’s Chris Martin on guitar and keys. It might be the best song here, but what it has to do with the Britpop concept is anyone’s guess, lambent synth-pop songs about AI having been pretty thin on the ground in the mid-90s.Still, conceptually sound or not, Britpop is never less than engaging. The one thing it doesn’t have is a track that might conceivably have the same impact as Angels or Let Me Entertain You, which leaves it in an odd position. It may well be the albumRobbie Williamswanted to make when he left Take That. Equally, he must be incredibly glad that he didn’t.This week Alexis listened toDaphni – Talk to MeDan Snaith returns to his dancefloor-focused alias, effortlessly conjures up hypnotic, tripped-out 3am mood.

Tragic Magic, the pair’s first collaborative album, evidences this bond: born out of a short series of improv sessions in Paris, it’s a wonderfully immersive set of new age and ambient tracks, where Barwick’s airy, reverbed vocals and atmospheric synth washes interweave with, and accentuate, Lattimore’s twinkling harp.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Tragic MagicThe album sessions took place shortly after last year’s California wildfires, which the two musicians experienced as residents. Accordingly, tragedy and hope cut through the dreamlike haze of these unfurling compositions. With its delicate harp loop and hushed whispers, openerPerpetual Adorationis as sweet and dreamy as a lullaby, while the gorgeous, moving Haze With No Haze carries a quiet desperation in the brittle, staccato melodyand Barwick’s yearning high register. As always, her lyrics are indiscernible, words blurring into texture and shapeless whispers, but teem with feeling.Even at their most spartan, the songs feel more grand and cinematic than the pair’s respective solo work; Lattimore’s harp is given particular room to shine. Occasionally, the duo reach towards epic heights, as in their murky take on Rachel’s Song from Blade Runner, which rushes into an effervescent flurry in its final minute, or on Stardust, the album’s climax, where soaring synths and celestial harp flickers are bolstered by a drum kick five minutes in, the closest things get to pop sensibilities. But just then, they strip it all back for the fluttering, near-nine-minute closerMelted Moon– the emotion lingering where the fullness doesn’t. The effect is both intimate and expansive.Also out this monthAquáticos, the new collaborative album from Brazilian guitaristFabianodo Nascimentoand Los Angeles producerEddie Ruscha, is a lush, meditative listen (Music from Memory). Across these nine wandering tracks, the trickling percussion and spritely guitar plucks and strums are buoyed up by warm, bubbling synths, a combination that evokes slow summer days. Even the most stripped-back recordings inTashi Dorji’s discography are characterised by a quiet freneticism that comes from his improvisational approach. On his new album Low Clouds Hang, This Land Is on Fire (Drag City), however, the Bhutanese-American guitarist opts for something much calmer. These reverb-drenched recordings are spacious, soft and introspective – his attempt “to find the silence”. French composer and sound artistCharlène Dannancierpaints an eerie portrait of ambiguous relationship dynamics on her new album Baisée (Strange Therapy). Across 10 haunting tracks, each devoted to a different relationship stage or feeling, her breathy vocals fragments twist around dense, discordant electronics.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicExperimental album of the monthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Title after title is devoted to clay and stone, trees and flowers, the riverine and the botanical, gardens and allotments. They share a vocabulary: care, tending, grounding, rootedness, nourishment, regeneration. Nature, however battered, is held up as an antidote to morbid modernity, its alienations, its amnesia.The Possibility of Tenderness is also about nature, its setting Coffee Grove in the May Day Mountains of Jamaica. During Jason Allen-Paisant’s early childhood there, it had no electricity or piped water. Neither beach idyll nor Trenchtown ghetto, its personality was shaped in large part by “grung” – the local name for small plots cultivated by peasant farmers. Apples, guava, mangoes: here, for all the sweat and toil, was succulence.He talks to locals, goes on mini-treks with herbalist Rastas, pores over old maps in local archives. No clear story emerges. In its absence are riffs – on the difference between a vision and a dream, the ubiquity of tombs, the frequency with which hillside people speak about the dead, what he claims is the absence of the term “forest” in the local vernacular. Walking especially fascinates him as it allows him to smell and to hear the countryside with an almost tactile acuteness. He even remembers how his grandmother, like many who lived in the Grove, “would walk with one arm gripping the other behind her back”.Sukhdev Sandhu£10.19 (RRP £11.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA wise and wonderful account of infidelityThree Days in JuneAnne TylerThree Days in JuneAnne TylerA wise and wonderful account of infidelityThere’s a scene near the end of Anne Tyler’s new novel, Three Days in June, where the two main characters, a divorced middle-aged couple named Gail and Max, compare their lives to the movie Groundhog Day, “where people live through the same day over and over until they get it right”, Gail reminds him. “Wouldn’t it be great if the world worked that way?” says Max. Instead, Tyler’s novels are records of the numerous ways people get things wrong and learn to live with it, and how the wrong things have a sneaky habit, eventually, of turning out to be right.Tyler gets much gentle comedy from the way Gail is both irritated by and drawn to her ex-husband, who nibbles at everything in the fridge, parks his car too close to hers and leaves the front door open, but also helps her negotiate what turns out to be a rocky few days as a bombshell strikes: news of a recent infidelity rocks the bride-to-be on the eve of her wedding. Form follows emotional function, as always in Tyler’s books. A hiccup in the wedding plans of their daughter proves the perfect place for all the unresolved feelings around Gail and Max’s own abruptly truncated marriage to pool.Three Days in June takes two days to read, but it envelops you just the same, her characters so alive they could be sitting next to you telling you what happened to them last Tuesday – and the ending is a beauty.Tom Shone£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseSocietyWhy you should quit your job to make the world a better placeMoral AmbitionRutger BregmanMoral AmbitionRutger BregmanWhy you should quit your job to make the world a better placeBregman begins from the deep and corrosive anomie experienced by so many gifted young professionals who find themselves making substantial sums of money in exhausting and (at best) morally compromising jobs. The “moral ambition” of the title is about recognising that serious financial, organisational, technological and analytical skills – the kind that in the US will get you through, say, law school with a secure ticket to prosperity – can be used to make tangible improvements in the lives of human and nonhuman neighbours.This is more than a self-help manual. It may be more optimistic than current global trends seem to warrant; it may be a bit thin on how you sustain imaginatively, even spiritually, the moral ambition it prescribes. But at its best it offers a bracingly hopeful perspective, insisting on the necessity of doing all you can to allow yourself to be sensitised and resensitised to that which eats away at the dignity not only of humanity but (an important element in Bregman’s argument) of the entire living environment. And, as he notes at the very end of the book, believing that individuals can’t make a difference is paradoxically a deeply individualistic conviction, a refusal to see the interwovenness of human agency. Oversimplified? Perhaps. But calls to arms often have to be.Rowan Williams£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePsychologyMusician, heal thyselfMusic As MedicineDaniel LevitinMusic As MedicineDaniel LevitinMusician, heal thyselfThat great music can be uplifting, transportive, transcendent – and conversely sorrowful or deeply unsettling – is a given, but its power to heal in the medicinal sense strikes me as a much more difficult proposition to prove. In Music As Medicine, Daniel Levitin makes a valiant attempt to do just that.A neuroscientist and cognitive psychologist who trained at Stanford, he is now a professor of behavioural neuroscience and music at McGill University in Montreal. He temporarily forsook science for music in the 1970s, playing in various bands before becoming a music consultant and sound engineer for, among others, Santana, Steely Dan and Stevie Wonder. This unique dual perspective underpins his bestselling volume of 2006 – This Is Your Brain on Music, in which he explored the often complex ways we mentally process and emotionally respond to music, how and why we find some songs profoundly affecting, while others leave us cold.Like that book, Music As Medicine merges research, theory and intriguing anecdotes about his interactions with musicians as well as patients to provide evidence of his contention that music not only functions as a temporary uplift or soothing balm in times of trouble, but possesses a much deeper restorative quality.It will certainly make you think more deeply about music’s healing properties, particularly for those who perform. As Levitin says, “when we play an instrument (including singing), we are engaging more mental facilities that almost any other activity: motor systems, motor planning, imagining, sensory auditory processing, and – if we’re inspired – creativity, spirituality, pro-social feelings and, possibly, a state of heightened awareness coupled with calm known as the flow state.”Sean O’Hagan£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionThe most Irish-American novel of the yearA Kid from Marlboro RoadEdward BurnsA Kid from Marlboro RoadEdward BurnsThe most Irish-American novel of the yearThis intensely nostalgic debut novel from film-maker Edward Burns, best known for writing and directing The Brothers McMullen, begins with a well-attended wake in 1970s New York. At the service, “old Irish biddies dressed in black” pray over their rosary beads; afterwards, drinking buddies of the deceased, a labourer named Pop McSweeney, trade stories at the bar.Then the narrator, Pop’s young grandson, introduces us to his Long Island home turf where many of the neighbours – O’Neils, Murphys, Dillons – have double-digit families. His dad loves to “play the ponies”; his mother suffers bouts of melancholy. He attends a Catholic school called St Joes run by sadistic nuns. If there’s a more Irish-American novel published this year, it’ll be something to behold.The narrator remains nameless but his background is markedly similar to the author’s own – indeed, photos from the Burns family album crop up at the back showing forebears who inspired some of the characters in the book. As well as Pop, there’s a paternal great-grandfather who started a trucking company in Hell’s Kitchen, and his abusive drunk of a son who was gunned down outside a tavern on 11th Avenue – the narrator’s father visits the spot every year with his kids to raise a celebratory glass.There is a keenly felt sense in the novel, which may have prompted its writing, of the past fading away or being demolished. The narrator’s mother gets a sadness in her eyes whenever she passes a monument of her youth that’s fallen into disrepair. She’s even more upset by the prospect of losing her two sons to adulthood. The narrator’s older brother, Tommy, turned into an “asshole” when he became a teenager – surly, delinquent, dismissive of his family. Now as the narrator turns 13, he worries he’ll go the same way.Before this dreaded transformation occurs – and there are twinges of it whenever his mother holds his hand in the street or his dad tries to foist Hemingway on him – he sets about documenting his life using a typewriter inherited from his grandfather. He records recent fishing trips and neighbourhood baseball games alongside older childhood memories and family anecdotes going back decades. The layers of nostalgia threaten to become overbearing at times but Burns’s plain, unfussy style keeps a lid on it. We’re left with a vivid snapshot of a time that’s already receding into the distant past – a tender-hearted complement to the Irish-American stories that Burns captures in his films.Killian Fox£11.69 (RRP £12.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePoliticsHow Team Biden wished away his decline until it was too lateOriginal SinJake Tapper and Alex ThompsonOriginal SinJake Tapper and Alex ThompsonHow Team Biden wished away his decline until it was too lateJoe Biden mistook his victory in 2020 for a sweeping, FDR-like mandate. Officially, that was before age and decay caught up. Horrifically, for Democrats, in June 2024 a debacle of a debate against Donald Trump confirmed what Washington insiders had only dared whisper but what most voters had known: Biden should not have sought re-election.\nTapper and Thompson concur. Over 350 engrossing pages, they deliver a stinging judgment, trenchantly written and well-sourced.Original Sin begins with a bang. Its first chapter is titled “He Fucked Us”, from an on-record quote by David Plouffe, senior adviser to the Harris campaign, before that manager of Barack Obama’s 2008 winning effort. “We got so screwed by Biden as a party,” Plouffe says. Harris was a “great soldier”, but the race was “a fucking nightmare. … And it’s all Biden”.“The Bidens’ greatest strength is living in their own reality,” a source tells Tapper and Thompson. “And Biden himself is gifted at creating it: Beau isn’t going to die. Hunter’s sobriety is stable … Joe always tells the truth. Joe cares more about his family than his own ambition … They stick to the narrative and repeat it.”To quote Lewis Carroll: “I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true.”\nTapper and Thompson lay bare a sense of betrayal. For now, Trump is the exception that proves the rule: America is no country for old presidents.Lloyd Green£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA dazzling Renaissance rompPerspectivesLaurent BinetPerspectivesLaurent BinetA dazzling Renaissance rompFlorence, 1557. A painter is murdered with a hammer blow to the head and a chisel to the heart. It looks as though someone has painted over a section of the frescoes he has been labouring on for years at the church of San Lorenzo. But who could have killed old Jacopo da Pontormo, and why?So begins this historical epistolary detective novel, stuffed with real-life Renaissance artists behaving badly. As the investigation proceeds we learn of secret passages, a missing pornographic painting, international intrigues and an annoying group of nuns who moan about not being given enough wine. The star of the show, however, is Benvenuto Cellini, goldsmith, sculptor, adventurer and author (his autobiography in real life is much admired): in Binet’s ventriloquism he is brave, catty and absurdly conceited, and gets to hide in cupboards and evade guards with irrepressible elan.The novel was originally published in France with the title Perspective(s), which makes more obvious the fact that, as well as its crowd of characters with their own points of view, it is also about the artistic technique of foreshortening. There is a very funny scene in which one artist manages to shoot an assassin with a crossbow because, as he explains in needless detail, his understanding of perspective helps him aim properly; while others speak in more serious tones about the way the vanishing point in a composition can make “infinity” visible to mortal man.In all, Perspectives aims, modestly and with thorough success, to be a dazzling romp.Steven Poole£8.49 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseMemoirA glorious celebration of queer loveThe Loves of My LifeEdmund WhiteThe Loves of My LifeEdmund WhiteA glorious celebration of queer loveIn this, Edmund White’s sixth memoir, the American novelist and critic observes that a universal prudishness about sex sits alongside the fact that it is constantly on our minds.Transcribing the vocabulary of sex – especially sex between men – has been White’s lifelong literary project, most famously in the semi-autobiographical 1982 novel A Boy’s Own Story. Loves of My Life approaches the task with refreshing candour. The result is something like an erotic almanac, charting the shifting sexual mores and conventions of gay life through seven decades, from the “oppression of the 1950s” to the “brewing storm in the 2020s against everything labelled ‘woke’”.Passages on two seismic events in modern gay history are invaluable, here, for their unsentimental frankness, a perspective only afforded to someone who actually lived through them. The Stonewall uprising is both the moment that gay men began “thinking we were a minority” and the victory that “permitted us to put our creative energies into something other than simply enduring”. The Aids crisis is portrayed through several thumbnail sketches of brief flings, each closing with five staccato syllables – “he got Aids and died” – that land with the force of a bludgeon.White is so clearly in complete control of his powers, switching between coquetry and high seriousness, weaving a rich tapestry of cultural references (Jean Genet to Hello Kitty, Stendhal to Sontag) while carefully deploying his unique ability, as Alan Hollinghurst put it, to “translate libido into style” through metaphor. Which is to say, he is also a poet. How else to describe a writer who sees, in the eyebrows and unsmiling, closed mouth of a man, a “Morse code of male beauty”, or even better, “the oblong pitches in a medieval hymnal”?Ralf Webb£9.34 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseCrimeA cosy whodunnitThis Is Not a GameKelly MullenThis Is Not a GameKelly MullenA cosy whodunnitMullen’s first novel is set on Mackinac Island in Michigan’s Lake Huron, where feisty septuagenarian Mimi and her granddaughter Addie team up to investigate a murder in a Cluedo-style house that functions as a character in itself. Addie, co-designer of the video game Murderscape, is recovering from a breakup with fiance Brian, who is claiming all the credit and financial reward for their joint invention, when she reluctantly agrees to accompany her grandmother to a charity auction. The invitation has been issued by socialite Jane who, it appears, is not above blackmailing Mimi into paying over the odds for an item she doesn’t want. When Jane is found stabbed to death, and a snowstorm shuts down all channels of communication as well as any means of travel, Mimi and Addie set to work to discover whodunnit. They question suspects, find secret passages and trapdoors, and apply both gaming skills and golden-age mystery knowledge. The result is fabulous, over-the-top fun.Laura Wilson£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePsychologyKeep the glass half fullThe Bright SideSumit Paul-ChoudhuryThe Bright SideSumit Paul-ChoudhuryKeep the glass half fullThe risk of a book called The Bright Side is that it evokes the farcical good cheer of Eric Idle’s character at the close of The Life of Brian, leading a trivial little sing song among a group of people who have been crucified. This is always a problem when seeking to promote optimism in the face of significant geopolitical and ethical challenges. It can seem perverse, amid ongoing suffering and uncertainty, to maintain that things will go well.Paul-Choudhury is a science journalist and a man who has borne the premature loss of his wife to ovarian cancer. He is serious about optimism, but he is never glib or Pollyannaish. His book is as much a careful examination of the misuses of optimism as its uses. Here ideas are picked up, explored, and critiqued. Different perspectives are presented, and what unfolds is a convincing case that, while we might frequently feel we have grounds for pessimism, a particular form of optimism is the only morally serious choice.This comes clearly to the fore when Paul-Choudhury is paraphrasing a prison letter of Gramsci’s; for “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will,” he suggests “the ability to see the world for what it is and press on anyway. That seems like a skill worth cultivating. But can we cultivate it?”He presents a fascinating and wide-ranging argument that is hopeful but never trite or self satisfied.Huw Green£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA wartime thrillerThe Ghosts Of RomeJoseph O'ConnorThe Ghosts Of RomeJoseph O'ConnorA wartime thrillerSet in 1944, six months after the Italians changed sides, the second title in O’Connor’s Rome Escape Line trilogy continues the story of Monsignor Hugh O’Flaherty and his fellow conspirators. Known as The Choir, they operate out of a Vatican left alone by the city’s Nazi occupiers in exchange for papal neutrality, risking their lives to help allied soldiers and other fugitives evade capture. The Choir’s attempts to rescue a grievously wounded Polish airman right under the nose of Gestapo commander Paul Hauptmann, who has been warned of the Fuhrer’s “intense displeasure” at his failure to eradicate the Escape Line, have a nail-bitingly tense “real time” feel to them. BBC interviews from the 1960s with former Choir members and fragments of an unpublished memoir give historical perspective and added pathos to this vivid and moving story, with O’Connor seamlessly combining real characters with imagined ones.Laura Wilson£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

Obnoxious jewellery dealer Rodney Manderson has been killed outside the Bowery auction rooms, stabbed through the eye with the Victorian hatpin that his boss, Rose Bowery, has brandished in front of the nation on Bargain Hunt. As she discussed the pin’s virtues as a deadly weapon as well as its millinerial uses, the fiercely loyal Rilke decides – while feeling grateful to have skipped lunch and trying not to think of jelly – to remove it before calling the police. They soon decide they’ve got their man, but Rilke’s not so sure; the roots of the crime may lie in the past – in particular, a notorious reform school. With a central character who feels like an old friend, The Cut Up is as sharply observed, humane and beautifully written as its two superb predecessors.The Persianby David McCloskey (Swift, £20)Former CIA analyst McCloskey’s fourth novel centres on Jewish Iranian dentist Kam Esfahani. Dissatisfied with life in Sweden, where his family relocated when driven out of Iran, and wanting the wherewithal to move to California, he accepts an offer from the chief of Mossad’s Caesarea Division. Returning to Tehran, he runs a fake dental practice as cover for assisting in “sowing chaos and mayhem in Iran”. Things go awry when he enlists double agent Roya Shabani, widow of an Iranian scientist killed by the Israelis. The book takes the form of a series of confessions that Kam, now caught and imprisoned, is forced to write by his torturer, and these documents – which may or may not reveal the whole truth – are interspersed with flashbacks. Kam’s cynical tone and mordant humour serve to underline not only the horror, but also the inherent hypocrisy of the endless cycle of violence and retribution: this masterly novel is tragically topical and utterly gripping.View image in fullscreenThe 10:12by Anna Maloney (Raven, £16.99)In screenwriter Maloney’s debut novel, fiftysomething art lecturer Claire Fitzroy is on her way home from Manchester, preoccupied by a marital crisis, when a ragbag of angry screw-ups, their antisocial tendencies inflamed by internet rage-bait, hijack the 10:12 to Euston. With other brave passengers, Claire fights back, but some of her actions have drastic consequences; and when the surviving terrorists are put on trial, Claire finds herself in the court of public opinion, with many viewing her not as a life-saving heroine but as an unhinged menopausal murderer. Now she wants to put the record straight – and, unsatisfied by what she’s heard at the Old Bailey, to discover the whole truth. Gripping and immersive, this salutary tale of how we stereotype and underestimate others is a white-knuckle read that also gives food for thought.View image in fullscreenVery Slowly Allat Onceby Lauren Schott (HQ, £16.99)This tense, pacy debut novel is a cautionary tale about living beyond one’s means. Trying to maintain their dream home and lifestyle in an exclusive Cleveland suburb has left the Evans family – divorce attorney Hailey Evans, lecturer Mack, and their two young daughters – financially stretched. To make matters worse, Mack is suspended from work; Hailey’s most lucrative client reneges on payment; ominous cracks are appearing all over their newly built house; and they are about to have to start picking up the tab for Mack’s mother’s care home. The cheques that arrive from the mysterious “Sunshine Enterprises” seem like a godsend, and Mack convinces himself that they are his estranged father’s way of atoning for past wrongs, but soon the money is accompanied by requests that involve breaking the law … Schott cleverly keeps things just the right side of plausible as the Evans’s lives spin out of control, and paranoia and desperation take hold.Vivian Dies Againby CE Hulse (Viper, £16.99)Comic novelist Caroline Hulse’s crime debut is the story of 36-year-old hot mess Vivian Slade, who spends her life trying to “avoid being sober and alone”. She’s a chaotic nightmare as a flatmate, an embarrassment to her relatives and a source of ruined parties and outrageous anecdotes to her acquaintances. When someone pushes her off a balcony at a family gathering, she finds herself caught in the timeloop of her own murder, her only ally an exhausted waiter who, having cradled her broken body during her first “death”, is now stuck with her. There are flashbacks to various important events in Vivian’s life as she and Jamie try to work out who wants her dead and why, and Vivian realises that she needs to start asking awkward questions and confronting hard truths. Hulse performs the necessary sleights of hand with great aplomb in this witty and innovative mystery.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupFictionThrillersCrime fictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her new novel, Chosen Family, is a smart, funny tale of a complicated, life-changing relationship between two women.Nell and Eve meet aged 12 at a girls’ school in Sydney. Gray’s narrative moves smoothly back and forth from the 00s to the present day; as in David Nicholls’s One Day, we learn about our protagonists by meeting them at different moments in their lives, from the pressures of high school to the alcohol-soaked freedoms of university to the frustrations and joys of early parenthood.We are told at the outset that, although Nell and Eve have a young daughter that they coparent, Nell is no longer around – and her mysterious absence keeps us deeply invested in their story. What went wrong? Who betrayed whom? And can it be fixed?When they first meet, Nell is a lonely kid with rich parents who give her their credit card details but not much else. She is resigned to being friendless until she meets Eve, a new girl with a flaky single mum. The two are instant allies, devoted to each other, but mean girls soon begin to circle. There are rumours Eve is a “lez”. Sensing social disaster, Nell cuts Eve loose to save herself.Gray evokes the horrors of school perfectly – “there is something almost sublime about the cruelty of preteen girls; the absolute acid of it”. Without Nell, Eve is a solitary “ghost”. But when we meet Eve again at university, we see her coming back to life, making new friends (the scene-stealing Marcus and Tae) and beginning to embrace her sexuality. She Googles “how to look even gayer” before going to class and, on her first outing to a gay bar, asks if it’s acceptable to buy another woman a drink, or “patriarchal”.Gray beautifully depicts Eve’s discovery of her new queer identity, showing how vital and exciting it can be to find a community. But even as Eve is revelling in the newfound joys of lesbian sex, she is careful not to let anyone get close to her. And when Nell comes back into her life – a subdued and apologetic version of her high-school self – Eve is both a magnanimous friend and someone acutely aware of the power of being a magnanimous friend.Beneath their tentative reunion, questions linger: what do they really feel for each other? Are they friends or something more?Beneath their tentative reunion, other questions linger: what do they really feel for each other? Are they friends or something more? Were those school bullies on to something? The wounds that linger from their younger years come into even sharper focus when Eve suggests they bring up a child together as friends, using sperm donated by one of their gay male housemates (“Inseminate me, babe!”). Despite misgivings, Nell goes along with it.Relationship novels typically use female friendship as a place where the characters go to discuss their love lives – a kind of narrative breakout area – but there is often an intensity equal to the “main” romances. Sally Rooney’sBeautiful World, Where Are You, for example, features long emails sent between two women, whose relationship to each other is arguably as compelling as the ones they have with men. Chosen Family explores that unspoken possibility: could a deep love between women be put at the centre of the story? Could it form a different kind of partnership, a new kind of family?But alongside that runs the terror of losing your best friend if it all goes horribly wrong. Both Nell and Eve are obsessed with the story of Medusa. Nell becomes an artist and her work features images of the snake-headed gorgon’s admirers being turned to stone. The idea of being petrified – in both senses of the word – runs through the novel. Both women conceal things from each other because the stakes are so high.This brilliantly sharp and readable book explores friendship, parenting, love, lust, self-deception and all the ways those things overlap. It reveals the cruelties we inflict on those we are closest to and asks if we might be able to find new, more honest, ways to love.Chosen Family by Madeleine Gray is published by W&N (£20).

I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”Foddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors:I spent a weeklast year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.Baby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! Andyouwill suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He wouldnevergo outside for a hike.”View image in fullscreenPre-hike Nate in his onesie in his parents’ basement: unprepared and out of shape.Photograph: Devolver DigitalNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.Talking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.Like (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Baby Steps developers Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzillo, and Bennett Foddy.Photograph: Boch/Cuzillo/FoddyFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”Another of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.As they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker ofDespelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.View image in fullscreenNate and Mike, mid mountain climb.Photograph: Devolver DigitalBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”There is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding theplayerwould be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s somethingheloves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”The inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”That is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way youareNate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.Baby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.After Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

Adapted froman award-winning book(which also becamethe film Purely Belter), the play has its own rags-to-riches story, of sorts. Written and directed byJamie Eastlake, it began life at a 60-seater social club in north Tyneside in 2022. Now, here it is in the West End, full of vivid characters, in-your-face demotic and subtly damning commentary on the political betrayals of this region, drained of resources – and sometimes hope itself.Jonathan Tulloch’s original novel, The Season Ticket, was published in 2000 but could have been written for our age of austerity, though its tone wavers between comedy and tragedy. The picaresque exploits of young, disenfranchised friends Gerry (Dean Logan) and Sewell (Jack Robertson) – whether scouring the banks of the Tyne for stuff to sell or carrying out burglaries – are spliced with dark family drama involving poverty, domestic violence, alcoholism and sexual abuse.Eastlake tries to capture it all, adding song and dance. There are vibrant performances and effective choreography (by Lucy Marie Curry and Sean Moon) with a balaclava-clad ensemble. There is also some grittily romantic spoken-word poetry. But the script as a whole is messy and incohesive, its various parts pulling away from each other.View image in fullscreenA ton of heart and soul … Jack Robertson (Sewell) and Katherine Dow Blyton (Mrs McCarten) in Gerry and Sewell.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSome numbers work, especially those sung by Gerry’s sister Claire (Chelsea Halfpenny), who is an aspiring singer. But sudden breakouts of music, club beats and pop songs do not progress the story and bring confusion at times.There are a few powerful family scenes in the second half, especially featuring Gerry’s other, elusive sister, Bridget (Erin Mullen), including one monologue with shades ofGary Owen’s Iphigenia in Splott. But these are isolated, diluted by long comic diversions around a dog that Gerry and Sewell adopt. There is toilet humour, meta-comedy and jokes about Sunderland FC, which seem to try too hard to turn this into feelgood fare when it might gain depth by embracing the story’s darkness a little more fully. The season ticket storyline is beached by the end and some basic plotlines remain fuzzy.Still, there are sparks of brilliance and much potential – as well as a ton of heart and soul.AtAldwych theatre, London, until 24 January.

The last time this Cinderella of the brass section had a major moment in the spotlight was in 2022, when theProms hosted their first solo trombonistin almost 20 years. Before that, you have to go back to 2008 for headlines – when a dazzling 12-year-old broke records asthe youngest ever winner of BBC Young Musician. The trombone player in each case? Peter Moore.Now with a decade-long stint at the London Symphony Orchestra under his belt, Belfast-born Moore is one of the great champions of his instrument, whose growing concerto repertoire has a lot to do with his persuasive advocacy. He had an intriguing platform inDai Fujikura’s Vast Ocean II (2023) – a reworking of the composer’s 2005 trombone concerto, given its UK premiere here by Kazuki Yamada and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.Stanisław Lem’s sci-fi novel Solarisprovides the starting point: Fujikura’s orchestra the teeming, sentient, otherworldly ocean, the trombone a human adventurer. “He’s George Clooney,” Fujikura joked of Moore in the pre-concert talk. The musical effect, though, is less Hollywood and more Tarkovsky – a pointillist canvas of glinting sounds and textures that only rarely coalesce into anything conventionally developmental, preferring to circle and echo, dissolve and re-form. Moore made his instrument sing, finding shifting colours in the score’s insistent, repeated notes, coaxing slides into vocal sighs and howls while Yamada conjured a rich, elusive backdrop. Does it all add up to more than a sequence of gorgeous sonic episodes? I’m not sure. But Fujikura is, after all, the master of the musical unanswered question.We swapped other worlds for more familiar territory after the interval, and the earthly – and earthy – landscapes of Mahler’s Symphony No 1. It’s a work that suits Yamada’s heart-on-sleeve, instinctive musicianship, a symphony painted in the broadest of strokes. The second movement’s lilting peasant-Ländler swayed with more than a whiff of schnapps in the deliciously woozy string portamenti, the finale whipped up thunderclaps of timpani before a blinding climax, brass on their feet, instruments triumphantly raised. Only in the third movement, with its sinister minor-key version of Frère Jacques – bells chiming not for matins but a funeral – did we miss something. There were grotesques here, hints of sleazy horror in the klezmer-esque theme, but not the bleak nullity that is the necessary counterweight to all the symphony’s overflowing life and optimism.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicCity of Birmingham Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Broadway star Levi Kreis plays a version of himself, battling his demons and facing his past, only to conclude that, however flawed he often feels, he is in fact – ah, you’ve guessed.This Levi stumbles off stage, inked and emotional, having been dumped by text during a matinee. After 11 sober months, he reaches for the crystal meth – but his soft-eyed sponsor Ben (Yiftach “Iffy” Mizrahi) urges him to confront his inner child, ideally in song. Levi is unconvinced – “my inner child is like Chucky, but he’s human, he’s gay and he thinks he’s Elvis” – but sits at the keyboard and yowls through the pain.Matthew (Levi’s given name) slides through a crack in the wall; this cocky twink, excellently played by Killian Thomas Lefevre, takes the hero through self-hating adolescence (conversion therapy and rejection) into self-destructive adulthood (drugs and terrible men). Older and younger selves glower and snipe and slowly make their peace.View image in fullscreenYowling through the pain … Levi Kreis in Already Perfect.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianKreis’s untrammelled, often lachrymose dialogue leaves no room for nuance. Instead it whops you about the ears, spelling out exactly what Levi is deflecting or denying. He unpacks and explains his feelings – there’s nothing for the audience’s imagination to do.His lyrics, too, tend to be on the nose – but his music has a compulsive secret life. It prowls from the Pentecostal rumble of a revival meeting to a bereft Nashville sob and a broken-hearted ballad which young Matthew diagnoses as Aretha meets Tori Amos. The alluring melodies offer the compulsive rhythms of old time religion, the irresistible drama of rejection – you see how these might hold Levi’s heart even as they damage him.In Dave Solomon’s nifty production, a workaday dressing room transforms into a theatrical playground (design by Jason Ardizzone-West). Piano chords summon coloured lights, the wardrobe spills costumes, while a snap of the fingers prompts a spotlight and a prop dropping from the ceiling.There’s no doubting the talent and sincerity involved in Already Perfect, and Kreis himself brings a big voice to this small stage. He tears the heart out of his songs and brandishes it, palpitating, above his head.AtKing’s Head theatre, London, until 15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Piotr Anderszewski sees in it a testament of sorts, but one that keeps as many secrets as it reveals. By selecting a dozen of these intimate miniatures to make up an absorbing 48-minute programme, the Polish pianist opens a markedly individual window on to the composer’s solitary artistic maturity.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Brahms: Late Piano Works.Photograph: Warner ClassicsHe opens with the aching B-minor Intermezzo from the Op 119 set, the tempo measured and laden with melancholy reflection. Phrasing is fluid across concentrated interpretations that exhibit a distinctive emotional core. The moderate pace continues throughout, with Anderszewski preferring to avoid leavening the mood merely for the sake of contrast. The cumulative effect is one of penetrating regret.The Op 118 set features a heart-rending account of the tender A-major Intermezzo, the steady pace ramping up its sense of loss. The shadow of death hangs over the Op 116 A-minor Intermezzo, its pent-up grief unleashed in the subsequent G-minor Capriccio. Bringing the recital to a close is the tragic Op 118, No 6, a reading shrouded in otherworldly sorrow.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

A Church of England moralist warned any “invert” who may have been listening in of “transitory attachments, disillusionment and loneliness in his old age”.The educationist John Wolfenden recommended “a healthy and normal” home life as “the best sort of prophylactic against all sorts of troubles of this kind”.The subject of homosexuality, then a crime, was so taboo that the finished radio programme was shelved until a heavily edited version was broadcast on the Home Service three years later.Then it was forgotten until the original script was rediscovered by the historian Marcus Collins. The script has been brought to life for a new stage play titled The BBC’s First Homosexual, which will tour England in February as part ofLGBT+ History Month.The play tells the story of the radio programme, shines light on the experience of gay men in the 1950s and explores themes that still resonate today, including so-called conversion practices.Collins, aprofessor of contemporary historyat Loughborough University, said there were a number of gay “scandals” in the 1950s that made headlines and led to debates on whether there was a need to clamp down on the “immorality” or to decriminalise.“The BBC saw this ruckus and thought that as the BBC, the voice of balance and authority, it should say something definitive about homosexuality,” Collins said.View image in fullscreenMarcus Collins, left, and Stephen M Hornby.Photograph: Shay RowanThe playwrightStephen M Hornbyhad access to the script and other archive materials, including internal BBC memos and letters from the public after the edited broadcast in 1957.“The overwhelming message I got from reading it [the original script] was either naked, foaming-at-the-mouth homophobia of people like Lord Hailsham. Or the more liberal voices who say conversion therapy works, you ought to give it a go at least – and if not you can live a quiet life of abstinence and not do anything which would scare the horses,” Hornby said.The programme was presented by CR Hewitt, later chair of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, who in the programme described homosexuality as “a sort of infantilism” and “a state of arrested development”. Wolfenden, one of the participants, would later author areport recommending decriminalisation.The only remotely gay voice on the programme, titled The Homosexual Condition, was an anonymous “reformed homosexual” who believed in the value of “sheer will power” to sort people out.Collins has also discovered that programme makers attempted to involve the author of a big, albeit anonymous, article for the Sunday Times about the subject.The writer of the article was described as the “wife of a businessman in the Midlands and mother of three sons”. It was in fact Mary Whitehouse, who wrote: “It may seem a strange thing that a woman should write about homosexuality. But I think many mothers suffer from the fear that, through no fault of their own, their boys may be tempted or warped.”View image in fullscreenA read-through by the team.Photograph: Shay RowanWhitehouse, who later became a household name for hercrusades against “filth”, did not participate. But she will appear as a character in the play, which tells the story of Tom, a 19-year-old who works as a Burton’s tailor in Manchester.The BBC’s director general decided not to broadcast the programme after internal debates, including over whether it might increase homophobia. Another argument made, Collins said, was simply “that the BBC doesn’t talk about sex”.When the edited version was broadcast in 1957, the backlash was such that bosses took the decision there should be no more programmes on the subject “except for special purposes and special occasions”, Collins said. “They say we’ve covered the Wolfenden report, that is the end of discussing homosexuality … there’s nothing more to say.”The play will open in Salford before touring. The plan is to have Q&A sessions afterwards.It is a story from 70 years ago but audiences may see contemporary resonances, including on the topic of conversion practices, which is, tangentially at least, back on the BBC with the participation of Matthew Hyndman on The Traitors. Hyndman experienced it and helpedfound a groupcampaigning for conversion practices to be banned.Hornby said: “Hopefully we’ll have some really interesting conversations with our audience about conversion therapy and why government after government has announced they are going to ban it. And nobody has.”The new play was a development of a “tiny script-in-hand proof of concept 30-minute piece” done three years ago, Hornby said. It will premiere at theNew Adelphi theatreat the University of Salford on 4 Februarybefore a tourto Birmingham, Brighton, London, Liverpool and Loughborough.Explore more on these topicsTheatreLGBTQ+ rightsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re back with a big show and their first album together since 1995Fri 16 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShare‘There isn’t one songwriter, and so the flavour of the band is always going to change,” says Dave Vanian, reflecting on 50 years of the group of which he has been the sole constant member, the Damned. “Captain Sensible is a great fan of syrupy pop music and prog and glam rock. So his writing is very poppy, melodic and quite wonderful. My writing is more melodramatic, more theatrical. And Rat Scabies was a mod who really loved bands like the Who. That melting pot would either not work at all, or be an absolute firecracker.” As the history of the Damned attests, it has, on occasion, been both.There have been three break-ups: in the late 70s, late 80s and early 90s; Sensible and Scabies have had repeated spells out of the band; Scabies only started working with them again in 2022, after 27 years away. “The rift was really between him and Captain,” says Vanian, though at one time or another, it seems as though each of the three principals has been in a relationship-ending rage with one or both of the others.In 1977, Scabies was so sick of the others he left the band while on tour in France, later to be replaced by the future Culture Club drummer Jon Moss. Then the founding guitarist and songwriter Brian James split the band in 1978, only for the other three to reunite. In the 80s, the others were unhappy at Captain Sensible’s chart-topping parallel solo career, which led to him in turn leaving the band and having a breakdown. Vanian himself considered his friendship with Scabies over after the drummer licensed the release of the Not of This Earth album in 1995 against Vanian’s wishes. But the trio are now reunited, releasing a new album and gearing up to mark their half-century with a gig at Wembley Arena.View image in fullscreenBack to black … Captain Sensible, Dave Vanian, Brian James and Lu Edmonds in 1977.Photograph: Erica Echenberg/RedfernsThe Damned’s history, in fact, is so convoluted it’s actually done them harm. Where everyone understands who and what their contemporaries the Sex Pistols and the Clash were, it’s much harder with the Damned. They released the UK’s first punk single, New Rose, before diverting to psychedelic pop, but to many listeners they’re one of the definitive goth bands. Their 13 studio albums are spread between nine labels, so there’s never been the career-spanning reissue programme a band of their status might expect. That hasn’t stopped anyone and everyone from trying to take their piece of the Damned: there are also 23 live albums of varying degrees of quality, and a preposterous 30 compilations. “It’s all out of our control,” Scabies says. “We signed those pieces of paper, and we never really thought about the consequences.”Then there’s the matter of the 33 people who have played with the Damned. But these days, regardless of the long service of the other band members, the idea of the Damned is once again fixed as Vanian, Sensible, Scabies. And, at last, they all seem to be getting on.I get so many people from other bands telling me, ‘If it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t have started my band’Dave Vanian“They’re genuinely funny blokes,” says Captain Sensible. “They’re very amusing to travel with. No one knows what Dave Vanian is really like, but he does very good impersonations from Carry On and On the Buses. And Rat has his ongoing hunt for the holy grail.” He really does, as documented in the bookRat Scabies and the Holy Grail: “Worth a read,” Sensible says. If you search, YouTube even has a trailer for a film about his hunt, called Rat Scabies: Grailhunter. “You should hear about the exploits he gets up to in the south of France with a shovel in the dead of night,” Sensible says. “Well, I won’t go into it.”As for the old enmities? A proposed sit-down with the three of them became individual video calls with Scabies and Sensible, before a weeks-long wait for a separate chat with Vanian. But relations are solid. “I didn’t want us standing around a grave saying, ‘We should have done that while we had the chance,’” Scabies says of their reunion. “Life’s too short. And it was quite a relief to be able to say, ‘You know what? It’s all water under the bridge. They say, ‘Forgive and forget,’ and we’ve benefited from that, for sure.”When the Damned began, punk didn’t even exist as a word. Brian Robertson, Chris Millar, Ray Burns and David Lett were part of the original tiny coterie of punks, coming together through the same array of half-formed bands as the other early punk groups did. Robertson became Brian James, to avoid confusion with Thin Lizzy’s guitarist, Lett became Dave Vanian (as in Transyl-), Millar became Rat Scabies, because he looked like a dead rat and had suffered scabies, and Burns became Captain Sensible, because he wasn’t.“Everyone in the band thought they were the best one in it,” Scabies says. “Any one of us could have fronted their own band.”View image in fullscreen‘Genuinely funny blokes’ … Dave Vanian, Captain Sensible, Rat Scabies and Brian James outside the Stiff Records office in 1977.Photograph: Ian Dickson/REX/Shutterstock“Each member was almost a frontman in themselves,” Vanian agrees. “Now there’s a lot more give-and-take and letting others shine.”Their forthcoming album – the first featuring the three of them since 1995 – is dedicated to James, who died in March 2025, and consists entirely of covers of the kind of songs the four of them all had in common when they first came together. “The one thing we all agree on musically is 60s garage bands,” Sensible says. “They were all doing their utmost to sound great, but with more passion and less skill they created this lovely sound.” And so Not Like Everybody Else serves as a whistle-stop tour of the Damned’s formative tastes: the Kinks, the Stones, the Creation, the Lollipop Shoppe, the Stooges, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd.The Damned, the three of them all admit, will always be known as “punk band the Damned”, despite their not being a punk band since 1978. Even on their first post-James album, Machine Gun Etiquette, they were stretching far beyond ramalama on Smash It Up Pt 1, I Just Can’t Be Happy Today and Plan 9 Channel 7. From 1980, The Black Album featured the 17-minute prog-psych epic Curtain Call, still a feature of their live sets (“I could probably take a minute and half out of that,” Sensible says, “but no more.” Vanian says they feared “it could be the kiss of death”). By the mid-80s, they were major label gothic psychedelic hitmakers with Grimly Fiendish, The Shadow of Night, Is It a Dream, and their cover of Barry Ryan’s Eloise.Vanian has regrets from those times, namely that they couldn’t translate those British hits into US success. He begins talking about his contemporaries – Billy Idol, John Lydon – who went to the US and remade their careers with the backing of their labels. And their relative financial circumstances have clearly occurred to him.“I get so many people from other bands telling me, ‘If it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t have started my band.’ And that’s very nice and flattering, but it hasn’t helped me, and I’d like to have a little bit of luxury before I pop off.”View image in fullscreenPatricia Morrison, Captain Sensible, Dave Vanian, Pinch and Monty Oxymoron at the Fillmore in San Francisco, 1999.Photograph: Anthony Pidgeon/RedfernsIn fairness, though, the Damned often didn’t help themselves: their instrument-smashing, pie-throwing mania wasn’t confined to the stage, and one reason they tore through so many labels is that they could be tiring signings. “There were several incidents when we were invited to go to see record companies and chat to the people there,” says Sensible. “And of course the first thing we’d do is head to the booze cabinet. Once we were left for about an hour in this bloke’s swanky office, because he’d said he had to go off to a meeting. By the time he got back, we’d demolished the place. Needless to say, we didn’t get signed.”Where Sensible and Scabies were always the outright maniacs of the band, Vanian, the Bela Lugosi of Hemel Hempstead, was more enigmatic. His image launched a million copyists: any singer who has ever worn black clothes and white face paint owes him a debt. He invented the goth image, without ever being a goth. Music fans might have a clear picture of him, but they perhaps have less of an idea of him, unlike Lydon and Joe Strummer, whose personalities were part of their image.“I don’t know if he knows himself,” Sensible says. “He would have made a very good actor.”“Dave’s the frontman, he’s been there the longest,” Scabies says. “If Dave doesn’t think something’s a good idea, there’s no point trying to do it.”“I was a reluctant frontman,” Vanian says. “Frontmen want to be the star of the show, but I didn’t even want to be in a band. I was chosen because of what I was before I was in a band. Brian had said to Rat, ‘Who’s that guy? He looks like a singer.’ I didn’t need an excuse to be like this; I would have been who I am, no matter what.”In the 2015 documentaryThe Damned: Don’t You Wish That We Were Dead, Vanian is a fleeting presence – in the background, and spoken about by the others, but never interviewed himself. That, he says, is because he saw the story the makers wanted, and didn’t want to be part of its telling. The story it ended up with was one of Vanian as at times both the Jagger and Richards of the band: he appeared to be the one keeping it running and very much the boss (at one point Sensible decides not to say something, for fear of upsetting Vanian), while also prone to following his own whims, down to not turning up to shows on occasion, leaving the others to carry on without him.“I’d love to do something with a proper film-maker – with actors – about the band’s inception,” Vanian says, reflecting on the film. “But I’m a private person – when the band started I thought about wearing a mask and being an unknown singer. But we got pictures taken too soon, and that was the end of that.”The Damned provided a chance for its members to live as the people they wanted to be, making the music they wanted to make. All three of them might wish they’d had the full backing of a major label but that would have brought pressures of its own, and their brief stint with MCA – the hits period – ended with them too exhausted to come up with new material. Doing it their way might have been chaotic, but it ensured they remained the Damned rather than another rock band reliving past glories.“We went on a musical adventure,” Sensible says. “For me, the purpose of punk was to be creative and do something for yourself. I was a toilet cleaner, then five minutes later I’m trashing a guitar on stage and girls find me attractive. So punk was my saviour.”We’re all knocking on. I don’t want to go out being miserable. I want to go out having a good time on a full bellyRat Scabies“There were no rules,” Scabies says. “It was a bunch of kids having a laugh. And a lot of our audience probably related to the fact that we were quite disjointed – all of the band came from kind of broken backgrounds in one way or another. I think a lot of dysfunctional youth related to the fact that we weren’t being packaged. We didn’t all wear the same clothes. We didn’t have a corporate logo or sign to a major.”In what might have been their dotage, the Damned are now bigger than ever. April brings that Wembley Arena gig; their recent albums have been the highest charting of their career. Things seem to be, for the first time ever, peachy.View image in fullscreenRat Scabies, Brian James, Dave Vanian and Captain Sensible c. 1978.Photograph: Chris Gabrin/Redferns“We’re all knocking on,” Scabies says. “I don’t want to go out being miserable. I want to go out having a good time on a full belly.”“We wouldn’t still be playing if we’d got stinking rich,” Sensible says. “I’m glad we did it this way because I bloody enjoy the shows and travel. None of us got lazy and lost our drive.”As long as he can still swoop across the stage like a vampire, and deliver those songs in that stern baritone, Vanian will continue, too. “You’ll know it’s time for me to quit when I start leaning on the mic to sing Sinatra songs, and reading letters from the fans.”Not Like Everybody Else is released 23 January on earMusic.

He wrote so positively about my music early in my career andthe last article he wrote was singling out my opera Festenfor special praise. He did seem to go off me a bit in mid career but he was such a serious and thoughtful critic that I often agreed with him. I got to know him very well in the late 90s as he was the partner of the librettist and translatorAmanda Holden. He had such a broad knowledge of music and a great enthusiasm for new music which he wrote and spoke about with such warmth and humour. We spent many evenings in Highbury talking about Stravinsky, politics and Arsenal football club – he cared about the most important things in life.Mark-Anthony Turnage, composerAndrew was perhaps the most remarkable critical voice of our age, and his writing embodied knowledge, curiosity and integrity. His tastes were open and adventurous, with a rare awareness of – and enthusiasm for – the newest musical developments from way beyond our shores. This isn’t the easiest time for contemporary music in the UK; Clements’ passing is a huge loss and he will be deeply missed.I’d like to add a more personal note – except that, beyond bumping into Andrew periodically at concerts over the last 45 years, I barely knew him. The strict professional distance he maintained throughout his career impressed me all the more. But I might add that he wrote the very first newspaper review my work received anywhere, something for which I’ll always remain grateful.George Benjamin, composerAndrew Clements was an outstandingly honest and perceptive critic. I much appreciated his support as well as his criticism. I read his words with interest and admiration for over 30 years. I will miss him.Steve Reich, composerView image in fullscreenVictoria Simmonds as Marie and Iestyn Davies as The Boy in George Benjamin’s 2012 Written on Skin, a work Andrew called ‘remarkable and spellbinding’.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianCeque l’on attend idéalement de la part d’une personne écrivant sur la musique et les musiciens est un jugement clair, une véritable indépendance et une force de caractère. Andrew Clements avait tout celà, plus une insatiable curiosité. Quel privilège d’avoir pu lire pendant plus d’un quart de siècle le point de vue d’un observateur si passionné et courageux!(What one expects ideally from anybody writing on music is clarity of judgment, true independence, and strength of character. Andrew Clements possessed all these qualities, along with an insatiable curiosity. What a privilege it has been to have been able to read for over a quarter of a century the insights of such an enthusiastic and courageous observer!)Pierre-Laurent Aimard, pianistFor many of us, since our first forays into classical music, Andrew’s words have always been there: illuminating our path, inclining our ear. I will dearly miss his reassuring presence, his deft articulation, and trusted insight. So much of his writing remains online to inform and inspire us – and to entice us, when writing about music ourselves, to find such precision, grace and eloquence of our own.James Murphy,chiefexecutive, Royal Philharmonic SocietyAndrew Clements was a regular and much-loved member of the audience here at Wigmore Hall. Sometimes when I encountered him before a concert, I was left disconcerted because he gave a very firm impression that he didn’t want to be here, but often, by the end of the evening, he was ecstatic, and this was reflected in his reviews. He was an outstanding critical voice, with the deepest possible knowledge and love of music. He was hugely respected, and he will be greatly missed.John Gilhooly,director, Wigmore HallIwas very fond of Andrew. I particularly enjoyed his deeply irreverent wit and insights, not just into music new or otherwise, but the people involved in the music world. His knowledge of music was vast. I can remember his partner,Amanda Holden, telling me how he could remember everything that he’d ever heard. Total recall. It was impossible to second guess what he was going to like or otherwise. His thoughts around pieces seemed to come from some deeply personal, off-kilter place as regards what meant anything to him at all. His writing was often thought-provoking and I certainly didn’t necessarily agree with his opinions, however it was always food for thought and would make me rethink my possibly entrenched thinking about certain composers.Simon Holt, composerWhen Ted Greenfield retired, I asked Alfred Brendel what sort of critic we should seek to hire. “Someone who understands modern music,” said Brendel in a flash. Though he himself tended not to stray too much from the late 18th and early 19th-century masterpieces, he thought the job of a critic was to understand, explain and judge the music of our times. Did he have any suggestions, I asked. “Try Andrew Clements,” he replied.I tried; he joined. He was everything Brendel could have wanted. Many years later, I told Andrew the story of how he came to be recruited. He was both shocked ... and a bit thoughtful. He had, he confessed, sometimes been a bit harsh on Brendel. He had not known that the subject of his criticism had been one of his great admirers. But I suspect, even if he had known, it wouldn’t have changed a thing.Alan Rusbridger, Guardianeditor-in-chief,1995–2015View image in fullscreenThe LSO conducted by François-Xavier Roth with Patricia Kopatchinskaja give the UK premiere of Francisco Coll’s Violin Concerto. “A showcase for Coll’s own freewheeling orchestral virtuosity, his tangled, teeming invention, ear for vivid sonorities, and sly references to earlier music,”wrote Andrew.Photograph: Mark AllanIt is with deep sadness that I receive the news of Andrew Clements’ passing. I am grateful for his immense contribution to music and for the consistently generous and attentive words he devoted to my work from the very beginning. His judgment and integrity leave an absence that is hard to put into words.Francisco Coll, composerAndrew was a great critic and a wonderful colleague, always ready with a cutting comment or a barbed witticism in the corners of otherwise not-so-memorable concerts. It’s easy to forget, but alongside his encyclopedic knowledge and enthusiasm, as a writer he was a superb stylist. Across thousands of reviews, Andrew never wrote an ugly sentence: his thoughts were lucid and sharp-edged, and he had a gift for writing in a direct, well-shaped way especially about the most complex of contemporary music.Having worked alongside him very happily as a writer on other papers, I had then to be ready for Andrew in a different mode when I went to Radio 3 and the Proms. His comments and judgments were always sharp, never (hardly ever) unfair. While he sympathised with what we were trying to do in broadening the Proms repertory, he always argued we weren’t doing enough for contemporary music. Eventually I was stung into writing to remind him that even William Glock did not do as much new music at the Proms as we did; he took it all in good part. He kept us on our toes, and he will be sorely missed.Nicholas Kenyon, writer and broadcasterHe will be sadly missed. Andrew’s knowledge of classical music across different disciplines combined with clear and refined writing narrative made him a major force in critical opinion over many years. He stuck to a critical response to what was in front of him and rarely strained into political and personal attacks, yet he was a respected, and at times feared, critic who didn’t pull his punches. His deep knowledge of contemporary music and his nose for a well thought out and ambitious production on the operatic stage gave him real stature in a critical world of diminishing returns where performing arts journalism has become subdued.John Berry, director, producer, artistic director ENO,2005-2015Iam deeply saddened to learn of Andrew Clements’ passing. I was fortunate that he took an interest in my music theatre works over the years, often traveling to cover premieres across Europe. I found his reviews were always analytical, intelligent, and fair – written with the kind of deep musical knowledge that made his opinion genuinely matter to me.Michel van der Aa, composerAndrew reviewed every year of my decade at Cheltenham music festival, and I always appreciated that, because getting critics to review out of London has become harder over time (the column inches available, the finances of trips out of town). I came to realise that there was a particular reason he was keeping the faith with Cheltenham – he mentioned that he was brought up nearby [in Gloucester] and had fond memories of attending in his youth, and hearing lots of new music. He knew that I was facing ever-stronger headwinds there by the time I was programming Cheltenham, and he always expressed his appreciation that I was doing my damnedest to keep the new music flag flying. That support, from someone I admired so much, was motivating and much appreciated.Needless to say, any longstanding fondness for the festival didn’t ever soften up his reviews there. If he didn’t like something, there was the same commendable objectivity and clarity.Meurig Bowen,chiefexecutive &artisticdirector, Britten Sinfonia, andartisticdirector of the Cheltenhammusicfestival,2007-17Artist egos are not merely fragile; they are ravenous. They feed on affirmation, recoil from scrutiny, and cry at the first sensation of disapproval. Most critics know this and exploit it. Andrew Clements did something far more dangerous: he paid attention.Yes, Andrew wrote generous reviews. But generosity was never his defining trait. Courage was. He attended the unruly, the excessive, the wilfully difficult programmes – the ones that frightened his peers into polite absence. Where others retreated into safe abstraction, Andrew advanced. He stayed. He endured complexity.And then he did the unfashionable work of comprehension. He refused the shortcut of reduction. Instead, he learned the internal grammar of the work, deciphered its syntax, traced its private logic. Reading his criticism felt less like evaluation than intrusion – an elegant trespass into the architecture of my thinking.In an era intoxicated by immediacy, where language is flattened, accelerated, and emptied of consequence, Andrew resisted. He chose exactitude over noise. His sentences were calibrated, his metaphors unsparing. He deployed words that sent me back to dictionaries, to etymologies, to the slow labour of meaning.Through this rigour, he created something rare: a zone of intellectual hospitality. A place where artists were neither indulged nor dismissed, but taken seriously enough to be challenged. He made criticism porous, reciprocal, alive.I will miss the severity of his attention. I will miss the precision of his seeing. I will miss the way his writing revealed what I had not yet articulated, and occasionally what I had not dared to know.Andrew Clements reminded us that criticism, when practised with discipline and courage, is not parasitic. It is generative. It does not consume art – it sharpens it. For those of us with fragile, ravenous egos, this was not comfort. It was nourishment.Tamara Stefanovich, pianistView image in fullscreenBrett Dean’s Hamlet, with Allan Clayton in the title role at Glyndebourne in 2017. (Andrew didn’t write about the opera himself because of Dean’s working relationship with Amanda Holden, Andrew’s partner).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAndrew Clements occupied an all-too-rare place in classical music criticism. His deep and genuine engagement with the new made his reviews so much more vital than mere descriptions of what had been performed, as if it were a passage of play at the cricket. They placed even brand-new works into a larger, informed context. He took the role so seriously that his comments were always constructively insightful, for composers young and old, even his more harsh assessments. He will be sorely missed.Brett Dean, composerIread Andrew Clements keenly from the early 1980s onwards. His trenchant reviews were alarmingly well informed, always perspicacious and never provincial. He was the first UK critic to spot the genius of Gérard Grisey, the French spectral composer whose music has been so influential in the past 35 years. As early as August 1984 and again in September 1985, he acclaimed Grisey as a major new force in music at a time when almost nobody else here showed any interest.In general, Andrew supported the more adventurous: Xenakis, Lachenmann, Saariaho, Carter and Ferneyhough were all championed, though not without a critical edge: Andrew was never easily pleased. Minimalists such as Glass, Pärt and Adams fared less well generally, though he had some interest in the Adams operas.In 1993 he suddenly telephoned me having read some of my articles, to invite me on to the reviewing staff of the Guardian where he wanted, as he put it, “to train up someone new.” Unknown to him I was just starting out as a composer: trying to be both composer and critic would, I felt, put me in an impossibly conflicted position. He understood but warned “composing’s a lottery: you’ll find it easier to have a steady job as a critic.” Alas, many music critics were to have just as tough a time over the next 30 years as many composers.Julian Anderson, composerAndrew’s unique values and judgment, and insistence on standards of quality and independence from the industries of power and clique in the classical – those principles are what it’s all about, along with his soupçon of cantankerousness and a delight in joyfully scurrilous gossip – who else could be grumpy at a premiere or a new production with a twinkle in their eye?There are those countless composers and new pieces whose work and importance he advocated and debated, to which he gave the seriousness of genuine criticism, and inspired all of us reading to explore, to resonate with what he said, or to argue passionately with it. The musical world isn’t the same: what a loss.Tom Service, broadcaster and writerAndrew Clements had a long-range perspective of music and held it up to the highest of standards. He cared deeply and his reviews were always fascinating. Even if he once described my sax concerto Iris as a mess, he wrote some wonderful things about my own music. I greatly appreciated his writing and will miss seeing him around, like a beacon of belief – within the rush of modern life – in the wonder that is contemporary classical music.Tansy Davies, composerMaybe flautists are quick to smile! For a number of years, I’d seen Andrew in his critic’s seat at Birmingham Contemporary Music Group concerts. I’d always admired his writing and regarded his presence as a strong endorsement. He had reviewed my music and I was therefore wary of approaching him. When I eventually decided to break the ice, it was with a joke. We both laughed. He was serious and readily amused. We shall miss him for his wisdom and sensibility.Howard Skempton, composerView image in fullscreenHarrison Birtwistle’s The Mask of Orpheus at the London Coliseum, a staging that earned astinker of a review from Andrew: ‘The production is the work of ENO’s departing artistic director Daniel Kramer, and let’s hope it is the last of his shows to be seen there. For this is a wilful parade of self-indulgence.’Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLike all natural-born writers, Andrew had a difficult relationship with deadlines, but his writing was so good that it was always worth the wait. In his early days, contributing to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, he even invented the genre of “leaky pillar box copy”, blaming the postal service for the non arrival of an article. Both he and I knew that when he telephoned for a chat it was often deadline-avoidance behaviour. In the foyers at performance intervals, he rightly kept his views to himself, but in our regular phone chats (usually a few times a week) Andrew would gossip freely or come up with shrewd musical insights. Not just musical insights: Andrew was something of a renaissance man, with wide interests, making him a valued colleague and friend.John Allison, editor ofOperawith Opera NewsAndrew was a devoted champion of composers and those dedicated to commissioning, performing and recording their music; invigorating readers through his illuminating, razor-sharp writing to seek out the richness of music: the new, the unexpected, the known, the discoveries. He was, above all, a treasured spirit, one of the rare ones who understood how vital music is for the human soul.Jackie Newbould,creativeproducer, formerlyexecutiveproducer, BCMGAndrew covered so many of BCMG’s concerts. To see him there meant to me, as artistic director, that I must be doing my job well. His presence was an encouragement, an endorsement. I would avidly await his reviews, he had such insightful things to say. On the rare occasions he mentioned the concert programme as a whole, as being deftly constructed for example, I would puff up with pride. Latterly, he and I would talk birds, a shared passion. On this, as with music, he was vastly more knowledgable than me. Andrew’s was a hugely important critical voice, and he was a sustaining pillar of the contemporary music culture. With his passing, as with that of his favourite composers such as Olly Knussen and Harry Birtwistle, it feels as if a particular realm of that culture has ebbed away.Stephen Newbould, formerartisticdirector, BCMGAndrew was a quiet, sometimes withdrawn, always thoughtful colleague: it was always a pleasure to coincide with him at a concert. I was (and still am!) a regular visitor to Iceland and, knowing his passion for bird-watching, I recommended he go to the Lake Mývatn area in the north, to seek out the rare Barrow’s goldeneye duck. He did! And loved the birdlife there!Hilary Finch, retired music critic,the Times****View image in fullscreenMartha Argerich performing in Lucerne in January 2025. The Argentinian-born musician was one of Andrew’s most admired pianists.Photograph: Philipp Schmidli/PHILIPP SCHMIDLI | FotografieAndrew Clements was important to the London Sinfonietta and to what we stand for through his profound belief that new music matters and deserves serious public engagement and debate. We awaited his reviews with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension – encouraged by his praise, frustrated by his criticisms – and did not always agree with his conclusions, which could be blunt. Yet his criticism was clearly grounded in a passion and enthusiasm for surprising breadth of musical styles. His death gives pause not only for his life and those close to him, but for the passing of a particular time and voice.Andrew Burke, CEO andartisticdirector, London SinfoniettaAfter I was in Venice the other year, I spottedAndrew Clements’ review in the Guardian. So I dropped him a line, one anorak to another (anorak: a person who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects). “I was really pleased to be there”, he said, “and very glad I made the effort.” Of course he made the effort; it was a work that fascinated him, something, like so much else, he cared about deeply.John Woolrich, composerAndrew really cared about festivals. As a relatively young festival organiser in the late 80s, I was slightly frightened and certainly in awe of music critics who, at the time, were the only people to have the power to praise or criticise so publicly. Their positive words were key to success.I first plucked up courage to talk to Andrew when I had to hand him a copy of a score, about to be performed at Spitalfields festival. I soon realised he was completely human, and as I read more of his reviews, I appreciated his immense knowledge of an extremely broad repertoire. Most Fridays I have tried to read his CD reviews in the Guardian – he knew exactly how to cherrypick just one from a huge pile of releases.Our paths crossed on frequent occasions over the decades, he always had time to smile or speak very briefly. However, on one occasion, when I sought his advice on a festival matter, he ensured we could have a long conversation, away from the concert hall. As I anticipated, his advice was invaluable.Judith Serota,executivedirector Spitalfields festival,1988-2007View image in fullscreenChristian Gerhaher (centre) at the Wigmore Hall.  For Andrew, Gerhaher was a singer who could do no wrong andwhose recitals he rarely missed.Photograph: Richard CannonBefore birding apps were a thing, a call to Andrew would bring an instant and comprehensive answer to any query. Yes, definitely a sparrowhawk standing sentinel, and likely a female, whose Exocet missile flight away from its perch was then exactly as he predicted. The wonder of swifts was discussed every May through to August, seeing them and – more so in recent times – not seeing them, the continuing decline in numbers a great sadness to him.Most often, phone conversations would focus on pianists, dislikes or likes, among the latter Martha Argerich, Bruce Liu and particularly Radu Lupu, for whom I’d once turned pages in a recital early in his career and, in sitting right there next to him, had learned so much. Reading Andrew’spenultimate CD reviewof previously unheard Lupu recordings, I sensed a valedictory tone which, of course, couldn’t be touched on. Instead, much quizzing of Lupu’s preference for a chair rather than a piano stool and Andrew’s laughing admission that, yes, dammit, Lupu did actually lean back rather than being hunched over the keyboard, as he’d written. His concern had been to capture the intensity of his approach. Lupu playing Schubert’s last sonata D960 will, for me, be a lasting reminder of the affinity Andrew instinctively felt for a musician of such profound commitment.Rian Evans, music critic, the GuardianI’m so very sad to hear of Andrew’s death. Post CD release or premiere, there was nothing quite like the suspense of wondering if the Great Andrew Clements would pen a few words about your latest offering. I’d expected my first CD to be little more than a deluxe drinks coaster, and was flabbergasted when Andrew wrote some lovely things about it. If words wore out, those sentences would be utterly threadbare, the use I’ve got out of them: proudly displayed at the top of every funding application I’ve ever done, his seal of approval has advanced my career, tangibly. Many of us composers liked to opine that, while a good review from Andrew was a badge of honour, a bad write-up was something to be even more proud of: I myself became particularly convinced of this after he labelled a big new piece of mine “almost hackneyed”! Rest in peace, Andrew: your opinions (particularly the flattering ones!) will be greatly missed.Cheryl Frances-Hoad, composerExplore more on these topicsClassical musicOperafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This paved the way for a female visionary, Artemisia Gentileschi, to depict women as heroes and avengers: but as this work by one of her male contemporaries in early 1600s Rome reveals, that focus on the female was not unique to her. Perhaps it was a way for the church to involve and control women, for Cortona portrays Saint Cecilia as a bland-faced icon of chastity: the story of this early Christian figure had it that she refused to let her husband touch her. She also stands by a pipe organ, for Cecilia became patron saint of music in the middle ages. Harmonious and virtuous, Cortona’s Cecilia urges women to emulate her, and do as they are told by the church.National GallerySign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get in TouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Because that’s how time and dates look in my brain. If you say a date to me, that day appears in a grid diagram in my head, and it shows if that box is already imprinted with a holiday, event or someone’s birthday. Public holidays and special events like Christmas and Easter are already imprinted for the year, and the diagram goes backwards to about 100,000BC and then forwards all the way to about the year 2500 before tapering off.It was only in my 60s that I discovered there was a name for this phenomenon – not just the way time appears in this 3D sort of calendar pattern, but the colours seen when I think of certain words. Two decades previously, I’d mentioned to a friend that Tuesdays were yellow and she’d looked at me in the same strange, befuddled way that family members always had when told about the calendar in my head. Out of embarrassment, it was never discussed further. I was clearly very odd.I see sounds as shapes. Synaesthesia has given me an extraordinary ability for languagesRead moreThe funny thing is I’d been working as a GP for more than 30 years before discovering there was a word for the way my brain worked. One day, while doing some research into managing anxiety for my paediatric patients, I stumbled across some research from Macquarie University in Sydney aboutgrapheme-colour synaesthesia. Other people were similarly affected, apparently. Then I learned about another common form of the phenomenon, called spatial-sequence synaesthesia, which fitted with my experiences of not only seeing time in a 3D pattern but numbers and letters too. Perhaps I was not so odd after all.I joined both research projects and learned so much about my own form of synaesthesia and other people’s. It is estimated that 10% to 20% per cent of the population have some form of spatial-sequence synaesthesia but we don’t all see time in the same way. Some people see minutes, hours, days and weeks going around in a circle or square pattern, whereas for me they go from left to right and veer up and down.While thinking about the moment in time I’m at now, I see the day of the week and the hours of that day drawn up in a grid pattern. I am physically in that diagram in my head – and there’s a photographic element to it. If there’s a concert coming up in the calendar, in my mind, a picture of the concert venue is superimposed on to the 7pm to 10pm time slot on that particular day.View image in fullscreen‘Sometimes I’d like to be more laissez-faire and less structured in my head but I do find it fascinating.’Photograph: Liz Ham/The GuardianThe alphabet and numbers also follow particular patterns in my mind’s eye.The main benefit day-to-day is memory. The patterns have helped with maths and handling money: I don’t need a calculator for basic arithmetic and, if I’m comparing prices, the amounts sit relative to other prices on a number map in my head. It’s helpful for remembering dates, too. I remember the birthdays of friends I haven’t seen for 65 years and I can picture my kindergarten classroom in vivid detail: its location in the building, the mats we sat on and the plastic templates of the Australian states that we drew around.When it comes to planning, synaesthesia is no longer as useful an asset as it once was, given that most of us have diaries and reminders on our phones. But it can be handy for history or geography rounds on trivia nights when phones aren’t allowed.Sometimes I’d like to be more laissez-faire and less structured in my head but I do find it fascinating. Neural patterns will become better understood as science becomes more sophisticated but, in the meantime, the wonder of it all is quite appealing. Neuro-researchers can have my brain one day, and I would love to get into someone else’s head and see what they see.We are all alike and yet our brains are surprisingly different.

There was the one where – exactly like that scene in The Inbetweeners – we realised they’d serve us a pint at 16 if we ordered some food (one shared plate of chips). There was the one you might get lucky in on Christmas Eve; the one you’d take a girl to, to impress her with the romantic views; and the one that only served cider in halves because it was so brain cell-poppingly strong – a pub best tackled before a bank holiday Monday, known colloquially as “Super Cider Sunday”, when you still had a few brain cells to spare.When I arrived at university, the pub that became my second home was the Hand & Heart. Like Nottingham’s other famous pub, Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem (which claims to be the oldest pub in England), it’s carved into the city’s sandstone caves, a setting that means you get to feel like Batman sipping a brandy after a hard day’s crime fighting. It was also our true local, just a quick stagger from the student house six of us shared – which became both an incentive and a deterrent. While our peers would start drinking at 7pm or 8pm, we had a reputation for rolling up for last orders, meaning we could leave the house at 10.20pm, be pint in hand by 10.30pm and – if we necked them fast – get two or maybe three in before the big lights flickered on.View image in fullscreenPelley’s friend Tony, pictured working at the Hand & Heart, circa 1997.Photograph: Courtesy of Rich PelleyBut what we gotreallygood at were the pub quiz machines. Rather than making polite chit-chat with our fellow student drinkers, the six of us would stand around the Monopoly machine like a trivia mafia syndicate. With our combined student knowledge covering nearly every base (Phil – politics; Tony – history; Becca – French and Spanish; Saz – French and management; me – chemistry; the other Rich – economics) and the fact that the questions kept repeating themselves, we could turn 50p stakes into profit. As a side hustle, Phil and I got whizzy at the Noel Edmonds Telly Addicts quiz machine. This relied on our other specialist subject, TV, and was, gloriously, a prize game you could win with practice. Just one or two games, each with a 50p stake, and we’d win the £5 jackpot. Thanks, Noel.I’d love to claim the Hand & Heart taught me something profound: the power of collective intelligence; that two (or six) heads are better than one; that a worry shared (even over a multiple-choice trivia game) is a worry halved. But honestly, it was mostly about bankrolling free rounds, then the post-pub kebab ritual from Sheesh Mahal, where every customer was greeted with the same question – open or wrapped? In other words, would you like your kebab wrapped to eat with the dignity of a knife, fork and plate when you got home? (Tony.) Or open to eat on the walk home, with kebab sauce dribbling down your chin, the remnants and wrappings neatly disposed of over a handy garden wall?

There’s not too much going on: just a good, buttery crumb, melt-in-the-mouth texture and chocolate-dipped ends, which are a must. While they’re pretty straightforward to make, issues often arise when it’s time to pipe the dough, and it can be tricky to strike a balance between a consistency that has enough butter but still holds its shape once baked. I find that the addition of a little milk helps make it more pipeable, as does using a large, open-star nozzle to avoid cramped hands and burst piping bags.Viennese fingersPrep5 minChill15 minCook40 minMakes10130g very softsalted butter50g icing sugar½ tsp vanilla extract170g plain flour2 tsp custard powder1 tsp milk70g milk chocolateHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper.

Mix in the milk, then spoon the dough into a piping bag fitted with a large open-star nozzle (I use Wilton 8B).Pipe 10 finger-shaped biscuits on to the lined tray, then chill for 15 minutes. Take out of the fridge, then bake for 18-22 minutes, until the biscuits are lightly browned. Leave them to cool completely on the tray.Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in short bursts in a microwave or heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water. Dip each end of the biscuits into the chocolate, then place on a rack to firm up before serving.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBiscuitsChocolateBakingSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

In fact, if you spend much time on TikTok, or live in Brooklyn, you’ve probably already been seeing them for months, if not years. I saw my first pair a few weeks ago. I watched a dad dropping his kids off at school in head-to-toe Carhartt, a pair of Gardanas peeping out from below his trousers like a shy frog.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Pliable, but with a sturdy sole, they go for as little as £25. The work of French “environmental poet” André Ravachol, who founded the Plasticana brand behind the clogs in 1998, they’re made from 100% recycled PVC and hemp, which gives them their earthy-caramel or, as Vogue put it, “bird-pooey” hue. They have since been called “maybe the coolest shoes in London” by one TikToker,as he Lime-biked his way through the capital to try to nab a pair.Gardanas already had fashion credentials thanks to US brand Bode, shorthand for beautifully craft-centric and exorbitantly expensive clothes, which sent them down the catwalk in 2020. No doubt buoyed up by that, they became known as the“I live in Brooklyn’ shoes”, but now the streets of certain quarters of the UK are being infiltrated with their swampy ways.Josh Chalmers, a gardener at the West Sussex rewilding project Knepp, loves them. They are, he says, ideal for the walled garden where he works. “Wearing a delicate shoe is pivotal,” he says, “The plants grow really small and slowly, and so lots of plants can fit in a smaller space.”He also wears them to hang out in Brighton, where he lives. ”They’re a great in between … I can wear them to do the job that I do and then I can literally hop into the shop and look like a normal person.” He’s been known to style them with a bright yellow sock and points out that they pair perfectly with trendy selvedge denim: “The colour together is just chef’s kiss.”View image in fullscreenAt leisure ... Josh Chalmers in his beloved Gardanas.Photograph: Josh ChalmersTikTokers style themwith everything from hickory stripes to suit trousers, with their bedrooms and city streets visible in the background, not allotments or raised beds. They sit low on the foot, allowing for such natty sock styling as Chalmers’.People aren’t buying them at their local garden centre. Fancy haberdasher and “purveyor of classic British elegance”Drake’s sells them, as does online concept store and clothing brand Plümo, and hippy-inflected, Urban Outfitters Inc-owned Free People. So doesStraw, a fancy lifestyle shopin east London, which, as the only UK bricks-and-mortar shop that currently stocks the shoes, invites shoe pilgrimages.Hugo MacGregor-Craig, co-founder of Straw, says that while they have been in demand since they first started stocking them three years ago, TikTok has introduced them to a new, younger audience. Most of his customers are buying them to wear in town, but it’s their gardening credentials that he credits with making them great for urban wear, “especially in UK weather”.While Chalmers wouldn’t call himself a trailblazer, he definitely hopped on them early, buying his first pair about four years ago. He was working at the Bloomsbury set’s Charleston house in Sussex at the time, “and everyone there was just so obsessed with them”.View image in fullscreenForking beautiful … JW Anderson jumps on the gardening trend.Photograph: JW AndersonIt was around this time that fashion sprouted green fingers, and menswear designer Kim Jones dida collectioninspired by Charleston. There was a moment, which Chalmers thinks is “still very much in the zeitgeist”, of gardening and vegetables and “basically growing a world that we wish we lived in”. It was also around this time that designerJW Anderson debuted a pair of amphibious Wellipet clogs in Milan. Since then, fashion’s flowers have continued to grow: chore jackets à la Monty Don have been on numerous designer moodboards, gardens have been dug for inspiration by brands from Burberry to Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Dior, back to Anderson, who recently put his name behind a set of antique gardening tools. This week, he even started to sell his own take on gardening shoes; all things horticulture have been cultivated by high-fashion’s rich soils.But while the Gardanas are the zenith of the clog genre, there are a Sissinghurst’s worth of other iterations. Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex has been spotted feeding her chickens inCrocs’ Dylan clog.Jennifer Lawrence zhuzhed hersup with no socks and an anklet. Bella Hadid’s got a soft spot for a pair that is a collaboration between high-fashion brand Proenza Schouler and rugged Canadian footwear brand Sorel. Of course, Birkenstock do them and Danish brand Dansko offer pioneer-coded distressed honey ones.Town & Country has a pair for a tenner that it affectionately calls Cloggies. Toast sells a suede pair, the work of ruddy-cheeked outdoorsy brandBlundstone, they presumably wouldn’t be much good in a dank compost heap, but they look lovely.Gardening clogs offer up an off-the-grid wholesomeness, and, of course, gardening, which Dr Bridget Dalton, a semiotician and cultural analyst at Truth Consulting, says, “is about ease, it’s about pottering, it’s about [being] in your space; you cultivate it, but it’s a mindful, restful, connecting, grounding activity”. She mentions them in the same breath as the chore jacket that has become ubiquitous on creative directors in recent years. “Are these chore jackets for your feet?” she asks. They’re #slowlife and cottagecore adjacent; anyone living the cottage life is going to find a pair by their back door to slip on and tend their hollyhocks and delphiniums useful, and many people not living in a cottage will want to borrow – whether to subvert or leverage – some of that atmosphere they bring.According to award-winning gardenerCharlie McCormick, traditional clogs are simply “very practical and convenient to slip on and off … they are brilliant in the winter – you are high off the ground – and likewise in summer”. Plus, he says, they are “good to go and dig veg”.But, while truly a shoe for our contradictory, whiplash-inducing age, they’re also a cult item – part of the churn – that people will cross cities to try to buy because they’ve seen them online.Clogs in general are the kind of item worn by people who need foot support and comfort for long hours such as chefs, and nurses (Dansko is a favoured brand) and, yes, also while gardening. This does raise the omnipresent conversation of appropriation and the borrowing of the optics of hard work for leisure pursuits slash Fashion with a capital F, it seems they’re being worn outside for outside pursuits, so it’s perhaps OK to offer some leeway on that front. (Interestingly the professional gardeners of the Royal Horticultural Society have to wear protective footwear when working, even if some may wear Gardanas or the like in their own gardens.)They sit neatly in the genre of “ugly shoes”, which has made it as aspirational, if not more so, to look down at shoes that mimic lumpy root vegetables, as to look down at slinky kitten heels. They’re gross and beautiful and confusing and, honestly, the more you look at them the more you may grow to like them – which is sort of how the “ugly” shoe thing works. Did you initially feel disgust and now feel a tiny pinprick of desire? Well, if it’s the Gardanas in particular you’re after, you’ll probably have to wait.

The dog clothing market is soaring and this winter it is coats that are topping the most in-demand list.Bestsellers atPawelier, a London-based luxury pet accessories shop include a£135 four-leg puffer coatcomplete with a fuzzy hood and toggle detailing, and a£110 reversible down-filled jumpsuitin cornflower blue and cappuccino brown that wouldn’t look out of place on a designer catwalk. The Italian greyhounds and whippets pictured bundled up in them appear to be prepped for an Alpine adventure rather than a lap around the park.At John Lewis, searches for dog coats are up 33% year on year. Its bestseller is a £22 own-brandtangerine-coloured puffer jacketwith a utility style belt.View image in fullscreenThree-in-one dog coat from Danish Designs.Photograph: Adam Marsden/Danish DesignsRob Newsome, director of sales at Danish Design, a Leeds-based pet product manufacturer, says Britain’s increasingly cold and wet weather is driving sales. The company started out creating pet bedding in 1981, but over the past 40 years has experienced a huge increase in demand. Its current bestseller,the 3-in-1 coat, looks similar to aDryrobeand features a waterproof and windproof outer layer and a detachable inner fleece.Oli Port, the editor-in-chief and founder ofDogue magazine, says due to social media dogs are now “the ultimate fashion icons”. Brands including Burberry and Louis Vuitton have included dogs in recent advertising campaigns; while some dogs have become lucrative standalone influencers, such asSamantha, an Afghan hound based in Edinburgh who has worked with brands including Jimmy Choo and Tommy Hilfiger.Brands including Barbour, Carhartt and Ralph Lauren sell matching dog/owner coats. Port says puffer jackets have become a top choice this winter (its latest issue stars Theodore Thurston, a mini Australian labradoodle in a padded Moncler vest), while she has also noticed an increase in trench-style coats that are “perfect for city dogs who want that chic, polished look”.View image in fullscreenAurorapuff downshield suit from Pawelier.Photograph: PawelierBut do dogs, particularly in Britain where the temperature rarely drops below freezing, really need a winter coat? Julian Hoad, a veterinary surgeon and president of the British Small Animal Veterinary Association says it depends on the breed.He says: “Dogs that have very thin coats and thin skin, for example lurchers, greyhounds, chihuahuas and Yorkshire terriers, can get quite cold particularly if it is wet, so a coat isn’t a bad idea in those circumstances. Other dogs such as malamutes and German shepherds have quite thick coats of their own, so really don’t need any.”He also cautions against coats for brachycephalic dogs such as French bulldogs and Boston terriers that have a short skull shape. “The problem is if they get overheated they can really struggle to pant effectively.” Other warning signs of a dog being too hot include a hunched posture and disinterest in walking.While some coats such as the Korean brandMerlot’s raincoatoffer adjustable hoods, Hoad says most dogs will “resent having anything around their heads” and focusing on the dog’s trunk is usually sufficient. When it comes to heat loss, Hoad says it depends on the dog’s total surface area. “A small dog will have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio. And if it has a thin fur coat, it’ll lose heat more quickly than a great big German shepherd with very thick fur because it has a relatively smaller surface area.”A dog’s proximity to the ground also plays a part. Hoad points to dogs with short legs such as miniature dachshunds whose bellies can rub against cold, wet grass.The UK is home to 13 million dogs, nearly double the number in 2011. Millennials and the gen Z demographic boughttwo-thirds of all dogs in Britain in 2022. Louise Nindi, co-founder of the dog lifestyle storeMutts, says a modern generation of dog owners are driving it. She says: “As young people are having fewer children, dogs are getting closer to being family members who understand you. Dogs aren’t just going to the park any more, they’re coming to work, restaurants – even on holiday – so they do naturally become an extension of yourself, your values, your style.”For those cynical of the trend, Ports also points to the normalisation of dogs everywhere from hotel stays to in-cabin airline travel. “Most of the time dogs are naked, but as they are participating more in our lives they need clothes. You wouldn’t allow your child to go outside in cold weather without wearing a coat. It’s the same thing for us. Dogs are our babies.”Explore more on these topicsDogsAnimalsPetsnewsShareReuse this content"

As senior aviculturist at the headquarters in Baraboo, Wisconsin, I’m involved in everything from daily feeding to overseeing chick-rearing.Whenever possible, chicks are raised by their biological parents or adopted by other adult cranes, but when that isn’t possible, we have to raise them, and teach them how to behave like cranes. Some chicks will later be released into the wild, so it’s important that they learn to stay away from people and other predators.Young birds identify the first large moving object they see as their parent – a process called “imprinting” – so it’s important they don’t see us as humans while we’re raising them. At one time, feeding was done from behind a barrier to reduce interaction, but this wasn’t really practical.One day, a colleague threw a sheet over himself. A lot of the staff thought he was crazy, but he started developing a more elaborate costume, adding feathers and even wearing pants that matched the colour of cranes’ legs.Amazingly, the chicks responded well, and followed him as they would an adult crane. The outfits we use now have detailed puppet crane heads on one arm. The other arm is our “wing”.We did away with the feathers to make laundering the costumes easier. Now, any time we spend among the chicks is done in costume.Whenever I see a video of us running and flapping, it does look kind of ridiculous, but the chicks still get the ideaThe chicks can be quite aggressive towards one another, depending on personalities and sexes, and who’s “hangry”.We spend a lot of time making sure everybody’s eating, drinking and getting along OK, and teaching foraging behaviour by searching for crickets and grasshoppers with them. Occasionally I’ll struggle to get an insect into the puppet’s bill and use my hand instead when the chicks aren’t looking.It can be tiring work – my arms get sore. Usually we rotate who’s in the costumes every hour or two. Wearing them provides anonymity, so it’s easy to ham it up.When I started herein 1986, I learned a small amount of crane vocabulary and could mimic the scolding sound made by adult cranes if chicks were fighting or putting themselves at risk. Now we hide an MP3 player under the costume and play recordings of real adult cranes. The coloration of the puppet heads also matches that of real birds – for example, whooping cranes have a patch of red skin, which they tilt towards other birds to warn if they’re too close. I’ll sometimes do that to get a chick to back off.Experience: I walked the length of the UK with a donkeyRead moreWhen new people first wear the costumes, it can be hard to suppress the impulse to react to things as a human, rather than a crane. If a plane flies over, they’ll look at it with their real eyes, rather than just reacting with the puppet head. It usually takes about a month to acclimatise.Before they leave us, it’s important that the cranes are good flyers and able to get away from predators. Coaching them can be a challenge but we have a prairie where we encourage them by running and flapping, right up to the point where a real crane would leave the ground. We mimic adults’ “pre-flight” call and stretch out the puppet head. Whenever I see a video of us running and flapping, it does look kind of ridiculous, but the chicks get the idea. It makes me feel like a proud parent to see them take flight.I do dream about work – sometimes, in my dreams, I would finally be able to fly. In others, my volunteers would take to the sky while I couldn’t, or I’d be the chick at the back of the flock, unable to keep up with the rest, and I would feel very sad.Currently,10 of the 15 crane species are still threatened with extinction, though the number of whooping cranes in the world has grown over the past 80 years from the low 20s to over 800. Ultimately, our aim is to help create a self-sustaining population where all the youngsters will be reared by real cranes, so we can get rid of the costumes. Although I would miss my interaction with the chicks, what an amazing outcome that would be.As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

First impressions in real life were equally lacklustre, at least for George.“We arrived for our viewing and he whispered, ‘There’s no way we’re going to buy this dump!’” says Harlalka. “But later, I convinced him of its potential. It had so much light and, importantly, a garden. I knew it was the one.”View image in fullscreenA warren of small rooms was turned into one huge living, eating and playing space that looks out on to an exotic garden.Harlalka’s brief to architect Jo Edwards ofEdwards Rensenwas to create a sense of spaciousness throughout the property, delivering fewer rooms but more space. “One of the attractions of this project was that the clients didn’t want to squeeze every bit of space out of it,” says Edwards. “They just wanted to make a beautiful family house for themselves.”To this end, instead of building extra rooms into the loft, the ceilings were removed, creating expansive double-height volumes, allowing the bedrooms to soar into their airy apexes.View image in fullscreenThe ceilings of the bedrooms were removed and they now soar into airy apexes.And at the bottom of the house, the basement, which had previously been divided into multiple rooms, became an open-plan live, eat and – for their young son – play area, dissected by a contemporary steel staircase. A sleek kitchen now flows across one side and dining and seating areas populate the other, while across the entirety glass doors open on to an evergreen garden.We wanted to see the garden from the moment we opened the front door“The full-height kitchen cupboards look like a simple long run, but they hide a multitude of sins,” Edwards says. “The wall behind them kinks and bulges with old fireplaces and wall supports, so beyond the doors, the cupboards are all different depths to make the most of the space available.’Balancing playfulness and originality with practical considerations was a common thread on this project, thanks in part to the expertise of interior designerEdwina Boase, who was invited to bring her eye-catching aesthetic and savvy layout skills to bear. “Edwina is a lover of art and colour, as am I,” says Harlalka. “She also values functionality and practicality, so we were completely in tune.”View image in fullscreenFull-height kitchen cupboards ‘hide a multitude of sins’ (wall supports, bulges, old fireplaces).Between them, Harlalka and Boase commissioned a raft of bespoke artworks, sculpture, photography, furniture and fabrics. Many of the pieces were bought from overseas, via artists and makers discovered on Instagram and Etsy, and then shipped to the UK to be reframed or re-covered where necessary. TheThim Rohdepainting in the study came from Denmark – its canvas stretched in the UK. The silkx+lartwork in the basement is from the Netherlands. The artwork in the main bedroom, byHolly Addi, is from Utah in the States, and the one above the dressing table is byRubeena Ratcliffefrom Canada.“The idea was to create a cherished tapestry of collaborations and stories, enriching not only the aesthetic, but adding depth and personality, too,” Boase says.A case in point is the sitting room, where a pair of large-scale photographs by the South African visual artistKgomotso “Neto” Tleane, found at LagosPhoto festival in Nigeria, inspired the decoration. “It was refreshing to use photography as the main focal point. The colour palette of this pair is quite unique,” says Boase. She reinforced these colours with a series of quadriptych sculptural artworks by Danish artistTilde Grynnerupand theFurbo rose rug. “And after an extensive search, we sourced an abstract painting by German artistSusanne Kirsch, which worked, both in terms of scale and colour palette, even bringing in a shot of the orange accent colour.”View image in fullscreenAn asymmetric mirror helps create a quirky vibe in the dressing table area.Ever the pragmatist, on a holiday to India Harlalka took with her a tracing paper template of the terrazzo design she wanted for the fabric of her sitting room blinds , so it would match theDiespekerdesign on the pair of console tables. Having the fabric and blinds made there proved much cheaper than doing it in the UK. “She will go the extra mile, always,” Boase says.Another example of Harlalka’s fastidious approach is the sideboard, which was originally flat-fronted. Nell Beale Navarro atCoucoumanouwas asked if she could create one of Harlalka’s own designs, using art deco-style routing to give it more texture. “I spent hours getting the sizing between the grooves just right. I love the result,” Harlalkas says.If the house itself is a thing of beauty, the garden is just as intoxicating, and about as exotic as you’ll find in the UK. It was designed byDeclan Buckley(who happens to live across the street) and it’s bursting with evergreens and hardy versions of banana that remind Harlalka and George of their childhoods spent growing up in India. “We wanted to see the garden from the moment we opened the front door, and the straight staircase down to the lower level – an idea George came up with – facilitates that so well,” says Harlalka.Despite his early misgivings about the house, it seems, in the end, that George has delivered the icing on this very special cake.Explore more on these topicsInteriorsHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All those pink cheeks and sweaty brows puffing their way around the park in dusted-down trainers; all those Botivo mocktails (delicious, for what it’s worth) as we strive to self-improve during one of the most grisly months of the year. I’ve never really been one for resolutions, nor time-measured sobriety (amazing how having small children deflates one’s desire to drink enough to conjure a hangover). I prefer to believe that we should mirror what the outdoor world is doing at this time: namely hibernating in an attempt to store up energy for the warmer months that are to come.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Still, if you really feel you must do something vaguely horticultural at this time of year, can I suggest you get your seeds in order? I still think about a photograph I saw of Monty Don’s seed stash in a colour supplement years ago. It was housed in a pleasingly bashed-up vintage index-card cabinet, tucked against the wall of his potting shed – a building with more natural light and square footage than many flats I’ve lived in. How chic! How clever! How deliciously organised!This is a nice job for January because it allows you to time travel through your imaginary garden of the year aheadI set about making my own miniature version soon after, painting a set of six IkeaMoppe mini drawersa similar hue of earthy green. Each drawer was given a couple of months, and I sorted my unruly pile of seed packets into the months I’d be likely to sow them.It soon became apparent that April and September each needed a drawer of their own, and there were all sorts of things among the stash that I wouldn’t be sowing on my tiny balcony or north-facing garden – broccoli, for instance, or rainbow chard. Which is when the capsule collection entered the fold: another box containing a ruthless edit of the seeds I was actually going to use – hardy annual flowers that do well sown direct; a handful of different varieties of poppy; sweet peas. You don’t need something new to do this – a shoebox would work.This is a nice job for January because there’s not a lot else to do on those hangover-free weekends, and because it allows you to time travel through your imaginary garden of the year ahead. As you whittle through the rag-tag pile of promise – a wild carrot here, anAmmi majusthere, some cornflowers in different shades of blue – it’s impossible not to conjure an image of what they could be, alive and growing. It’s a time, in a month made of light punishment, to shrug off the “shoulds” and select what you want to grow, what your gut tells you to, while allowing for a surprise packet or two that you may find along the way. In this way, seed-sorting is as close to a resolution as I get.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Spokespeople for Uganda’s government and military did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.Wine has alleged mass fraud during Thursday’s election, which was held under an internet blackout, and called on supporters to protest. His party said on Thursday he had been placed under effective house arrest.A senior member of the Ugandan opposition earlier said security forces stormed his house early on Friday morning and shot dead 10 members of his campaign team.The NUP’s Muwanga Kivumbi told Reuters the incident happened at about 3am local time when security forces “broke the front door and began shooting” inside a garage where the people were waiting for the results of the election for his parliamentary seat to be announced. “It was a massacre,” he said.Lydia Tumushabe, a local police spokesperson, said she was unaware of an incident at Kivumbi’s house, which she said was close to the police station.She said machete-wielding opposition “goons” organised by Kivumbi had attacked a police station and vote-tallying centre, forcing security personnel to shoot in self-defence.Tumushabe told Agence France-Presse that “an unspecified number” of people had been “put out of action” and that 25 others had been arrested.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ugandan security forces patrol a street in Kampala this week.Photograph: Isaac Kasamani/EPAKivumbi said security forces had earlier dispersed crowds outside but disputed the police’s assertion that the deaths occurred during clashes between the two sides.He said he was “emotionally broken” by the attack, which occurred after hundreds of his supporters had gathered at his house after voting ended.Many fled as security forces stormed the compound, but officers fired through the door of the garage, where 10 campaign agents were hiding, his wife, Zahara Nampewo, a law professor, said.“I was very shaken personally,” she said. “Seeing fresh bodies. I mean, that is something that cannot easily go away.”The army later came to take away the bodies, the couple said.Wine condemned the incident and called on Ugandans to respond. “The criminal regime in its evening, has gone insane.

Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule. He told reporters after casting his ballot on Thursday that he expected to win with 80% of the vote if there was “no cheating”.As of Friday evening, Museveni held a commanding lead with nearly 74% of the vote, the electoral commission said. Wine trailed with 23% and the remaining votes were split among six other candidates.

So we are glad that at this point the study is being cancelled,” Boum said. The study was halted because it raised critical questions on the ethics of the trial, he said, adding: “The way the study was designed was a big challenge.”Officials inGuinea-Bissausay the trial will still happen, according to one journalist on the press call. But Africa CDC officials said the trial would only move forward once it has been redesigned to address ethical issues. There were “still some conversations happening” between Guinea-Bissau officials and the US on how to conduct a trial like this ethically, and Africa CDC, which is not affiliated with the HHS, had assembled a team to make sure Guinea-Bissau officials “receive the adequate support to ensure that this study, if it has to happen, will also fit the ethical regulations”, Boum said.Health secretary RFK Jr appoints two vaccine skeptics to CDC advisory panelRead moreThe design of the study has not been made public by the researchers or by health officials, buta leaked versionwas published by Inside Medicine on Thursday. An HHS official told the Guardian after publication that the protocol is now being updated and the leaked version is not finalized. That would mean the trial would not proceed as it has been described so far.The official did not offer a timeline for when the study would be finalized, but said the US was trying to move as quickly as possible before vaccines roll out to all Guinea-Bissau newborns in 2027. “This study is going to proceed as planned,” the official said.Yet a senior official in Guinea-Bissau said that the trial has been cancelled due to ethical concerns about the study design, according to a letter obtained by the Guardian on Friday. Guinea-Bissau will continue its current vaccination schedule until the birth dose is implemented for all newborns, the letter said.Guinea-Bissau, which underwent a coup in November, appears to have replaced all top officials, including at the ministry of health. Previous officials did not respond to media inquiries, and the number and email address for the health ministry appear to be disconnected.“The good guys won,” said Paul Offit, an infectious diseases physician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a former member of the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The cancellation news was “extremely heartening”, he said, adding that except for the birth of his children, he had “never been happier”.“This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable,” Offit said. “You can’t treat children like this, you can’t treat people like this. We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”The news could represent a turning point for Guinea-Bissau and other countries where researchers are conducting work that critics say is unethical. It shows that “the institutions are getting stronger” by pushing back on unethical and exploitative studies in Africa, said Boghuma Titanji, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University who is studying vaccine misinformation in Africa.The halt was “a win for advocacy and upholding the ethics of research”, said Titanji, who called the trial as it seems to be designed a “damaging study”. “It can lead to damage that lasts for several decades after the study has been completed,” said Titanji.The researchersarguedthat the trial would make the vaccine available to 7,000 newborns when they would “not otherwise receive it”. But that means the other 7,000 children in the trial would not have access to the vaccine “due to the flip of a coin”, which would “knowingly deprive 7,000 children of a vaccine that could save their lives”, Offit said. Instead, he said, “take the $1.6m and vaccinate as many children as you can at birth”.About 18% of adults and about 11% of children under the age of one in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B. Children are much more likely to develop long-term effects, such as liver cirrhosis, which can lead to cancer and death if they catch the virus when they are very young.Guinea-Bissau currently recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all babies at six weeks of age because of issues accessing the vaccine, but that recommendation will change to all newborns at birth in 2027, when more doses are available.Offit likened the trial to the Tuskegee experiment, in which US researchers knowingly withheld an effective antibiotic from African American men suffering from syphilis.The Danish researchers conducting the trial have also been criticized for not publishing the results of a study on the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, potentially because it contradicted their belief that the vaccine is dangerous,accordingto the Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård.Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer, one of the Danish researchers, also shared somedetailson social media. Titanji didn’t find his argument compelling. “It actually just raises even more concerns in my mind,” she said.The researchers argue that some types of vaccines may bring nonspecific effects – improving overall health, not just against the disease the vaccine is targeting. But, they say, adding other kinds of vaccines, such as that for hepatitis B, could interfere with these possible effects. Yet the evidence to support possible overall health effects is based upon the researchers’ prior research, which has been called into question.Other Danish researchers analyzed these studies and found no statistically significant effects, according to their newpreprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed or published yet. One of the researchers on that study, Anders Hviid,saidon LinkedIn that these findings were especially important given recent decisions in the US to limit several vaccines for children.The Danish researchers also argued that trials should be done in Africa in order to study their effects on African children.Titanji agreed that there needed to be more randomized controlled trials done in Africa on Africans, but said that they should be led by African scientists and powered by questions from Africans. Projects like the Danish study “basically exploit the scarcity of a proven beneficial vaccine in a context where that vaccine is needed”, Titanji said. The study, as it is currently designed, would be “exploiting a window where the government is not able to provide that intervention to its citizens”, Titanji added. “You are not solving the problem. You’re actually being part of the problem.”The trial was slated to begin on 5 January. When asked last week about whether the trial had begun, the lead researchers, Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, disputed the Guardian’sprevious storythat cited ethical concerns.“That article was totally wrong,” Aaby said. “The report had virtually no evidence-based content about vaccines to transmit to the readers, only a lot of ethical condemnations from those who might potentially be questioned by the future results of the study.”Aaby and other researchers on the project did not respond to further inquiries about the project’s cancellation.Aaby and Stabell Benn, who are Danish researchers, have close ties with Trump administration health officials. Stabell Benn hosted apodcastwith Tracy Beth Høeg, now an FDA official who has worked tofind deaths after Covid vaccinationand advocated for the US toslash vaccine recommendationsto align with Denmark’s schedule.On Joe Rogan’spodcastin 2023, Kennedy praised Aaby as a “very famous” researcher whose work showed the DTP vaccine was deadly, he said – research Kennedy also cited when he ended funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. But he didn’t mention that the year before, in 2022, the researchers found completely different results when they conducted the same trial.Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationGuinea-BissauRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationInfectious diseasesAfricaHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Some locations in South Africa recorded hundreds of millimetres of rain over the weekend, such as Graskop in Mpumalanga, where 113mm fell in 24 hours, and Phalaborwa, which recorded about 85mm of rainfall. Rain has continued to fall across the region since the weekend.The deluge has been driven by a slow-moving cut-off low pressure system that has remained anchored over the region, repeatedly drawing in moisture and triggering intense downpours. Further heavy rainfall is expected on Friday and over the weekend. Maputo, Mozambique’s capital, could expect daily rainfall totals to exceed 200mm by the end of Friday, while western parts of South Africa and north-western Eswatini may record more than 100mm.The rain has fallen on already saturated ground after an unusually wet December, overwhelming river systems and causing widespread flooding. The South African weather service has raised its flood warning to the highest level as roads have been washed away, infrastructure damaged and large areas rendered inaccessible. Kruger national park has been closed, with flood waters forcing evacuations of staff and visitors.Since October 2025, parts of Limpopo and Mpumalanga have received about twice their average annual rainfall. The prolonged wet weather is disrupting the harvesting and export of mangoes and lemons, threatening supply chains. Authorities have also warned of displaced wildlife, including crocodiles and hippos, which have been sighted near homes. Emergency services have also rescued residents trapped by rapidly rising rivers.Meanwhile, in North America, January continued the theme of much of December with further record warmth. The core of the atypical warmth is focused to the north, with temperatures over the last few days 10-15C warmer than usual for this time of year across much of the US as well as in parts of eastern and western Canada.Temperatures were so anomalous that you would be forgiven for thinking it was late spring in parts of Alberta, Canada, where temperatures exceeded 15C.More widely across North America, many places experienced exceptionally warm days and nights, breaking January records. Unusually high temperatures are expected to continue across much of the western half of North America over the coming days, while in the eastern half an arctic plunge will bring temperatures well below normal for the time of year.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaWeather trackerMozambiqueAfricaFloodingExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Now, the practice of generations of women could become a lifesaving tool in the fight against malaria.Researchers in Uganda have found that treating wraps with the insect repellent permethrincut rates of malariain the infants carried in them by two-thirds.Malariakills more than 600,000 people a year, most of whom are children in Africa under five years old.The trial involved 400 mothers and babies aged about six months old, in Kasese, a rural, mountainous part of westernUganda. Half were given wraps, known locally aslesus, treated with permethrin and half used standard, untreated wraps that had been dipped in water as a “sham” repellent.Researchers followed them for six months to see which babies developed malaria, re-treating the wraps once a month.Babies carried in the treated wraps were two-thirds less likely to develop malaria. In that group there were 0.73 cases per 100 babies each week, and in the other there were 2.14.One mother who attended a community session on the trial results stood up to tell the gathering: “I’ve had five children. This is the first one that I’ve carried in a treated wrap, and it’s the first time I’ve had a child who has not had malaria.”The results had everybody “tremendously excited”, said co-lead investigator Edgar Mugema Mulogo, a professor of public health at Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda.“We suspected that there would be potential benefit – what was quite outstanding was the magnitude.”His co-lead investigator Dr Ross Boyce, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was so astounded he said they should rerun the results to double-check them. “I wasn’t sure it was going to work, to be honest with you,” said Boyce. “But that’s why we do studies.”The mosquitoes that carry malaria parasites generally feed at night, which is why bed nets have historically been so key in fighting the disease.View image in fullscreenA mural in a Ugandan orphanage. Mosquitoes have historically bitten people at night, so the fight against malaria has focused on bed nets.Photograph: Bella Falk/AlamyHowever, they areincreasingly biting outside that time frame, in the evening or early morning, in what could be an adaptation to mosquito nets.Mulogo said: “Before you go to bed, when you’re outdoors – particularly in the rural community, where the kitchens are outside, probably they have the evening meal outside – we also need to find a solution ensuring that we can prevent those bites likely to transmit malaria.”Wraps are everywhere in those communities, he said, used not only for carrying infants but also as shawls, bed sheets and aprons. He would like to see treated wraps become part of the suite of tools used to tackle malaria in Uganda. Already there is demand in the communities that took part in the study, he said.Health officials in Uganda and international malaria leaders at the World Health Organization have expressed interest in the research. It could help babies, as protection passed on through the mother’s antibodies wanes, often before they can be vaccinated.It builds too onearlier researchtreating shawls in Afghan refugee camps that found a similar levels of success. WHO guidelines already recognise the role permethrin-treated clothing can play as individual protection against malaria.The chatbot will see you now: how AI is being trained to spot mental health issues in any languageRead moreMulogo is hopeful there could one day be local production of impregnated wraps. “It presents a very good business opportunity for local industry.”There are a series of steps that will need to be taken before any rollout, the researchers said, including evidence that the intervention works in other settings.Boyce said the insecticide has a good safety profile, and has been applied to textiles for years – including by the US military, where he first came across the idea when serving in Iraq.View image in fullscreenAmerican soldiers’ uniforms are sprayed to prevent sandfly bites in Iraq in 2004. The US military has long applied insecticide to textiles.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyBabies carried in permethrin-treated wraps were slightly more likely to develop rashes, at 8.5% v 6%, although none were sufficiently troublesome that they withdrew from the study. Boyce and Mulogo say further research will be needed to confirm the safety of the intervention, although any risks are likely to be outweighed by the benefits.Boyce would like to see whether treating school uniforms can also cut malaria rates. But he said there was no money for the next research stages “in the bank accounts quite yet”.He is hopeful that the simplicity of the intervention will appeal to funders. “My mother can understand what we did. It’s not some specific inhibitor of a fusion protein or something like that. We took some cloth and we soaked it. And it’s dirt cheap,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthMalariaMedical researchUgandaAfricaChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Those who can afford to seek care abroad typically do so.There is also a dearth of emergency response services. When the former world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua survived a car accident in Nigeria in December, he was helped at the scene by bystanders, with no ambulance in sight.Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie reveals her one-year-old son has died after a short illnessRead moreAdichie’s sister-in-law Dr Anthea Esege Nwandu, a physician with decades of experience, has called for change.She told Agence France-Presse: “This is a wake-up call, for we, the public, to demand accountability and transparency and consequences of negligence in our healthcare system.”An exodus of medical personnel has exacerbated the situation, resulting in a doctor-to-patient ratio at the last count of 1:9,801. According to the health ministry, anestimated 16,000 doctorshave left Nigeria in the last seven years.‘The will of God’As Nigerians at home and abroad mourned Adichie’s son this week and the Lagos state government ordered an inquiry, stories flooded social media about a crisis of errors by medical personnel.In Kano state, authorities said they were investigating the case of a woman who died four months after doctors left a pair of scissors in her stomach during surgery. The woman repeatedly visited the hospital complaining of abdominal pain, but was only prescribed painkillers. Scans revealed the scissors just two days before she died.For Ijoma Ugboma, who lost his wife in 2021, the tragedy felt painfully familiar. Peju Ugboma, a 41-year-old chef, had gone into hospital for fibroid surgery and died due to complications exacerbated by staff putting “the wrong setting of the ventilator [on] for 12 hours”, her husband said.“Surgery on Friday, ICU on Saturday, dead on Sunday. I asked for the death certificate … but at that point I knew that I wasn’t going to let this thing go like that,” he told the Guardian.Almost two years after Peju’s death, after a battle Ugboma said had tested him “mentally, emotionally and financially”, three of the four doctors in the operating theatre were indicted for professional misconduct.The law firm of Olisa Agbakoba, a medical negligence lawyer with two decades’ experience, was one of two that represented the Ugboma family in court. He said in Nigeria there was no rigorous regulatory structure in place in the health sector.“There is no requirement for routine submission of reports, no systematic inspections, and no effective enforcement of professional standards,” he said.Agbakoba said his brother had undergone surgery by a physician who was not suitably qualified, resulting in sepsis that required a month-long treatment. “That was absolute incompetence,” he said.Despite the abundance of medical malpractice claims, formal complaints and lawsuits remain remarkably low, partly because negligence is hard to prove. But many say there is also a cultural and spiritual dimension involved.“People say it’s the will of God,” said Agbakoba. “They just go home and don’t talk about it … It’s underreported because many people don’t really do anything about it.”Finding justiceEven when issues are escalated legally, medical personnel are reluctant to give professional opinions in court. Two of the three expert witnesses that testified for the Ugbomas live outside Nigeria.“People told us they’d read through the case notes, they’d seen all the fault lines … but nobody wanted to talk and that is part of the rot in the system because there’s an unwritten oath of secrecy,” Ugboma said.Some people are cautiously optimistic that the high-profile death of Adichie’s’s son will trigger an overhaul of the health regulatory framework.For Ugboma, his long fight for accountability was worth it. “Right now, I can talk to my children and tell them I fought for their mother even in death,’ he said. “There’s justice out there if only one can persevere. It’s a marathon. But we can only have a better system if more people begin to challenge them.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricaChimamanda Ngozi AdichieHospitalsDoctorsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Her sudden removal came despite an emergency court order on 21 November directing the government to keep her inMassachusettsor elsewhere in the United States for at least 72 hours for legal processes.People affected by the US visa freeze: share your experienceRead moreLópez Belloza, whose family emigrated from Honduras to the US in 2014 when she was seven, is currently staying with grandparents and studying remotely. She is not detained and was recently visiting an aunt in El Salvador. In early December, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers reportedlyturned upat her parents’ home in Austin, Texas, and behaved aggressively towards the family but left without taking further action.At a federal court hearing on Tuesday of this week in Boston, the government argued the court lacks jurisdiction in the case because lawyers for López Belloza filed their action several hours after she was taken toTexason the way out of the US in November. But the government also acknowledged it violated the judge’s order.In court filings and in open court, government lawyers said an ICE deportation officer mistakenly believed the order no longer applied and he failed to activate a system that alerts other ICE officers that a case is subject to judicial review and that removal should be halted.“On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologize,” said Mark Sauter, assistant US attorney, to the judge, saying the employee understood “he made a mistake”. The violation, Sauter added, was “an inadvertent mistake by one individual, not a willful act of violating a court order”.In a declaration filed with the court on 2 January, the ICE officer also admitted he did not notify ICE’s enforcement office in Port Isabel, Texas, that the removal mission needed to be canceled. He said he believed the judge’s order did not apply once López Belloza was no longer in the state.The government maintains, however, that her deportation was lawful because an immigration judge ordered the removal of López Belloza and her mother in 2016, and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed their appeal in 2017. Prosecutors said she could have pursued additional appeals or sought a stay of removal.Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, countered that she was deported in clear violation of the 21 November order and said the government’s actions deprived her of due process. “I was hoping the government would show some leniency and bring her back,” he said. “They violated a court order.”On Friday he filed papers with the court asking the judge to order the government to come up with a plan to return his client to the US.López Belloza said that as she was being flown toHondurasher emotions went from incredulity to something darker and she began thinking the life she had – living in a college dorm in a comfortable Massachusetts suburb, earning a business degree so she could open a tailoring shop with her father – might be over.“I guess this is where my dreams are gone,” she recalled thinking, in a telephone interview with the Associated Press on Friday. “Because in Honduras, if you want to dream big, it’s like you have to have a lot of money. You have to be rich. But in the United States, dreams are possible. You can make them happen.”Federal Judge Richard Stearns has said he appreciated the government acknowledging the error, calling it a “tragic” bureaucratic mistake. But he appeared to rule out holding the government in contempt, noting the violation did not appear intentional. He also questioned whether he had jurisdiction over the case.“It might not be anybody’s fault, but she was the victim of it,” Stearns said, adding at one point that López Belloza could explore applying for a student visa.López Belloza further said to the AP: “I have a lot of hope,” adding that she was “so appreciative of the apology that the government made”.But the mistake has turned her life upside down.“Those hours I was detained, it was so horrible,” she said. “Knowing that it was a mistake, it does hurt me.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationMassachusettsTexasHondurasUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Rodríguez is governing as acting president with support from other key Maduro allies, including thefeared interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and has vowed to improve ties with the US.“I’m sure the opposition is biting their tongue because this is just brutal for them,” said Eva Golinger, a US lawyer who advised Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez. “They’re sidelined… They have no role in what’s going on. They’re out of the game for now.”Trump’s decision to back Rodríguez was reportedly based partly on personal animosity towards Machado and partly on CIA advice that she would be incapable of preventing a dangerous security breakdown by bringing the military and armed pro-regime paramilitary groups under control.Trump officials have been open about their decision to strike a deal with Maduro’s closest allies, many of whom have been implicated in serious human rights violations.“We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you’ve got to prevent in the meantime is a collapse of the nation,” the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, told CBS News on Sunday.Golinger believed Machado hoped to squeeze her way back into Trump’s plans by offering her 18-carat medal in a golden picture frame to a man obsessed with “everything gilded and golden”.View image in fullscreenMaría Corina Machado presents Donald Trump with her Nobel peace prize medalPhotograph: White House/Getty ImagesBut she doubted the move would work, noting how Rodríguez’s administration was already complying with one of Trump’s key demands – opening up Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to US companies. The first US deportation flight since Maduro’s capture landed in Caracas on Friday carrying 199 Venezuelans.“Delcy is giving him everything he wants. He has no reason to disrupt the situation – and he’s certainly not going to let María Corina Machado come in and try to shake things up,” Golinger said.“I’m sure he sees her as weak. She’s come [to Washington] and grovelled and handed over her Nobel peace prize …and she went out the back door…I would put money on the fact that should Delcy come to the White House, she will get a formal reception.”Imdat Oner, a former Turkish diplomat in Venezuela who is a fellow at Florida International University’s Jack D Gordon institute for public policy, also doubted Machado’s gift would change Trump’s mind.“They bet fully on theTrump administration… [that] Trump would remove the whole regime from power and open a path for the opposition. But this didn’t happen,” he said.Giving Trump the Nobel peace prize medal is ‘absurd’, say Norwegian politiciansRead more“Machado’s hands are tied … she definitely understands that she has already been sidelined and she will not be part of the game,” he said, calling the idea of her becoming president “completely out of the question” for now.If Machado’s visit to the White House was widely viewed as a humiliation for the Nobel laureate, the arrival of the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, in Caracas on Thursday was also seen as a mortifying moment for Rodríguez and members of her “interim administration”.Less than two weeks earlier, Ratcliffe’s agents had played a key role in infiltrating Maduro’s inner-circle to pinpoint his location so he could be seized from what should have been Venezuela’s most fortified address. Their information was reportedly so strong that they even knew what food Maduro was eating and which pets he had.One US officialtold the New York TimesRatcliffe had gone to Caracas to “to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship” with the embattled remnant’s of Maduro’s regime led by Rodríguez.Speaking during a state of the union address that Maduro had expected to be giving himself, Rodríguez said their country “had the right” to good relations with the US and that she was willing to travel to Washington to hold talks with representatives of the “lethal nuclear power”.“The pretext of any kind of anti-imperialist socialist movement [has] really just been stripped away. It’s ridiculous,” said Golinger.“You can’t claim in the morning … that you’re an anti-imperialist sovereign movement and then receive the director of the CIA … after 10 days earlier they bombed Caracas and executed an extraordinary rendition of the sitting head of state.“It’s just farcical … what we’re witnessing is a clear betrayal of everything that [the Chavismo] movement stood for.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDelcy RodríguezMaría Corina MachadoUS foreign policyTrump administrationAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, a supreme court judge authorised the disgraced former president to take part in the scheme after a request from his legal team.Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper famed for his hostility to democracy, minorities, the Amazon rainforest and the arts, is unlikely to appreciate the approved reading list. It includes Brazilian works on Indigenous rights, racism, the environment and the violence meted out by the country’s 1964-85 dictatorship – a regime Bolsonaro openly supported.One title, Ana Maria Gonçalves’ 950-page Um Defeito de Cor (A Colour Defect), tells “the history of Brazil … from the point of view of a Black woman”.Also featured isDemocracy!, a children’s non-fiction picture book by the English-born author-illustrator Philip Bunting.Some of the books on the list, such as Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote, are more than 1,000 pages long. Bolsonaro did once appear in public with a similarly sized tome – Winston Churchill’s 1,000-plus page Memoirs of the Second World War – but it is unclear if the former president read it.In order to benefit from the sentence reduction scheme, prisoners must prove they have actually read the books by submitting written reports to prison authorities.Asked to name his favourite book during the 2018 presidential election, Bolsonaro plumped for one byCarlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a notorious army colonel accused of torturing hundreds of prisoners during the dictatorship. “It’s a real story about Brazil … with facts, with data, with places with real episodes,” enthused Bolsonaro who was this week transferred toa maximum security prisonin the capital, Brasília, after spending Christmas imprisoned at a federal police base.Ustra’s book does not feature on the justice system’s reading list but it does contain one title,Marcelo Rubens Paiva’s I’m Still Here, about the plight of prisoners who disappeared into such torture centres.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasLiteracynewsShareReuse this content"

In 2024, only 2% of Canada’s crude oil was exported to China.Additional agreements were signed covering forestry, culture and tourism.Welcoming Carney, Xi said China-Canada relations had reached a turning point at their previous meeting on the sidelines of theApec summit in October 2025.“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,” Xi told the Canadian prime minister.He added that “the healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations serves the common interests of our two countries”, and that he was “glad” to see efforts in recent months to restore cooperation.Relations between Beijing and Ottawa withered in 2018 afterCanada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer, on a US warrant, prompting China’sretaliatory detention of two Canadianson espionage charges.In the years that followed, the two countries imposed tariffs on each other’s exports, while China was also accused of interfering in Canada’s elections.Carney has sought a strategic pivot, and Beijing has signalled its willingness to get relations back on “the right track”.The Canadian prime minister, who on Thursday met China’s premier, Li Qiang, is also scheduled to hold talks with business leaders to discuss trade.Canada, traditionally a staunch US ally, has been hit particularly hard by Trump’s steep tariffs on steel, aluminium, vehicles and lumber. In October, Carney said Canada should double its non-US exports by 2035 to reduce reliance on the US.However, the US remains far and away its largest market, buying about 75% of Canadian goods in 2024, according to government statistics. While Ottawa has stressed that China is Canada’s second-largest market, it lags far behind, buying less than 4% of Canadian exports in 2024.Officials from Canada and China have been in talks to lower tariffs and boost bilateral trade, though an agreement has yet to be reached.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCanadaChinaTariffsTrump administrationMark CarneyXi JinpingInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

These accusations are absolutely false and pain me deeply.”The singer said he would “defend my dignity against this serious affront” and thanked “so very many dear people for their messages of love and support”.The two women – a domestic worker and a physical therapist known by the pseudonyms Rebeca and Laura – have filed a complaint against Iglesias at Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, accusing him of sexual assault and human trafficking. The allegations are the subject of a preliminary investigation by prosecutors at the court.Rebeca has alleged that Iglesias, who was 77 at the time, would often call her to his room at the end of the working day. She claimed he would then penetrate her anally and vaginally with his fingers without her consent. “He used me almost every night,” she said. “I felt like an object, like a slave.”Laura alleged to elDiario.es and Univision Noticias that Iglesias had kissed her on the mouth and touched her breasts without her permission and against her will. “We were at the beach and he came up to me and touched my nipples,” she said, adding that a similar incident took place by the pool at the singer’s villa in Punta Cana, a luxury resort in theDominican Republic.On Wednesday, elDiario.es published testimony from Rebeca and another former worker, Carolina, in which they allegedbeing required to have medical teststo check for sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and chlamydia.The women said they were then asked to send the results to one of Iglesias’s housekeepers. ElDiario.es also obtained medical documents apparently showing that five women employed at Iglesias’s villa in the Dominican Republic in 2021 underwent gynaecological examinations.In an interview with elDiario.es, Laura said she and Rebeca had decided to file a complaint against Iglesias to encourage other women to come forward. “I think by taking legal action we’re sending a message to all the victims of this person – Julio Iglesias – so that they can speak out and believe in justice,” she said. “It’s so they can understand that this wasn’t something that just happened to them.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeSexual harassmentDominican RepublicAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Lawmakers rushed to override the decree, with some climbing over fences to reach the chamber before voting to lift the order.The emergency rule lasted six hours before Yoon backed down. In the separate insurrection case, prosecutors allege he attempted to use military force toparalyse the legislature, arrest political opponents and seize control of the national election commission.Weeks after martial law collapsed, investigators from the country’s corruption investigation officeattempted to arrestYoon on insurrection-related charges.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Yoon Suk Yeol hold placards and flags as they rally outside the Seoul central district court in Seoul on Friday.Photograph: Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPAHe refused to comply,barricading himselfinside his residence and deploying hundreds of presidential security service officers toblock a court-issued arrest warrantby sealing the compound with vehicle barricades and human chains.“The defendant abused his tremendous influence as president to obstruct lawful warrant execution, effectively privatising security officials sworn to serve the Republic of Korea into his personal troops,” Baek said in a televised ruling. “His crimes are extremely serious in nature.”The court also criticised Yoon’s conduct in the run-up to the martial law declaration. He selectively summoned only loyal cabinet members to a late-night meeting, excluding nine others in order to rubber-stamp the decision without meaningful deliberation.He later signed backdated documents to create the false appearance of proper cabinet approval.“Emergency martial law should only be declared in the most exceptional circumstances when no other means exist to resolve a national crisis,” Baek said. “The constitution specifically requires state council deliberation precisely to prevent presidential abuse of power and arbitrary action.”Friday’s conviction marks the opening act in a reckoning without parallel in South Korea’s democratic history. Yoon faces seven additional criminal trials, including the insurrection case, where prosecutors are seeking either the death penalty or life imprisonment.Other cases, some brought by separate special prosecutors, include allegations that he ordered drone incursions into North Korean airspace to provoke a response that could be used as a pretext for martial law.The insurrection verdict is scheduled for 20 February. That case centres on allegations that Yoon, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police commissioner Cho Ji-ho orchestrated the deployment of armed troops to the national assembly.Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee,faces a separate verdicton 28 January on stock manipulation andbribery charges, carrying a prosecutorial demand of 15 years’ imprisonment and a 2bn won (£1m) fine.The former prime minister Han Duck-soo is due to receive a verdict on 21 January on charges of aiding insurrection.Explore more on these topicsYoon Suk YeolSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Because of the terrain where the rain fell, it accelerates the water flows down through the river systems coming off Mount Cowley,” she said.About 186.2mm fell in the 24 hours to 9am, the highest rainfall recorded in one day at Lorne, exceeding the previous record of 123.2mm on 30 September 2021. Up to 100mm of rain was recorded across the Otway coastal fringe.0:46Footage shows campsites flattened in aftermath of flash flooding in Victoria – videoGiri said more than 10,000 people in the area received a text alert telling them to go to higher ground, “so, in our eyes, warnings were not issued late”.“It was an unprecedented weather event, and our response was pretty incredible when you think about how quickly it happened and how quickly we were able to mobilise SES crews, the local CF brigade, and other emergency partners,” she said.The Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Diana Eadie told reporters at a press conference on Friday that it had been an “extraordinary” rainfall event and warnings were escalated as the bureau started to see “increased rainfall rates”.She said a severe thunderstorm warning for heavy rain that may lead to flash flooding was first issued at 11.57am, after 45mm of rain was recorded in one hour at Mount Cowley, in the Otway ranges near Lorne. Then, at 12.40pm, the warning was escalated to include intense rainfall with the risk of flash flooding over the Surf Coast as the rainfall observations continued to climb rapidly at Mount Cowley.View image in fullscreenThe cleanup along the Victorian surf coast begins.Photograph: Michael Currie/AAPSpeaking at the same press conference, Wiebusch said the situation was dynamic and he believed the warnings were “adequate … and as timely as they could be”.He said the first triple zero call reporting flash flooding was at 1.08pm, and then at 1.20pm for cars being washed away – about 30 minutes after the BoM upgraded its emergency warning.There was just one injury, Wiebusch said – a child who climbed on to a roof and had to be airlifted to hospital. Police also airlifted a man in his 60s from the roof of a shed at Cumberland River, and rescued five hikers and two four-wheel drive vehicles bogged west of Lorne.NSW was also hit hard, with the State Emergency Service responding to more than 274 incidents statewide in the 24 hours to 3pm on Friday – the majority on the south coast.In Eden, about 40 vehicles were trapped on the Princes Highway for three hours by water over the road and a fallen tree, and more than 100 people were temporarily stranded at a golf club when surrounding areas flooded.View image in fullscreenThe floods carried tents, camping equipment and campers’ personal possessions on to the beach and into the sea.Photograph: Michael Currie/EPAEarlier, the BoM’s Hines said there would be more flash flooding across the southern parts of NSW and Victoria in coming days, with isolated falls of up to 200mm in three days possible, with storms.“There is a severe weather warning for Friday,” Hines said. “We can see it extends from Wollongong down to the Victorian border, covering the south coast area and parts of the Illawarra in this region.“We’ll likely see some damaging wind gusts on Friday, up to about 100km an hour. We will also see some heavy, persistent rain.”View image in fullscreenFlash flooding was so strong it washed cars into the sea.Photograph: Michael Currie/AAPThe Illawarra and south coast of NSW could receive between 150 and 200mm of rain between Thursday afternoon and Saturday night, Hines said, with “significant” flash flooding.“There’s likely to be disruption and delays to travel and transport, including road closures,” he said. “It’s going to be very rough on the coastline for boats and maybe even have an impact on flights and travel.”Severe winds were expected to make it difficult to fight the bushfires in Victoria.View image in fullscreenHundreds of stranded holidaymakers were evacuated from flooded campgrounds.Photograph: Michael Currie/AAPWiebusch said there were still about 10 major fires burning across the state, including in the Otways and Gippsland and the large Longwood fire complex, although none were at emergency warning level.He said updated assessments found more than 1,000 structures had been damaged or destroyed by the fires, including 289 homes.About 100 roads were still shut and being cleared due to fires and floods, including the road from Skenes Creek to Lorne.The climate crisis is making the country more vulnerable to extreme and unpredictable weather and natural disasters, areport from the Insurance Council of Australia warned in October. This week, the World Meteorological Organisation said 2025 had continued a three-year streak of “extraordinary global temperatures” during which surface air temperatures averaged 1.48C above preindustrial levels.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherVictoriaNew South WalesFloodingBushfiresExtreme weatherNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

Papers they examined that compared health outcomes among children born to the same mother included 262,852 under-18s who had been assessed for autism, 335,255 assessed for ADHD and 406,681 assessed for intellectual disability.Khalil said: “The message is clear: paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided. This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever, and so they should feel reassured that they still have a safe option to relieve them of their symptoms.”Without naming Trump, the researchers categorically refute his remarks. They “hope that this gold-standard review will put an end to any scepticism on using paracetamol during pregnancy as avoiding paracetamol for significant pain or fever can expose both mother and baby to known risks, particularly untreated maternal fever”.Trump madehis interventionduring a press conference at the White House on 22 September. Referring to the drug by its name in America, he said: “Taking Tylenol is not good … All pregnant women should talk to their doctors about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant … Don’t take Tylenol. There’s no downside.”He said paracetamol in pregnancy was so dangerous that his administration planned to tell doctors in the US to advise expectant mothers to avoid using it.However, this new study has concluded that Trump’s statements were baseless. It identified no association between exposure to paracetamol in utero and a baby being autistic, having ADHD or an intellectual disability.“Familial and genetic factors, including the well-established tendency for autistic traits to run in families, are more plausible explanations for previously observed associations than any direct effect of paracetamol,” it says.The authors also raise the possibility that an ailment which prompts a woman to take paracetamol regularly during pregnancy may itself play more of a role in influencing a child’s neurodevelopmental status.“Paracetamol is typically used only intermittently, and its prolonged use raises questions about whether the underlying health condition prompting extended use might be more important in shaping neurodevelopmental outcomes rather than the drug itself,” they say.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, responded to Trump’s claims by advising women in the UK to ignore them. “I would just say to people watching: don’t pay any attention whatsoever to whatDonald Trumpsays about medicine,” he said on ITV the day after.Experts welcomed the Lancet study. “Expectant mothers do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far-reaching effects on their child’s health.Grainne McAlonan, a professor of translational neuroscience at King’s College London, said: “While the impact of last year’s announcement has been extensive, I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close.”Dr Steven Kapp, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Portsmouth, said: “An implication is that society needs to stop going down rabbit holes of seeking false prevention of developmental disabilities. Instead, we should focus on making the world a better place for disabled people.”Streeting said: “This major review can, yet again, reassure mothers-to-be everywhere that there is no evidence whatsoever to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism, ADHD or disabilities in their children.“Our country’s leading scientists, doctors, and the NHS are clear that paracetamol is safe to take when pregnant and in pain or suffering a fever.”Explore more on these topicsAutismMedical researchHealthDonald TrumpEuropePharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

While the song appears on Spotify’s own charts, it does not qualify for inclusion on the official chart under the current rules,” said an IFPI Sweden spokesperson.Ludvig Werber, IFPI Sweden’s chief executive, said: “Our rule is that if it is a song that is mainly AI-generated, it does not have the right to be on the top list.”I Know, You’re Not Mine is an acoustic guitar-led folk-pop song, and the artist’s profile page on Spotify is illustrated by a sketch of a bearded, T-shirt-wearing man. The song has been streamed more than 5m times globally, including 200,000 plays in Sweden. It is part of a six-track EP called Kärleken är Bränd, or Love is Burned.IFPI Sweden acted after an investigative journalist, Emanuel Karlsten, revealed the song was registered to a Danish music publisher called Stellar and that two of the credited rights holders worked in the company’s AI department.“What emerges is a picture of a music publisher that wants to experiment with new music and new kinds of artists. Who likes to push the limits of the audience’s tolerance threshold for artificial music and artificial artists,” wrote Karlsten.In a statement, Stellar said: “The artist Jacub’s voice and parts of the music are generated with the help of AI as a tool in our creative process.”Stellar said it was “first and foremost” a music company run by creative professionals, not a tech or AI outfit. The company added that creating a hit had required “something different” to simply prompting an AI tool to create a tune.“We are passionate and experienced music professionals who have invested large amounts of time, energy and dedication in the songwriting and production of this release, and the creation has been a process that has been guided by a clear artistic vision,” said the company.Stellar said it was against “AI music slop”, the term for mass-produced AI content that is often nonsensical and surreal.‘We are truly doomed’: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard despair at AI clone appearing on SpotifyRead moreSpotify does not require music to be labelled as AI-generated, but has beencracking down on AI-made spam tracksas every play more than 30 seconds long generates a royalty for the scammer behind it – and dilutes payments to legitimate artists.Jacub is not the first AI artist to score a hit with audiences. A “band” called the Velvet Sundown amassed more than 1m streams on Spotify last yearbefore it emerged the group was AI-generated, including its promotional images and backstory as well as the music. Its most popular song has now accumulated 4m streams on the platform.Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said Jacub’s success underlined the need for mandatory AI labelling.“If Spotify told users when they were listening to AI music this wouldn’t have made it so high in the charts, taking streams and royalties away from human musicians. Governments must require that AI-generated works be prominently labelled as a matter of urgency,” he said.Last year Spotify, which is based in Sweden, said it was backing a new industry standard for disclosing the use of AI in creating a track. The product is being developed by a tech and music industry-backed nonprofit called DDEX. Artists’ use of the standard on the platform will be voluntary, said Spotify, and they will not be forced to label music as entirely or partly AI-created.Spotify has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)SpotifyDigital music and audioSwedenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I think he’s laid the markers down.“He’s told Denmark what he’s looking for, and now it’s a matter of having Secretary Rubio and Vice-President JD Vance make a deal.”Denmark announced it had agreed to provide support to help Greenland’s emergency preparedness.Torsten Schack Pedersen, Denmark’s minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, said: “It is important that we stand together.”Peter Borg, Greenland’s minister for fisheries, hunting, agriculture, self-sufficiency and environment, said his government “appreciates the support from Denmark to strengthen preparedness in Greenland”.This week, Greenlanders living in the capital, Nuuk, said they were so afraid of the threat from the US that they werewatching the skies and seas themselves. In the absence of emergency preparedness support from authorities, many said they had been left to work out their own plans on what to do in the case of emergency evacuation or capture by US forces.2:37What do people in Greenland think of Trump’s threats? – videoDuring the congressional visit to Denmark, for which the Greenlandic flag, Erfalasorput, was flown at Christiansborg Palace, the US lawmakers were due to meet other Danish and Greenlandic politicians as well as Frederiksen and Nielsen.Arriving at a lunch meeting at the Confederation of Danish Industry, the Democrat Steny Hoyer told TV 2: “Keep the faith. You’ve got a lot of people with you.”At a joint press conference, Coons thanked Denmark for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said they had a “strong and robust” dialogue about how to continue their relationship into the future.“There’s a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of reality” in Washington, he said, in discussions about Greenland. He added that they were hoping to use information from the visit to try to “lower the temperature” and have a “constructive dialogue” at home.Murkowski said the majority of Americans did not want a US takeover of Greenland, adding: “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset.”After Wednesday’s closely watchedhigh-stakes meetingbetween the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the US vice-president, Vance, and the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, the two sides gave starkly contrasting accounts of what was agreed.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Thursday claimed that a delegation from Denmark and Greenland had agreed to “continue to have technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland”.But Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Vivian Motzfeldt, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland respectively, contradicted her claims.Rasmussen said they had not made such an agreement, but had formed a working group to investigate whether it was possible to “accommodate” US security wishes for the Arctic region.Motzfeldt said Leavitt had not been at the meeting, telling the Greenland newspaper Sermitsiaq: “There is a lot of work ahead, the situation is still very uncertain, but we have a new channel, a place where we can talk directly to each other.”On Thursday, Frederiksen said Greenland’s defence was a “common concern” for Nato as international troops started arriving in Greenland from across Europe.A spokesperson for the German defence ministry said on Friday that the reconnaissance mission would assess the viability of deploying Eurofighter jets to the territory.“It is a matter of looking at whether the Arctic is secure and to what extent we can contribute to this together with our Nato partners,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkTrump administrationNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As Washington challenges the US Federal Reserve’s independence, sending jitters through financial markets, the price soared to a record $4,643 (£3,463) an ounce this week, and analysts have tipped it to break $5,000 this year.As Donald Trumpshatters the global rules-based order, official institutions (and private investors) are scrambling to buy gold: the share of the asset in central banks’ reserves has doubled in the past decade to more than a quarter, the highest level in almost 30 years.Although this partly reflects the soaring bullion price, experts say central banks are also stuffing their vaults as an insurance policy in a volatile world. Many are also rushing to repatriate gold stockpiles held overseas, and slashing their exposure to the US dollar.“We have moved from Pax Americana to global discord, geopolitically. It is the law of the jungle when we see what the US are doing,” says Raphaël Gallardo, the chief economist at the asset manager Carmignac.“Investors – private and sovereign – believe their strategic reserves are no longer safe in dollar terms, as they can be confiscated overnight. The dollar is losing the credibility as the nominal anchor of the global monetary system because the Fed is losing credibility, and US Congress is losing its credibility.”View image in fullscreenAs Donald Trump shatters the global rules-based order, the share of gold in central banks’ reserves has doubled in the past decade.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesOfficial reserves are a critical piece in the global monetary puzzle. Underpinning national currencies as a kind of safety fund, they are typically made up of currencies such as the dollar, euro, yen and pound, as well as gold, bonds and International Monetary Fund assets. They are used to help maintain investor confidence, and can be deployed to stabilise exchange rates in times of stress.For much of the past century the dollar has been the primary reserve currency of choice; the grease in the wheels of global finance and the medium of exchange in the majority of world trade.Bitcoin’s buzz is gone. Investors chose real gold in 2025 | Nils PratleyRead moreHistorically, the monetary system pegged currencies to the value of gold – with countries committing to convert paper money to a fixed amount; reflecting millennia of obsession with the precious metal. However, the link for the dollar – and with it other currencies pegged to the US currency under the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement – was severed in theeconomic upheaval of the 1970sby the then US president, Richard Nixon. Since then, exchange rates have floated on international currency markets based on supply and demand.However, the dollar’s status is dwindling; reflecting Trump’s erratic policymaking – including interference at the Fed and the fragile US public finances – as well as Washington’s readiness to deploy economic sanctions. This includes the targeting of Russian central bank reserves after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Still, the dollar is down but not out. From about 66% of total central bank reserves a decade ago, it has slipped to about 57%. Economists say this is because it lacks a clear alternative. Other fiat currencies – such as the pound, euro, yen or yuan – lack global scale. As a consequence, institutions are turning instead to gold – the world’s oldest reliable store of value.View image in fullscreenA currency dealer monitors exchange rates. For much of the past century the dollar has been the primary reserve currency of choice.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesAs a case in point, in June last year – fuelled by the soaring bullion price –gold overtook the euroto become the world’s second-most important reserve asset after the dollar.“There is no one to replace the dollar. So gold is shining by default,” Gallardo says. “People are returning to what [British economist John Maynard] Keynes called the ‘barbarous relic’, as it is nobody’s debt.”According to a survey of 50 central banks by the asset manager Invesco, about half plan to increase their gold allocation. Two-thirds also plan to relocate bullion stockpiles they hold outside their borders back to domestic vaults for safekeeping.“Gold has always been the ultimate safe haven. So in times of political uncertainty and instability you see gold spikes in terms of central banks. It’s a form of protection and a backstop if traditional fiat currencies fail,” says Rod Ringrow, the head of official institutions at Invesco.Gold price tops $4,000 for first time as investors seek safe havenRead more“The last four years have seen this whole concept of the weaponisation of reserves, after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. So central banks have started to look at that and say: ‘If I want gold reserves, am I comfortable with them in-country, or at other depositories?’. We’ve seen a shifting pattern in that regard.”Historically, many central banks have held their gold stockpiles in London, Switzerland and New York – the centres of the global bullion trade, with records of political and economic stability.The Bank of England is the world’s most important hub. Serving about 70 official institutions worldwide, its vaults deep under London’s streets contain about400,000 bars, worth more than half a trillion dollars.The clamour for central banks to repatriate their gold – and the difficulties it can involve – has recently come to the fore: Venezuela hasbars locked-up at the Bank of England worth $2bn, which it cannot access while the UK government refuses to recognise the Caracas regime. Russia has alsothreatened Belgium, where the bulk of Moscow’s frozen foreign-currency reserves are held.Alongside Serbia, governments that have sought to repatriate their gold reserves includeIndia,HungaryandTurkey.Polandhas brought back hundreds of tonnes of gold bars that it transported to London, the US and Canada amid the outbreak of the second world war.View image in fullscreenBank of England vaults, deep under London’s streets, contain about400,000 bars, worth more than half a trillion dollars.Photograph: Bank Of England/ShutterstockIn the 2010s,Germanywas an early pioneer of repatriation, amid political pressure to return thousands of tonnes of bullion from the US and France, where its reserves had been moved to because of fears of a Soviet invasion during the cold war.Economists say the most prominent countries hoarding gold are typically those most exposed to geopolitical tensions. Central bank purchases rose by 10% in the year to September, according to the World Gold Council, led by Poland, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and China.Beijing has been on a buying spree, amassing more than 2,000 tonnes – estimated to rank as the sixth largest in the world – in its attempts to rival Washington. Still, with more than 8,000 tonnes, the US is thought to be the world leader – even though the contents of its Fort Knox vault have not been officially audited since 1953.Other countries have gone in the opposite direction. The UK government was a notable seller during Gordon Brown’s time as the Labour chancellor in the late 1990s and early 2000s – disposing of 401 tonnes of gold out of its 715-tonne holding – at a time when gold prices were historically low.Some economists believe cryptocurrencies could grow in significance to rival traditional currencies and gold as a reserve asset. However, central banks have so far shown caution when it comes to a volatile and nascent market where security concerns remain, and where the most stable assets are still pegged to the value of the dollar or gold anyway.Jonathan Fortun, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, says although gold is ascendant, and crypto could come next, few assets are yet to rival the dollar.“I don’t think the dethroning of the dollar would be the main concern if we arrived to the stage where we were to be bartering in gold. That would be a second round effect – we’d have many other issues.”Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesEconomicsDollarEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In June last year, Kim Kardashian disembarked from a water taxi here and navigated its planks during thefive-day weddingof the billionaire Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, and Lauren Sánchez, a former TV journalist.The reality TV star was among the scores of celebrities and members of the world’s super-rich who had descended on the city to celebrate the nuptials, which included everything from pyjama parties to elegant dinners, and provoked widespread protests by anti-Bezos campaigners who threatened to disrupt the festivities by letting loose a convoy of inflatable crocodiles into the city’s canals.View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos leaving the Aman Venice hotel on 29 June 2025.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersThe event, which the Italian press called “the wedding of the century”, brought in about €957.3m to the local economy, according to estimates from Italy’s tourism ministry, the bulk of which is believed to have been derived from the huge hubbub created by the world’s media as it captured all the friction and frivolity.More than six months on, the fascination with the Bezos shindig shows no signs of waning as rising numbers of visitors seek peeks of the various places frequented by the bride, groom and their glitterati guests.Gone are the days when the top requests for Scomparin – a guide esteemed for his insight and intimate knowledge of Venice’s history, culture and traditions – involved visits to St Mark’s Square, the Doge’s Palace or the Rialto Bridge.Now his customers want to be taken off the beaten track, away from the crowds and, increasingly so since June, “they want to see where the Bezoses got married and where the celebrities ended up”, he said. “They saw all the media attention and now they are curious to see what these places are really like.”View image in fullscreenVenice tour guide Igor Scomparin shows tourists ‘goti de fornasa’ drinking glasses, which were among the gifts given to the Bezos wedding guests.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianA recent Bezos wedding tour began with a stroll along a street filled with designer boutiques where Ivanka Trump shopped, before the group stopped opposite the seven-star Aman hotel, famous for its frescoes by the Venetian master Giambattista Tiepolo, where the bride and groom stayed.“This whole area was full of paparazzi,” Scomparin said as he pointed towards the hotel. “People mostly want to know how much it costs. When I tell them prices start from about €3,500 a night for a basic room, they are not so much shocked, just interested to know about that kind of lifestyle.”Scomparin’s clients, mostly from the US, want to see San Giorgio island, where the couple exchanged vows, and the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, the majestic 16th-century building in the city centre where they had hoped to wed before the plan was scuppered by the threatened crocodile stunt. Then there is the Arsenale, a former medieval shipyard in an eastern district of the city where the afterparty was held.Alongside the key wedding locations there is high demand for rides on the wooden taxi boats that transported celebrities, among them Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as for visits to the piazzas where celebrities were spotted or where they took selfies, not to mention the now famous “Kardashian jetty”.View image in fullscreenBoats carrying Bezos and photographers travel past St Mark’s Square.Photograph: Luigi Costantini/AP“Teenagers especially tell me they saw the photos on Instagram of her arriving and want to go to that spot,” Scomparin said. “But when they see it they are a little disappointed because it’s not as chic as it looked. It’s just a regular, everyday jetty that locals use to get on and off boats.”People have been snapping up the two main gifts received by the wedding guests: Friuliane, the velvet shoes typically worn by gondoliers, and goti de fornasa drinking glasses, traditionally made on the island of Murano.An often impromptu bonus to Scomparin’s tours is if his customers get to see packages emblazoned with the Amazon brand whizzing along Venice’s canals as they are being delivered to their recipients.George and Amal Clooney got married in Venicein 2014, and three years before that elephants were brought to the city for a lavish Bollywood wedding. But neither attracted as much intrigue – or indignation – as the Bezos one. The protests were organised by various groups, from those fighting overtourism who accused local authorities of being hellbent on turning Venice into a playground for the rich, to climate activists and people appalled by Bezos’s support for Donald Trump.View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney and Amal Alamuddin on the way to their civil wedding in Venice in 2014.Photograph: Robino Salvatore/GC ImagesThe protests were noisy but marginal to the occasion, which took place without any issues, according to Michael Zennaro, a wedding photographer. “It was an opportunity to show off Venice across the world and to show that weddings can take place here – away from the crowds, in more private settings,” he said.Marigiulia Sella, a wedding planner, said there had been an increase in enquiries for high-end weddings. “Very often they want experiences that span multiple days. One of the beautiful things about Venice is that you are in a unique city with high-end historic venues that offer so much, as well as a lot of privacy.”View image in fullscreenScomparin points towards San Giorgio island, where the couple exchanged vows.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianDuring his Bezos tours, Scomparin provides plenty of interesting snippets about other aspects of Venice, including an abandoned building that nobody wants to buy because it is believed to be cursed.But one thing he does not know is what became of the designer dress – one of 27 that Sánchez packed for the event – that was laterreported missing. “That one is still a mystery,” he said.Explore more on these topicsVeniceItalyJeff BezosWeddingsEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many question his level of popular support, even though his name has been chanted at some protests.Calling on the west to help unseat Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, Pahlavi said on Friday that the regime was nevertheless doomed to collapse with or without such assistance.3:05Reza Pahlavi: is the last shah's son a viable opposition leader for Iran? – video explainer“The Iranian people are taking decisive actions on the ground, it is now time for the international community to join them fully,” he told reporters at a news conference in Washington.He said foreign involvement did not require “boots on the ground” but instead “targeted intervention” that could weaken the regime’s repressive apparatus, such as targeting the leadership of the Revolutionary Guards.“What they need from the world is resolute, targeted support to protect lives, amplify their voices and hasten the collapse that is already on the way,” he said. “But let me be clear, with or without the world’s help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner, and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.”Pahlavi said 12,000 protesters had been killed over 48 hours as security forces conducted a bloody crackdown against demonstrations that have swept the country since 28 December. Human rights groups have confirmed lower figures but still put the death toll in thousands.Donald Trump had vowed that “help is on the way” if the regime continued to kill protesters, or carried out executions of those detained. But he retreated afterwarnings from the US’s Middle East alliesthat military intervention could trigger regional instability. Posting on his Truth Social network on Friday, Trump thanked the regime for allegedly cancelling a wave of scheduled executions.View image in fullscreenLarge-scale anti-government protests have been carried out across Iran since late last year.Photograph: AP“I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!” he wrote.Pahlavi spoke out after protesters chanted his name and “long live the shah” at recent protests – an ironic development given that the monarchical regime of his father, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown after months of similar mass demonstrations and complaints of torture and human rights abuses.He avoided giving a clear answer when asked by the Guardian if he intended to re-establish a monarchy, but said he had a “comprehensive plan for an orderly transition, which is ready to be implemented immediately”. It would include referendums to establish the form of a successor government, but he refused to rule out a monarchical restoration.“I am uniquely positioned to ensure a stable transition,” he said “That’s the verdict delivered loudly and clearly by the people in the face of bullets.”He claimed “large segments” of the security forces had already refused to fire on the population and “whispered their loyalty to me”.He referred to “the bond between me and the Iranian people” – a phrase redolent of his father’s rhetoric – and said: “It’s been with me since birth, and it cannot be broken, even in exile.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

He also demanded the return of the remains of the final Israeli captive still believed to be held by the group, sharpening tensions at a fragile moment in the truce process.“Hamas must IMMEDIATELY honor its commitments, including the return of the final body to Israel, and proceed without delay to full Demilitarization,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “As I have said before, they can do this the easy way, or the hard way.”No agreement has yet been reached on the disarmament of Hamas, which remains one of the most contentious elements of the second phase of the ceasefire, alongside the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and the easing of restrictions to allow significantly more humanitarian aid intoGaza– measures that Israel has yet to fully implement.Hamas has so far refused to give up its arms.Trump has said that Hamas would be stripped of its weapons and its vast tunnel network would be dismantled with the backing of Egypt, Turkey and Qatar. However, it is unclear how such an objective could realistically be enforced.According to the plan, Hamas would give up its heavy weapons completely. As for smaller weapons, the US is considering launching a “buy-back” programme where rifles, pistols and machine guns will be handed over by the owners in exchange for money.View image in fullscreenHamas militants escort members of the Red Cross in Gaza City in November. The US is considering a ‘buy-back’ programme for small weapons.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersThe focus of the second phase has shifted from simply stopping the fighting to establishing transitional governance, demilitarisation, and reconstruction in the territory – a dramatic escalation of diplomatic ambition amid persistent violencefrom the Israeli military.At least 451 Palestinians have been reportedly killed since the ceasefire took effect in October last year.Trump has announced he will chair what is being called a “board of peace” to govern Gaza, tasked with supervising reconstruction, economic recovery, and the broader transition process across Gaza. The former UK prime minister Tony Blair is reportedly expected to join a separate executive board alongside Trump’s advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, with Nickolay Mladenov, a former UN Middle East envoy, playing a central on-the-ground role.The board will oversee a 15-member Palestinian committee that has been formed to supervise Gaza’s civil administration during the transition.Formally known as the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), it is meant to be apolitical and staffed by technocrats and experts rather than political factions. Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority, has been appointed to lead the group.Israel’s war in Gaza has created a “human-made abyss”, and reconstruction is likely to cost more than $70bn (£53bn) over several decades, the UN has said.View image in fullscreenTents housing displaced people in Gaza City.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockAfter visiting Gaza on Thursday, Jorge Moreira da Silva, a UN undersecretary general and executive director of its office for project services, said “the level of destruction is overwhelming”.“Homes, schools, clinics, roads, water, and electricity systems have been levelled or severely damaged,” he added. “Gaza has more than 60m tonnes of rubble: the capacity of nearly 3,000 container ships. On average every person in Gaza today is surrounded by 30 tonnes of rubble. It is likely to take overseven yearsto clear this rubble. I welcome the announcement of the second phase of the plan, this must finally mean the beginning of reconstruction. But meanwhile, early recovery must start right away including to restore access to basic services.”On Thursday, medical sources at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said six Palestinians were killed and others wounded in two Israeli airstrikes.Life in the territory remains precarious. While airstrikes and gunfire have slowed, they have not ceased. At the same time, recent storms have compounded the crisis, causing deaths and flooding in displacement camps already stretched beyond their limits.Strong winter winds caused walls to collapse on to flimsy tents housing displaced Palestinians on Tuesday, killing at least four people.The UN Children’s Fund (Unicef) said on Tuesday that 100 children had been killed since the beginning of the ceasefire in October, including six who died of hypothermia.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasPalestineDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The film won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival last year and is a leading contender for the 2026 Oscars in the international feature category.Part revenge thriller, part black comedy, the French entry for the Academy award follows a group of Iranian former political prisoners who try to decide on whether to exact revenge on a man they believe to have tortured them in prison.“What I have been depicting in this film is when the cycle of violence continues, then it becomes very difficult to stop it,” Panahi said. “Unfortunately, because of the savagery that is being carried out by the state, the fear is that this cycle of violence will continue.”It Was Just an Accident review – Jafar Panahi takes us on a nightmare trip into a land of bribes and brutalityRead moreIn December the director was handed a one-year prison sentence in absentia on charges of creating propaganda against the political system, but he has stated his intention to return to the country.He has been jailed twice, for protesting against the detention of two fellow film-makers who had been critical of the authorities in 2022, and for supporting anti-government protests in 2010.Panahi said while the collapse of the government led by the clerical leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was inevitable after the latest bloody suppressions, its timing was impossible to predict.“The regime will collapse, 100%,” Panahi said. “It is what has happened to dictatorship governments throughout history. When it will collapse, no one knows. We want it to be as soon as possible, in the next few minutes, but there are many factors that have to come together for it to happen.”View image in fullscreenIranian police officers stand guard at a protest in Tehran.Photograph: Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu/Getty ImagesHe warned western governments about engaging with the clerical regime as rational actors. “In other dictatorships around the world, you will see that there will be at least a few people who will act based on rationality and who will not let it get to this point,” he said, speaking via his interpreter Sheida Dayani. “But unfortunately in this system there is no rationality. All they can think of is crackdown and how they can stay in power even just one more day. The last thing they’re thinking about is the people.”Some anti-regime protests, in Iran and among the Iranian diaspora in Europe and the US, have called for the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah. The Washington-based Pahlavi, whose late father ruled Iran as an autocratic monarch from 1941 to 1979, has called for people to take to the streets.Panahi recognised that calls for the son of the shah’s return were “the voice that is coming out [of the protests] indeed”. However, he added: “As Reza Pahlavi as said himself, after the transition there must be a referendum in Iran, and that is when people will decide what type of government they want and whom they want to rule over them. During this period of transition, we should all be united.”Asked whether Pahlavi could be trusted to oversee a post-regime transition, he said this would be for the people of Iran to conclude. “Whether we agree with Pahlavi or not, we know that the overwhelming majority of the population of Iran want the current regime to go.”Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiJafar PanahiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Intelligence assessments had indicated that the US was preparing to strike Iran, a move Trump had threatened if Iran’s government killed protesters.But on Wednesday night Trumpappeared to walk backfrom the brink of a military intervention, telling reporters that Iranian authorities were halting executions.“We’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping – it’s stopped – it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution, or execution – so I’ve been told that on good authority,” Trump said.The White House later claimed that 800 executions scheduled in Iran had been halted. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump and his team had warned that there would be “grave consequences” if killings continued. “The president understands today that 800 executions that were scheduled and supposed to take place yesterday, were halted,” she said.But Trump continues closely watching the situation, she said. “All options remain on the table for the president,” Leavitt said.The US ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, echoed those sentiments at a meeting of the UN security council on Thursday night, saying the US stands by the “brave people of Iran” and Trump “has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter”.Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the UN, blasted the US for what he claimed was its “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence”.“Under the hollow pretext of concern for the Iranian people and claims of support for human rights, the United States is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilisation and military intervention under a so-called ‘humanitarian’ narrative,” Darzi said.Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, accused the US of convening the meeting in a bid to “justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state”. Russia defended Iran’s actions, the only member of the council to do so.France’s UN ambassador, Jérôme Bonnafont, called for the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained and the suspension of the death penalty, while Britain’s deputy ambassador, Archibald Young,said“Iran must urgently change course” and respect the fundamental rights of Iranians, “including the right to protest without fear of violence or repression”.At least 2,637people have been killed in the protests, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.Among them was an Iranian Red Crescent staffer who the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said was killed in northern Iran on Saturday. Five other Red Crescent staffers were wounded, prompting the organisation to call for the protection of humanitarian workers.1:02Protesters face police across Iran – video reportIt is understood Trump reviewed the full range of options to strike Iran but was unconvinced that any single action would lead to decisive change.Trump has pulled off misleading feints with Iran in the past. In June, he suggested US officials were fully engaged in negotiations with their Iranian counterparts over its nuclear programme, when in reality he was preparing the strikes for the 12-day war last summer.Iranian authorities also toned down their rhetoric on Wednesday, after a week of threatening retaliatory strikes against the US, with the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, urging the US to engage in negotiations. Araghchi added that the authorities had no plan to hang people, Iranian state media reported on Thursday.View image in fullscreenErfan Soltani was the first Iranian protester sentenced to death amid the current unrest.Photograph: Facebook/ReutersIranian state media claimed that 26-year-oldErfan Soltani, the first protester sentenced to death, would not be executed. Soltani had been scheduled to be put to death on Wednesday and had become a symbol for the repression of protesters in Iran around the world.Despite Trump’s comments that the killing would stop, Iranian authorities have continued to go after protesters. Iranian media trumpeted the arrest of protesters it labelled “terrorists”, while the internet shutdown entered its seventh day – surpassing communication blackouts during previous protest movements.Authorities were reportedly searching for Starlink satellite dishes, posting pictures of shipments of the devices they said they had seized, cracking down on one of the only ways to communicate with the outside world.Rights groups expressed concerns about forced confessions among arrested protesters, as state media showed the hardliner chief justice, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, personally questioning detainees. Ejei, who has been placed under sanctions by the US and EU, is accused by opposition groups of being involved in the 1988 mass execution of political prisoners.I know the terrible cost of speaking out in Iran – and I beg the world to stand with those speaking out now | Nasrin ParvazRead moreFootage broadcast on Thursday showed Ejei interrogating women, one of whom stood accused of sending a message to the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Another woman, accused of dropping concrete blocks on security forces, said as Ejei interrogated her: “I don’t know what happened, why I did something so foolish.”From the very beginning, state media have broadcast footage of such confessions, as authorities attempt to cast the protests as a foreign-instigated movement to destabilise Iran.The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said: “Confessions that were obtained under coercion and torture being aired prior to legal proceedings violate the right of defendants to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.”Protests started on 28 December after a sudden slide in the value of the country’s currency, and quickly expanded to demands for political reform and even an end to the Iranian regime. The protest movement spread to all 31 provinces. It is the most serious bout of unrest the government has faced in decades.Iran’s president,Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Thursday that the government was trying to ameliorate living conditions in the country and address the issues that sparked the protests. He vowed to target corruption and price gouging, which he expected would improve Iranians’ purchasing power.View image in fullscreenMasoud Pezeshkian has vowed to target corruption and price gouging.Photograph: Iranian Presidency/Zuma Press/ShutterstockIran’s national currency has lost two-thirds of its value over the past three years while the price of basic goods has soared, with food prices increasing by 72% since last year.Analysts have said that while the protests point to underlying systemic issues in Iran that will be problematic for the Iranian regime in the long term, state collapse is unlikely. The concern was echoed by Israeli and Arab officials, who told the US administration in recent days that the Iranian regime was not yet weak enough for American strikes to topple it, NBCreported on Tuesday.Trump waslobbied hard by leaders in the Middle Eastnot to go ahead with strikes that would have been certain to lead to an Iranian counterstrikes on US bases across the region.On social media, some Iranians expressed disappointment with Trump’s seeming about-face on military intervention. An AI photo of Trump pulling off a mask to reveal the former US president Barack Obama, whom Iran’s diaspora depicted as soft on Iran, was widely shared.Foreign ministers from the G7 said they were “prepared to impose additional restrictive measures” on Iran over its handling of the protests and the “deliberate use of violence, the killing of protesters, arbitrary detention and intimidation tactics”.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

My message to millions of people in the country who stuck with the Conservative party, often with gritted teeth … if you want to get rid of this Labour government and have a strong reforming government to fix the country, there’s frankly only one way to do that.”In her own interviews during a visit to Scotland, Badenoch was equally blunt about her former shadow cabinet colleague and his new party. Asked if she could commit to the Conservatives going into the next election as a solo force, she said: “Yes. How do you do a deal with liars?”‘Enough already’: Jenrick’s defection gets mixed reception from Reform membersRead moreOn Jenrick, Badenoch said: “You can’t believe a word that comes out of his mouth. This is a man who was asked yesterday morning: ‘Are you going to defect?’ And he said ‘never’ to the chief whip.”She added: “People from Reform and other Conservative party members have been bringing stuff to me about the actions he had been doing to undermine the party, and I kept giving him a chance. So I’m just glad that Nigel Farage is doing my spring cleaning for me. He’s taking away my problems.”Badenoch urged any Tory MPs considering a similar move to act quickly: “If they’re people who do not belong in our party, who think that it’s all a game and that people’s lives are a game, they just want all this psychodrama, then yes, they should go. We don’t want people like that in the Conservative party.”Jenrick has urged other rightwingers to follow his example, writing in the Telegraph on Friday: “If you’re not already onboard, join the movement. The future of the country is on the line.”He told the BBC, however, that he did not know of any other imminent high-profile defections.Some Conservative MPs said Jenrick’s brutal defenestration by Badenoch was likely to have made others more wary, and that the party was determined to unite. “It was all about Robert and his ambition, and he needed to grow up,” one said. “Everyone is sick of this crap.”Speaking to Sky News, Nick Timothy, who has been given Jenrick’s job as shadow justice secretary, said voters would not welcome his former colleague’s move.“The country is absolutely sick of the backbiting, the backstabbing and, frankly, the lack of seriousness with which lots of politicians have taken the very serious and significant challenges that the country faces,” he said.Explore more on these topicsConservativesKemi BadenochRobert JenrickReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Downing Street made it clear Keir Starmer had lost confidence and fellow chiefs told him his clinging to office risked damaging the police’s reputation nationally.It also became clear to Guildford, who had a £220,000-a-year salary and will retire on a full pension, that the row would be a distraction for months. One senior policing source had described him after the report as a “dead man walking”.The deal for his departure was done on Friday with Foster agreeing to the decision, which crucially meant a potential legal battle would be avoided.The force had advised Birmingham’s safety advisory group in October thatMaccabi Tel Avivfans were too dangerous to be allowed to attend a 6 November Europa League game against Aston Villa.Bit by bit the intelligence case unravelled, but sources told the Guardian that the ousted chief constable still believed the decision had been “made on good grounds, and kept everyone safe”.The report by Andy Cooke, the chief inspector of constabulary, attacked the force’s credibility in trying to justify the ban, and the home secretary is expected to use a police reform white paper due out by 28 January to give herself power to sack chiefs she deems to be failing.Mahmood, having claimed a scalp demanded by the right as well as significant figures in her party, said:“The findings of the chief inspector were damning. They set out a catalogue of failings that have harmed trust in West Midlands police.“By stepping down, Craig Guildford has done the right thing today. I would like to acknowledge his years of service. And I pay tribute to the work of the officers in West Midlands police who keep their community safe every day. Today marks a crucial first step to rebuilding trust and confidence in the force amongst all the communities they serve.”Guildford, a police officer for 32 years, has been chief of the West Midlands force since 2022 and boosted its crime-fighting and service to the public. He said: “I have come to the conclusion that the political and media frenzy around myself and my position has become detrimental to all the great work undertaken by my officers and staff in serving communities across the West Midlands.“I have carefully considered my position and concluded that retirement is in the best interests of the organisation, myself and my family. With the force’s dedicated and hard-working workforce, together we have turned this force around.”Foster said Guildford’s retirement, first revealed by the Guardian, meant he had “acted with honour and in the best interests of West Midlands police and our region. I welcome his decision.”“I am pleased this outcome has been reached having regard to due process and the law,” added Foster, who had faced criticism from some for not immediately sacking Guildford after the scathing report. “That has prevented what might otherwise have been a complex procedure that would have caused significant distraction, impact and cost to West Midlands police and the wider West Midlands.”Foster will now have to find a new chief constable for the Birmingham-headquartered force. Scott Green, the force’s deputy chief constable, will step into the role temporarily.Senior sources accept there is a shortage of capable police leaders.Central to West Midlands police’s defence as they planned for the Birmingham game was information from Dutch police. The force said this intelligence led it to believe Maccabi fans had been perpetrators of violence during a match against Ajax in Amsterdam in November 2024.But Dutch police disputed this claim, saying the cause of trouble before the Amsterdam game was much more mixed, with Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian supporters provoking one another. Cooke’s report found that West Midlands police had “greatly exaggerated” the problems in Amsterdam.Police intelligence emerged showing Guildford’s force had been told some locals might arm themselves if Israeli fans turned up, which led to claims the ban amounted to caving in to antisemitism. News of it emerged a fortnight after a terrorist attack left two dead at a synagogue in Manchester.Guildford testified twice before MPs on the home affairs committee, with each appearance prompting further criticism. In the first hearing, he admitted part of a force dossier contained a reference to a Maccabi game against West Ham that never happened, and it had been gathered erroneously using artificial intelligence. The report from MPs is expected to be more savage than Cooke’s.Two of the most prominent Jewish groups, Campaign Against Antisemitism and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, backed Guildford’s departure, and the latter said it would work with Guildford’s successor “to restore confidence”.The independent Birmingham MP Ayoub Khan said: “Today an honourable man of integrity has been ruthlessly scapegoated and discarded in favour of appeasing hooligans and the very violence his actions prevented. This was not accountability, it was a witch-hunt.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceWest MidlandsBirminghamShabana MahmoodAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Karos was born in Poland and raised in Italy, where her family still lived.He said: “I just want people to understand that Martina was a great person and just got stuck in a terrible place.”Peter Sigee, the area coroner for Greater Manchester West, concluding the four-day inquest into the deaths of the mother and daughter, said Karos had killed herself and Eleni was unlawfully killed by her mother.He said: “Ms Karos had deliberately placed herself and her daughter in an environment where they were overcome by the toxic effects of carbon monoxide with the intention and effect of ending both their lives.“Despite a high level of good-quality, focused support and care from family, her limited group of friends and professionals, including GP, specialised mental health services, social workers and carers, Ms Karos experienced feelings of extreme loneliness and isolation which overwhelmed her.“Ms Karos decided to end her life by suicide.”Sigee said Karos denied any thoughts of harming herself or Eleni and there was no “objective basis” to suspect she would do so, adding: “This tragic incident could not reasonably have been foreseen.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Watch any reality TV show and it won’t be long before you hear the lead presenter talking about how each contestant has been on a journey. It’s as though we can’t survive without a narrative structure. An attempt to give emotional meaning to something fundamentally meaningless.It feels as if everyone has to be on a journey now. If you’re not, then you’re somehow less interesting. Only half a person. Even our politicians are no longer exempt. In the last 24 hours there have been any number of talking heads lining up to tell us that Robert Jenrick has been on quite the journey. His former Tory colleagues.His new tribe at Reform. Even Honest Bob likes to talk about his journey. Makes him feel special and different. Important.But what sort of journey has Jenrick really been on? Some of the externals may have changed, but the core has always remained the same – once an annoying, self-centred, man-child halfwit, always an annoying, self-centred, man-child halfwit. A politician whose eye has always been on his own ambition. The main chance. No more, no less.To recap. Back in 2014, when Honest Bob was first elected as MP for Newark, he was a wishy-washy Cameroon. Because that’s what he thought you needed to be to get on in the Tory party. He was a faithful remainer when he thought that was the winning side, and then became a committed Brexiteer in a heartbeat after the vote. Without even an attempt to hide the shamelessness.Then came his populist phase. No foreigner went unscathed. Especially all those brown and black faces in Birmingham. Because that’s where he thought the votes were. Everything he’s ever done has been to advance his career.If Jenrick has been on a journey, it’s been a circular one. The man with no qualities. No values. No beliefs. Just a needy homunculus for hire. Hitching his wagon to the highest bidder.On Friday he wasout and about, doing his best grift. Giving an exclusive interview to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg in which he tried to gloss things over. To put the best spin on how he was bounced into defecting to Reform the day before. He had always been planning to do this, he said. There had been many conversations with Nigel Farage. His mind had been made up since Christmas. Really? That’s odd. Because when the Tory chief whip had asked him if he was planning to defect he had replied: “Of course not. Nothing could be further from my mind. Wherever did you get that idea from?”Laura K sounded unsurprisingly sceptical. How on earth could anyone trust him again? Hurt face from Jenrick. Slapped puppy eyes. No one does this sort of thing lightly, he insisted. And really he had always intended to tell Kemi he was planning to defect, but somehow it was never the right time. If he had a fault it was that he was too kind. He didn’t want to disappoint his party leader because he knew how much she valued and trusted him. Yes, the actual defection itself had been a bit rushed, but it was all for the best in the end. Wasn’t it?Mystic Nigel has seen the future: a country run by his cabinet of taxidermied Tories | Marina HydeRead moreAnd when you came to think about it, he was really the most trustworthy of all the Tories. His honesty wasn’t in doubt. Because when Richard “Dirty” Desmond, the Tory donor and pornographer, had asked him to rush through a planning application to save him £45m, he had been only too happy to oblige. At least Honest Bob had been open about there being a “real possibility of bias”. Which was a form of honesty. Other Tory cabinet colleagues had pretended to have the country’s best interests at heart. He had never made that claim.Hmm. The Tories had broken Britain. Only Honest Bob was brave enough to say this. Every other Conservative was in denial. Maybe if there had been more people like him, things would have turned out brilliantly. He didn’t want to boast, but he had been exceptional in all the ministerial roles he had ever taken. If only the same could be said of all the other Tories. The country wouldn’t forgive them. Though obviously they should forgive him. Because he was King Baby.A byelection would be in no one’s best interests, he went on. Byelections were for the little people. And no one in his constituency wanted one. Apart from all the many thousands who considered his defection a major betrayal and had called for a byelection. Look me in the eyes, Laura. Laura looked. I am going to continue to represent Newark to the best of my ability. He had a pothole repaired in his own drive. What more could anyone ask for?Laura moved on to his relationship with Farage. Honest Bob had said Nige was unfit to run a school or hospital. Nige had called Honest Bob a liar and a fraud. So how was that going to work? Jenrick simpered. It was the tactics of a pickup artist. To neg the person you are in love with. The reason they had trash-talked each other was because they adored each other. They had a desperate attraction. Couldn’t get enough of each other. Loved each other’s casual racism. And yes there were one or two things they didn’t necessarily see eye to eye on. But Honest Bob could come round. Easy when you don’t believe in anything.Let this be a unifying moment, said Jenrick. Having just split the right down the middle. He hoped some of his former colleagues might join him in rallying around Nige. Though almost certainly not his former party leader. Kemi Badenoch had given her own interview in which she couldn’t have sounded more thrilled tosee the back of Honest Bob. A brave face, maybe. Some might have been asking why she hadn’t sacked him sooner. After all, Jenrick has always been hiding in plain sight.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickThe politics sketchReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Losing a senior shadow minister is not ideal. But given those basic facts, the day could hardly have gone better.”Badenoch set the agenda in pre-empting Jenrick’s likely defection by sacking him as shadow justice minister and stripping him of the Tory whip, leaving the Newark MP andReform UKto play catchup with a late afternoon press conference.At that event there were slightly farcical scenes as Jenrick initially failed to appear whenNigel Farageannounced him. Tory sources say they believe this was because they had just tweeted extracts of his defection speech, obtained by Badenoch’s office, leaving Jenrick making frantic last-minute changes to the address.“[Thursday] was really brutal and should give anyone else pause for thought,” another shadow minister said. “It cemented Kemi’s position as a robust leader, but it also showed that members – and probably the country – don’t like traitors. Kemi was right when she said he’s Nigel’s problem now. When I’ve talked to members, the phrase ‘good riddance’ has come up a lot. He’s not been helpful for a while.”Another MP was more brutal still: “Nobody cares about this. The internal WhatsApp groups are almost silent.”The big question for Badenoch and for Farage is whether any more sitting Tory MPs follow Jenrick before Reform’s self-imposed May deadline for defections. One of the most commonly cited names tipped to also make the move has insisted they are staying put, and others say Jenrick spent recent months more focused on his own profile than building a team of allies.The MP linked with Reform said not only were they staying put but they did not expect others to defect. “My sense is not,” they said. “I think it has really solidified people in the other direction. What Robert did looks really blatant and cunning. People really hate that. And the personal attacks on colleagues were really classless.”Another MP said: “Reform are the main challengers in my constituency, so there is an appeal. But polling can change, and why annoy so many people? As one of the remaining Conservative MPs, it’s a privilege to help rebuild the party. And anyway, who wants to be in the same club asAndrea Jenkyns?”Others are less certain. “These things are always difficult to predict,” a shadow minister said. “There are people who clearly thought that Jenrick should be leader. They are going to have to figure out how to be a team player – or go.”While polling can change, Badenoch’s biggest problem is that for the most part it is not changing very much. The YouGov tracker of voting intentions shows Tory support has risen recently to about 20% after months of languishing at closer to 16% or 17%.Badenoch’s standing with her MPs and, to an extent, ordinary Tory members has arguably risen more steeply since a generally well-receivedConservative conference speechin October and a blistering response to Rachel Reeves’ budget the following month.“At least 40 people have, separately, mentioned the budget speech to me,” one Conservative MP said. “It’s amazing how little infighting there is. We’re all focused on getting [Keir] Starmer out.”This might be true for now but even though a poor showing in May’s Scottish, Welsh and English local elections is factored into calculations about Badenoch’s future, a result on current polling levels could be seen as sufficiently disastrous to change some minds.For now, quite a few Tory MPs are simply enjoying Jenrick’s departure. He had been in talks with Reform for months but nothing had been decided until Badenoch forced his hand.“It’s all so messy,” one said. “His departure is like some sort of horrible arranged marriage, carried out simply to spite one side of the family.”Explore more on these topicsConservativesKemi BadenochRobert JenrickReform UKNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

Trump himself will serve as chair, with further appointments expected in the coming weeks.“Each executive board member will oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization,”a White House statement said.“The United States remains fully committed to supporting this transitional framework, working in close partnership with Israel, key Arab nations, and the international community.”Blair’s inclusion is likely to prove contentious in the region. The former Labour leader remains a divisive figure in the Middle East for his role in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.Soon after leaving office in 2007 he became special representative of the Quartet, a group composed of the US, EU, Russia and the UN seeking peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But he became seen as too close to the Israelisand stepped down in 2015.Acknowledging that Blair remains a divisive figure, Trumpconcededlast October: “I’ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he’s an acceptable choice to everybody.”The president also appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisers to the board to oversee “day-to-day strategy and operations”.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN envoy to the Middle East, will serve as the High Representative for Gaza.The list was made public a day after Trumpannouncedthe formation of the “board of peace” as part of phase two of the US-brokered plan to end the conflict in Gaza. Characteristically effusive, the president described it as the “Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place”.Its creation follows the formation of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee tasked with running day-to-day affairs in post-warGaza. The body will be headed by Ali Sha’ath, a Gaza native and former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority.The White House said: “Dr Sha’ath brings deep experience in public administration, economic development, and international engagement, and is widely respected for his pragmatic, technocratic leadership and understanding of Gaza’s institutional realities.”Trump has also appointed the former head of US special forces, Maj Gen Jasper Jeffers, to lead an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which is to oversee security across the territory.The US-backed peace plan, launched on 10 October, brought about the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas and a cessation of fighting between Israel and the militant group.The second phaseis now in motion, though reports of aid shortages and sporadic violence continue to cast a shadow over the process.Since the ceasefire, Israel has also demolishedthousands of structuresthat survived the war, including homes and greenhouses, in the part of Gaza is still controls.Hamas has yet to publicly commit to full disarmament – a key Israeli demand and one of the most contentious elements of the longer-term settlement.Rosa DeLauro, a Democratic congresswoman, said on Friday: “The success of phase two of the ceasefire in Gaza depends on full implementation of phase one, which is still lacking in several key areas, including delivery of humanitarian aid, cessation of Israeli military strikes, and the return of the final deceased hostage held by Hamas, Ran Gvili … The war must finally end before the peace can be built.”Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver, suggested that the board’s name was undermined by Trump’s bellicose actions. “I hope he can find time to attend Board of Peace meetings between meetings about invasions of Venezuela, Iran, Greenland, Canada, and Minneapolis,” Masketobservedon social media.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyGazaDonald TrumpMarco RubioTony BlairJared KushnernewsShareReuse this content"

I think he’s laid the markers down.“He’s told Denmark what he’s looking for, and now it’s a matter of having Secretary Rubio and Vice-President JD Vance make a deal.”Denmark announced it had agreed to provide support to help Greenland’s emergency preparedness.Torsten Schack Pedersen, Denmark’s minister for public safety and emergency preparedness, said: “It is important that we stand together.”Peter Borg, Greenland’s minister for fisheries, hunting, agriculture, self-sufficiency and environment, said his government “appreciates the support from Denmark to strengthen preparedness in Greenland”.This week, Greenlanders living in the capital, Nuuk, said they were so afraid of the threat from the US that they werewatching the skies and seas themselves. In the absence of emergency preparedness support from authorities, many said they had been left to work out their own plans on what to do in the case of emergency evacuation or capture by US forces.2:37What do people in Greenland think of Trump’s threats? – videoDuring the congressional visit to Denmark, for which the Greenlandic flag, Erfalasorput, was flown at Christiansborg Palace, the US lawmakers were due to meet other Danish and Greenlandic politicians as well as Frederiksen and Nielsen.Arriving at a lunch meeting at the Confederation of Danish Industry, the Democrat Steny Hoyer told TV 2: “Keep the faith. You’ve got a lot of people with you.”At a joint press conference, Coons thanked Denmark for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said they had a “strong and robust” dialogue about how to continue their relationship into the future.“There’s a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of reality” in Washington, he said, in discussions about Greenland. He added that they were hoping to use information from the visit to try to “lower the temperature” and have a “constructive dialogue” at home.Murkowski said the majority of Americans did not want a US takeover of Greenland, adding: “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset.”After Wednesday’s closely watchedhigh-stakes meetingbetween the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the US vice-president, Vance, and the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, the two sides gave starkly contrasting accounts of what was agreed.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Thursday claimed that a delegation from Denmark and Greenland had agreed to “continue to have technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland”.But Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Vivian Motzfeldt, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland respectively, contradicted her claims.Rasmussen said they had not made such an agreement, but had formed a working group to investigate whether it was possible to “accommodate” US security wishes for the Arctic region.Motzfeldt said Leavitt had not been at the meeting, telling the Greenland newspaper Sermitsiaq: “There is a lot of work ahead, the situation is still very uncertain, but we have a new channel, a place where we can talk directly to each other.”On Thursday, Frederiksen said Greenland’s defence was a “common concern” for Nato as international troops started arriving in Greenland from across Europe.A spokesperson for the German defence ministry said on Friday that the reconnaissance mission would assess the viability of deploying Eurofighter jets to the territory.“It is a matter of looking at whether the Arctic is secure and to what extent we can contribute to this together with our Nato partners,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkTrump administrationNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Mock-ups circulated by the company show the ads in a tinted box. They will be served to adult users “when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation”, according to OpenAI’s announcement. Ads will not be shown to users under 18 and will not appear alongside answers related to sensitive topics such as health, mental health or politics. Users will be able to click to learn about why they received a particular ad, according toOpenAI.Previously, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, expressed reluctance to introduce ads to the chatbot: “I kind of hate ads just as an aesthetic choice.” His company has made commitments to spend more than $1tn on infrastructure supporting AI in the coming years. Altman hassaidthat revenues are running at well over $13bn a year.“Maybe there could be ads outside the [large language model] stream that are still really great, but the burden of proof there would have to be very high. And it would have to feel really useful to users and really clear that it was not messing with the model’s output,” Altman said recently. “I think it’d be very hard, we’d have to take a lot of care to get it right. People have a very high degree of trust inChatGPT.”In a blogpost on Friday, OpenAI attempted to reconcile Altman’s distaste for ads with the need for revenue: “Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone. Once we begin testing our first ad formats in the coming weeks and months, we look forward to getting people’s feedback.”The company is also launching ChatGPT Go, which it bills as a low-cost subscription tier, for $8 a month.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTAdvertisingSam AltmanOpenAIAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

About 30 minutes later, the network followed up withanother post, containinga link to an articleby two correspondents that similarly cited “two US officials briefed on his medical condition”.The report, which was not extensively covered by other news organizations, drew an immediate response on social media from critics who questioned the network’s sourcing – and whether it aligned with the Trump administration’s preferred focus.But there was also internal skepticism at the network about the report, according to emails viewed by the Guardian. It was met with “huge internal concern” by some, oneCBSNews staffer said. Others viewed the conversations as standard editorial discussions.Before the original report was published, a medical producer at the network suggested in an email to colleagues that “it would be helpful to ask what type of treatment he received”, and whether the officer received surgery or any other type of procedure.In another email, an executive expressed skepticism about the broad nature of the medical diagnosis, and what it actually entailed. “I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” wrote CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter.“A bruise is internal bleeding. But it can also be something serious,” Reiter continued. “We do know that the ICE agent walked away from the incident – we have that on camera.” (The network’s story noted that “videos from the scene showed Ross walking away after the incident”.)The network’s top editor, Bari Weiss, expressed a high level of interest in the story on an editorial call on Wednesday morning, according to staffers who listened.“There was big internal dissension about the ‘internal bleeding’ report here last night,” the CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said. “It was viewed as a thinly veiled, anonymous leak by [the Trump administration] to someone who’d carry it online.”“Felt to many here like we were carrying water for the admin’s justifying of the shooting to keep our access to our sources,” said a second network staffer, who was also not authorized to comment.In a statement, a CBS News spokesperson said the network “went through its rigorous editorial process and decided it was reportable based on the reporting, the reporters, and the sourcing”.CBS, which labeled its story as an “exclusive”, was not totally alone on the story. The ABC News live blogpublished a two-paragraph updaterepeating the claim and citing “multiple US officials familiar with [Ross’s] medical condition” – but noting that the officials “didn’t provide more details about the medical condition”.Other news organizations, includingNBC Newsandthe New York Times, also made brief mentions of the claim. Fox News,which published a full story, cited a confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin – though it acknowledged that “the extent of the bleeding … was not immediately clear”.The Guardian has not independently confirmed the report.Since Weiss took over as editor-in-chief in early October, the network has faced accusations of favoritism toward the Trump administration. CBS has been controlled since last year by Paramount Skydance, the media conglomerate heavily bankrolled by the tech billionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a friend of the president.On Tuesday, the CBS News anchor Tony Dokoupilscored an exclusive interview with Trump, who claimed he would not have recently been made anchor of the CBS Evening News if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election. When Dokoupil pushed back, Trump conceded that he might have, “but at a lesser salary”.Explore more on these topicsCBSMinnesota ICE shootingMinneapolisnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump had repeatedly threatened legal action.The justice department is now investigating the project, and whether Powell – who accused the administration of targeting him because the Fed has defied Trump’s repeated demands for drastic interest rate cuts – lied to Congress about its scope during testimony last summer.Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for the District of Columbia, has insisted her office takes decisions “based on the merits”. Trump claimed he did not know about the investigation before it was reported.Hassett, chair of Trump’s national economic council – and one of the US president’s top candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair, when his term expires in May – suggested on Friday morning that he believed Powell had told the truth about the renovation.In an interview with the Fox Business Network, Hassett said that he wished the Fed had been “more transparent” when it comes to Powell’s congressional testimony about the ongoing renovations to the central bank that are at the heart of the investigation.“All corners of government – the Fed, the White House, everything – we have a responsibility to the American people to be transparent,” said Hassett. “And I think that, if I were Fed chair, that I would insist on transparency. I probably would’ve answered the questions right away.“But the bottom line is, I expect – Jay’s a good man – I expect that there’s nothing to see here, that the cost overruns were related to things like asbestos, as he says. But I sure wish that they had been more transparent.”Every living former Fed chaircondemned the investigation this week, warning that similar prosecutorial attacks in other countries had led to “highly negative consequences” for the cost of living – and argued they had “no place” in the US. Central banks around the world alsoissued a rare joint statementoffering “full solidarity” to Powell.Hassett said that, if offered the job as Fed chair, he would take the job with a commitment to “independence and transparency”.“I think that’s something the Fed could have done better in the past,” he added.Later on Friday morning, at a roundtable event on rural healthcare at the White House, Trump praised Hassett’s earlier performance on cable news. “You were fantastic in television today,” Trump said, adding that he’s reluctant to let Hassett leave his role at the national economic council.“I actually want to keep you where you are if you want to know the truth,” Trump said. “You’ve done incredible. We don’t want to lose him.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS economyFederal ReserveDonald TrumpEconomicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As Washington challenges the US Federal Reserve’s independence, sending jitters through financial markets, the price soared to a record $4,643 (£3,463) an ounce this week, and analysts have tipped it to break $5,000 this year.As Donald Trumpshatters the global rules-based order, official institutions (and private investors) are scrambling to buy gold: the share of the asset in central banks’ reserves has doubled in the past decade to more than a quarter, the highest level in almost 30 years.Although this partly reflects the soaring bullion price, experts say central banks are also stuffing their vaults as an insurance policy in a volatile world. Many are also rushing to repatriate gold stockpiles held overseas, and slashing their exposure to the US dollar.“We have moved from Pax Americana to global discord, geopolitically. It is the law of the jungle when we see what the US are doing,” says Raphaël Gallardo, the chief economist at the asset manager Carmignac.“Investors – private and sovereign – believe their strategic reserves are no longer safe in dollar terms, as they can be confiscated overnight. The dollar is losing the credibility as the nominal anchor of the global monetary system because the Fed is losing credibility, and US Congress is losing its credibility.”View image in fullscreenAs Donald Trump shatters the global rules-based order, the share of gold in central banks’ reserves has doubled in the past decade.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesOfficial reserves are a critical piece in the global monetary puzzle. Underpinning national currencies as a kind of safety fund, they are typically made up of currencies such as the dollar, euro, yen and pound, as well as gold, bonds and International Monetary Fund assets. They are used to help maintain investor confidence, and can be deployed to stabilise exchange rates in times of stress.For much of the past century the dollar has been the primary reserve currency of choice; the grease in the wheels of global finance and the medium of exchange in the majority of world trade.Bitcoin’s buzz is gone. Investors chose real gold in 2025 | Nils PratleyRead moreHistorically, the monetary system pegged currencies to the value of gold – with countries committing to convert paper money to a fixed amount; reflecting millennia of obsession with the precious metal. However, the link for the dollar – and with it other currencies pegged to the US currency under the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement – was severed in theeconomic upheaval of the 1970sby the then US president, Richard Nixon. Since then, exchange rates have floated on international currency markets based on supply and demand.However, the dollar’s status is dwindling; reflecting Trump’s erratic policymaking – including interference at the Fed and the fragile US public finances – as well as Washington’s readiness to deploy economic sanctions. This includes the targeting of Russian central bank reserves after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Still, the dollar is down but not out. From about 66% of total central bank reserves a decade ago, it has slipped to about 57%. Economists say this is because it lacks a clear alternative. Other fiat currencies – such as the pound, euro, yen or yuan – lack global scale. As a consequence, institutions are turning instead to gold – the world’s oldest reliable store of value.View image in fullscreenA currency dealer monitors exchange rates. For much of the past century the dollar has been the primary reserve currency of choice.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesAs a case in point, in June last year – fuelled by the soaring bullion price –gold overtook the euroto become the world’s second-most important reserve asset after the dollar.“There is no one to replace the dollar. So gold is shining by default,” Gallardo says. “People are returning to what [British economist John Maynard] Keynes called the ‘barbarous relic’, as it is nobody’s debt.”According to a survey of 50 central banks by the asset manager Invesco, about half plan to increase their gold allocation. Two-thirds also plan to relocate bullion stockpiles they hold outside their borders back to domestic vaults for safekeeping.“Gold has always been the ultimate safe haven. So in times of political uncertainty and instability you see gold spikes in terms of central banks. It’s a form of protection and a backstop if traditional fiat currencies fail,” says Rod Ringrow, the head of official institutions at Invesco.Gold price tops $4,000 for first time as investors seek safe havenRead more“The last four years have seen this whole concept of the weaponisation of reserves, after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. So central banks have started to look at that and say: ‘If I want gold reserves, am I comfortable with them in-country, or at other depositories?’. We’ve seen a shifting pattern in that regard.”Historically, many central banks have held their gold stockpiles in London, Switzerland and New York – the centres of the global bullion trade, with records of political and economic stability.The Bank of England is the world’s most important hub. Serving about 70 official institutions worldwide, its vaults deep under London’s streets contain about400,000 bars, worth more than half a trillion dollars.The clamour for central banks to repatriate their gold – and the difficulties it can involve – has recently come to the fore: Venezuela hasbars locked-up at the Bank of England worth $2bn, which it cannot access while the UK government refuses to recognise the Caracas regime. Russia has alsothreatened Belgium, where the bulk of Moscow’s frozen foreign-currency reserves are held.Alongside Serbia, governments that have sought to repatriate their gold reserves includeIndia,HungaryandTurkey.Polandhas brought back hundreds of tonnes of gold bars that it transported to London, the US and Canada amid the outbreak of the second world war.View image in fullscreenBank of England vaults, deep under London’s streets, contain about400,000 bars, worth more than half a trillion dollars.Photograph: Bank Of England/ShutterstockIn the 2010s,Germanywas an early pioneer of repatriation, amid political pressure to return thousands of tonnes of bullion from the US and France, where its reserves had been moved to because of fears of a Soviet invasion during the cold war.Economists say the most prominent countries hoarding gold are typically those most exposed to geopolitical tensions. Central bank purchases rose by 10% in the year to September, according to the World Gold Council, led by Poland, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and China.Beijing has been on a buying spree, amassing more than 2,000 tonnes – estimated to rank as the sixth largest in the world – in its attempts to rival Washington. Still, with more than 8,000 tonnes, the US is thought to be the world leader – even though the contents of its Fort Knox vault have not been officially audited since 1953.Other countries have gone in the opposite direction. The UK government was a notable seller during Gordon Brown’s time as the Labour chancellor in the late 1990s and early 2000s – disposing of 401 tonnes of gold out of its 715-tonne holding – at a time when gold prices were historically low.Some economists believe cryptocurrencies could grow in significance to rival traditional currencies and gold as a reserve asset. However, central banks have so far shown caution when it comes to a volatile and nascent market where security concerns remain, and where the most stable assets are still pegged to the value of the dollar or gold anyway.Jonathan Fortun, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, says although gold is ascendant, and crypto could come next, few assets are yet to rival the dollar.“I don’t think the dethroning of the dollar would be the main concern if we arrived to the stage where we were to be bartering in gold. That would be a second round effect – we’d have many other issues.”Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesEconomicsDollarEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The tush push on fourth down that propelled Josh Allen 10 yards andhelped secure Buffalo’s winover Jacksonville last weekend epitomised how the Bills dominated the game’s crucial moments. The Bills converted four of their five third downs with four yards or to go last Sunday, and they finished fifth in third-down rate in the regular season in the same situations. Denver were eighth this season in third-and-short defensive efficiency (50.6%). Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady will have to find ways to create leverage for Allen and the Bills in those vital moments to keep the scoreboard moving.Brilliant, battered and unkillable: Josh Allen lurches towards the Super BowlRead moreWhat the Broncos need to do to win:Copy the Jaguars (except the losing part). If James Cook, this season’s best running back, had been allowed to take off last Sunday, Jacksonville wouldn’t have kept the game so close. Cook’s meagre 46 yards on 15 carries meant the Jags almost pulled off the victory. Buffalo may struggle to establish the ground game even more against the Broncos: they lost their two best run-blocking receivers toACL tears against the Jags, Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers. Not that the Broncos’ rock-solid front needs too much help: they gave away the second-fewest rushing yards per game this season (91). If Allen is forced to throw, Sean Payton’s defense can feast. They have the most sacks and the highest rate of QB takedowns (68 at 9.7%) and allow the second-lowest pass completion rate (57.8%). Former Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib, who won a Super Bowl with Denver, is confident: “They sending Superman home,” he said this week.Key player: Nik Bonitto, edge, Broncos.Bonitto has cemented his status as an elite pass rusher with two brilliant seasons in Denver, earning 13.5 sacks in 2024 and 14 in 2025. He has the power to hustle, harass and help show Allen the door.Prediction:Bills over Broncos.San Francisco 49ers v Seattle Seahawks (Saturday 8pm ET/Sunday 1am GMT)What the 49ers need to do to win:Show no fear. San Francisco rolled into Philadelphia with a litany of injuries and proved that this team are so much more than the sum of their parts. You no longer feel that a key figure such as George Kittle landing on injured reserve with a torn achilles will slow them down. Adversity just keeps knitting them tighter together, so much so that, against the Eagles, journeyman receiver Demarcus Robinson produced his first 100+ receiving yard-game since November 2022. A large part of the 49ers’ fight comes from the ultimate underdog quarterback, Brock Purdy. His never-say-die attitude was crucial as he shook off two interceptions and backed his deep ball over a fierce Eagles secondary. If they bring the same fearless attitude to Seattle they can handle Sam Darnold,who says he will playdespite being listed as questionable with an oblique injury.What the Seahawks need to do to win:With Trent Williams back in at left tackle for the 49ers, the Seahawks will have a fight on their hands after a fairly straightforward 13-3 win over San Francisco in Week 18 of the regular season. A clear path to victory though lies behind punishing the 49ers’ weak run defense. In the Week 18 win, Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet’s combined 171 yards rushing yards were essential to keeping the Seahawks’ offense on the field as they chewed up the clock. The pressure told on Purdy, who had limited time to score while facing Seattle’s formidable defense.Key player: Devon Witherspoon, CB, Seahawks.Witherspoon does everything brilliantly, though you may not always know it as quarterbacks often avoid throwing in his direction. Behind Witherspoon, the Legion of Boom 2.0 conceded the fewest points per game in the regular season (17.2).Prediction:Seahawks over 49ers (all bets are off if Darnold doesn’t play though).Houston Texans v New England Patriots (Sunday 3pm ET/8pm GMT)What the Texans need to do to win:The Texans will expect their defense to make the Patriots suffer. Their offense is less of an asset and lost its best receiver, Nico Collins, to a concussion against Pittsburgh on Monday. Surprisingly, veteran receiver Christian Kirk stepped to lead the Texans to victory after doing next to nothing all season. Kirk made eight grabs for 144 yards and a touchdown and rapidly became Houston’s lone star on offense. In a perfect world, Collins makes it through concussion protocol –although that looks unlikely– if not Kirk needs to continue to do the heavy lifting.What the Patriots need to do to win:Attack Houston’s offensive line. The Patriots knew they had a huge advantage over the Chargers’ wafer-thin pass protection, and they subjected Justin Herbert to six sacks, 16 pressures and 11 hits. The Patriots need to blitz CJ Stroud as much as possible to force the quarterback into mistakes. The Texans’ offensive line had the 22nd-ranked pass block grade from Pro Football Focus this season. After dominating the Chargers, defensive end Milton Williams needs to be relied on once more to make sure the Patriots punch their ticket to the AFC championship game.Key player: Rhamondre Stevenson, RB, Patriots.Stevenson may not own the top spot in New England’s backfield for much longer but he showed how vital his versatility as a runner and receiver is in the win over the Chargers. He had 75 yards on three receptions while accounting for 30% of New England’s total offensive output. He is a workhorse whose all-round abilities will be crucial in trying to outfox Houston’s brutal defense.Prediction:Patriots over Texans.Los Angeles Rams v Chicago Bears (Sunday 6.30pm ET/11.30pm GMT)What the Rams need to do to win:The Bears love a comeback, so Sean McVay needs to use every play he has secreted away while leaning on his vast array of offensive weapons. Wringing every last drop of production from Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua is the first step to blowing the Bears out of the water. Stafford targeted Nacua 18 times against the Panthers last weekend, so he should at least be aiming for more than 20 on Sunday. When the Panthers didn’t show Nacua special attention he pulled off a string of chunk plays. He was also deployed as a runner, and bulldozed through three defenders for a touchdown. The Bears will always believe they can dig out a victory so the Rams should give them no hope whatsoever by spamming Nacua’s involvement until Chicago break.What the Bears need to do to win:Ben Johnson needs to be prepared for the Rams’ pass rush. Los Angeles have a key member of their secondary back: Quentin Lake, who freezes quarterbacks into holding the ball so that McVay’s heavy hitters, Jared Verse, Byron Young and Kobie Turner, can make a decisive sack. Johnson needs to scheme up the offense so they don’t get that chance. He should spotlight the out-of-structure playmaking of Caleb Williams – whose sack rate has dropped from 10.8% as a rookie to 4% this season – to stay one step ahead while using large doses of play action to draw the sting from blitzes. Williams needs to stay on his feet to get the ball out to his receivers who excel in yards after the catch. Rookie tight end Colston Loveland could be a huge headache for the Rams if he gets the targets.Key player: Montez Sweat, DE, Bears.The defensive lineman is surging at just the right time for Chicago. His three hits on Jordan Love earned him the game ball in the win over the Packers. The Bears need all of that and a few sacks to mitigate the danger of Stafford’s incredible array of receiving weapons.Prediction:Bears over Rams.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsDenver BroncosLos Angeles RamsChicago BearsSan Francisco 49ersSeattle SeahawksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Because during his darkest hours – and there have beena few of thoseduring a fraught first season at the club – he may also see a vision of his own future.The parallels between the two are clear and they are difficult to ignore as Nuno makes his return to Spurs with West Ham, desperate for a result to help lift the club out of the relegation places. When Nuno went to Spurs in 2021, he did so as a manager who had made his name in English football with Wolves, getting them promoted from the Championship and going on to enjoy success with them in the top division. Ditto Frank with Brentford beforehis move to Spurs last summer.Richarlison injury blow prompts Spurs to seek attacking reinforcementsRead moreNuno started brightly, recording a win against Manchester City. But then, as with Frank, there were dismal defeats against Chelsea and Arsenal, the booing of some of his substitutions and an overall feeling of frustration.Nuno was sackedafter 10 league games, his team having collected 15 points.There are obvious differences. Nuno had Harry Kane and Son Heung-min in their prime. Frank has missed the injured Dejan Kulusevki and James Maddison throughout his tenure and has only just got Dominic Solanke back after a long-term absence. Nuno also arrived at a club that was used to being up in the European qualifying places. Frank, meanwhile, inherited a team that had finished 17th.Nuno was given a two-year contract and there was a short‑term feel around his appointment, the sense that if a ready-made replacement became available – like, say, Antonio Conte – he could be vulnerable. Nuno was a long way down Spurs’s original shortlist and he was appointed after a 72-day search.Frank, by contrast, was the number-one choice. He was hired quickly and given a three-year deal. The talk around him has been of a long-term rebuild, with Spurs restructuring their ownership and making numerous head‑of‑department changes.Nobody likes to talk about transitional seasons in football. They have had to do so at Spurs. Yet there is one further similarity between Frank and Nuno that nags grimly, bringing worry to the Spurs fanbase, polluting the atmosphere, especially at home, where the team have won just twice in the league (only two clubs – West Ham and Wolves – have taken fewer points on their own turf). It concerns the playing style.Nuno brought with him a reputation for pragmatism, prioritising defensive strength, seeking to land his punches mainly on the counter. He was not associated with attractive passing up through the thirds. The same perception tracked Frank from Brentford and he has so far done little to alter it.The Spurs support are not famous for their patience and they will not tolerate a gameplan that lacks pace and excitement, attacking thrust or creativity. Nuno’s failure to provide one was the single biggest factor in his demise. It will do for Frank, as well, unless he can add fresh layers to his approach. What the eyes have seen so far under Frank is a stodginess to the buildup play, a predictability, a lack of options. They have been blunt and the statistics only reinforce things. According to Opta, no team in the league has played fewer through balls than Spurs, while only two have sent over more unsuccessful crosses in open play.View image in fullscreenThe return to fitness of Dominic Solanke (centre) could provide a timely boost to Thomas Frank at Tottenham.Photograph: Alex Morton/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockSpurs are 15th for shots on target; 16th for total shots and touches in the opposition box. An interesting detail is that they have massively outperformed their expected goals number in the league, which stands at 20.5. They have scored 30 times; no team has overdelivered by a greater margin. What happens when Spurs revert to the mean? It is also worth noting they are equal 17th for high turnovers forced and 20th for the number of shots resulting from such situations.Frank is well aware of the data, although he disputed the line about the high turnovers, believing his team are among the best in the division by this metric. He is supplied with incredible minutiae by his analysts. For example, one of them told him recently that Guglielmo Vicario was the goalkeeper with the most clearances with his weaker foot.Frank leans into this, saying during the preparations for West Ham that he was aware his team had made the fewest deep runs in behind opposition defences in the opening months of the season. That has been addressed. “In the last seven or eight games, we have improved this more and more, we are gradually moving up [this list],” says the Dane. “You need to run in behind if you want to score goals.”The bottom line is that Frank is reasonably happy with the defensive improvements he has overseen, together with those on set pieces, and is extremely conscious of the need to be better going forward. Solanke will help when he is fully fit, a proper pressing No 9 who can come short to link the play or run in behind, and thesigning of Conor Gallagherhas lifted the mood.Spurs are 14th, one place lower than they were at this stage last season, albeit three points better off. They have won three of their past 14 league games, they have justgone out of the FA Cup to Aston Villaand, from the outside looking in, it would be easy to think that Frank would be in big trouble if he lost to West Ham. Everybody knows how the Spurs crowd would react to that. But from the inside looking out, there is no sense that Frank is in immediate danger – and not only because nobody is going into the game thinking about a bad result. The hierarchy knows where the club are, the realities.Frank said the arrivals of Gallagher and the new assistant coach, John Heitinga, were “definitely a very good sign” of the backing he has at boardroom level, and he radiated confidence and calm, insisting he has seen positives in the past six matches; a decent half here and there, a greater ability to deal with setbacks, the culture within the squad getting stronger. Nuno’s unloved Spurs tenure, the lack of any connection with the fans, provides a warning. Frank does not need it.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ortiz’s lawsuit, acopy of whichhas been obtained by the Guardian, argues that the agreement allowed him to walk away if Golden Boy’s broadcast partnership with Dazn ended – a condition he says was triggered when the promoter’s deal with the streamer expired on 31 December.According to the complaint, Ortiz formally exercised his right to terminate the agreement on 8 January. Golden Boy has acknowledged that its Dazn deal concluded at the end of the year but maintains that Ortiz remains under contract because the promoter has been actively negotiating a renewal with Dazn covering 2026 and 2027. Ortiz disputes that position, arguing that ongoing negotiations and exchanged drafts do not constitute a binding agreement and that the contract language requires a completed deal, not “an agreement to agree”.The lawsuit seeks declaratory relief to clarify the 27-year-old Ortiz’s contractual status, with his attorneys arguing that uncertainty is harming the prime years of his career as he looks to secure high-profile fights.Ortiz’s filing goes beyond the termination clause, alleging that Golden Boy breached the agreement well before the split. Central to those claims are negotiations – or lack thereof – for a bout with Ennis, one of the most hotly anticipated matchups in boxing. Ortiz and Ennisboth hold interim championships at 154lb, and the fight is widely viewed as a natural step toward a unification bout for the undisputed title.Ortiz alleges he instructed Golden Boy to work with Ennis’s promoter, Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Boxing, but that Golden Boy failed to act in good faith. The complaint claims De La Hoya’s strained relationships with rival promoters and Saudi boxing power brokerTurki al-Sheikhundercut opportunities to stage the fight, particularly givenSaudi Arabia’s recent rolein financing marquee events.The lawsuit also alleges Golden Boy violated a contractual requirement to present Ortiz with at least three opponent options for each bout, instead offering a single Ennis proposal and threatening to sideline him if he declined. Ortiz further claims Golden Boy failed to disclose written documents generated during meetings involving Golden Boy, Matchroom and Dazn that related to the Ennis fight.Following Ortiz’s attempt to terminate the agreement, the complaint alleges Golden Boy continued to publicly assert control over his career, setting negotiation terms and deadlines without authorization. Ortiz argues that those actions wrought confusion within the industry and interfered with his ability to negotiate independently with other promoters.Golden Boy disputed Ortiz’s claims in a statement, saying it intends to fight the lawsuit. “We are aware of the lawsuit,” a spokesperson said. “Unfortunately, Vergil is getting bad advice from his lawyer and manager who have repeatedly violated the contract. We will aggressively defend this lawsuit and enforce our rights. We are confident a judge will agree that our contract is valid and Vergil and his team are in breach.”Ortiz is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Golden Boy’s conduct cost him millions in fight purses, sponsorships and related earnings.The lawsuit adds Ortiz to a growing list of elite fighters who have taken Golden Boy to court over contractual disputes,including Canelo Álvarez, whom Ortiz’s attorney Gregory Smith previously represented in his successful effort to exit a promotional deal with De La Hoya’s company.Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsTurki al-SheikhCanelo ÁlvarezShareReuse this content"

In October 2024 Bencic had plummeted to a lowly spot as world No 1,213 when she stepped back on to court feeling secure that baby Bella was being looked after by her husband, Martin Hromkovic – who is also her strength and conditioning coach.On 11 January, 14 months since her comeback began,Bencic played Iga Swiatek in the final of the United Cup in Sydney. The world No 2, and current Wimbledon champion, won the first set but Bencic played supreme tennis as she swept Swiatek aside 6-0, 6-3 in the next two sets to seal her ninth consecutive victory of the week for Switzerland. Her imperious performance also meant that Bencic was back in the world top 10 again.Katie Boulter hires Sharapova’s former coach to revive career after dismal 2025Read moreOf course Bencic has been a fine player for many years. She won theOlympic singles titlein 2021 and has been ranked as high as world No 4, in early 2020, but the odds are always stacked against a mother trying to make a sustained impact on the gruelling WTA tour. The schedule is relentless, the demands of travel are challenging and the matches have become even more intensely physical and psychologically draining. But the friendly and intelligent 28-year-old has conjured up one of the great sporting stories of the last year with remarkable conviction.Bencic pauses when I ask her to explain why she believes her tennis has improved since she became a mother. “It’s difficult to say why but I’m definitely very focused on trying to make my game better. I’m also pushed to do this because everyone else is getting better too.Tennisis moving forwards and it’s getting more physical and just faster. But I also think my mindset is different. I’m focusing more on the process and not so much on the results – which is funny because the results are coming as well. Most of all, in the comeback, we really worked hard on my physical fitness and with my movement on the court. That has really made my game better.”She is also bolstered by the fact that Bella doesn’t care whether a tennis match has been won or lost. The little girl is just happy to see her mum when she comes off court. “It’s very true,” Bencic says with her familiar laugh. “I still try to win so much and I really put my heart into playing well and getting the goal. But then, if that doesn’t happen, my world doesn’t crash. I am able to leave everything else on the court and have a life without being measured by results.”View image in fullscreenBelinda Bencic at the United Cup, where she won nine matches in succession, in singles and doubles.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesDid Bencic always believe she could make a successful return? “Yes, for sure. I’ve done it many times and come back from injury. I was very positive that I could do it again and I feel like once you reach the top 20, top 10, multiple times, then you can always do it. That gives you belief and it definitely helped with everything.”She explains that “I didn’t really play in pregnancy. I didn’t really feel like it and I was a little bit scared, maybe. I was basically just enjoying my time off. After being three months pregnant I didn’t hit any more. And then I hit my first ball after three months postpartum. I took it really easy at first on a small court where I was just feeling the ball and then working more on fitness. I then built that up step by step.”Bencic and her team also made a crucial choice in deciding to return to competitive play in small Challenger events away from the main WTA tour. “Absolutely,” she says. “That’s what made me most comfortable because it’s really arrogant to think that you can just stop playing and then, right after pregnancy, get straight back to the level you’d been before. It doesn’t work that way. I don’t want to go to [WTA] tournaments and keep losing in the first round and then not have enough matchplay or enough confidence. It’s much better to start in smaller tournaments, just to test myself out, and see the level.“I was still breastfeeding in the first four tournaments I played and we had to figure out the schedule with Bella. How are we going to make this work? We didn’t really want to throw ourselves into the highest level of competing before trying these things out.It was a very different challenge as you’re feeling tired and you also feel you’re playing with a different body. And you have to work out all the timings. I once had to play three sets and I was stressed about having to let go of the milk and also that Bella was getting hungry.“But for me it was always most important not to sacrifice anything that Bella needed. She was always first in my priorities. If it hadn’t worked out I wouldn’t have done it – but we found a good schedule.”‘It’s a long and difficult dream’: João Fonseca on practice, patience and matching Sinner and AlcarazRead moreBella is with her parents in Melbourne but Bencic is emphatic when I ask if she has a big support team helping her prepare for the first grand slam of the year. “Actually, no, we don’t have anyone here. It’s just Martin looking after her and we have my coach [Iain Hughes] as well. So we’re travelling with just the three and a half of us at the moment. We really don’t want to take a nanny because we want to keep her close to us. We want Bella to grow up with us and not with anyone else. So that’s all good but it’s challenging – especially for Martin. But he is such a great father and he’s with her 24/7. He’s also working with me and so we take Bella to the gym with us. We somehow manage it. But we don’t really have a plan – we just do it day by day and we’re kind of winging it.”Bencic laughs again before explaining that whenshe faces Katie Boulter, in the first round on Monday: “Martin and Bella will come on site with me. We will do the warm-up together but then he will stay with her in the players’ area or the restaurant while I go out to play. If she’s sleeping then he can watch a little of my match.”View image in fullscreenBencic, with the Switzerland team, after winning the quarter-final against Argentina at the United Cup in Perth.Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesHas Bencic had time to absorb the significance of her dizzying climb up the rankings? “I didn’t have so much time yet to let that sink in and, to be honest, I don’t really want to focus on it right now. My main focus is theAustralian Openbut, once that’s over, we can take time to just say: ‘Well done – one year back and we made it to the top 10.’ Even last year, when I finished 2025 as No 11 in the world, I was emotional and proud.”She adds: “At the start you cannot really expect it to happen because it’s such a long way back. You wonder: ‘Hmm, can I really get to that level? How long is it going to take me?’ There are a lot of questions but it’s important not to focus so much on the long term. I had no expectations and I wasn’t putting myself under pressure in the timeline of my comeback. I just really enjoyed it and lived in the moment. And then when I started to play in the first couple of tournaments I realised that I still have the level to come back. But I was thinking about playing grand slams and maybe making the top 100, top 50. I didn’t know that it’s going to be a top 10 comeback. So it’s definitely also been a surprise to us.”Bencic played well in a series of taxing matchesat Wimbledon last summerand she reached the semi-finals – whereSwiatek beat her easily 6-2, 6-0. Memories of that defeat made victory over Swiatek last Sunday all the sweeter. “It was a big win for me,” she says happily, “because at Wimbledon she completely killed me. I really tried to find another way to beat her in Wuhan [in October] and I got a bit closer. She won 7-6, 6-4. And then last week I tried another different approach. I’m really glad that worked out and I’m able to challenge myself against her because Iga’s a really amazing champion.”View image in fullscreenBencic celebrates reaching the semi-finals after beating Mirra Andreeva at Wimbledon 2025.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBencic is on such a hot streak of form that some pundits have suggested she is a real contender at the Australian Open. Does she harbour similar hopes? “Yes, for sure. But it’s funny. Before every grand slam the media and tennis experts always talk about who has a shot and who doesn’t. And at the end it’s all different because you have to win seven matches in a row. You have to be completely sharp from the start and sometimes you can be in the best form of your life and then you play a match and your opponent is just better on that day. So I’m really cautious with predictions. Obviously, I can play great tennis and I’m on the same level with the top players. So that gives me a lot of confidence. But I really just want to focus on the first round and try to work myself into the tournament and keep winning.”After all she has achieved over the last year, as a restored top-10 player and such a fulfilled and happy mother, Bencic allows herself, just briefly, to look even higher. “Well, you know,” she says, almost shyly, “my dream of winning a grand slam still continues. So yes, I’m going to try to do that, with everything I have. We’ll see if it works out. I hope it does, and I do believe I can do it.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Its 14-player field matches the reigning world champion, India’s Dommaraju Gukesh, against a range of rivals who include four of the eight Candidates who will meet in March to decide his 2026 challenger, another three grandmasters from the world top 10, the controversial US star Hans Niemann, plus a 14-year-old Turk who is breaking age records.Gukesh’s unimpressive recent results mean the world Nos 5 and 8, Arjun Erigaisi and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, will aim to finish ahead of him. Germany’s world No 4, Vincent Keymer, had a good 2025, while the home nation’s world No 6, Anish Giri, often performs well in this event.Turkey’s Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus, 14, is already famous for his “Turkish Immortal” in the Fide Grand Swiss and has broken several world age records. He is the youngest ever to reach a 2600 rating.

Her results included a draw against Germany’s top woman and a win against a Bulgarian who had just qualified for the Women’s Candidates.Last weekend Sivanandan, now aged 10 and the reigning UK Women’s Blitz Champion, returned to Monaco and repeated her stellar performance. As in 2024, she totalled 8.5/13 against high-rated opponents. As in 2024, she won the junior under-20 prize because Eline Roebers (Netherlands), who was also eligible by age, won the women’s European title.Sivanandan began slowly with 3/6 before winning four games in a row from rounds seven to 10, then finishing with three draws. Inher most eventful game, she was worse from the opening before recovering to overwhelm her opponent with a queen and rooks onslaught.Sivanandan followed up by scoring 7/11 in the Rapid, where she was unbeaten and gained a massive 133 Fide rapid points. She finished 20th in the 143-player field, two points behind the new champion, Nino Batsiashvili, from Georgia.Chess: Hastings Masters guards tradition and produces an English co-winnerRead moreIn the final round, shedrew a pawn down endgameagainst Teodora Injac, the 2025 European women’s champion at classical chess.

The pair endured several terse exchanges with Hamilton expressing frustration and confusion, notably in Monaco when he asked his engineer at the end of the race: “Are you upset with me or something?” He appeared to receive no reply.Hamilton dismissed speculation that the pair did not enjoy a good working relationship at the time as “BS” and said Adami had “been amazing to work with, he’s a great guy”.However, Hamilton went on to suffer the worst season of his career. He failed to claim a podium and finished sixth in the drivers’ championship, behind his teammate Charles Leclerc in fifth, while Ferrari were fourth in the constructors’ championship, 435 points behind the champions, McLaren.Hamilton has been outspoken in his dissatisfaction, describing last season as a “nightmare” at one point and, after being knocked out in Q1 at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, was at the end of his tether. “I don’t have the words to describe the feeling that I have inside,” he said. “An unbearable amount of anger and rage. There is not really much I can say about it.” He intimated in Abu Dhabi that he expected there to be changes made and was explicit that the team could not carry on as it was.“My surroundings in terms of personal personnel, team personnel, how you utilise people, whether people need to move into different positions to work better, all these different things need to be looked upon in my personal space so that we can optimise our teamwork,” he said.Adami had previously been race engineer to Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz, and being moved sideways from such a pivotal role suggests Ferrari is heeding Hamilton’s entreaties during the close season.Explore more on these topicsFerrariLewis HamiltonFormula One 2026Formula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

In the almost 13 years since Sir Alex Ferguson left, the club have struggled to find stability, with his shadow stretching down from the directors’ box to the dugout, emphasised by the stand named in his honour staring back.Manchester City arrive at Old Trafford on Saturday in the opposite position, having had Pep Guardiola in post for a decade, amassing 18 major trophies.Michael Carrick will take charge of Unitedfor the first time since being appointed until the end of the season at a club who appear to be without a functioning long-term plan. This will be a campaign of only 40 competitive games for United, their fewest since 1914-15, with some fans thankful for being able to cut down on trudging visits. So is this, in the post-Ferguson era, the lowest of the lows?Ratcliffe and Glazer family visit Manchester United training ground to support CarrickRead more“We’ve hit more rock bottoms and broken more unwanted records in the past few years than I’d care to remember, but I wouldn’t say this is the lowest point since Sir Alex retired,” says Rick Redman, a season-ticket holder. “That was the7-0 at Anfield, even though we finished above Liverpool that season. You could argue it was finishing 15th in the league andlosing a European final to a Spurs sidewho had already beaten us three times that same season. This shows the overall problem. There are too many to choose from.”Speak to United fans and the nadir varies from seat to seat. There is plenty to suit individual taste, including humbling defeats by Liverpool and City, missing European nights, a tedious style or entire managerial spells.Nostalgia lingers at Old Trafford, especially because celebrations have been in short supply. This is thesecond short-term managerial spell Carrickhas been thrust into. In times of crisis, the plan is often to find someone who knows the club, with talk of its DNA. Ryan Giggs,Ole Gunnar Solskjærand Ruud van Nistelrooy had their stints, and Darren Fletcher was in charge for the past two games. All sought the advice of Ferguson, ensuring a direct link between the old and the new in an attempt to go back to the future, but contemplating repeating those successes is preposterous. Instead, a realignment of ambitions has taken over the stands, if not the boardroom.Ferguson oversaw an aeon, whereas the successors have barely found time to fill a chapter. Thenine-month reign of David Moyesto start life post-Ferguson was a sign of things to come. It was never going to be easy to replace a legend but little has gone well.Louis van Gaal,José MourinhoandErik ten Hagran tight ships but they came with a shelf life.View image in fullscreenCan Michael Carrick and his assistant Jonathan Woodgate drive Manchester United to some kind of success in the rest of this season?Photograph: Martin Rickett/PANo one has survived three years in the role. Solskjær lasted longest, taking charge of 168 games, and finished second in the Premier League but won no silverware and lost five of his final seven league games. The Norwegian brought back Cristiano Ronaldo to amplify the feeling of days gone by, only for his return to be rememberedfor its explosive ending.James Starr, a lifelong fan, says: “Strangely, my lowest moment in recent history was either [Ralf]Rangnick’s tenure, which was defined by a dire run of results, or the second half of last season under [Ruben] Amorim. I don’t thinkAmorim should have been sacked; he had got rid of the deadwood and was starting to make small progress with this team. Another good summer of signings of the ilk of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and I think we’d have been around the Champions League spots again comfortably next season.”Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s investment was supposed to hail a new era but that optimism is diminishing, with the Glazers still at his side.Ratcliffe claimed Amorim required three yearsto prove his mettle as an elite Premier League coach but the Portuguese was gone within months of the co-owner’s comments. The chief executive,Omar Berrada, and director of football, Jason Wilcox, have come under scrutiny and lacked an obvious succession plan after Amorim’s demise. The suits have plenty to prove after numerous missteps.View image in fullscreenOle Gunnar Solskjær is one of many former Manchester United players brought back to guide the team as a caretaker manager. He assumed the permanent role but still ended up being sacked.Photograph: John Walton/PAStarr says: “It is difficult to have faith in the hierarchy when you look at the key decisions they’ve made so far: keeping Ten Hag after the FA Cup win just to sack him a few months later,hiring and firing Dan Ashworth, neglecting our glaringly lacking midfield, and now backing Amorim then firing him seemingly without a long-term plan B.”For all the faults in Amorim’s 14-month tenure, he left United in a promising position in the Premier League: seventh, three points off fourth. There is a clear opportunity to challenge for Champions League qualification with no distractions. Europe’s most lucrative competition has not visited this part of town for two years and the drop in revenue is critical for a club marketed as the biggest in the world butunable to get past Grimsby of League Two.With three wins in their past 13 matches there is an immediate problem facing Carrick in front of an apathetic crowd. A derby against bitter rivals could galvanise the fanbase or sink the mood to new depths. “I can’t see the derby being anything other than a thrashing,” says Starr. United’sFA Cup final victory over City in 2024kept Ten Hag in his job and offered hope but instability continued. Carrick is here to bring positivity as someone who won five Premier League titles at Old Trafford as a player.Redman says: “We have to look at this season – as shambolic as it is by traditional United standards – as slow progress in terms of the league. Some of the embarrassing defeats we’ve suffered have at least been through fine margins, or referees implementing the rules differently against us. Those are excuses we shouldn’t be making, and it’s depressing that we’ve seen off yet another manager.”Quick GuideNow for manager No 6.

Paul Pogba returned for £100m and Antony, Jadon Sancho and Romelu Lukaku each cost more than £70m but repaid very little of it before leaving. The ineptitude has been compounded by academy players being sold to make way for incomings, with Scott McTominay, Anthony Elanga and Dean Henderson going on to thrive outside the United bubble. The latest summer recruits – Cunha, Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens – have offered hope of evolution but nothing akin to a revolution.Carrick’s return marks the 12th permanent or temporary appointment since Ferguson’s retirement. Five trophies have been collected: two FA Cups, two League Cups and a Europa League. Under Ferguson, United never ended outside the top three in the Premier League but the past 13 years have brought eight seasons where they have finished fourth or below, culminating in coming 15th last May.“I keep thinking back toRalf Rangnick’s ‘open heart surgery’ comments, having analysed and explained the multitude of issues at the club,” Redman says. “His words still very much apply four years on. With the Glazers still being in power it’s more like we’ve had a pacemaker fitted, at best.” Another health check will be administered by Manchester City on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMichael CarrickfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oliver Glasner, having confirmed that the captain Marc Guéhi’s move to Manchester City is poised to go ahead, had another bombshell prepared for his press conference to preview Saturday’s trip to Sunderland.Nearly eight months to the day since the Austrian led the club to their first major trophy bybeating Manchester City in the FA Cup final, his announcement thathe will leave Selhurst Park at the end of the seasoncame as no surprise. It rounds off one of the worst weeks in the club’s history after thehumiliating defeat by non-league Macclesfieldthat will be for ever an unwanted postscript to their victory.Oliver Glasner confirms he will leave Crystal Palace role in summerRead moreThe writing has been on the wall since Glasner revealed at the end of August deep frustration at Palace’s failure to reinvest the record £67.5m fee received from Arsenal for Eberechi Eze – the man who scored the winning goal against City – as they embarked on their debut campaign in Europe. Two days after their triumph at Wembley, and with the club yet to become embroiled in the dispute with Uefa over breaking its regulations on multi-club ownership that led to their demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League, the manager urged Palacenot to become “one-hit wonders”and insisted he was “100% here”.But Glasner, who clashed with the directors at Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt over transfers, has always worn his heart on his sleeve and could not hold back with his criticism of Palace’s lack of activity despite the last-minute decision not to sellGuéhi to Liverpool in the final hours of the summer window.A key figure at Palace had predicted a few weeks earlier that Guéhi’s future would be closely connected to the manager’s given that their contracts expired this summer. Glasner is understood to have been instrumental in the decision to keep Guéhi for the first half of the season when the defender appeared poised to move to Anfield. But with City desperate for defensive reinforcements after injuries to Josko Gvardiol and Rúben Dias, the chair, Steve Parish,accepted a fee of £20m– a £15m loss compared with what Liverpool had been prepared to pay five months ago.View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner led Crystal Palace to the first trophy in their history, with the win over Manchester City in the FA Cup final last summer.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APWith Guéhi on his way, Glasner could not keep his secret any longer. He revealed he had informed Parish in October of his desire to pursue a new challenge, when Palace had just set a club record of 19 matches unbeaten stretching back to the previous season. Glasner, who has expressed his ambition to manage a club in the Champions League again after reaching the last 16 with Eintracht in 2023, had been in favour of coming clean last month to avoid speculation that his departure was down to lack of investment in the squad.“I spoke with Steve, I wanted to maybe announce it before the transfer window because of these rumours about my decision being influenced, but we decided it wasn’t the best moment,” he said.Whether announcing he is leaving after a run of nine games without a win that has led to Palace plummeting down the table proves to be a better idea remains to be seen. Glasner said he hoped it could inspire a “turnaround” in fortune but replacing a player of Guéhi’s quality will be no easy task in a squad lacking confidence and resources.There are also doubts over the futures of several of the FA Cup winning side. The France striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has 18 months left on his contract and is wanted by Juventus, and Adam Wharton, Daniel Muñoz and Daichi Kamada are also coveted by bigger clubs. The Japan midfielder, who – like Muñoz – has been badly missed in recent weeks owing to injury, played for Glasner at Eintracht and is out of contract in the summer.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi was bound for Liverpool in the summer only for his transfer to fall through at the last minute.Photograph: Simon Dael/ShutterstockThe most important decision Palace must take is appointing their next manager. They have looked at Getafe’s José Bordalás and Iñigo Pérez of Rayo Vallecano as potential successors, although Parish is understood to have pushed for Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna before appointing Glasner to replace Roy Hodgson nearly two years ago and may try again. Brendan Rodgers could also be a contender despite taking over at the Saudi Arabian side Al-Qadsiah last month.None are likely to be as demanding as Glasner, although his track record in south London has confirmed he gets results. Palace became distracted bytheir battle with Uefa, and the arrival of the American billionaire Woody Johnson to replace John Textor as the biggest shareholder proved too late to supply the firepower needed to sustain a European campaign and satisfy their ambitious manager, whose exit was bizarrely not mentioned on Palace’s website on Friday.All roads could lead to Manchester United for Glasner, even if his most recent trip up the M6 was one he willnever be able to forget for all the wrong reasons. But after making history at Palace, he will relish the opportunity to test himself at Old Trafford or elsewhere.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceanalysisShareReuse this content"

His impoverished childhood and the early death of his father forced him to grow up fast while still a teenager. To eat, he had to start working as a child. He was a bricklayer’s assistant, a fruit carrier at the market and a car washer … so many jobs that could have prevented him from becoming the Brazilian to make Premier League history with the most goals in a single season.Igor Thiago has 16 goals in 21 games forBrentford. There are still 17 more matches to go, the first against Chelsea on Saturday, but he has already surpassed such Brazilian luminaries as Roberto Firmino, Matheus Cunha and Gabriel Martinelli, all of whom scored 15 league goals in their most prolific season. How to describe this turnaround in his life? Igor Thiago has an easy explanation. “I would describe it as a lot of hard work. I think that everything God has planned for my life, has given me this year at Brentford, is something I hadn’t experienced yet in my career,” he says.As has been the case at many points throughout his life, the beginning of his time at Brentford was marked by difficulties and challenges. Two knee injuries kept him out for much of last season, to the point that he only played eight games in his first campaign.“I was really upset because I didn’t understand why this was happening to me. I even thought: ‘My God, will I ever be myself again?’ Until this year’s pre-season, I kept thinking: ‘Am I going to come back?’ I felt it a lot. My body had never been through that before.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Igor Thiago scores the first of his two goals past Sunderland’s Robin Roefs this month.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters“But in the end, it was a good thing for me. I also worked on other things. Other weaknesses, too. I had something that was lacking a little, that I might not have had time to work on if I hadn’t had that injury. So I worked harder. That injury taught me a lot.”The period away from the pitch enabled the forward to get closer to his young family and try to fill a void opened up by the death of his father when he was 13, due to problems with alcohol.“I learned to really value my family. To look at life differently, to enjoy football, to enjoy being on the pitch. To play with more love, not to think so much about mistakes. I realised that I had to enjoy my life as a footballer more, enjoy every minute on the pitch, not let the little things frustrate me or take me out of the game mentally. I had to enjoy every moment, both the good and the bad, because they are what make you grow.“I also became a father very young. I had to mature early. So, with the whole period of my father’s loss, life made me understand that I needed to be a man. Being a father is different from having a father. While my father was alive, I had many good memories with him. He was an alcoholic, but he was never an aggressive father. He was always very loving, caring. Because of the loss of my father, I had to grow up mentally. After his death, a lot of things started to be missing. So that pushed me even more to work.”I need to talk about my story. I understand that if I tell my story, I can inspire people around me.And things really started to fall short in Igor Thiago’s life. His mother – widowed with four children to care for – worked as a street cleaner in their home city of Cidade Ocidental, near Brasília, and life was tough for Igor Thiago and his siblings.“I had friends who wanted me to steal with them. They weren’t really friends, of course. They were acquaintances from the street, but they wanted me to use drugs, to follow the wrong path in life.“Many people in my city live a reality similar to or worse than mine at the time. Many people have alcoholic parents, who use drugs, who were abandoned. But I need to talk about my story. I understand that if I tell my story, I can inspire people around me.”Rejected by the biggest clubs in Brazil, Igor Thiago ended up in Verê, a city of 7,000 inhabitants. He was top scorer of the regional league, but what took him to Cruzeiro – in Belo Horizonte, the country’s sixth largest city – was a short video presented to the club’s board.Ricardo Resende, then coach of the under-20s, says: “Our football director, Amarildo, showed me a short video, 30 seconds long, and I liked it. It was beautiful goals, a different profile, he was a very high-quality player. We called him for a trial and in the first training session he made a run that impressed us. There was no way we couldn’t sign him.”Célio Lúcio, a former Cruzeiro player and general technical assistant for the youth teams, adds: “What impressed me most about Thiago was his potential to learn. I saw Ronaldo starting at Cruzeiro. I was a player at the club and saw his arrival in 1993. Ronaldo was a very persistent, hard-working guy. Thiago is similar to him in that sense. Of course, not the technique because Ronaldo is from another world, but Thiago was a talent that needed to be polished and wanted to learn.“I showed him the way and he followed it. He used to arrive 20 minutes before the training and stay another 20 minutes on his own after. He is an example to everyone.”Even with the praise at the club, Igor Thiago did not receive the recognition he deserved. He was sold for about €1m (£860,000) to the Bulgarian champions, Ludogorets, and while it was an important move in the transition to European football, it was to prove another challenging period when he was targeted by racists on social media.View image in fullscreenIgor Thiago at Brentford’s training ground: ‘This World Cup feeling is very exciting.

I had to adapt to a culture that was totally different from what I was used to in Brazil. I had to live a different life, speak a language that wasn’t mine, I had to learn to endure the cold. I suffered a lot of prejudice, too.“There was a game where I scored a winning goal. I had never received a message on Instagram in Bulgaria. Suddenly, I started receiving a lot of private messages saying that I was a monkey, that my children were monkeys. It was an embarrassing situation, but I understood that it wasn’t about me. It didn’t say anything about me. It said more about them, frustrated people, people with problems of their own. I moved on in peace. That’s not going to shake me.”Back-to-back titles in Bulgaria and 21 goals in 55 games attracted the attention of Club Brugge in 2023 before Igor Thiago signed for Brentford in a club record £30m move in February 2024 and he claimed the goals record for a Brazilian in the Premier League after scoring twice in the3-0 defeat of Sunderland. Without forgetting the past, Igor Thiago is preparing to fulfil a childhood dream: to wear the national team shirt of Brazil.“This World Cup feeling is very exciting. I’m very hopeful about being part of it, I’ve always dreamed of playing in a World Cup. It’s something I only saw other people experiencing on television, but now I’m close to experiencing it myself.“God has a purpose in everyone’s life. If it is God’s will and [Carlo] Ancelotti’s will, it will be a pleasure, an honour, to represent my country. It is an indescribable feeling to represent my country, to be able to experience this moment. It will be something I can’t explain. No one from CBF [the Brazilian Football Confederation] has ever contacted me, but I have this expectation.”Despite the arrival of the former Real Madrid coach Ancelotti in May, Brazil are struggling. One of the team’s weaknesses is the No 9 shirt, a position Igor Thiago says he is ready to take on and bring home the trophy for the first time since 2002.“I believe I am ready. The only thing I know how to do in my life is score goals. God has prepared me for this moment, and if he allows me, we will bring the sixth World Cup title to Brazil.”Explore more on these topicsBrentfordBrazilinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Both in the Long, Fast and Clever throw-in. No more comments at the moment.”Arsenal have scored more goals from set-pieces than any other team in Europe’s top-five leagues, with Ben White’s opener against Chelsea on Wednesday night in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final their 24th of the campaign. But while there has been marked increase in the frequency of Premier League goals coming from long throw-ins, with 18 already compared with 20 last season, Arsenal have still yet to score from one and Arteta revealed in December thatDeclan Rice has been working on developing the skill.Arteta refused to elaborate on the decision to hire Grønnemark, only going as far saying he believes he could make the difference as Arsenal seek to be crowned champions for the first time since 2004. “We try to improve every single area,” said Arteta. “Every single margin that we possibly can to be a better team and anybody can help us. We have many experts, many people around trying to help us to become as good as we can.”Statistics published by Opta this week show that the number of long throw-ins per match – defined as a throw that travels 20 metres or more – have risen from 1.52 last season to 3.97. That is more than double the amount of any of the previous 10 campaigns, with Brentford’s Michael Kayode the most prolific having taken exactly 100.Meanwhile, Arteta dismissed reports of a bust-up between Rice and his assistant, Albert Stuivenberg, at half-time of the 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge in midweek, insisting that any issues between them are now “all sorted”.Arsenal’s lead could be cut to three points by Manchester City if they can overcome Manchester United in the lunchtime derby at Old Trafford, with their trip to Nottingham Forest kicking off at tea time. Arteta is optimistic that his side can pick up where they left off against Chelsea. “I think we are building very good momentum and belief comes from performances and the level of consistency that we have shown throughout 32 games already this season and what we did at Stamford Bridge,” he said.“It should help us to be very convinced that we have the ability to do that, but the reality is that you have to show it in every game and there’s still so much to happen, but we are glad that we are still alive in the four competitions.”Ed Aarons2.Moyes needs faltering Barry to step upDavid Moyes has defended Everton’s signing of Thierno Barry but admitted he has needed to take “a bit of a gamble” on some transfers for financial reasons.Barry was signed for £27m from Villarreal last summer after Everton had negotiated down his €40m release clause, but took 17 games to score the first of his three goals for the club and has struggled to make an impact. The 23-year-old also had a weak penalty saved in last weekend’s FA Cup shootout defeat by Sunderland.Moyes was asked whether the striker was signed by Everton’s new football leadership structure – which gives him the final say on transfers – or was a recommendation by the former director of football Kevin Thelwell. The manager replied: “It came from us. We paid £27m and that is not a lot of money for a centre-forward. We didn’t have £50m-£60m to buy a centre forward and we probably couldn’t have got one at that price because those ones wouldn’t have come to the club with us having no European football.“We had to go early and we went for Thierno who had scored 14 or 15 goals in his first year in La Liga [it was 11 goals]. If we had waited until the second year and he had done the same then he probably wouldn’t have come to us or we couldn’t have got him at the cost he would have been. We need him to step up but he’s a first year in the Premier League from overseas so there is a bit of room to give him a wee bit of manoeuvre. Hopefully it will improve.”Everton are looking to sign a striker and have inquired about a loan for Fenerbahce’s Youssef En-Nesyri. The Morocco international has several options.Moyes insists Barry has the attributes to come good for Everton. “He’s got a physicality, he’s good in the air, he can run plenty, he helps us off the ball and his goals last year looked good enough to say that he’s going to continue that. And being young, a French under-21 international, there are a lot of good things about him in terms of potential.“As a manager sometimes these are the decisions you have to take. Some of them are a little bit of a gamble and while we’ve not got the big funds we are probably in a position where we are having to take a bit of a risk with quite a few players.”Andy Hunter3.Dyche seeks striker after Kalimuendo exitSean Dyche is seeking a striker in the transfer window since Nottingham Forest only have Igor Jesus available, with Chris Wood out following knee surgery and Arnaud Kalimuendo joining Eintracht Frankfurt on loan.Dyche said before Saturday’s visit of the league leaders, Arsenal: “The obvious one is the striker area because we are a bit short there. The club felt it was a really good deal for Kalimuendo to go out. We are looking at various options to bring in. That’s the obvious one that jumps off the page. You’ve got to be ready for the shifting sands of the market.“We’ve got to be proactive where we can be and reactive if things change. I think the club are well aware of that. I’ve had a good meeting from the owner all the way through the structure about what we think we’ve got and what we think we need. It’s aligning the right people and getting the deals done, which is often the hardest part – the actual process of getting the deal done and getting the player here.”PA Media4.Silva wary of Calvert-Lewin threatMarco Silva never had any doubts Dominic Calvert-Lewin could cut it in the Premier League. The 28-year-old is enjoying an impressive campaign for Leeds, having scored eight goals in his last nine appearances to help Daniel Farke’s side push themselves clear of the relegation zone. Calvert-Lewin played under Silva at Everton and will come up against his old manager when Leeds host Fulham at Elland Road on Saturday.“It is not the first time he has performed at this level. When you talk about performing, he is a striker who can score in many different ways,” Silva said. “When you look through his career, when he is playing, the numbers are there. Game by game, he is getting better and showing he is a proven Premier League striker.”View image in fullscreenDominic Calvert-Lewin has tallied an impressive eight goals in his last nine appearances for Leeds.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersFulham head to Leeds looking to extend their own impressive six-match unbeaten run in all competitions, but Silva knows just what a tough task that will be against Farke’s rejuvenated team. “It is never easy to play there,” the Fulham manager said. “To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means – the home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition. They have been very strong at home, [but also] achieving results away from home as well. They have the quality, the organisation, the manager and the individual players.”PA Media5.Nuno ‘cannot afford mistakes’ in windowNuno Espírito Santo has told the West Ham outcasts James Ward-Prowse and Callum Wilson to “go and pursue their careers” after being frozen out at the London Stadium. Wilson has not featured in Nuno’s last two squads and the former Newcastle striker is understood to be in the process of cancelling his contract amid links with Celtic and Everton.“We are working on both ins and outs,” said Nuno. “I feel that we need to rebalance our squad, so that means bringing more options to some positions, and finding solutions for the players who are not having so many minutes to go and pursue their careers. We are working very hard as a club to find the right players, in a very tricky transfer window. So, we have to make good decisions, and we cannot afford to make mistakes.”View image in fullscreenJames Ward-Prowse has been frozen out at West Ham.Photograph: Patrick Khachfe/Getty ImagesNuno has already brought in the strikers Taty Castellanos and Pablo Felipe at a combined cost of around £45m. Further evidence that the Portuguese coach is not in any imminent danger of the sack, even if West Ham are plunged deeper into relegation trouble with a defeat at Tottenham on Saturday, came when the club allowed him to appoint the veteran Spaniard Paco Jémez to his coaching staff.“It’s one more person to help us. The coaching staff now has more numbers, which means more ideas and more energy,” said Nuno. “Paco is an experienced coach, and he’ll bring something new to the set-up.”PA Media6.Iraola needs to plug leaky defenceAndoni Iraola admitted Bournemouth’s leaky defence away from home is giving him a headache. Bournemouth visit Brighton on Monday, having conceded 29 goals in 10 matches on their travels this season – the worst record in the Premier League. In their last three top-flight matches away from the Vitality Stadium, the Cherrieshave drawn 4-4 at Manchester Unitedand2-2 at Chelseaeither side ofbeing thrashed 4-1 at Brentford.Iraola said: “It definitely concerns me. We are a team that scores a lot of goals and concedes a lot of goals. If you want to be a very good team you cannot concede the number of goals we are conceding. This is the main reason we have not been able to get the results we want lately because we have been scoring a lot of goals and not getting the results.“It’s very difficult to do the things we do – to go to Chelsea and score two goals or Old Trafford and score four goals and not win. If you score two, three or four goals away, you should get more wins and we are not getting them because we are conceding goals. If we don’t improve this, it’s going to be difficult to get more wins.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talkArsenalFulhamBournemouthWest Ham UnitedNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

She accepted the sanction and was also ordered to enrol on an education programme after an FA investigation into the language, which was overheard by some staff and teammates.Manchester United sign Wangerheim, Birmingham make ‘statement of intent’Read moreThe remark is understood to have been heard while Liverpool were preparing to take a squad photograph during pre-season. Liverpool promptly looked into the matter internally and it was referred to the FA.It is understood further details surrounding this disciplinary case will not be publicised, on player-welfare grounds.The Liverpool head coach, Gareth Taylor, said on Friday: “We have a slight update on the situation, in the sense that the FA has now completed its thorough investigation. They sanctioned the player with a six-game ban. That ban has been ongoing whilst we’ve been playing, so effectively she will be out of the running to be included this weekend, but after that she is available for selection.”Asked how difficult it had been while this case had been ongoing, Taylor said: “The situation is the situation. The team and the club have acted in the appropriate way. We’ve supported the FA in this investigation. I will say, it’s been dragged on a little bit. I think that’s been frustrating for everyone involved, particularly Rafa. But we’re happy now that it’s completed, we’re happy now that we have some actual detail on what it looks like, and all of us can now move on.”Liverpool will not be commenting further. The team travel to the lower-league side London Bees in the Women’s FA Cup on Sunday.After theGuardian reportedon 19 September that the FA was investigating Borggräfe, she played in Liverpool’s next four matches. She was then selected as an unused substitute in their next five games, before her ban came into force before a loss to Arsenal on 6 December. She will be available when they host Tottenham on 25 January in the Women’s Super League.Explore more on these topicsLiverpool FC WomenWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

However, when Miovski drove past Annan’s debutant keeper Charlie Albinson from 16 yards for his sixth goal of the season, there was always going to be only one winner.Rangers, despite a lacklustre demeanour, doubled their lead when Dowell played in Findlay Curtis – linked with a loan move to Kilmarnock – down the right and he stood up a cross to the back post where Miovski had the easiest of tasks heading in from three yards.In the 38th minute, Curtis escaped the Annan defence again but his delicate chip came off the bar and backtracking defender Scott Hooper cleared to safety. The Light Blues then settled.In another incisive attack Albinson made a save from Miovski from close range at the expense of a corner that came to nothing, unlike Dowell’s looping header from a Joe Rothwell cross in the 48th minute to effectively seal the home side’s entry into the next round.Danilo and Curtis came close with efforts before 17-year-old Zebedee Lawson, who signed from Brighton in September, came on to make his debut, along with Rabbi Matondo.Chukwuani came on to make his debut in the 63rd minute amid more substitutions but it was his fellow replacement Matondo who was fouled by Hooper in the Annan box, with Miovski sending Albinson the wrong way with his spot kick.View image in fullscreenKieran Dowell heads home Rangers’ third goal.Photograph: Kirk O’Rourke/Rangers FC/ShutterstockAlbinson saved a long-distance effort from Chukwuani, the £4m signing from Sturm Graz, but he had no chance with Aasgaard’s curling free-kick which sped into the top corner for his fourth goal in six games.On Saturday, round four continues at lunchtime with Dunfermline hosting Hibernian. There are 11 games scheduled for 3pm, including Camelon Juniors, from the Falkirk area, at home to Elgin, and all-Premiership games between Kilmarnock and Dundee, and Livingston and St Mirren. In the evening match, Hearts are at home to Falkirk in a clash between two sides exceeding expectations in the top flight.The round concludes on Sunday, with Aberdeen hosting Raith and Celtic travelling to Auchinleck Talbot.Explore more on these topicsScottish CupRangersAnnan Athleticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Niall McVeighFri 16 Jan 2026 11.17 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 11.55 ESTShareTHE MAGIC OF THE CUP OF NATIONSThe 2025 Africa Cup of Nations reaches its big finale in 2026 on Sunday, having rolled on through the annual festive time warp, outlasting Enzo Maresca, Ruben Amorim andRyan MasonXabi Alonso. Some Premier League teams will have played games in four different competitions by the time they welcome their players home. Wedged into the domestic calendar’s most crowded months, Afcon can get overlooked and more’s the pity, because the 2025-26 tournament has been a vintage edition. The group stage may have lacked big surprises but was still packed withlate twists,ridiculous goalsand dramatic storylines. Two different coaches named Cameroon squads amid a pre-tournament power struggle; their first opponents, Gabon, weredisbanded by their governmentafter going out early (a decision quietly reversed this week). Sudan and Mozambique earned historic victories, bringing light to fans suffering through conflict. We were introduced to Kuka Mboladinga, thesharply-dressed, statuesque DR Congo fanwho we all hope will make it to next summer’s Geopolitics World Cup.In the knockout stages, the tension turned up and star names stepped forward. Brahim Díaz led hosts Morocco through a major wobble against Tanzania, Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman made Nigeria look like the team to beat, and Mohamed Salah helped Egypt battle past outsiders Benin and defending champions Côte d’Ivoire. Algeria’s Adil Boulbinascored a screamerin the 119th minute to eliminate DR Congo – then toppled over right in front of Mboladinga, who remained admirably stony-faced. In the semi-finals, Sadio Mané reminded us that he very much still has it, an instinctive late strike undoing an ultra-cautious Egypt and sparing us all the 30 minutes of extra time.Morocco, burdened by huge expectations on home soil, toiled against a Nigeria side whose attacking verve deserted them, in a semi-final so lacking in action, it almostadded to the sense of occasion. Having the continent’s best keeper paid off as Yassine Bounou saved two penalties in the shootout. The losers’ punishment for playing it too safe: having to take part in Saturday’s third-place playoff. Sunday’s final between Africa’s two highest-ranked teams promises to bring the curtain down in style. Morocco are seeking their first continental title since 1976, and carrying the expectations of a nation. Senegal have been there before, winning their first Afcon crown in 2021 to end years of anguish. It’s the best attacking side against the strongest defence, and is all but guaranteed to go to the wire: in the 21st century, nobody has won an Afcon final by more than a single goal, and six of the 13 showpiece games have gone to penalties. Truly, this is football heritage.All of which makesCaf’s decisionto switch Afcon to every four years from 2028 even more baffling and disappointing. The change was announced on the eve of the tournament, and several African football federations allege they were not consulted. “We’re killing ourselves,” one anonymous suit told Big Website. “If there had been a general assembly, it would never have passed.” The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino,first pushed for the change back in 2020, despite claiming three years later that “we need way more and not less competitions, we want football to develop worldwide”. We’re not sure how cutting back one of the planet’s best international tournaments fits into that masterplan, but what do we know?QUOTE OF THE DAY“A decision has already been taken, months ago. I had a meeting with Steve [Parish] in October, the international break. We had a very long talk, and I told him I will not sign a new contract. We agreed at the time it was best to keep it between us. It’s the best that we could do that and keep it confidential for three months. But now it’s important to have clarity, and we had a very busy schedule so that’s why we didn’t want to talk about it.

Xiao could not reproduce the form thathelped him see off Mark Selby 6-2 in the first round.Xiao had chances in the first frame but failed to put away a routine blue to the middle and split the pack for his opponent. Some dreadful misses and poor safety play did not help as he struggled to make any progress.Wu fashioned a break of 84 as he took the fifth frame before rounding off a comprehensive victory with a run of 97.“It is definitely a dream stage for me from since I was a little kid,” Wu told BBC Sport. “I just told myself to enjoy every moment of this match and give my best and obviously it is a great performance.”Explore more on these topicsSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

He arrived after Darren Fletcher’s two-game spell in charge that took in a Premier League draw at Burnley and an FA Cup third-round defeat by Brighton at Old Trafford.United wish to assess several candidates for the permanent head coach role in the summer. Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto De Zerbi, Andoni Iraola, and Oliver Glasner, who confirmed on Friday he will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the season, are among the names in the frame.Carrick played for United for 12 years, was a coach for three years before departing in December 2021, having also managed the team for three matches after Ole ­Gunnar ­Solskjær’s sacking in November that year, and indicated on Friday that he wants his return to the club to be long term.“I’m here because I enjoy the role and I wanted to do it and I’m hugely privileged to be in this position,” said the 44-year-old. “It doesn’t change whatever the term or whatever the length.”There have been no discussions with Omar Berrada, the chief executive, and Jason Wilcox, the director of football, regarding Carrick’s long-term future. “We’re realistic about where we are at the moment, why I’m here,” said the former ­midfielder. “That doesn’t change how we go about it in the day-to-day and the focus and making decisions for the long term. All I can control is what we give the players and how we create the atmosphere around the group. We’ll see what happens after that.”Given the turmoil after Amorim’s sacking and United being out of both domestic cup competitions, meaning, at 40 games, this will be their shortest season since the 1914-15 campaign, it was put to Carrick that the club has lost its soul. “I certainly don’t think it’s soulless,” he said. “There’s a magic around this place. Results and ­sometimes from the outside things look a little different but it certainly doesn’t feel majorly different on the inside.”Fletcher described the squad as having fragile confidence. ­Carrick was asked how he has tried to change this before Saturday’s visit of ­Manchester City. “It’s funny, confidence, because you can sometimes get it from a moment or a situation and all of a sudden it sparks,” he said.“When you’re confident and in the zone everything happens slower and everything is clear and you’re calm. Sometimes when you want something so much you can almost over try and it over affects you at times. We’re here to support the players and hopefully they’ve felt that the last few days.”United are seventh in the Premier League on 32 points, three places and three points off Liverpool in fourth, and Carrick was asked if he would deem it a personal failure if he could not guide United to ­Champions League qualification in the next four months. “You’ve got to be careful about what’s a success and what’s a failure. I think it’s not as clearcut as that,” he said.Carrick shrugged off Roy Keane’s jibe regarding his wife “probably doing the team talk” at United by claiming it does not bother him.Keane made the comment about Lisa Carrick on the Stick To Football podcast. The Irishman was ­responding to Jamie Carragher’s comment that United should not have employed Carrick as interim head coach for a second time. “Well, his wife can always come in because she’s got a bit of a big mouth ­sometimes. She’s probably doing the team talk,” Keane said.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreThe comment was a clear reference to the fallout that occurred between Keane and Lisa Carrick in ­February 2014 after the former criticised Michael Carrick’s display and post-game comments ­following ­United’s 2-0 Champions League defeat against ­Olympiakos. Lisa Carrick responded with a social media post that read: “Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.”“Honestly, it didn’t bother me,” said Carrick in response.Quick GuideNow for manager No 6.

Egypt face Nigeria in a third-place play-off in Casablanca after suffering another loss to a Sadio Mané-inspired Senegalin the semi-finals. The 33-year-old Salah travelled to Morocco with uncertainty surrounding his future having accused the club of throwing him “under the bus” after a poor run of results and claiming he no longer had a relationship with Slot. Liverpool are unbeaten in the 11 matches since Slot first dropped Salahat West Ham.With Alexander Isaksidelined with a leg fractureand Slot’s options limited on the right of his attack, Liverpool’s head coach hopes Salah can be involved in Wednesday’s fixture in the south of France. “That is something we are talking about together now,” Slot said. “He is back next week. We are in talks with him about what is expected of him over there, what is expected over here. But first of all he needs to play another big game for Egypt on Saturday.“I am happy that he comes back. Mo has been so important for this club, for me, so I am happy that he is back. Even if I had 15 attackers I still would have been happy if he came back but that is not our current situation.”Slot would not be drawn on whether the issues between Salah and himself – or Salah andLiverpool– have been ironed out during his five weeks on international duty. “What happens between Mo and me, on the phone or over here, stays between the two of us and I don’t think it is necessary for me to share all the private conversations I have,” Slot said.Meanwhile, Slot has insisted Liverpool will not panic buy this month but could act if their injury situation worsens or the right opportunity arises. The Premier League champions saw a £35m deal for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guéhi collapse last deadline day and have since lost two defenders, Conor Bradley and Giovanni Leoni, to season-ending knee injuries. Despite those injuries Liverpool did not revive their interest in Guéhi, who is close to joining Manchester City for £20m as they saw no value in a January deal for a player who is out of contract in the summer. Slot suggested defensive reinforcements are not an urgent priority.“I am surprised people are so focused on our last line. Do you think we have more options in the front?,” Slot said. “Everyone is aligned and everyone knows what the challenges are. That is not to say there is no possibility for us to act because as you know this club has always waited for the right moment and never from a position of panic. We always do the right things at the right moment.“At this moment there are only the three players who are out with long-term injuries. We have shown last season and in the summer window how we act. It is a meticulous process and it is not done in two weeks. But if there is an opportunity in the market or things get even worse then we can have a different situation.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

The centre-back’s ­contract expires at the end of the season and Palace have accepted an offer of £20m.Palace’s manager, Oliver Glasner, said on Friday that the deal was in its final stages, on a day when he also revealed he would beleaving the club in the summer. Guéhi, he said, would not be involved in Palace’s game at Sunderland on Saturday. “I can’t ­confirm a club, because it’s still not done, but it’s in the final stages,” Glasner said. “The result is that Marc doesn’t play tomorrow for us.”The England international almost joined Liverpool in the summer beforePalace pulled out of the deal. Personal terms are not thought to be an issue for Guéhi, who has said he would not extend his Palace deal.City have injuries in central defence. Rúben Dias is out with a hamstring injury, Josko Gvardiol has a tibial fracture and John Stones, who is unlikely to have his contract renewed in the summer, is out with a thigh problem. Pep Guardiola was forced to recall the 20-year-old Max Alleyne from a loan at Watford to help alleviate the shortage.Guéhi’s former club Chelsea will be due 20% of any fee, as part of the package that took him to Palace in 2021. Barcelona have held talks over signing Guéhi and Bayern Munich expressed interest in getting him on a free but they have been usurped by City.Guéhi is in line to be City’s second signing of the window afterAntoine Semenyo joined from Bournemouthfor an initial £62.5m.City have drawn their past three Premier League matches and Erling Haaland has not scored from open play since 20 December to leave them six points behind Arsenal, the ­leaders, going into Saturday’s­ Manchester derby. Guardiola is unhappy with the ­officiating around Haaland, whom he feels needs more protection.Oliver Glasner confirms he will leave Crystal Palace role in summerRead more“God bless that we have Erling in our team right now and all of the ­season – we are fortunate to have him and without him we would not be in the position we are in now,” ­Guardiola said. “He brings a lot and is getting better at many, many things. There are a lot of games and it is an ­incredible period for games. Every three days there is a match, recovery is less with travel, tough conditions, central defenders tough. It is difficult. But he’ll be back.”He then said sarcastically: “He is the only striker in the world that makes more fouls than defenders do on him. That is his biggest ­attribute. That is really good. He is the only striker in my life that he makes more fouls to defenders than defenders to him. I’ve never seen this. At the beginning of the season the referee said it would be the opposite. But it is the opposite of that.”Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowManchester CityCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

Glasnersaid last weekhe was planning further talks with Parish to resolve his future but revealed in the buildup to Palace’s game at Sunderland on Saturday that he would be leaving the club.Oliver Glasner’s inevitable exit compounds one of Crystal Palace’s worst ever weeks | Ed AaronsRead more“A decision has already been taken, months ago,” said Glasner. “I had a meeting with Steve in October, the international break. We had a very long talk, and I told him: ‘I will not sign a new contract.’ We agreed at the time it was best to keep it between us. It’s the best that we could do that and keep it confidential for three months. But now it’s important to have ­clarity, and we had a very busy schedule so that’s why we didn’t want to talk about it. Steve and I want the best forCrystal Palace.”He also revealed that Guéhi would not be part of Palace’s squad that travels to the north-east, with City closing in on signing the England defender. He said: “My latest understanding is that a deal with Marc is in the final stages. I can’t confirm a club, because it’s still not done but it’s in the final stages. The result is that Marc doesn’t play tomorrow for us.”Glasner said Jean-Philippe Mateta, the leading scorer, would also be allowed to leave for the right offer. Juventus are interested but have not met Palace’s demands. “It’s the same [as Guéhi],” Glasner said of Mateta. “There will be a price that Crystal Palace [accept], with 18 months left on his contract. We’d do the deal, if JP wants. If nobody pays that price, then he will stay.”Palace have offered Angers €20m (£17.3m) for Sidiki Chérif and are ­confident the 19-year-old striker wants to join.Glasner, whowon the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurtin 2022, made no secret of his dissatisfaction with Palace’s squad as the club embarked on their first European campaign, in the Conference League. The 51-year-old hinted before thehumiliating defeat by Macclesfieldin the FA Cup last week that his future might lie elsewhere when he said nothing that happened in the transfer window would affect his decision on whether to stay. He insisted on Friday that his relationship with Parish remained strong.“We have a great relationship and we’re always talking about what is best for Crystal Palace,” he said.“I haven’t spoken to any other club, I told the players that and promised them today I will give my best to give the best season in Crystal Palace history, the best points tally in history. We are now four points better off than we were at this stage of the season and we will do everything to bring another trophy back to Selhurst Park. We had the Conference League draw today, we will play Zrinjski Mostar from Bosnia in the playoff draw and I had a look at the draw tree – it’ll be quite interesting who we could play in our section.”Palace are understood to have started the process of finding a replacement for Glasner, with Getafe’s José Bordalás,Iñigo Pérezof Rayo Vallecano and Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna among the names who could be considered. McKenna was a candidate when Roy Hodgson left Selhurst Park in February 2024 before Glasner was appointed.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

Los Angeles’ previous big move of the offseason was signing former New York Mets closer Edwin Díaz, widely considered to be the best reliever on the free agent market, to bolster their subpar bullpen.The Dodgers will welcome Tucker’s exceptional bat for the heart of their order, but he also fixes one of their few roster deficiencies as an everyday corner outfielder after Michael Conforto and several others largely struggled last season in left field. Tucker seems likely to play right field for Los Angeles, allowing the club to move Teoscar Hernández back to left.The Mets and the Toronto Blue Jays, who lost to the Dodgers in last year’s World Series, were believed to be in the mix for Tucker’s services. “Let me know when you see smoke,” Mets owner Steve Cohen posted on X on Thursday, before following with a second post clarifying that he was “waiting for a decision”.When healthy, Tucker is among the best all-around players in the majors. But he played in just 214 regular-season games over the past two years.He batted .266 with 22 homers and 73 RBIs with the Chicago Cubs last season. He was acquired in a blockbuster trade with Houston in December 2024 that moved slugging prospect Cam Smith to the Astros.Tucker was slowed by a pair of injuries in his lone season with the Cubs. He sustained a small fracture in his right hand on an awkward slide against Cincinnati on 1 June. He also strained his left calf against Atlanta on 2 September.After getting off to a fast start with his new team, Tucker hit just .231 with five homers in 41 games after the All-Star break. He served as Chicago’s designated hitter in the playoffs as the Cubs eliminated San Diego in the first round before losing to Milwaukee in a five-game NL Division Series.Tucker, who turns 29 on Saturday, rejected a $22,025,000 qualifying offer in November, so his new deal means the Cubs will get a compensatory draft pick – likely in the No 77-80 range.Tucker was selected by Houston with the No 5 pick in the 2015 amateur draft. He played in three World Series with the Astros, winning a ring in 2022.He hit at least 29 homers and drove in at least 92 runs for three straight seasons from 2021-23. He won a Gold Glove in 2022 and led the AL with 112 RBIs in 2023.He was limited to 78 games in his final season with Houston because of a fractured right shin, but he hit .289 with 23 homers and 49 RBIs.The Tampa, Florida, native is a .273 hitter with 147 homers, 490 RBIs and an .865 OPS in 769 career games. He also has 119 steals in 135 attempts.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles DodgersMLBBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Several changes were made to Wikipedia pages by a network of editors, allegedly controlled by a contractor working on Portland’s behalf.According to an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), Portland outsourced Wikipedia editing relating to some of its high-profile clients, including the state of Qatar.TBIJ said it had evidence of alleged Wikipedia edits made on behalf of Portland between 2016 and 2024. Between 2016 and 2021, many were made by Web3 Consulting, which is run by a consultant allegedly used by Portland to make edits.Portland was founded by Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, in 2001. There is no suggestion that Allan personally ordered any changes to be made or was aware of them. He sold most of his shares in the company in 2012 and left Portland in 2019. He was contacted for comment.A spokesperson for Portland said: “Portland does not have a relationship with the firm mentioned and has a policy of strict adherence to the guidelines on all social media platforms.”A Portland employee said: “If anyone who worked here in the past did this, they were foolish. For sure nobody does it today.”TBIJ said some of the alleged edits were designed to improve Qatar’s image by burying references to critical reporting before the 2022 World Cup.The intermediary is alleged to have removed suggestions that a billion-dollar philanthropy project linked to another Portland client had failed to achieve its mission.TBIJ found other subtle changes, such as relegating unwelcome information about clients under descriptions of their philanthropic work, or swapping out critical news references to articles with something more positive.Undisclosed paid advocacy on Wikipedia, also known as “black hat” editing,violates the terms of use set out by The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit body that supports the online encyclopedia.The practice of institutions, states and individuals finessing their Wikipedia pages to improve their image is frowned on by the PR industry.Guidelines on the use of “dark arts” in relation to Wikipedia, written by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), state: “Intentional deceit and anonymous or incognito activities are breaches of professional codes of conduct.” The CIPR is a voluntary members-based association to which Portland has not signed up.The rise of AI chatbots and summaries have made Wikipedia pages even more influential, as they are often a source for the tools.Portland has a history of making Wikipedia edits. In 2012,it was found to have made alterationson behalf of the company that produces Stella Artois, removing references on Wikipedia to an unwanted nickname, “wife beater”.At the time, it said the changes had been made openly and within Wikipedia’s rules.However, former employees told TBIJ that Portland instead began to contract out edits of Wikipedia, with one telling its reporters: “No one said: ‘We should stop doing this’. The question was how we could keep doing it without getting caught.”Several of its sources claimed Portland commissioned a web consultant, Radek Kotlarek, whose network of accounts made Wikipedia changes. TBIJ said seven Portland insiders said Kotlarek’s services were used.Kotlarek was contacted for comment, but did not respond.The TBIJ’s investigation claimed to have identified a network of 26 accounts making edits. They were linked to Web3 Consulting, Kotlarek’s company. TBIJ said that while its sources were confidential, it had been able to corroborate their information using the public record of Wikipedia edits.All accounts in this network that were still active in 2024 were blocked by volunteer Wikipedia editors, who investigated their activity.Six former Portland employees involved in some of the Qatar work reportedly said that Wikipedia edits were a common request. They claimed that Portland hired subcontractors to target pages related to Qatar’s human rights record, particularly around World Cup stadium-building.Some changes were performed by accounts outside the Web3 network.Companies other than Portland also worked on major accounts such as the Qatar government’s public relations.Allan has faced controversy since becoming Downing Street’s executive director of communications at the start of September, as part of Starmer’s attempt at a government-wide reset. Heretains a financial stakein another PR firm, Strand Partners, but has said he will not to take dividends or become involved in running the company while in government. He also resigned as chair on his appointment to No 10.He has also pushed for sweeping changes to political journalists’ access to Downing Street,including scrapping one of the two daily briefingswith the prime minister’s official spokesperson.In an email last month, Allan said the changes were necessary because the media landscape had been “utterly transformed”, making existing arrangements “not fit for purpose”. The group that represents political journalists was not consulted on the plan.Journalists warned the move towards ad hoc press conferences could restrict access and scrutiny.Explore more on these topicsWikipedianewsShareReuse this content"

They are exposed to the child sex abuse material, executions, war and drug use. Their job is to make sure this content doesn’t reach TikTok’s 30 million monthly users. It is high pressure and low paid. They wanted input into their workflows and more say over how they kept the platform safe. They said they were being asked to do too much with too few resources.”A TikTok spokesperson said: “These changes were part of a wider global reorganisation, as we evolve our global operating model for trust and safety with the benefit of technological advancements to continue maximising safety for our users.”The dispute began in August 2025, when the union had been poised to ballot several hundred of TikTok’s moderators and quality assurance agents from the trust and safety team, whose job was to vet posts for compliance with TikTok’s rules – including traumatic posts processed at high speed. TikTok announced a restructuring exercise that put members of the proposed bargaining unit at risk of redundancy, according to the legal claim.Rosa Curling, a co-executive director of the tech justice non-profit Foxglove, which is backing the action, called TikTok’s treatment of its content moderators “appalling”.She said by “laying off essential safety workers they are putting the platforms’ users at risk”, adding: “TikTok has made its position clear: union busting and trampling on our labour laws comes first – the safety of its users, including millions of children, and the wellbeing of its essential safety workers, comes last. We hope the employment tribunal will force them to change course.”According to TikTok, its increasing use of AI has reduced moderators’ exposure to graphic content by 76% in the past year.Michael Newman, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “This case is an important example of how individuals who band together can stand up to the might of big tech firms, and especially of how the fig leaf of AI cost savings should not be allowed to obscure vital safety concerns.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokEmployment lawSocial mediaEmployment tribunalsAI (artificial intelligence)Trade unionsDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

It was also possible to post this adult content on to X’s public platform without any sign of it being moderated, meaning the clip could be viewed within seconds by anyone with an account.Grok AI: what do limits on tool mean for X, its users and UK media watchdog?Read moreIt appeared to offer a straightforward workaround torestrictions announcedby Elon Musk’s social network this week. These had been welcomed by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, who had described the photographs generated by Grok as “disgusting” and “shameful”.After weeks of rising public concern, X said late on Wednesday it had “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”.It said the restriction would apply to all users, including paid subscribers, and it had “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content”. But it did not specify whether people would still be able to create such images on the standalone Grok app, and then share this material publicly on X.The Guardian found that this standalone version of Grok, known as Grok Imagine – which is easily accessible through a web browser – was still responding to prompts to digitally remove the clothes from images of women.Reporters uploaded still images of fully clothed real-life women, and prompted the AI tool to dress them in bikinis. The platform responded by going further than the request, to create short videos of the women removing their clothes in the manner of a sexually provocative striptease.X has been contacted for comment.Rebecca Hitchen, the head of policy and campaigns at the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said such a simple workaround should not be possible.“The continued ease of access to sophisticated nudification tools clearly demonstrates that X isn’t taking the issue of online violence against women and girls seriously enough,” she said.Hitchen called on the UK government andOfcom, the media regulator, to pressure X and other platforms “to stop the proliferation of image-based sexual abuse”.Reuters has also reported that its journalists, including a reporter in Britain, used Grok to create on-demand sexualised photos after the announcements by X.“It’s hard to believe that xAI and Elon Musk can’t work out how to prevent these images from being spewed out by Grok,” said Penny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society. “First, Musk decided the solution was to preserve nudification as a privilege only for those users who pay for X. Then he pledged to stop it entirely. And yet it has not stopped.“The truth is Musk and the tech sector simply do not prioritise safety or dignity in the products they create. It’s a pretty low bar for women to expect that they can converse online without men undressing them. And yet seemingly even that is impossible.”While Downing Street had said it felt “vindicated” by the steps X had taken, there was also caution among ministers about the extent of the changes and how they would be delivered.On Thursday, Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, who had described the sexual manipulation of images of women and children as “despicable and abhorrent”, welcomed the move and thanked “those who have spoken out against this abuse, above all the victims”.However, she added: “I will expect the facts to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom’s ongoing investigation.”Starmer also demanded X to act without delay. “Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent,” he said. “Young women’s images are not public property, and their safety is not up for debate. I welcome that X is now acting to ensure full compliance with UK law – it must happen immediately.”Ofcom said its formal investigation into X,launched on Monday, remained ongoing and it was “working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what’s being done to fix it”.Canada’s privacy watchdog said it was investigating xAI, while authorities in the Philippines said they were moving to block Grok, with Malaysian authorities planning to take legal action.But the controversy may have been helpful for boosting public awareness of Grok. On Thursday, Musk shared a post claiming “popularity and real world usage are skyrocketing globally” – alongside a graph of “Grok” as a search term hitting a new high on Google Trends. Musk simply added: “Try Grok.com.”A government spokesperson said: “The Online Safety Act already requires platforms like X to prevent illegal content, including nonconsensual intimate images and child abuse material, from appearing on their services.“The secretary of state has said she expects X’s compliance with UK laws to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom’s investigation, which is already under way, and the government will not rest until social media companies meet their legal duties.“We are also taking further action through the proposed ‘nudification’ offence, which will target tools designed specifically to generate nonconsensual intimate images.”Explore more on these topicsGrok AIAI (artificial intelligence)Social mediaXInternet safetyOfcomnewsShareReuse this content"

We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”It said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.In December, Australiaimplemented a social media ban for peopleunder the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed thatmore than 4.7m accounts had been removedacross 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.Earlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he wasopen to a social media ban for young peoplein the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.The prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed atreportsof five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.Starmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.Earlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong,called for more rights for parentsto access social media accounts of their children if they die.The European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.TikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.In 2023, aGuardian investigationfound that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.Explore more on these topicsTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaTechnology sectorEuropean UnionEuropeYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.Lord Vallance spoke as a government unit helping to deploy new technologies in Britain announced robots and defence as new sectors receiving its support.He said factories and warehouses, already at the forefront of robot deployment, will undergo further change as a result of the new generation of humanoid robots.“Activities that require movement around warehouses and factories, or those sorts of things that can be made robotic, will be made robotic. I think they will be made robotic in many cases and therefore, will change the nature of those jobs. That’s going to be the first wave,” he said.Meanwhile, theLondon mayor, Sadiq Khan, has warnedthat AI could “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.Speaking in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday, Khan said artificial intelligence coulddestroy a significant amount of jobsin London unless ministers act to help replace jobs taken over by the technology.Grok scandal highlights how AI industry is ‘too unconstrained’, tech pioneer saysRead moreAsked to comment on Khan’s speech, Vallance said robots would take away “repetitive” tasks. “You take away some of the things which are less interesting, repetitive things that can be done in another way,” he said.Vallance, formerly the government’s chief scientific adviser, added that the example of robotics assisting in surgery showed how the technology can enhance jobs.“Robotics is not displacing surgeons, it’s radically improving how those surgeons work and allowing things to be done with more precision,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe government is investing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe government announced on Friday that the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is expanding its remit to defence tech and robotics, with the aim of slashing red tape for companies operating in those spaces.The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is also releasing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses. These hubs will offer companies advice on using robots and live demonstrations. “The RIO will aim to streamline overlapping requirements to bring products to market safely, but more quickly, to improve lives and grow our economy,” it said.The department added that autonomous drones could benefit from the wider RIO remit. Such technology could require separate approvals for aviation, data protection, and sector-specific safety rules, in an expensive process that could take months.Vallance was speaking during a visit to Humanoid, a UK-based robotics company that has already deployed its prototypes in a factory operated by German industrial group Siemens.Adam Kelsall, Humanoid’s head of product management, said the company welcomed “anything that gets us into the real world and testing [robots] sooner”.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)RobotsComputingPatrick VallanceUnemploymentSadiq KhannewsShareReuse this content"

I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”Foddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors:I spent a weeklast year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.Baby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! Andyouwill suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He wouldnevergo outside for a hike.”View image in fullscreenPre-hike Nate in his onesie in his parents’ basement: unprepared and out of shape.Photograph: Devolver DigitalNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.Talking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.Like (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Baby Steps developers Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzillo, and Bennett Foddy.Photograph: Boch/Cuzillo/FoddyFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”Another of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.As they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker ofDespelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.View image in fullscreenNate and Mike, mid mountain climb.Photograph: Devolver DigitalBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”There is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding theplayerwould be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s somethingheloves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”The inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”That is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way youareNate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.Baby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.After Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

The real danger is from his administrationFri 16 Jan 2026 13.21 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 13.36 ESTShareIn Minnesota, armed and masked agents areripping families apart. They are seizing parents while theywait with their child at a bus stop, going door to door seeking undocumented migrants and breaking car windows to drag people out. Last Wednesday an officer shot dead Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen. Her killing is a tragedyfor all who loved her, and most of all for the three children left motherless. It also marks her country’s crossing of a Rubicon.Where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) once preferred to keep a low profile, it now seeks publicity and confrontation – pumped up onbillions of dollarsin funding, the aggression and brazenness of the administration and thelicensing of bigotry.While statistics show that violent and property crime rateshave plungedsince the 1990s, Mr Trump has conjured a threat of American carnage, and an enemy responsible: undocumented migrants – and, increasingly, those who stand with them. Fear is an instrument. The administration will struggle to meet its target of removing 1 million undocumented migrants a year unless people are frightened into “self‑deporting”, and sympathisers are frightened out of offering support. Most Americans – and the majority of independent voters –think Mr Trump’s deportation drive is excessive. But Republican-aligned voters disagree, and a third think he has not gone far enough.Undocumented migrants are frightened to leave their homes, fearing they may not see their families again. US citizens of colour are increasingly affected, with a Septembersupreme court rulingseeminglyinterpreted by ICEas allowing detention solely on the basis of race and ethnicity. Racism, militarisation and the impunity of law enforcement are familiar themes: police killed 1,379 people in the US in 2024, and victims were almost three times more likely to be black than white. But this drive is all the more shocking because being an undocumented migrantis a civil not a criminal offenceand ICE officers have limited detention powers. It is not clear that theyeven had the authorityto demand that Ms Good leave her car.In smearing her as a “deranged leftist” and “domestic terrorist”,investigating herwidow, and claiming that there is “absolute immunity” for the officer who shot her, the administration is not only willing to vilify the apparently unlikely Republican targetof a white middle-class mother, but is exposing its broader political agenda. That videos lay bare the lies is irrelevant. Opponents need not believe – only comply.In Trumpism, rules and restraint are portrayed as a corruption of the people’s will instead of the essence of American democracy. A man who pardoned supporters for an actual insurrection seeking to keep him in power nowthreatens to invoke the Insurrection Actto quell protests. In October, the presidenttold generals: “It’s a war from within.” ICE has been transformed into a paramilitary force apparently answerable only to Mr Trump. Imagineits potential usesin future.Little wonder that Minnesotans say thisfeels like an invasion, and the state’s governor, Tim Walz, describes it as an occupation. The communities who are now defending and supporting each other are not only challenging the demonisation, mistreatment and removal of undocumented migrants. They are pushing back against the fear on which Trumpism feeds and the manufacturing of a crisis which would consume many more victims.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last time around, this was when the Washington “grownups” debated his capacity to be president, notably in the final fortnight of his presidency, after theJanuary 6 Capitol insurrection. Under the constitution, a president can be replaced should the vice-president and a cabinet majority decide their leader is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. The trouble today is that there are no grownups.The US president’s designs on Greenland are clearly mad. He claims Russia and China are scheming to seize the island and that Denmark should be forced urgently to transfer its sovereignty. Denmark had long allowed the US extendedmilitary access to Greenland, but Trump seems to want to own it. None of his staff has been able to say why.Until now it would have seemed a comic satire for Norway, Sweden, France and Germany to be sending troops to Greenland, pending a possible US attack. Yet that is the absurd prospect happening this week. Britain even sent a military officer. This has come within weeks of Trump’s leadership putsch in Venezuela, and within days of his threatened military assault on Iran. In the latter he appeared to claim victory, saying Iranhad stoppedusing its armed troops to suppress street protests. It happens that Trump has effectively been doing the samein Minnesota. He has had a hectic fortnight.There is no justification for Trump’s attempted grab ofGreenland. Under the Nato alliance there is full defence cooperation between the US and Denmark, as with Canada, which he has also threatened. Trump appears to be like a shoplifting addict who cannot resist a quick grab – an oilfield here, a critical minerals mine there. It is hard to believe he will not back off, but when?View image in fullscreenMembers of the Danish armed forces on a military drill in Greenland, 17 September 2025.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersWise leaders have advisers. Reckless ones have sycophants. Most American presidents claim to be non-interventionists, but when dressed in the robes of military might they find it hard to resist flaunting them. As with George W Bush in Iraq, Trump’s “mission accomplished” press conference after Venezuela two weeks ago clearly exhilarated him. His army had just reportedlykilled more than 100 peoplein Caracas, but he looked as if he had won the lottery.When the US decides to set the world to rights, no one but the US can stop it. But the rights seldom emerge as such. They more often end as a vast expenditure of blood and money, justified by senseless talk of freedom and national security. This is despite the fact that, of all countries, the US must be the most unthreatened.Sooner or later the US’s antique but resilient constitution will exert itself. Its central curb on presidential power remains the term limit. In three years, Trump will be gone. Before then, this year’s midterm elections seem certain to bring Congress some revival of confidence and thus balance of power. Assuming no 25th-amendment moment, Trump’s remaining years are likely to be dominated by an ever more eccentric vanity and growing domestic antipathy.Meanwhile, what allies should not do is fall into Trump’s own trap, relying on the vacuities of national security to seal every argument and jeer every opponent. China and Russia may persist in their neurotic “grey-zone” aggressions, but the glee with which western defence lobbies use them to talk up the prospect of a “third world war” merely raises the temperature and generates fear.China does not pose an existential threat to Britain. It never has and I cannot believe it ever will. Meanwhile, Russia’s borderlands have always been unstable. Before the current war, Russia had attacked Georgia and Ukraine in the past 20 years, without the west reacting militarily. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was outrageous and the west was right to help it defend itself. But that is quite different from declaring Russia a threat to Britain’s territorial security.As Henry Kissinger and many Kremlinologists warned, Nato’s decision to advance its umbrella to Russia’s borders after the collapse of the Soviet Union was a severe test of Russian paranoia. Yet Russia has never responded by invading a Nato country, despite the incessant warnings of the defence lobby that it still might. The efforts of the former British army chief, Lord Dannatt, and others to portray Ukraine as just an overture toa third world warmerely adds to Russia’s belligerence. I sometimes feel the military establishment craves war.This is why Greenland matters. Clearly east-west relations – or rather emotions – are at an alarmingly tender stage. But portraying Russian tanks as about to race acrossEuropewill hardly reduce the tension. A dispute over Greenland could split Nato and severely weaken it. If ever a crisis merited stalling and slow diplomacy, this is it. When tub-thumping generals and politicians seize the microphone from diplomats and peacemakers, all sanity vanishes.In the past four years Ukraine has turned its border with Russia into a global battlefield between tyranny and freedom. But its dispute with Russia need have nothing to do with Nato. Of course Britons may want to assist other countries when fate or geography leads them into harm. But this has nothing to do with Britain’s national security. Defence is so expensive it should at least mean what it says on the tin.Keir Starmer has promised to divert billions of pounds from his domestic budget intohiring soldiers and buying weapons. This is in order to send soldiersto Ukraine(and possibly even Greenland) so he can look good on his next foreign trip. He should not do so. They have nothing to do with the defence of Britain.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist and the author ofA Short History of America: From Tea Party to TrumpExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGreenlandDenmarkEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

That question captivated the world for the past two weeks, as the US president issued bellicose threats warning the Iranian regime not to crack down on nationwide protests demanding economic and social reforms. On Tuesday, as he was scheduled to be briefed by Pentagon officials on various options for a strike, Trumpposted a messageon social media urging Iranians to continue their demonstrations and take over government institutions. The president signaled that he was leaning toward ordering an attack, telling protesters that “help is on its way”.But by Wednesday, Trumppulled backfrom the brink of a military intervention, saying he had received assurances from “very important sources” that Iran had stopped killing protesters and was not moving forward with executions. A group of US allies in theMiddle East– including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Turkey – seem to have succeeded in a last-ditch effortto convince Trumpnot to launch airstrikes against Tehran, warning it could unleash a wider conflict in the region. While many Sunni-led Arab states resent Shia Iran’s influence in the Arab world, they are also worried about retaliatory attacks by Iran and its allies, an influx of refugees and a civil war that could lead to the collapse of the Iranian state.For now, the Iranian regime appears to have squashed the protests with abloody crackdownthat has killed thousands and isolated the country from the world by shutting off international phone and internet access. But the theocratic regime that took power after Iran’s 1979 revolution has a long history of biding its time and failing to heed the grievances of its people, leaving Iranians caught between continued repression and potential US intervention.Whether or not Trump invades Greenland, this much is clear: the western order we once knew is history | Timothy Garton AshRead moreTrump could still order some kind of attack on Iran in the coming weeks – if not missiles, perhaps a cyber-attack directed at the country’s security apparatus – partly to save face. Because of his posts on Truth Social, the media platform he owns, Trump cornered himself into following through on his threats to take military action. On 2 January,the president laid outa red line, warning the Iranian government that if it “violently kills peaceful protesters” the US “would come to their rescue”.As the protests widened and the regime’s crackdown intensified, Trump’s aides said he began tofeel obligedto carry out an attack on Iran. In his first term, Trump criticized past US presidents who he claimedhad shown weaknessby failing to enforce similar red lines, especially Barack Obama, who decided not to attack the regime of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad after it used chemical weapons against its own people in 2013. (During his first term, Trump orderedtwo sets of strikesagainst Syrian government forces for their use of chemical weapons in 2017 and 2018.)Trump admires strongmen and authoritarian leaders – and he is loath to project signs of weakness, even if an attack on Iran leads to retaliation against US military bases in the Middle East, or provokes Tehranto close offthe strait of Hormuz, a vital trade route, through which more than a fifth of the world’s oil supply passes each day. In other words, Trump could risk a military intervention that destabilizes the Middle East, and disrupts global oil prices, so that he doesn’t lose face and appear weak.Trump has also been emboldened by his apparent military success in Venezuela, where on 3 January, US special forces attacked Caracas to depose and abduct the president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to New York to stand trial. Since then,Trump has saidthe US could oversee Venezuela, and control its vast oil resources, for years.Trump also used the shock of his Venezuela gambit to issuenew threats againstCuba, Colombia and Mexico – warning they could all be next in his quest for dominance of the western hemisphere. And Trump’s demand for the US to own Greenland – once dismissed as trolling or a distraction – has shaken Europe in new ways after the attack on Venezuela.Trump doesn’t have an overarching strategic policy or goal. He is motivated by showmanship, vengeance and self-aggrandizementOver the past two weeks, Trump showed the world that he’s willing to back up his grandiose threats and imperial ambitions with military action. But most Americans are opposed to foreign interventions, with only a third supporting the US military strike on Venezuela,according to a pollconducted in the days after the raid that captured Maduro. Anotherrecent poll, by Quinnipiac University, showed that 70% of Americans oppose military action in Iran.The US public is tired of foreign interventions, and a segment of Trump’s supporters voted for him because heportrayed himselfas the “candidate of peace” who would end America’s legacy of forever wars. In hisinaugural addresslast year, Trump pledged to establish himself as a global peacemaker who would avoid starting new wars and resolve ongoing conflicts, including those in Ukraine and Gaza. “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,” he said.So far in his second term,Trump has bombedYemen, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia and Venezuela. Trump’s warmongering ignores the exhaustion of his own electorate – not to mention the constitutional reality that the power to declare war rests with Congress, rather than a presidential post on Truth Social. And while some of Trump’s acolytes argue that he’s making effective use of Richard Nixon’s“madman theory” of foreign relations– in which a president will act in unpredictable, or volatile, ways as a tactic to throw his adversaries off balance – Trump doesn’t have an overarching strategic policy or goal. He is motivated by showmanship, vengeance and self-aggrandizement.Like much of his foreign policy, Trump’s approach towardIranhas been chaotic and contradictory. In 2018, during his first term, he unilaterally withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions that crippled the Iranian economy. Trump tore up the 2015 agreement, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and five other world powers, and had provided Tehran with relief from international sanctions in exchange for limits on its nuclear enrichment.Trumpcalled it“a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made” and insisted he would be able to negotiate a better agreement with Iran. Trump saw himself as the ultimate dealmaker, and reveled in the fact thathe had destroyedone of Obama’s major foreign policy achievements. But Iran was outraged that the US had abandoned the agreement, showed little interest in negotiating with Trump and waited for another US administration to take power. After taking office in 2021, Joe Biden and his aides were too cautious in their dealings with Iran and instead focused much of their energy in the Middle East on brokering a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia – an expansion of the so-called Abraham accords that Trump had initiated between Israel and several Arab states.When he returned to power last year, Trump was eager tonegotiate a new dealwith Tehran: in March, he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suggesting a new round of direct talks. Trump also issued a public threat, warning that if diplomacy failed, Iran’s leaders would be subjected to “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before”. At the same time, Trump dispatched his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to lead a team of US negotiators to meet with top Iranian officials inindirect talksmediated by Oman.As the negotiations got under way, some Iranian officials tried to stroke Trump’s ego, blaming Biden for the failure of previous negotiations – even though Trump had ripped up the original deal. In April, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, publishedan essayin the Washington Post in which he appealed to Trump’s desire to be a peacemaker, writing: “We cannot imagine President Trump wanting to become another US president mired in a catastrophic war in the Middle East.”Iran and the US eventually held five rounds of talks, and were planning on further negotiations until Israel launched asurprise attackin mid-June, killing some of Iran’s top military officials and nuclear scientists, and bombing dozens of targets across the country. Trump then briefly joined the war started by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, when heordered US warplanesto bomb three major nuclear facilities in Iran. While Netanyahu destroyed Trump’s chance at making a new deal with Iran, the Israeli leader appealed to Trump’s desire to be a strongman who can impose his will through military strength.Trump’s perceived success against Iran last year – in which he declared the US had destroyed “all nuclear facilities and capability”, despiteintelligence assessmentsthat showed two of the sites were not as badly damaged as the administration first implied – probably emboldened him to carry out his recent attack on Venezuela. The Iran strikes also reinforced Trump’scontempt for military officerswho have tried to warn him of the risks and repercussions of military action.The president seems to have shelved his plan to attack Iran, for now. But Trump also relishes keeping the world’s attention focused on him – and his astounding power to unleash theUS militaryabroad, whenever and wherever he chooses.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionIranVenezuelaUS militaryUS foreign policyTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

You can stare at a blank wall, obsessively count the hairs on your arm, or, in a true moment of desperation, ponder the state of global fashion. I prefer the last one. I love being on the cutting edge of style, peacocking out in the decaying slopfest that is our planet. A crisp, well-made suit is a cure for all manner of emotionally trying times. I relish being hyper-aware of the goings-on of fashion, so I was one of the first sorry souls to learn of the current global obsession withflimsy canvas Trader Joe’s shopping bags.For those unaware, Trader Joe’s is an American grocery store chain known primarily for its affordable prices, whimsical tropical branding, and heart-attack-inducing parking lots – apparentlydesigned to be smallbecause the stores themselves are so tiny that they can’t justify more spaces. I don’t naturally see the use in swanning about with a tote bag promoting a demolition derby disguised as a market, but I’m not most people.All across the world, eager consumers are seeing price tags ofup to $50,000for a bag I can buy today for $3 that I will then shove into the remaining empty space in my closet and completely forget about every time I go shopping. Such is the fate of most tote bags. It’s a lonely existence, filled with neglect rather than groceries. So, why all the fuss over something so trivial? How did a store for budget-conscious Americans become a status symbol everywhere else?Money bags: would you pay $1,200 for one of Trader Joe’s $2.99 totes?Read moreI almost understand it. When I went to London last summer, I brought back a reusable shopping bag from Waitrose. It’s physical proof that I have been to London and was there long enough to need to stock up a refrigerator. Thus far, on the rare occasion that I recall owning this bag and use it for its intended purpose of carrying food, no one has said a word to me about it. I have turned zero heads, totally shut out from even a hint of praise for my globetrotting. Not once has anyone complimented me on a bag from a nondescript supermarket chain where you can get asix-pack of The Jolly Hog’s Proper Porkers Sausagefor £3.18. Waitrose is simply not fashion, even if I want it to be, but Trader Joe’s is, because it’s … American.Whether we like it or not, America has retained a shred of coolness, despite the best efforts of those in power. Countless American brands became synonymous with hipness in the 20th century – Marlboro, Budweiser, Levi’s, Ford. A staggering 38,000 people were estimated to have waited in line for thefirst McDonald’s in Moscow back in 1990. Surely they were all highly satisfied by the limp patties, haphazardly applied ketchup, and suspiciously symmetrical diced onions after having been deprived of it for so long. That the food tastes like an ageing bathroom sponge wasn’t the point. It was that it was exotic, previously forbidden, and American. It’s probably the same reason people inEast Berlin loved the music of David Hasselhoff. In both cases, I wouldn’t recommend consistent consumption of the product.Culture was always one of America’s greatest strengths on the world stage – movies, music, incredibly disappointing fast food, Baywatch. I’m not saying all of it was good, but it was certainly popular. It made people want to come here. It made other countries jealous of our influence. In the 1980s, amid the cold war, American cinema was stuffed with blatant patriotism in movies like Top Gun and Rocky IV. Only Sylvester Stallone could end hostilities between the United States and the Soviet Union just by punching a guy over and over again.It sure would be fun to get nostalgic over those days, when Americans could actually be proud of their propagandainstead of deeply embarrassed by it. But the truth is, American cultural exports have always hidden the very real problems this country has faced.

That just about sums up the centre-leftFri 16 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 06.26 ESTShareLast weekend, as the world wondered whether Donald Trump would swipe Greenland,Keir Starmermade his own big geographic intervention: he published a map of which councils were fixing potholes.Yes, potholes. Yes,a map. Barely 18 months into office, with crucial elections just ahead and his partylagging behindthe ragtag troops of Nigel Farage and even Kemi Badenoch, this was how Team Starmer kicked off 2026. To be fair, as the young people say, the map is colour-coded.Then the prime minister got tough. Spurred on byfury at Grok, the AI service that doubles as a factory forchild porn, he threatened Elon Musk’s X with losing the “right to self-regulate”. No 10 doubtless considers this fighting talk, but no one would call it action. For that, look to other countries, which simply went ahead andsuspended X.This week, tens of thousands of families and schools and pubs and restaurants across Kent and Sussexhave had no water. For the second time this winter South East Water has deprived customers of one of life’s essentials. So glaring is the company’s failure that Tory MPs – true-blue, laissez-faire, privateer-loving sprogs of Thatcher – are demanding its boss quit, while Ed Davey’s Liberal Democratswant its licence confiscated. So how has Starmer responded? By declaring the fiasco – wait for it – “totally unacceptable”. That’s telling them!This is not another newspaper column on the redundancy of our prime minister, because such pieces are themselves redundant. From day one, the public has been way ahead of most of the press and besides, when the cheap shops are flogging anti-Starmer Christmas cards, you know that next December Downing Street will have a new occupant.Nor am I going to hymn the praises ofDonald Trump, who is, as I may have mentioned here previously, a know-nothing vainglorious bully out to grab what he can for himself, his family and funders. Yet this extremist rightwinger offers the left a profound lesson. He shows us that political power really can matter, provided it is wielded with clarity and purpose.Day after day, the most anti-government president since Ronald Reagan demonstrates the uses of government. And guess what? It turns out that the point of running a country is not to palm off tricky decisions to Ofcom or Ofwat. Not to announce yet another apparently essential policy, duly followed by yet another U-turn. Not to collect material for a crybaby op-ed about how some toughs in Whitehall (sorry, I mean a “political perma-class”) laughed at the size of your majority before legging it with your shiny new mandate.Over the past decade or so, as politics in the UK, the US and elsewhere has become ever more reactionary, people on the left have looked across at their counterparts on the right for ideas. Then they write threads or columns or entire papers about how progressives need to learn TikTok or cut welfare or be a bit racist. The conclusion I draw is rather more basic: the centre-left could do with reminding itself what politics is for.Because for Trump, change isn’t merely a word you slap on the front of a manifesto. He bends both the US and the world to his will – while the centre-left, whether in Washington or further afield, peevishly taps a big sign marked “RULES”.After Trump’s troopsillegally kidnappeda foreign leader, how did the highest-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries,protest?“The Trump administration has not sought congressional authorisation for the use of military force and has failed to properly notify Congress in advance of the operation in Venezuela.” The more basic among us might worry about the morality or the fallout; sophisticates such as Jeffries know that what counts is the process.You can see the same dynamic in Trump’s hounding of Jerome Powell, the head of the US central bank. The president has long attacked his central banker as a “numbskull” fornot cutting interest ratesmore quickly; now his government is investigating him over the spiralling costs of refurbishing the Federal Reserve’s HQ. The pettiness here is rather tired and very squalid – Powell is in any case due to step down this May, while another Fed member, Lisa Cook, has already been hauled up on charges that lookequally baseless. Still, ahead of tough midterms and with his donors on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley swimming in debt, it makes sense for Trump to ram-raid monetary policy. Yet commentators on the centre-left do not point out how such authoritarianism is deployed to empower and enrich an unpopular president and his court. Instead, they tut about the injury done to independent central banking.Exactly when progressives fell into such neoliberal priggishness is a good question – we might start with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder urging their weakened industrial towns to euthanise themselves for the good of globalisation. But it has destroyed their voter base, leaving their chief source of legitimacy as an expertise in the rulebook. So while Trump bashes the Fed and faces down any storm in the bond market, Starmer and his lieutenant, Rachel Reeves, cite the bond market as the chief reason for keeping their jobs.When Andy Burnham decried his party’s subservience to financial marketsa few months ago, he was ridiculed by Labour’s leadership. Yet while his remarks could have done with nuance, they were based on good economic and political sense. Labour cannot govern against its own people and expect to hold on to power. A chancellor cannot devise inflexible rules for herself, then claim those rules as a reason for inertia. And it should not be left solely to a chancer such as Farage to question the unelected power of the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility. Government by wrecking ball – a la Trump – is not the answer, but nor is presiding over a failing status quo.However hard he thumps the table about “delivery”, radicalism is not on Starmer’s agenda. It never was. He and his little men play politics as a game where the instructions are handed down from others and the stakes are miserably low: a purge of some annoying lefties, a few well-paid and unadmirable careers. Government in the hands of these pretenders is about grids, anonymous briefings and “getting both sides around the table”. Oh, and potholes, of course: lovely, tricoloured maps festooned with potholes.All the while, voters in Britain for whom the system isn’t working look across at other leaders and other ideologies where politics is a means of doing things and getting results. However much you deplore Trump and Farage, the counter to their action isn’t to shrug your shoulders. It’s to act.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the US president’s chaotic actions are not that strategicFri 16 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 09.31 ESTShareIt is axiomatic to many of his critics that the US president, Donald Trump, is a fascist. Indeed, some have seen echoes of the work of the Nazis’ “crown jurist” and political theorist,Carl Schmitt, in the Trump administration’s domestic policies, particularly his doctrine of “the exception”, which can be used to suspend certain constitutional rights. After a tumultuous few weeks in geopolitics, his work is being discussed for its contemporary relevance again.In the wake of the release of the new USNational Security Strategyin 2025, its raid on Venezuela, the president’s rhetoric on Greenland, Panama, Colombia, Mexico andCuba, and his apparent indulgence towards Vladimir Putin’s Russia, the question now being asked is whether Trump is also an advocate of aspects of Schmitt’s concept of “great space”.Like many of his compatriots, Schmitt was outraged at Germany’s humiliation after the first world war and its alleged “colonisation” by the victorious entente powers. He regarded international law as a victor’s racket, designed to keep the Reich in permanent subjection and to facilitate the exploitation of the world’s resources. Schmitt reserved his greatest scorn, though, for the British, whom he saw as hypocritical “universalists” who preached a gospel of free trade and internationalism while building the biggest empire the world had seen. He contrasted them unfavourably with the Americans, who had confined themselves largely to their own continent in the 19th century, in accordance with the newly topicalMonroe doctrine, before they were (allegedly) gulled into entering the first world war.In April 1939, before the outbreak of the second world war, Schmitt proposed his solution in a well-publicised lecture to the Institute for Politics and International Law at the University of Kiel, which was later published in extended form. The world, he suggested, should be divided into great spaces (Großraum), each dominated by an empire (Reich) at its heart. Each great space would have its own identity, mission and force-field, which would shape the other states in its immediate orbit. Outside powers – which Schmitt termed “spatially alien powers” – would be “forbidden” to “intervene”. Obviously, Schmitt envisaged Nazi Germany as the Reich at the heart of the European great space, which he sought to shield from Anglo-American interference.All this was garnished with a hefty dose of antisemitism, because Schmitt – like Hitler – saw “world Jewry” as a fundamentally “universalising” influence, determined to break down nation states and national economies. It is sometimes said that Schmitt’sGroßrauminspired Hitler, but in fact Hitler had called for a “German Monroe doctrine” as far back as 1923, more than 15 years earlier. It is also possible to see echoes of Schmitt in imperial Japan’s concept of a “greater east Asia co-prosperity sphere”.Of course, Schmitt’s vision failed. The “Anglo-Saxon” powers, as he termed them, refused to stay out of Europe and eventually confronted Hitler. The Reich was annihilated, though not before it had inflicted terrible harm on Europe, especially its Jews. Schmitt himself, well known as a representative of the Nazi regime, was widely pilloried and never held another academic appointment after 1945, although he continued to exercise considerable intellectual influence on the right and the left, within Germany and beyond.In recent decades, Schmitt’s ideas have found new advocates and been reprised in anti-western “challenger” states, especially Russia. His rejection of western universalism and his concept of great spaces free of outside interference have found a ready audience in Moscow and Bejiing. For example, the notorious EurasianistAlexander Dugin– a key influence on Putin and an intellectual architect of the attack on Ukraine – has been a strong partisan of Schmittian ideas. He too calls for Russia to radiate its conservative and Christian Orthodox principles into neighbouring states and to exclude western influence, especially that of the Anglo-Saxons, as “spatially alien”. Like Schmitt, Dugin and many of his Russian nationalist peers are particularly anti-British, regarding them as the primary agents of liberalism, international capitalism and other supposedly noxious, anti-Russian, universalising principles.Drugs and gangs exist in Venezuela, but don’t be fooled. Trump arrested Nicolás Maduro to plunder our wealth | Andrés AntillanoRead moreAll this, with Trump’s willingness to impose territorial losses onUkraine, has led some to suggest that we are finally witnessing a Schmitt-style division of the world into great spaces. Such a partition of the globe between Trump, Putin, Xi Jinping and perhaps Narendra Modi is certainly plausible, but it is probably mistaken – and not only because Trump is unlikely to have been directly influenced by Schmitt.It is true that the Trump administration hasprioritised the western hemisphere, explicitly invoking the 200-year-old Monroe doctrine. But if the original intention of President Monroe was to stay out of Europe in return for an end to any new European colonies in the Americas, the doctrine as it subsequently evolved became an entirely one-way affair. Washington rejected any outside influence in “its” continent – though it had to accept outliers such as Cuba – but it also asserted its power across other continents, especially Europe and Asia. “What’s yours is mine,” Americans were saying, “and what is mine is my own.” While many objected to this as hypocrisy, and many Asians were bitterly opposed to the US presence, a healthy majority of Europeans rightly welcomed this US “empire by invitation”, as the Norwegian historian Geir Lundestad once put it.So far, Trump is firmly – in his own way – within that expansive American tradition. There is no sign of him acknowledging other spheres of influence, except perhaps in corners of Ukraine. Trump hasclobbered Iran, obliterated Russian air-defence systems in Venezuela, stoppedRussian tankersin European waters with British help and, on his watch, the CIA masterminded crippling Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s oil infrastructure. Whatever we think of all this, it does not suggest either any strategic collusion or any understanding based on spheres of influence. Trump is not a fascist but a narcissist. He will not accept any other gods beside him, and Putin and Xi know this. Schmitt would be turning in his grave, but he would also feel vindicated in his belief in the “hypocrisy” of the Anglo-Saxons.Brendan Simms is director of the Centre for Geopolitics at Cambridge University and author of Hitler: Only the World Was EnoughDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As events unfolded rapidly, calls for regime change became the focus of international attention. Consistent with its response to previous protest movements, the Iranian government once again opted for repression rather than engagement,violently suppressing demonstrationsinstead of allowing popular grievances to be articulated and addressed.As visual evidence circulated depicting theaccumulation of bodies at Kahrizak, it became increasingly evident that the primary instigator of the violence leading to these fatalities was the Islamic Republic itself, which has refused to tolerate civil unrest and has consistently responded to popular mobilisation with force.To understand the scale of repression, it is necessary to examine the ideological foundations of the regime, which are rooted in an apocalyptic worldview. The Islamic Republic cannot be understood solely as a theocratic system; rather, it functions as part of a broader network of Shia jihadist militias across the Middle East, which are mobilised in moments of crisis to carry out violence and suppress unrest.Reports have emergedsuggesting that militias from neighbouring countries – particularly Iraq – have entered Iran to assist the government in repressing protests. Additionally, the regime maintains a devoted ideological base within Iran that demands swift state action during periods of political upheaval.Although regime change has long been a genuine demand among a majority of Iranians, its sudden prominence was significantly shaped –and, arguably, distorted– by Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former shah, andmonarchist groups within the diaspora, some of whom receive support from foreign actors, including Israel. Pahlavi called on Iranians tooccupy streetsand public spaces without presenting a coherent strategy or ensuring organisational preparedness.The narrative of a “final battle”, advanced by Pahlavi, alongside expectations of foreign intervention fuelled by Donald Trump promising assistance via social media, played a significant role in mobilising individuals to engage in high-risk street protests.As a result, the protests were in many ways hijacked by the Pahlavi-centred narrative, undermining many Iranians’ legitimate democratic demands and transforming the movement into a nationalist confrontation. Earlier protest movements – such as the green movement, largely confined to Tehran, and the woman, life, freedom movement, which originated in Kurdistan and spread nationwide – were characterised by democratic aspirations. By contrast, this uprising appears to exhibit ultra-right nationalist tendencies, instrumentalising popular demands for change rather than advancing a pluralistic democratic vision.Iran is a multinational society composed of diverse ethnic and national groups, including Kurds in western Iran, Turkic Azeris in the north-west, and other ethnic minorities including Baluch and Arabs. These non-Persian communities maintain strong political movements that explicitly reject Persian supremacy. Kurdish political organisations, in particular, voice their opposition to Pahlavi and the Persian nationalist ideology he represents.The political and ethnic demands of these communities have been largely eclipsed in pursuit of calls for regime overthrow by any means necessary, even when such outcomes offered no guarantees of democratic governance or equitable power-sharing. Additionally, the central role historically played by women in democratic movements, as well as the contributions of gen Z, have been marginalised and swiftly overshadowed.Pahlavi’s ineffective leadership and the consolidation of a Persian nationalist narrative – particularly after the twelve-day war – have constrained democratic political discourse. This dynamic has further marginalised diverse perspectives, contributing to the absence of a genuinely inclusive and representative political narrative. By promoting a far-right monarchist discourse grounded in notions of Persian supremacy, meaningful democratic dialogue within Iranian civil society has been severely undermined.Moreover, the Islamic Republic’s response – marked by a level of brutality exceeding that of previous uprisings, driven by fears of foreign intervention and the perceived likelihood of regime collapse – has resulted in significant loss of life and once again silenced the Iranian people’s peaceful and democratic demands.Ultimately, mainstream media tend to reproduce two dominant and competing narratives: one depicting the Islamic Republic as a fundamentalist regime responsible for mass atrocities, and the other promoting a nationalist alternative rooted in monarchist ideology.Largely absent from both frameworks are the lived realities of Iranians subjected to lethal state violence, as well as the voices of civil society actors and ethnic minority movements that remain excluded from platforms through which their demands might be heard.Behrouz Boochani is a Kurdish writer.

The truth is that governments don’t tackle the problem because they don’t want toFri 16 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 13.27 ESTShareThere is one political problem from which all others follow. It is the major cause of Donald Trump, of Nigel Farage, of the shocking weakness of their opponents, of the polarisation tearing societies apart, of the devastation of the living world. It is simply stated: the extreme wealth of a small number of people.It canalso be quantified. The World Inequality Report (WIR) 2026 shows that about 56,000 people – 0.001% of the global population – corral three times more wealth than the poorest half of humanity. They afflict almost every country. In the UK, for example, 50 familieshold more wealththan 50% of the population combined.You can watch their fortunes grow. In 2024, Oxfam’s figures show, the wealth of the world’s 2,769 billionairesgrew by $2tn, or $2,000bn. Thetotal global spendingon international aid last year was projected to be, at most, $186bn, less than a tenth of the increment in their wealth. Governments tell us they “can’t afford” more. In the UK, billionaires, on average, havebecome more than 1,000% richersince 1990. Most of their wealth derives from property, inheritance and finance. They have become so rich, in other words, at our expense.The issue affects every aspect of policy. Trump is notseizing Venezuela’s oil wealthfor the sake of the US poor. He couldn’t give a damn about them, as his “big, beautiful bill” –robbing the poorto give to the rich – revealed. Hecovets Greenlandon behalf of the same elite interests, of which he is the avatar.When the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, helped destroy the lives of the world’s poorest bytearing downUSAID, he did so on behalf of his class. The same goes for Trump’sassaults on democracy, and his war on the living world. It is the ultra-rich who benefit most from destruction, in making money and in spending it. The WIR shows that the richest 1% of the world’s population account for 41% of greenhouse gas emissions arising from private capital ownership: almost twice that of the bottom 90%. And through their consumption, another study shows, the 1%produce as many greenhouse gasesas the poorest two-thirds.Inequality damages every aspect of our lives. Decades of research by Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson shows thathigher inequality, regardless of absolute levels of wealth, is associated with higher crime, worse public health, higher addiction, lower educational attainment, worse status anxiety (leading to higher consumption of positional goods), worse pollution and destruction, and a host of other ills.Extreme inequality creates an “Epstein class” of global predators,exploiting the restfinancially – and in other ways. It creates an ethos that no longer recognises our common humanity, that sees other people, asMusk puts it, as “non-player characters”,and believesthat, “the fundamental weakness of western civilisation is empathy”.This is the metric by which you can tell who in politics are your allies and who are your enemies: whether they support or oppose the extreme concentration of wealth. In fact, the matter should be definitional. Those who support it (let’s call them Group 1) are the right. Those who oppose it (Group 2) are the left.As soon as you understand politics in this light, you notice something extraordinary. Almost the entire population is in Group 2. Polling across 36 nations by the Pew Research Center found that84% see economic inequalityas a big problem, and 86% see the political influence of the rich as a major cause of it. In 33 of these nations, a majority believe their country’s economic system needs either “major changes” or “complete reform”. In the UK, a YouGov poll revealed,75% support a wealth taxon fortunes above £10m, while only 13% oppose it. But – and here’s the astonishing thing – almost the entire political class is in Group 1. You can search the manifestos of major parties that once belonged to the left, and find no call to make billionaires history.Quite the opposite in fact. Even when politicians are forced to respond to calls for a wealth tax, they dismiss it, as UK ministers have done, with two excuses. The first is that it won’t raise much revenue. Maybe, maybe not: there’s a wide range of evidence on this matter. But revenue-raising is the least of its benefits. Far more important are two other issues. One is fairness. Asthe WIR reports, “Effective income tax rates climb steadily for most of the population but fall sharply for billionaires and centi-millionaires.” This undermines trust in the tax system and politics in general. The other is reducing the power of the ultra-rich over our lives. To restore democracy and create a fairer, safer, greener world, we must bring the ultra-rich to heel, cutting their fortunes until they canno longer bludgeon us.The second excuse is that the uber-rich will flee the country. There are three possible responses to this claim. The first is thatthere’s no evidenceto support it. The second is, if true, good riddance: they do us more harm than good. The third is to say: then the obvious solution is a global tax-avoidance measure. So guess what? While 125 nations supported this approach, Keir Starmer’s government wasone of ninethat opposed it. Our government doesn’t tax the ultra-rich enough not because it can’t, but because it doesn’t want to.It’s not just politicians. Almost all the media belongs to Group 1. As the wealth and power of the proprietor class becomes ever greater and harder to justify, the views expressed in their outlets become ever crazier. Immigrants, asylum seekers, Muslims, women, transgender people, disabled people, students, protesters: anyone and everyone must be blamed for our dysfunctions, except those causing them. Ever more extreme “culture wars” (a euphemism for divide-and-rule) must be waged.It’s also why imaginary threats (Venezuela, “cultural Marxists”, “domestic terrorists”) must constantly be drummed up. You cannot have both a free market in media ownership and a free market in information and ideas. The oligarchs who dominate the sector stifle inconvenient thoughts and promote the policies that protect their fortunes.No one would claim that taking on extreme wealth is easy. But the battle begins with political parties spelling out this aim, clearly and unequivocally. Either they represent the great majority, or they represent the tiny minority: they cannot do both. So where, we might ask, are our representatives?George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsThe super-richOpinionInequalityTax and spendingEconomic policyGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

Think about it. You never see Reform’s defectors after the initial unveiling press conference, and I’m beginning to wonder what happens to them. I think Nigel amateurishly embalms them or stuffs them with horsehair and sackcloth, then seats them round a “cabinet” table in his cellar, where they all silently agree with him at all times, and never interrupt him.But look, I’m prepared to consider more outlandish fan theories too, particularly after the sheer farce ofRobert Jenrick’s defectionon Thursday. If Nigel’s sloppy-seconding carries on at this rate, the Reform/Conservative party differentiation is going to feel a lot like it did when Bucks Fizz factionalised and split, then mounted rival tours of the UK. Neither music nor the United Kingdom was the beneficiary.For now, Farage is really leaning into the enemies-to-lovers trope. On Monday hecosied up to a manwho’d previously said of him: “Yr comments r offensive&racist. I wld b frightened 2live in country run by U.” On Thursday, he did it with a guy who he’d incredibly recently negged as “a fraud”. Personally, I have found both these episodes of Heated Rivalry the least appealing.Hopefully, though, one day someone will write an interior fiction novella that takes place within the five hours of limbo on Thursday when Jenrick was whereabouts unknown. During this period, he had been stripped of his home in the Conservative party, yet not granted citizenship of Reform – kind of an SW1 version of Shamima Begum. During these hours, something had to fill the vacuum, and there was much to enjoy in all the staged fretting from Reform about the threat of cultural pollution from outsiders. “The worries I get from within Reform,” confessed Farage of all these defections, “are …will they bring Tory infighting with them?” Listen, someone’s got to say it. If you allow these people in, they do bring their primitive, vicious culture with them.Although this was not how Kemi Badenoch framed it in herviral video message. Incidentally, one of multiple problems with Kemi is that she seems to have stolen her act off Dolores Umbridge. Even the voice, with that treacly-steely delivery, is straight out of the Ministry of Magic’s supply teacher department. Or, even worse, the shadow Ministry of Magic’s supply teacher department.Anyway, on both off- and on-the-record briefings, theConservativeshave been keen to play this as a double-agent plotline, casting Jenrick as maybe the Ozempic Guy Burgess. As revealed by the Times, Badenoch had been informed by a mole that Jenrick was planning to imminently do one, and was furious that he “came to shadow cabinet and behaved as if nothing was going on”. I hope you love the idea that anything is going on at shadow cabinet. And are even more intrigued by reports that, the week before, Jenrick had “sat through a shadow cabinet awayday taking copious notes” about strategy. Wait – the Tories have a strategy? If so, Farage is very keen to tell them how it ends up panning out, constantly making reference to what happens “after the May 7th catastrophe”. A catastrophe which, given it happens on 7 May, can technically not yet be called, but in Nigel’s telling has already occurred. Then again, Farage undoubtedly has political gravity and momentum working for him, so there’s no reason to think he can’t master time as well.Given the reputation of “Honest Bob”, it remains unclear whether Reform will ever really trust Jenrick, or whether he will have to live under constant oppressive surveillance by the party’s security services/a disgruntled Richard Tice. A bit like when Lee Harvey Oswald went to the Soviets and he just got a load of monitoring and a factory job in Minsk. You get the feeling Jenrick wants more than a factory job in Minsk. Or as he put it yesterday: “I’ve put aside my personal ambition.” (Genuinely the most hilarious thing that was said yesterday.)As for the upshot of it all outside the Westminster dramasphere, you hear a lot from Reform about the uniparty, the epithet meant to embody the necrotic consensus between failed Conservative and Labour parties. But yesterday risked shifting the vibe to unichaos, in which Reform joined the big tent, too. Certainly, the lesson of the past 18 months in British decline is how easily the feeling of “same shit, different clown show” sets in, with even Farage now offering repeat variations on how short his notional period of grace with the British public will be.But why should anyone feel patient? To pick just one example, it is stunningly appalling that thousands of people cursed with living under South East Water have nowbeen without waterin their homes for a week, after having already suffered repeated outages since November. The government has asked the regulator to “review” South East Water’s licence, but it has emerged that even if they did want to terminate it, they would have to give the firm 25 years’ notice. You read that right: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS. This is one of many, many reasons why people have had it with the current system, and why many will give Farage a chance. It doesn’t, however, make him the answer. I am sure Farage has the will and possibly the ability to tear dysfunctional things down. It’s the fixing them or building them back up I just cannot see, no matter how many “gamechanging” press conferences he calls. After all, if Nigel’s allowed to report back from the future, so are we.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionRobert JenrickReform UKKemi BadenochConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

If they fail, the powerful plastics lobby will step into the breachDebora MacKenzie is a science journalist and author ofStopping the Next Pandemic: How Covid-19 Can Help Us Save HumanityFri 16 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 12.03 ESTShareAre we being injured and killed by ubiquitous, teeny-tiny shards of toxic plastic? Or aren’t we? For many months, the Guardian hasreported a series of worrying scientific resultsthat our bodies are full of jagged microplastic particles that could be giving us everything from heart attacks to reproductive problems.But on Tuesday, the Guardian revealed that a significant number of scientists think many of these studiesshowed no such thing. Or maybe they did. The methods are new and riddled with problems, so we can’t always reliably tell.If you, like me, have spent the past few decades watching battle after battle over environmental pollutants – fromDDTto cigarette smoke, to ozone destroyers to greenhouse gases – it will all look familiar. New problems present new challenges, and science takes a while to work them out. But eventually, it does. Science’s unique and greatest strength is that it is self-correcting. The current battle among researchers of microplastics is the first salvo in that process.Here is how thedisputes arose. Similar to the earlier cases just mentioned, as a new environmental nasty emerged, a community of specialists developed delicate, precise techniques to track the nasties and measure their impact, beyond any reasonable dispute. Scientists are, with good reason, persnickety about exact measurements and experimental controls. The analytical specialists who chase sometimes tiny quantities of pollutants and pinpoint their effects are arguably the most persnickety of the lot.But as microplastics got more attention, along came a bunch of researchers who often weren’t even analytical specialists, but medical scientists used to dealing with very different complex systems such as blood or brains or hardened arteries. They knew microplastics were everywhere, so they went to the analytical literature for ways to measure them. Theythen used these methods to measure microplastics in thebiological systems they are familiar with. For instance, in one of the disputed papers, an Italian team found nearly five times more heart attacks and strokes in people with jagged microplastics in their hardened arteries than in those apparently without.But inevitably, the analytical researchers, mainly chemists, wrotehorrified lettersto journal editors. They contend, for example, that the methods being used can read ordinary bodily fats in a sample as plastics, potentially giving false readings; that there weren’t proper corrections for the amount of background plastic in the laboratory; and that more controls were needed.The clinical teams have replied that there is a steep learning curve, and that this sort of work hasn’t been donein biological material before. Maybe some more controls would help, but more background plastics wouldn’t account for some things, such as that five-fold difference in heart attacks. And it isn’t at all clear whether any of these methodological shortcomings mean that there aren’t microplastics in humans, or that they aren’t having ill effects. They just raise uncertainties.Eventually, the analytical experts will start working more closely with the clinical crowd, and they will all learn to measure microplastics robustly in human tissue and investigate possible impacts on health. That is, if the agencies that fund scientific research keep funding them.That’s why the uncertainties worry both sides. Anydispute over methods“only provides ammunition to deniers”, warns one analyst. And these days, there are plenty of science deniers around.We have seen this before.Naomi Oreskesand others haveabundantly documentedhow people who make money from some pollutant or other “manufacture” doubt about science, enough to block action. But the example I know best was also the one where scientists learned how to fight back.The few companies who made the CFC chemicals that destroy stratospheric ozone, allowing more, deadly UV light to hit our planet, pointed for years to methodological disputes among ozone scientists to claim that “the science isn’t certain enough to do anything drastic” – such as banning CFCs. It worked.But the world eventually banned CFCs, and the ozone layer is healing, becausein the 1980s a few scientists, headed, improbably, by a British expat at Nasa,Bob Watson, organised all the other scientists to summarise for governments what they agreed was true, and conduct experiments to resolve their disagreements. It was a specific project meant to resolve the “uncertainty” for the wider world–and unleash action. “It’s important to get everyone, the industry scientists and every country that does research involved,” Watson told me then. Italso worked.Microplastic and nanoplastic research now has to learn that lesson. We know there are problems, wrote one scientist in response to scathing criticism from analytical teams, but we’d be better off spending our limited funding developing better methods, rather than “continually engaging in a dialogue”. Wrong. Dialogue is how you’re going to get the methods.Agroup of biomedical researcherswant “interlaboratory studies” to compare methods “and learn from each other”, with multidisciplinary teams “ideally including industry scientists”.Others callfor “an international and interdisciplinary collaboration of experts” to improve research methods.That’s more like it. Cynics will roll their eyes at the bit about industry scientists, but I know Watson would say that’s what you need. Everyone. So science can do its thing, creating knowledge on the basis of real, robust data about the world, without disputes that block progress – or discourage funding for the needed research.And we need that sooner rather than later. Enough skirmishing in letters columns in journals. The plastics industry is more powerful than the CFC-makers were, and it has friends who know how to manufacture doubt. (Researchers I spoke to said that their papers have been denounced to journal editors by chemical industry figures who were not analytical experts.)This is your ozone moment, microplastics people. Time to see the bigger picture, and find a way to resolve this battle, keep public trust and move forward with this vital research.Debora MacKenzie is a science journalist and author ofStopping the Next Pandemic: How Covid-19 Can Help Us Save HumanityExplore more on these topicsPlasticsOpinionHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The past five years changed thatEnver SolomonAs head of an immigration charity, I’ve seen firsthand how hostility and toxicity have reached unprecedented levelsEnver Solomon is the outgoing chief executive of the Refugee CouncilFri 16 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 05.03 ESTShareIt is difficult to think of another area of government policy that has weathered as much legislative hyperactivity as asylum and migration. I have been chief executive of the Refugee Council since 2020, and I am struck by the fact that there have been four bills that have become law since I started. A fifth one in as many years is expected soon as Home Office officials beaver away under the orders of the home secretary to quickly turn the proposedasylum reforms, published in November, into legislation.As I prepare to leave the organisation this month, I have been reflecting on how the asylum and migration landscape has changed. It’s clear the rhetoric and intent behind all these new laws has been the same: to deter so-called asylum shopping, to disrupt the people-smuggling gangs, to ramp up removals of migrants, to fix the broken asylum system and, ultimately, deliver control of our borders.Soon afterLabourcame to power, there were hints of a change in tone when Home Office officials quietly said they had been told to stop using the language of “illegal arrivals” and instead describe them as “irregular”. It seemed at the time that ministers did not want to be seen to be punching down on those who came to our shores seeking safety, regardless of how they arrived.But this change didn’t last long. Launching the latest proposed reforms, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, claimed illegal migration was“tearing the country apart”. People seeking asylum, particularly single men, are now seen as the root of all our problems. Theleader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch,said women have “stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes”. They were not seen as economic migrants but as potential criminals posing a major threat to our nation.This narrative shift has been stark. It has emboldened the far right to exploit people’s concerns and pushed them to take matters into their own hands. When I began my role I never thought I would see a hotel housing asylum seekers set on fire, hear from refugees who had been beaten up in the street, watch organisations working with refugees face sustained attacks on social media, learn that staff are careful about disclosing where they work, or need to ensure my own home has security protection.Hostility and toxicity have reached unprecedented levels. And I fear we have not seen the worst of it yet. Home Office officials will be bracing themselves for the possibility of yet more protests and attacks this summer.Not surprisingly, the salience of asylum and migration as an issue of concern has grown. Despiteanalysissuggesting that annual net migration immigration could be negative by the end of the year , the majority of voters thinkimmigration is increasing. And despite numerous new laws and government announcements, voters say they have no confidence in the government’s ability to control the UK’s borders.To me, it is clear that in the last five years, endless talk of stopping the boats, smashing the gangs, restoring control and fixing the asylum system has simply led to a rise in scepticism and disbelief around the impact of immigration. This is compounded by the public hearing about the workings of the asylum system being dysfunctional.Analysis by the National Audit Officerecently found that more than half of people who applied for asylum almost three years ago still didn’t have an outcome.The basic malfunctioning of the system never ceases to amaze me. Letters are sent to the wrong address. Interpreters for asylum interviews who aren’t able to translate because they are given the wrong information about the individual’s mother tongue. Traumatised and bewildered children who are being told they will be sent to adult accommodation because they were given a cursory age assessment by border officials when they arrived.The words that ring in my head each time I hear of these failures remind me of the Windrush inquiry’s conclusion: that the Home Office has lost sight of the faces behind the cases. Yet it doesn’t have to be this way. Better political decisions would mean people were not housed in hotels or former military barracks, that asylum decisions would be made in a timely manner and that refugees would be given support so that they could find work and contribute. Let’s not forget that for decades, many refugees have been welcomed into their new communities, going on to become proud British citizens.This is only one area of government policy – but it has become one of the defining issues of our time that determines who we want to be. A nation that looks inwards or outwards, that chooses to hate or love strangers, that shuns or embraces the notion of a shared humanity.It is a simple yet stark choice for the governing Labour party. Carry on with an approach to asylum and migration that in essence is stating that “Nigel Farage is right but don’t vote for him”, or confidently articulate an alternative worldview that proudly talks up the UK’s integration story and sets out a renewed values-based multilateralism that delivers global solutions to what at its root is a global challenge.This is a critical moment. Our political leaders must do far more to bring an end to the division and hate that the harmful “othering” of migrants has created. And for all of us, we must say clearly to our family, friends, neighbours, colleagues and politicians this is not who we are or who we want to be. As I leave my role, it feels more urgent than ever that we collectively stand up for the British values of fairness, decency and compassion so that refugees are treated with the dignity and humanity they deserve.Enver Solomon is the outgoing chief executive of the Refugee CouncilComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

(Dutch police told his inspectors that they deployed 1,200 officers, had reports regarding one flag and one taxi driver, and that a Maccabi fan was in fact thrown into a canal, seemingly by members of a pro-Palestinian group).Though nobody disputes it was a violent night that might well have shaped police desire to ban Maccabi fans, at best they made a worryingly sloppy case for it, including references cribbed from an unreliable AI tool to a football match that did not actually exist. But perhaps most damaging is the finding that by publicly downplaying reports of locals plotting to attack the visitors, the force overstated the threat posed by the Israelis and understated that posedtothem – an error with global consequences.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, who as a Muslim MP in Birmingham needs no lectures on the sensitivities, responded that by apparently trying to smooth community relations, the force had only made matters worse. Now the city faces a toxic row over so-called two-tier policing, reactivating both incendiary rightwing claims of thepolice going easy on Muslims for fear of looking racist and complaints that, if anything, the reverse is true, which does little to reassure either British Jews or British Muslims fearful for their safety in a febrile climate. Meanwhile, it was left to the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation,Jonathan Hall, to ask why,if the police were aware of threats to harm Israeli fans, they didn’t pursue the wannabe attackers instead of telling prospective victims of racially aggravated crimes to stay at home.For many British Jews, all this stirs deep-seated fears of being treated less as a persecuted minority than as the problem, obliged to retreat from mainstream spaces to spare everyone else the awkwardness of having to battle for their inclusion. Someone seeks to harm visiting Israelis? Well, maybe they just shouldn’t come. This fear of being squeezed out of public life is, for some, only intensified by a campaign to boycott Jewish public figures – from musicians and comedians to the MP and vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, Damien Egan,reportedly forced to cancela visit to a school in his Bristol constituency due to a threatened public protest – deemed by pro-Palestine activists to have insufficiently denounced the war on Gaza, or to have too close a relationship with Israel. (Egan has reportedly visited the country since the war broke out, a red flag for the boycott movement.)Though activists insist they’re not boycotting anyone just for being Jewish, it is not hard to see why a vulnerable minority would fear being singled out for political purity tests, or held unfairly to account for the actions of a foreign government over which they have no control. Arguing over whether this is or isn’t antisemitism seems less productive than figuring out how to stop Britain sliding into the kind of mutually hostile and distrustful cultural ghettoisation that extremists find only too easy to exploit.The school says it hasrescheduled Egan’s visit, which is reassuring: MPs should be able in a democracy to move freely around their own constituencies, and teenagers who will shortly be voters deserve the chance to meet – and sometimes challenge – their representatives. Meanwhile, a snap Ofsted inspection should get to the bottom ofnewspaper allegationsthat school staff, professionally obliged to be politically impartial, actively worked to keep Egan out.Yet it’s crucial that lessons are learned ahead of the next flashpoint, for sadly there will be more. Handled badly, they can only play into the hands of all those – from the nativist far right to fundamentalists demanding that Muslims leave the decadent west to build their longed-for caliphate – desperate to prove the old lie that Muslims and Jews cannot peacefully coexist, that liberal democracies can’t absorb these tensions, that mass immigration leads inevitably to the importing of distant conflicts and what Trumpworld calls “civilisational erasure”.Those of us who genuinely believe in the goal of a multicultural society, where people of all faiths and backgrounds learn to live together more or less tolerantly, have to accept that it won’t always be easy. Frontline professionals from politicians to chief constables, headteachers and people who never expected to find themselves navigating political minefields, will sometimes be called on to make difficult judgments – and when they turn to the police for impartial advice over handling these flashpoints, they must be able to trust it. That trust was badly damaged in the West Midlands, which is why the Cooke review hasbecome a resigning matter.But living together through times of war and tension also demands empathy and effort from the rest of us: a willingness to compromise, be generous and accept that tolerance isn’t just something liberals preach to other people, but something we must practise ourselves, even (or perhaps especially) when feeling morally righteous. It won’t be easy. But, trust me, it beats the alternative.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Count me outThu 15 Jan 2026 19.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 00.18 ESTShareThere’s something particularly dystopian about watching the mute headlines of daytime television play at the gym. It feels like a movie montage; pop bangers streaming, surrounded by sweaty hotties, I watch the latest horror unfold. News of war, the pandemic, death and destruction slide across the bottom of the screen below chatty hosts. It’s here where I first seeNEO, the “world’s first consumer-ready humanoid robot designed to transform life at home”. I watch as the hosts gleefully introduce its creepy, soft, grey body and chilling blank face with puny camera eyes. As though exercising my corporeal form wasn’t trial enough, now robots?Who in their right mind would want a walking, talking surveillance machine inside their home? The privacy invasion required for such robots to function goes far beyond yoursmart speaker listening into your conversations, yourautomatic pet feeder capturing footage, or your Roomba mapping the inside of your home andsharing it with Amazon. Beyond sensors, cameras and pervasive data collection, Neo – just one example of humanoid “service” robots now on the market – relies upon “expert mode” for the tasks it can’t quite manage on its own. That’s code for a remote employee being able to see inside your home and control the robot through a VR headset. Creepy.Robots that can do laundry and more, plus unrolling laptops: the standout tech from CES 2026Read moreThis isn’t the first time that the fantasy of automation doesn’t match up with reality. Tech companies all too often (misleadingly) promote their latest product to be far more intelligent than it actually is, all the while relying upon a team of invisible workers behaving like machines to make the device appear to function. For example, “self driving” cars such as Amazon’s robotaxi servicedepend on a team of human workersto remotely drive the car when they struggle to drive themselves. If we go way back to the 18th century, theMechanical Turkwas presented to the public as a chess-playing automaton, but in reality it was an elaborate hoax with a chessmaster controlling it from the inside. It’s what Astra Taylor callsfauxtomation:a marketing ploy to make pointless products seem cutting-edge. Or what Jathan Sadowski callsPotemkin AI: it provides a convenient way to rationalise unseen exploitation while calling it progress.Aside from the creepy surveillance and the gaping trench between marketing and reality, there’s also the question of what these robots are for.The promise of technology to alleviate the burden of housework is longstanding. Helen Hester and Nick Srnicekchart the historyof attempts to transform housework through domestic technologies. They highlight how despite revolutionary changes through domestic technologies like gas ovens, refrigeration and washing machines, they did not, overall, decrease the amount of labour in the home. This is theCowan Paradox:despite all these labour-saving devices, there isn’t any less work being done in the home.One of the key reasons behind this is that these technologies facilitated the shift from previously collectively shared work to individualised and undervalued labour, concentrated around the figure of the lone housewife. Activities that once required coordinated efforts – such as washing clothes – could now be undertaken by a single, isolated and unpaid person in the home with a washing machine. It also shifted expectations of cleanliness, ramping up productivity expectations inside the home and in turn creating more work. This ultimately contributed to a longstanding project of devaluing the labour that goes on in the home – by and large performed by women – despite how it sustains everyday life andunderpins all manner of paid work recognised by the capitalist economy.Turning to more recent developments, we’ve already seen that increased automation through generative AI does not inherently lead to less work – rather, we end up withworkslopwhich actually makes more work,not less. With all this history and research showing the shortcomings of so-called labour-saving technologies, we ought to hold on to a healthy dose of skepticism towards robots pitched as a way to minimise household chores.Since that day at the gym, my social media feeds have been full of videos of humanoid robots ranging fromembarrassing failsandgrim attemptsto close a dishwasher, towavinganddancingfor impressed bystanders. It makes me recall the time a robot designed for warfareperformed a DJ setas a way for the company to show that its killing machine is also … fun. Or when Boston Dynamics robot dogs werefeatured at the National Gallery of Victoriain a “futuristic, yet joyful” exhibition. This isfunwashing– a way to humanise and make light of these, frankly, disturbing and dangerous robots. (Though nothing could put me off a freaky robot man more than seeing onedance with Elon Musk.)The smart home on offer today – now with humanoid robot servants – is a thoroughly capitalist product with predictable aims of profit, data harvesting and control. At around A$30k a pop, it’s unlikely these robots will be gracing many people’s kitchens in the immediate future. But when the time comes that they do become affordable: count me out.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights advocate and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsRobotsOpinionSurveillancePrivacycommentShareReuse this content"

Now she’s back in the new Tomb Raider – and a Die Hard-style thrillerFri 16 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareSophie Turner has a screwball comedy vibe in real life – elegant trouser suit, arch but friendly expression, perfect hair, she looks ready for some whipsmart repartee and a sundowner. She seems very comfortable in her own skin, which is unusual anyway when you’re not quite 30, but especially incongruous given her various screen personas: first, inGame of Thrones. Thirteen when she was cast as Sansa Stark, 14 when she started filming, she embodied anxious, aristocratic self-possession at an age when a regular human can’t even keep track of their own socks. Six seasons in, arguably at peak GoT impact, she became Jean Grey inX-Men: Apocalypse, a role she reprised in 2019 forDark Phoenix, action-studded and ram-jammed with superpowers.Now she’s the lead in Steal, a Prime Video drama about a corporate heist, though that makes it sound quite desk and keyboard-based when, in fact, it is white-knuckle tense and alarmingly paced. The villains move in a malevolent swarm like hornets; hapless middle managers are slain almost immediately; it’s impossible to tell for the longest time whether we’re looking at gangster thugs or hacking geniuses, motivated by avarice or anarchy. It’s a first-time screenplay by novelist Sotiris Nikias (who writes crime under a pseudonym, Ray Celestin), and it feels original, not so much in the action and hyperviolence as in the trade-offs it refuses to make: whatever explosions are going on, however much chasing around a dystopian pension-fund investment office, you still wouldn’t call it an action drama. It has a novelistic feel, like characters from a David Nicholls book woke up in Die Hard, and there’s a constant swirl, as you try to figure out who’s the assailed and who’s the assailant.The central point is Turner’s performance as Zara, office drone cum action hero – by turns petrified, sleuthing, exhausted, baffled. “There’s so much betrayal, the stakes are so high, you can’t prep the feeling,” she says, explaining that, however much research she does ahead, her decisions are always made in the moment. “I don’t even remember what happens in the script! You think you have a grasp on who is who, the power dynamics and who they are as a person, then the next episode, you’ve got it wrong, it’s a whole other game. It’s a constant puzzle-solver.”View image in fullscreenTaking office … Sophie Turner as Zara Dunnein Steal.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/PrimeHer character is so much more than a damsel in distress, with traces of nihilism and “a lot of rage and sorrow”, she says. “So many of the reasons why Zara does what she does is because she’s had to grow up with an alcoholic, abusive mother.” The director had a cat-and-mouse game going with the cast – the villains have elaborate but quite subtle prosthetics, so all their faces seem slightly off but it’s not obvious why, as if they were rendered by an amateur sculptor. The rest of the cast saw that disguise for the first time as they started shooting, and were as disoriented as the viewers, Turner says. The mood is one of deliberate, chaotic menace. “Take one was a surprise for all of us,” says Turner. “They wanted to get our genuine reaction. It was quite method. It was my first time really having that.”Without wanting to give too much away, wealth is as much the enemy as any character, which is pretty zeitgeisty. It’s interesting how bad guys used to always have a Russian accent, then they had to be Arabs, and now “it’s just rich people”, Turner says. “It’s much better, much less racist.”This is Turner’s first big role in a while, though she’ssoon to start filmingthe live-action Tomb Raider, made by Phoebe Waller-Bridge for Prime Video, playing Lara Croft. The training has been absolutely intense – eight hours a day, five days a week – since she finished shooting Steal. She’d never worked out before in her life – on Game of Thrones, the most physical thing she had to do was get beaten up. “It’s quite nice to learn how to throw a punch and not just take it,” she said recently.View image in fullscreen‘It’s nice to learn how to throw a punch not just take it’ … Turner as Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider.Photograph: Jay Maidment/PrimeGame of Thrones had been a trial by fire, though she describes it now with a marginally less painful-sounding “thrown in at the deep end”. Sansa Stark was a pivotal part – the eldest daughter of Sean Bean’s House of Stark head Eddard, she was on screen continually, a huge amount of dynastic drama hanging on the credibility of her turmoil. She’d never been to drama school, and even though she’d been a member of the children’s Playbox Theatre Company in Warwick, she still feels self-conscious about those first seasons.“I learned how to act on that set, and now I’m thinking: that’s not how to do it. That’s not what I do these days. It’s very embarrassing. Imagine if you were learning to sing, and all your lessons had been filmed and broadcast. It’s just an uncomfortable experience. I think the imposter syndrome remains. But I don’t think there’s any actor who doesn’t have that.”It was an incredible learning curve, given the quality of the cast, and that as many demands might be made of a 14-year-old who’s never done it before as of a 73-year-old who trained with Laurence Olivier. “Having an aristocratic background, as Sansa, and coming into a scene, having to command authority over these very seasoned actors, it was really funny. It felt so foreign and so wrong.”View image in fullscreenQueen of the North … Turner as Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones.Photograph: HBOEven before the show got its mass following, “there was such a fierce fan culture around it”, she remembers. (This was so marked that the author,George RR Martin, appeared at a book festival once and more than one of the audience questions was to the effect of: what are you doing wasting your time at a book festival? You’re not going to live for ever, and you need to write more books.) “The fans have a contagious energy,” says Turner. “Once you feel their enthusiasm, it makes you work 10 times harder than you would have done. You just don’t want to let them down.”Game of Thrones arguably defined the entire 2010s, and once it finished, Turner was considered box-office gold, but to a type: “I got sent so many period dramas, about princesses who start off weak and end up learning and developing and growing into strength. I had to separate myself from all that. After Game of Thrones finished, I didn’t know what was up and what was down. I needed to discover who I was.”At the tail end of that show, she was cast as Jean Grey in X-Men, and that, again, carried a huge weight of fan expectation, the world already built and people so invested in it. “Also a really important part of being an actor is to live a life so you have experiences to draw on. I remember having to act being in love before I’d ever been in love. I thought: ‘OK, I guess I’ll just do this.’ And then suddenly, when I’d been in love for the first time,thenI knew the feeling. That’s part of the job – to sit in the discomfort of feeling so that we can bring it to the table.”View image in fullscreenChit-chat … Turner with Archie Madekwe in Steal.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/Prime VideoShe got engaged to the American singer Joe Jonas when she was 21, moved to the US, had two children in an awesome hurry – her first daughter when she was 24, her second at 26. “It’s really nice,” she says. “I’m not worrying about my biological clock and all that sort of stuff.” At the time, she says, “it just felt like the right break to focus on me, because I’d been a character for so long. Nesting and being at home was amazing. But the flipside of it, and Covid didn’t help, was that this was a big break from the career. And I’ve had to try to rebuild, in a way. You don’t realise how important momentum is in a career, and I stalled it a bit.”She and Jonas divorced two years ago, and she and her daughters returned to the UK, just as green shoots started to appear in the film industry, after the post-pandemic, post-writers’ strike double whammy. “The state of our industry is slowly getting a little bit better, especially in the UK,” she says. As much as a return to the screen, Steal feels like a homecoming for Turner – filmed in east London, the down-at-heel streets strike a contrast against the shiny skyscraper backdrop, effortlessly making the wealth-is-decay point of the story, while also looking quintessentially British.As a viewer, Turner’s favourite genre is romcom, and she’s never really had a comic role, always “drawn to characters who are going through some sort of terrible anguish. The more high-stakes, the more high drama, the more I feed off it.” That’s what she wants to do next: “I actually think comedy is a lot harder than drama. With drama, you make it real for yourself then you just live in it. But with comedy, it’s about timing, delivery. There’s a certain way that it has to be done in order for it to connect. It is more scientific.” It’s hard to imagine hernotin a crisis, but in Steal – and I don’t think this spoils anything – life is tough but she’s tougher.Steal is on Prime Video from Wednesday21 January.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as American studios increasingly prioritise franchise sequels over serious drama, and European films vie for major trophies outside the “best international feature” silo, the EFAs are feeling emboldened about becoming a major tastemaker for grownup cinema.This year, the European Film Academy has for the first time moved its annual jamboree from December to the middle of the US awards season, right between the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards.“Hollywood has stopped making movies for adults, with a few exceptions”, said Scott Roxborough, European bureau chief for the Hollywood Reporter. “That leaves room for the Europeans, who only make films for adults”.View image in fullscreenStellan Skarsgård won a Golden Globe for Sentimental Value on Sunday. Will he be victorious again at tomorrow’s EFAs?Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/2026GG/Penske Media/Getty ImagesTaking place at Berlin’s House of World Cultures this Saturday, the awards’ 38th edition could be a night of triumphs for Norwegian director Joachim Trier’s family dramaSentimental Value, which is nominated in five categories including best European film.The meta-tale of familial estrangement and artistic competition has already scooped the Grand Prix at Cannes and a best supporting actor Golden Globe for Swedish veteranStellan Skarsgård, and is seen as a major contender at the Oscars in March. “It’s the kind of serious dramatic film that Hollywood is generating fewer and fewer of,” said Roxborough.After the Oscars expanded their best picture nominee count from five to 10 films in 2009, there has been a marked uptick in non-English-language films in the running. Swedish director Ruben Östlund’s Triangle of Sadness, French film-maker Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall, British director Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest and French director Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Pérez all gained best picture nominations in recent years.At the EFAs, Trier’s film faces competition from Spanish director Óliver Laxe’s Mad-Max-meets-Stalkerthriller Sirāt, with four nominations, and German newcomer Mascha Schilinski’s The Sound of Falling and Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi’s French co-produced It Was Just an Accident, each nominated in three categories.Saturday’s ceremony – which in place of a host will be “curated” by Irish documentary-maker Mark Cousins as a “live film essay” – is part of a long-held plan to to reposition the awards as a more glamorous event in the cultural calendar. Unlike in previous years, distributors have held special screenings of nominee films in order to canvas for votes, and Roxborough said there are signs that some European distributors were starting to shape their marketing campaigns around the awards.View image in fullscreenMad Max meets Stalker … Sirāt is nominated for three awards.Photograph: AP“European cinema has gone on the front foot and repositioned itself to take on Hollywood – by moving its dates this year to the middle of January,” said British producer Mike Downey, the outgoing chair of the European Film Academy. “Our major overhaul and rebranding radically boosts our profile and, indeed, European cinema’s importance in the international awards season.”While the EFA’s shortlisted films are resolutely art-house, Hollywood blockbuster productionscontinued to dominate the European box office in 2025. Yet strong showings for select homegrown productions are giving European distributors grounds for hope.“This year has given us irrefutable proof that German film shouldn’t make itself smaller than it is,”wroteGerman broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung at the end of last year.

So, there’s everything to play for.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAwards and prizesStellan SkarsgårdOscarsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tommy Lee Jones’ shrieking, neon-splashed Batman Forever iteration turned the character into a dissociative identity slot machine, endlessly pulling its own lever, while Billy Dee Williams’ take in 1989’s Batman was a promise of future ruin. In Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, the downfall of Aaron Eckhart’s crusading district attorney signalled the dangers of placing too much faith in the moral resilience of a single individual, especially in a city where the very idea of justice is already under existential strain.With the news this week cautiouslyannounced in the Hollywood Reporterthat Sebastian Stan will be playing Dent in Matt Reeves’ highly anticipated forthcoming sequel to The Batman, it’s quite possible the new episode will be less interested in the masked theatrics of the 20th-century big screen caped crusader, and more in the idea that the very concept of justice is about to slowly disintegrate. In Stan, Reeves has an actor who excels at playing men whose morality erodes like damp plaster, which feeds beautifully into his vision of Gotham. In Reeves’ worldview, it is a city that is rotting politely from the inside, not one ruled by a carnival of freaks desperate for the spotlight. So it is hard to imagine this languid, gloriously doom-drenched Gotham giving birth to a Dent who goes down the rampant route of extreme, scenery-chewing theatricality.There is even the potential here to move on from the Nolan era, with its focus on symbolism and high-stakes ethical thought experiments. Eckhart’s turn is one of the greatest performances in any comic book movie, but by utilising the madness of grief to transform him into Two-Face, rather than relying on the incremental, constantly self-justifying slide into monstrosity seen in the best comics or the excellent 1990s Batman: The Animated Series TV show, something was lost. When he’s at his best, Dent doesn’t “snap”, so much as reason his way into villainy, seemingly convincing himself step by step that the law no longer works and that only he is strong enough to replace it. This Two-Face isn’t chaos dressed up as madness (like the Joker) but justice stripped of empathy, clinging to the illusion of fairness – the semi-ruined coin he still pretends represents due process. His descent into villainy feels almost inevitable in a town as violently decayed as Gotham, and his arrival on the scene simply confirms how impossible Batman’s job is.It might even be nice to see the new Two-Face hanging around Gotham for several movies, like a sort of lingering corruption designed to keep reminding Robert Pattinson’s caped crusader that he really can’t win in a world where doing the right thing and the wrong thing often look identical from a distance. Nolan’s films had Cillian Murphy’s Scarecrow as the last rat to leave Gotham’s ever-sinking ship, while it seems likely that Colin Farrell’s Penguin will be the resident cockroach in Reeves’ saga. That doesn’t mean there isn’t room for another famed member of Batman’s rogues gallery to remain forever lurking in the architecture.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekThe BatmanBatmanRobert PattinsonSebastian StanSuperhero moviesAaron EckhartcommentShareReuse this content"

Why are there so many of me and so few of you?”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If a fantasy author were to dream up Welles’s psychedelic cousin, he’d likely have the air of Alejandro Jodorowsky: serene and white-bearded with a crocodile smile, presiding over a niche band of disciples. He has been – variously, often concurrently – a director, an actor, a poet, a puppeteer, a psychotherapist, a tarot-card reader, an author of fantasy books. At the age of 96, Jodorowsky estimates that he’s lived 100 different lives and embodied 100 different Jodorowskys. “Because we are different people all the time,” he says. “I died a lot of times but then I’m reborn. Look at me now and you see I’m alive. I am happy about this. It is fantastic to live.”Jodorowsky recently finished work on atwo-volume Taschen monograph, Art Sin Fin. That’s another rebirth, he says, although it also serves as an archive, a repository, a bulging bestiary of counter-cultural weirdness. Naturally, Art Sin Fin covers Jodorowsky’s brief 70s reign as the “king of the midnight movie”, the creator of the head-scrambling cult classics El Topo and The Holy Mountain, beloved by Dennis Hopper and John Lennon alike. But the retrospective roams much farther afield, leading us through riotous stage shows, outlandish comic-book panels and designs for grand productions (such as his long-cherished adaptation of Dune) that never saw the light of day.People say that I’m the world’s last crazy artist. But I am not mad. I am only trying to save my soulJodorowsky chose the images and artwork alongside the book’s editor, Donatien Grau of the Musée du Louvre. But the accompanying prose is inimitably his own and mixes metaphors and similes with a devil-may-care panache. On one page his brain is “like a canary growling like a whale”. On another it has become “two bicycle wheels fighting like dogs”. Jodorowsky’s work can be provocative, outlandish and sometimes wilfully shocking, geared towards themes of sex and death. But it has always carried a top note of outright silliness, too.In the beginning, before anything, there was Tocopilla, he says; a small port town on the rocky coast of northern Chile. That’s where he was raised, the square-peg son of a Ukrainian-Jewish shopkeeper, constantly dreaming of escaping to somewhere else. “Well,” he says, clarifying. “First I was one cell in the belly of my mother. Then I was working with my father from the age of seven, working behind the counter of this general store. I was the little young genius who was helping him every day. Now I am the little old genius who is talking to you.”Tocopilla, it turned out, couldn’t contain him for long. He jumped first to Santiago and then on to Paris, where he studied mime with Marcel Marceau and directed Maurice Chevalier in music hall. His 1967 debut feature – the surrealistic Fando y Lis – sparked a riot when it premiered at the Acapulco film festival. “In Mexico they wanted to kill me,” he says. “A soldier marched in and put a gun to my chest.”Jodorowsky shares a portion of Art Sin Fin with his second wife, Pascale Montandon. The couple like to paint together under a joint pseudonym, PascALEjandro, producing a series of jubilant watercolours that are one part Dalí to two parts Paula Rego. Montandon joins Jodorowsky on our Zoom call as well, gently chipping in to translate questions or correct her husband’s English.View image in fullscreenAlejandro Jodorowsky. Art Sin FinTASCHENPhotograph: Mark Seelen/© Mark Seelen“This is because I am a very old person,” he says. “Listen to this – I am nearly 100 years old. Soon I will die, that is the law of this planet. Maybe other planets as well. But my wife, she must not die. She is only 50 years old.”“I’m 54,” Montandon says.“She is 50,” he repeats. “That means she will live for another 50 years. And she will be here and think about me when I’m gone.”“You’re not dead yet,” Montandon says. “And I might die before you. People don’t know anything.”Jodorowsky insists he is an artist not a teacher, which means that there has never been any message or moral to his work. If his multi-hyphenate career is bound to anything, though, it is to the principles of a therapeutic practice that he calls “psychomagic”, which stirs Freud’s theory of the unconscious in with elements of shamanism and the tarot. For years Jodorowsky hosted regular free psychomagic sessions around Paris, where he lives, preaching the gospel and treating the afflicted. Nowadays he mostly counsels his patients via Zoom and sometimes wonders if he’ll have enough time to get through all his bookings. “Today,” he says. “Listen. There are 8 million people who are waiting for my help.”“Eight million,” echoes Montandon. It is not quite a question.“Yes,” he says firmly. “Eight million people, it’s true.”Among the many black-and-white photographs in Jodorowsky’s collection, one shows a wide-eyed teenager with a white-painted face. He is leaning into the arms of a raven-haired woman. “My first pantomime in Chilean theatre,” reads the caption. “Aged 17, made up as an old man of 90, experiencing an orgasm in the arms of death.”The artist squints at the photo. He is older today than the man he once played as a boy. “Another planet,” he says. “Another Jodorowsky. But maybe I am still the same person, deep inside. Maybe I only look different because I am in a different body.”He frowns, shakes his head and puts the picture aside. “Soon I will be in the arms of death,” he says. “I am ready to die and I will go with happiness, with a great orgasm. But listen, I will tell you, I have always been this way. Life for me is an adventure. We live in an eternal present. Life is action, action, orgasm, and we experience it all the time.”Endless art: the ages of JodorowskyView image in fullscreenAlejandro Jodorowsky’s film El Topo.Photograph: ABKCO FilmsEl Topo“It’s not a western, it’s an eastern,” Jodorowsky said of his 1970 breakthrough, a phantasmagoric Mexican odyssey that deliberately loses itself in the desert. The director plays the violent gunslinger in search of enlightenment while dragging his infant son, Brontis, along for the ride. El Topo’s US distribution was bankrolled by the former Beatles manager Allen Klein, who, urged on by John Lennon, would later agree to finance Jodorowsky’s 1973 epic, The Holy Mountain.Endless Poetry (main image)“My father was a monster and my mother was, too,” says Jodorowsky, who fled Chile for Paris and never saw his parents again. In his 80s he belatedly returned to shoot a pair of acclaimed magic-realist memoirs, The Dance of Reality (2013) and Endless Poetry (2016), in which he played the guardian angel of his younger self and arranged for his dad to be captured and tortured by Nazis. “People say that I’m the world’s last crazy artist,” he says. “But I am not mad.

He went on to produce his own interpretation of the original tarot family alongside designer Philippe Camoin. His 78-card deck is an “alphabet of the soul”, he says, with its major arcana (the Fool, the Juggler, the Devil et al) corresponding to individual human qualities. It is instead “a system for self-discovery and psychological healing”, he says.View image in fullscreenTeo Jodorowsky, died of an overdose at 24 years old, 2021.Photograph: pascALEjandroTeo JodorowskyJodorowsky’s son Teo – who played a dancing bandit in 1989’s Santa Sangre – died of an overdose at the age of 24.

He wrote so positively about my music early in my career andthe last article he wrote was singling out my opera Festenfor special praise. He did seem to go off me a bit in mid career but he was such a serious and thoughtful critic that I often agreed with him. I got to know him very well in the late 90s as he was the partner of the librettist and translatorAmanda Holden. He had such a broad knowledge of music and a great enthusiasm for new music which he wrote and spoke about with such warmth and humour. We spent many evenings in Highbury talking about Stravinsky, politics and Arsenal football club – he cared about the most important things in life.Mark-Anthony Turnage, composerAndrew was perhaps the most remarkable critical voice of our age, and his writing embodied knowledge, curiosity and integrity. His tastes were open and adventurous, with a rare awareness of – and enthusiasm for – the newest musical developments from way beyond our shores. This isn’t the easiest time for contemporary music in the UK; Clements’ passing is a huge loss and he will be deeply missed.I’d like to add a more personal note – except that, beyond bumping into Andrew periodically at concerts over the last 45 years, I barely knew him. The strict professional distance he maintained throughout his career impressed me all the more. But I might add that he wrote the very first newspaper review my work received anywhere, something for which I’ll always remain grateful.George Benjamin, composerAndrew Clements was an outstandingly honest and perceptive critic. I much appreciated his support as well as his criticism. I read his words with interest and admiration for over 30 years. I will miss him.Steve Reich, composerView image in fullscreenVictoria Simmonds as Marie and Iestyn Davies as The Boy in George Benjamin’s 2012 Written on Skin, a work Andrew called ‘remarkable and spellbinding’.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianCeque l’on attend idéalement de la part d’une personne écrivant sur la musique et les musiciens est un jugement clair, une véritable indépendance et une force de caractère. Andrew Clements avait tout celà, plus une insatiable curiosité. Quel privilège d’avoir pu lire pendant plus d’un quart de siècle le point de vue d’un observateur si passionné et courageux!(What one expects ideally from anybody writing on music is clarity of judgment, true independence, and strength of character. Andrew Clements possessed all these qualities, along with an insatiable curiosity. What a privilege it has been to have been able to read for over a quarter of a century the insights of such an enthusiastic and courageous observer!)Pierre-Laurent Aimard, pianistFor many of us, since our first forays into classical music, Andrew’s words have always been there: illuminating our path, inclining our ear. I will dearly miss his reassuring presence, his deft articulation, and trusted insight. So much of his writing remains online to inform and inspire us – and to entice us, when writing about music ourselves, to find such precision, grace and eloquence of our own.James Murphy,chiefexecutive, Royal Philharmonic SocietyAndrew Clements was a regular and much-loved member of the audience here at Wigmore Hall. Sometimes when I encountered him before a concert, I was left disconcerted because he gave a very firm impression that he didn’t want to be here, but often, by the end of the evening, he was ecstatic, and this was reflected in his reviews. He was an outstanding critical voice, with the deepest possible knowledge and love of music. He was hugely respected, and he will be greatly missed.John Gilhooly,director, Wigmore HallIwas very fond of Andrew. I particularly enjoyed his deeply irreverent wit and insights, not just into music new or otherwise, but the people involved in the music world. His knowledge of music was vast. I can remember his partner,Amanda Holden, telling me how he could remember everything that he’d ever heard. Total recall. It was impossible to second guess what he was going to like or otherwise. His thoughts around pieces seemed to come from some deeply personal, off-kilter place as regards what meant anything to him at all. His writing was often thought-provoking and I certainly didn’t necessarily agree with his opinions, however it was always food for thought and would make me rethink my possibly entrenched thinking about certain composers.Simon Holt, composerWhen Ted Greenfield retired, I asked Alfred Brendel what sort of critic we should seek to hire. “Someone who understands modern music,” said Brendel in a flash. Though he himself tended not to stray too much from the late 18th and early 19th-century masterpieces, he thought the job of a critic was to understand, explain and judge the music of our times. Did he have any suggestions, I asked. “Try Andrew Clements,” he replied.I tried; he joined. He was everything Brendel could have wanted. Many years later, I told Andrew the story of how he came to be recruited. He was both shocked ... and a bit thoughtful. He had, he confessed, sometimes been a bit harsh on Brendel. He had not known that the subject of his criticism had been one of his great admirers. But I suspect, even if he had known, it wouldn’t have changed a thing.Alan Rusbridger, Guardianeditor-in-chief,1995–2015View image in fullscreenThe LSO conducted by François-Xavier Roth with Patricia Kopatchinskaja give the UK premiere of Francisco Coll’s Violin Concerto. “A showcase for Coll’s own freewheeling orchestral virtuosity, his tangled, teeming invention, ear for vivid sonorities, and sly references to earlier music,”wrote Andrew.Photograph: Mark AllanIt is with deep sadness that I receive the news of Andrew Clements’ passing. I am grateful for his immense contribution to music and for the consistently generous and attentive words he devoted to my work from the very beginning. His judgment and integrity leave an absence that is hard to put into words.Francisco Coll, composerAndrew was a great critic and a wonderful colleague, always ready with a cutting comment or a barbed witticism in the corners of otherwise not-so-memorable concerts. It’s easy to forget, but alongside his encyclopedic knowledge and enthusiasm, as a writer he was a superb stylist. Across thousands of reviews, Andrew never wrote an ugly sentence: his thoughts were lucid and sharp-edged, and he had a gift for writing in a direct, well-shaped way especially about the most complex of contemporary music.Having worked alongside him very happily as a writer on other papers, I had then to be ready for Andrew in a different mode when I went to Radio 3 and the Proms. His comments and judgments were always sharp, never (hardly ever) unfair. While he sympathised with what we were trying to do in broadening the Proms repertory, he always argued we weren’t doing enough for contemporary music. Eventually I was stung into writing to remind him that even William Glock did not do as much new music at the Proms as we did; he took it all in good part. He kept us on our toes, and he will be sorely missed.Nicholas Kenyon, writer and broadcasterHe will be sadly missed. Andrew’s knowledge of classical music across different disciplines combined with clear and refined writing narrative made him a major force in critical opinion over many years. He stuck to a critical response to what was in front of him and rarely strained into political and personal attacks, yet he was a respected, and at times feared, critic who didn’t pull his punches. His deep knowledge of contemporary music and his nose for a well thought out and ambitious production on the operatic stage gave him real stature in a critical world of diminishing returns where performing arts journalism has become subdued.John Berry, director, producer, artistic director ENO,2005-2015Iam deeply saddened to learn of Andrew Clements’ passing. I was fortunate that he took an interest in my music theatre works over the years, often traveling to cover premieres across Europe. I found his reviews were always analytical, intelligent, and fair – written with the kind of deep musical knowledge that made his opinion genuinely matter to me.Michel van der Aa, composerAndrew reviewed every year of my decade at Cheltenham music festival, and I always appreciated that, because getting critics to review out of London has become harder over time (the column inches available, the finances of trips out of town). I came to realise that there was a particular reason he was keeping the faith with Cheltenham – he mentioned that he was brought up nearby [in Gloucester] and had fond memories of attending in his youth, and hearing lots of new music. He knew that I was facing ever-stronger headwinds there by the time I was programming Cheltenham, and he always expressed his appreciation that I was doing my damnedest to keep the new music flag flying. That support, from someone I admired so much, was motivating and much appreciated.Needless to say, any longstanding fondness for the festival didn’t ever soften up his reviews there. If he didn’t like something, there was the same commendable objectivity and clarity.Meurig Bowen,chiefexecutive &artisticdirector, Britten Sinfonia, andartisticdirector of the Cheltenhammusicfestival,2007-17Artist egos are not merely fragile; they are ravenous. They feed on affirmation, recoil from scrutiny, and cry at the first sensation of disapproval. Most critics know this and exploit it. Andrew Clements did something far more dangerous: he paid attention.Yes, Andrew wrote generous reviews. But generosity was never his defining trait. Courage was. He attended the unruly, the excessive, the wilfully difficult programmes – the ones that frightened his peers into polite absence. Where others retreated into safe abstraction, Andrew advanced. He stayed. He endured complexity.And then he did the unfashionable work of comprehension. He refused the shortcut of reduction. Instead, he learned the internal grammar of the work, deciphered its syntax, traced its private logic. Reading his criticism felt less like evaluation than intrusion – an elegant trespass into the architecture of my thinking.In an era intoxicated by immediacy, where language is flattened, accelerated, and emptied of consequence, Andrew resisted. He chose exactitude over noise. His sentences were calibrated, his metaphors unsparing. He deployed words that sent me back to dictionaries, to etymologies, to the slow labour of meaning.Through this rigour, he created something rare: a zone of intellectual hospitality. A place where artists were neither indulged nor dismissed, but taken seriously enough to be challenged. He made criticism porous, reciprocal, alive.I will miss the severity of his attention. I will miss the precision of his seeing. I will miss the way his writing revealed what I had not yet articulated, and occasionally what I had not dared to know.Andrew Clements reminded us that criticism, when practised with discipline and courage, is not parasitic. It is generative. It does not consume art – it sharpens it. For those of us with fragile, ravenous egos, this was not comfort. It was nourishment.Tamara Stefanovich, pianistView image in fullscreenBrett Dean’s Hamlet, with Allan Clayton in the title role at Glyndebourne in 2017. (Andrew didn’t write about the opera himself because of Dean’s working relationship with Amanda Holden, Andrew’s partner).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAndrew Clements occupied an all-too-rare place in classical music criticism. His deep and genuine engagement with the new made his reviews so much more vital than mere descriptions of what had been performed, as if it were a passage of play at the cricket. They placed even brand-new works into a larger, informed context. He took the role so seriously that his comments were always constructively insightful, for composers young and old, even his more harsh assessments. He will be sorely missed.Brett Dean, composerIread Andrew Clements keenly from the early 1980s onwards. His trenchant reviews were alarmingly well informed, always perspicacious and never provincial. He was the first UK critic to spot the genius of Gérard Grisey, the French spectral composer whose music has been so influential in the past 35 years. As early as August 1984 and again in September 1985, he acclaimed Grisey as a major new force in music at a time when almost nobody else here showed any interest.In general, Andrew supported the more adventurous: Xenakis, Lachenmann, Saariaho, Carter and Ferneyhough were all championed, though not without a critical edge: Andrew was never easily pleased. Minimalists such as Glass, Pärt and Adams fared less well generally, though he had some interest in the Adams operas.In 1993 he suddenly telephoned me having read some of my articles, to invite me on to the reviewing staff of the Guardian where he wanted, as he put it, “to train up someone new.” Unknown to him I was just starting out as a composer: trying to be both composer and critic would, I felt, put me in an impossibly conflicted position. He understood but warned “composing’s a lottery: you’ll find it easier to have a steady job as a critic.” Alas, many music critics were to have just as tough a time over the next 30 years as many composers.Julian Anderson, composerAndrew’s unique values and judgment, and insistence on standards of quality and independence from the industries of power and clique in the classical – those principles are what it’s all about, along with his soupçon of cantankerousness and a delight in joyfully scurrilous gossip – who else could be grumpy at a premiere or a new production with a twinkle in their eye?There are those countless composers and new pieces whose work and importance he advocated and debated, to which he gave the seriousness of genuine criticism, and inspired all of us reading to explore, to resonate with what he said, or to argue passionately with it. The musical world isn’t the same: what a loss.Tom Service, broadcaster and writerAndrew Clements had a long-range perspective of music and held it up to the highest of standards. He cared deeply and his reviews were always fascinating. Even if he once described my sax concerto Iris as a mess, he wrote some wonderful things about my own music. I greatly appreciated his writing and will miss seeing him around, like a beacon of belief – within the rush of modern life – in the wonder that is contemporary classical music.Tansy Davies, composerMaybe flautists are quick to smile! For a number of years, I’d seen Andrew in his critic’s seat at Birmingham Contemporary Music Group concerts. I’d always admired his writing and regarded his presence as a strong endorsement. He had reviewed my music and I was therefore wary of approaching him. When I eventually decided to break the ice, it was with a joke. We both laughed. He was serious and readily amused. We shall miss him for his wisdom and sensibility.Howard Skempton, composerView image in fullscreenHarrison Birtwistle’s The Mask of Orpheus at the London Coliseum, a staging that earned astinker of a review from Andrew: ‘The production is the work of ENO’s departing artistic director Daniel Kramer, and let’s hope it is the last of his shows to be seen there. For this is a wilful parade of self-indulgence.’Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianLike all natural-born writers, Andrew had a difficult relationship with deadlines, but his writing was so good that it was always worth the wait. In his early days, contributing to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, he even invented the genre of “leaky pillar box copy”, blaming the postal service for the non arrival of an article. Both he and I knew that when he telephoned for a chat it was often deadline-avoidance behaviour. In the foyers at performance intervals, he rightly kept his views to himself, but in our regular phone chats (usually a few times a week) Andrew would gossip freely or come up with shrewd musical insights. Not just musical insights: Andrew was something of a renaissance man, with wide interests, making him a valued colleague and friend.John Allison, editor ofOperawith Opera NewsAndrew was a devoted champion of composers and those dedicated to commissioning, performing and recording their music; invigorating readers through his illuminating, razor-sharp writing to seek out the richness of music: the new, the unexpected, the known, the discoveries. He was, above all, a treasured spirit, one of the rare ones who understood how vital music is for the human soul.Jackie Newbould,creativeproducer, formerlyexecutiveproducer, BCMGAndrew covered so many of BCMG’s concerts. To see him there meant to me, as artistic director, that I must be doing my job well. His presence was an encouragement, an endorsement. I would avidly await his reviews, he had such insightful things to say. On the rare occasions he mentioned the concert programme as a whole, as being deftly constructed for example, I would puff up with pride. Latterly, he and I would talk birds, a shared passion. On this, as with music, he was vastly more knowledgable than me. Andrew’s was a hugely important critical voice, and he was a sustaining pillar of the contemporary music culture. With his passing, as with that of his favourite composers such as Olly Knussen and Harry Birtwistle, it feels as if a particular realm of that culture has ebbed away.Stephen Newbould, formerartisticdirector, BCMGAndrew was a quiet, sometimes withdrawn, always thoughtful colleague: it was always a pleasure to coincide with him at a concert. I was (and still am!) a regular visitor to Iceland and, knowing his passion for bird-watching, I recommended he go to the Lake Mývatn area in the north, to seek out the rare Barrow’s goldeneye duck. He did! And loved the birdlife there!Hilary Finch, retired music critic,the Times****View image in fullscreenMartha Argerich performing in Lucerne in January 2025. The Argentinian-born musician was one of Andrew’s most admired pianists.Photograph: Philipp Schmidli/PHILIPP SCHMIDLI | FotografieAndrew Clements was important to the London Sinfonietta and to what we stand for through his profound belief that new music matters and deserves serious public engagement and debate. We awaited his reviews with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension – encouraged by his praise, frustrated by his criticisms – and did not always agree with his conclusions, which could be blunt. Yet his criticism was clearly grounded in a passion and enthusiasm for surprising breadth of musical styles. His death gives pause not only for his life and those close to him, but for the passing of a particular time and voice.Andrew Burke, CEO andartisticdirector, London SinfoniettaAfter I was in Venice the other year, I spottedAndrew Clements’ review in the Guardian. So I dropped him a line, one anorak to another (anorak: a person who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects). “I was really pleased to be there”, he said, “and very glad I made the effort.” Of course he made the effort; it was a work that fascinated him, something, like so much else, he cared about deeply.John Woolrich, composerAndrew really cared about festivals. As a relatively young festival organiser in the late 80s, I was slightly frightened and certainly in awe of music critics who, at the time, were the only people to have the power to praise or criticise so publicly. Their positive words were key to success.I first plucked up courage to talk to Andrew when I had to hand him a copy of a score, about to be performed at Spitalfields festival. I soon realised he was completely human, and as I read more of his reviews, I appreciated his immense knowledge of an extremely broad repertoire. Most Fridays I have tried to read his CD reviews in the Guardian – he knew exactly how to cherrypick just one from a huge pile of releases.Our paths crossed on frequent occasions over the decades, he always had time to smile or speak very briefly. However, on one occasion, when I sought his advice on a festival matter, he ensured we could have a long conversation, away from the concert hall. As I anticipated, his advice was invaluable.Judith Serota,executivedirector Spitalfields festival,1988-2007View image in fullscreenChristian Gerhaher (centre) at the Wigmore Hall.  For Andrew, Gerhaher was a singer who could do no wrong andwhose recitals he rarely missed.Photograph: Richard CannonBefore birding apps were a thing, a call to Andrew would bring an instant and comprehensive answer to any query. Yes, definitely a sparrowhawk standing sentinel, and likely a female, whose Exocet missile flight away from its perch was then exactly as he predicted. The wonder of swifts was discussed every May through to August, seeing them and – more so in recent times – not seeing them, the continuing decline in numbers a great sadness to him.Most often, phone conversations would focus on pianists, dislikes or likes, among the latter Martha Argerich, Bruce Liu and particularly Radu Lupu, for whom I’d once turned pages in a recital early in his career and, in sitting right there next to him, had learned so much. Reading Andrew’spenultimate CD reviewof previously unheard Lupu recordings, I sensed a valedictory tone which, of course, couldn’t be touched on. Instead, much quizzing of Lupu’s preference for a chair rather than a piano stool and Andrew’s laughing admission that, yes, dammit, Lupu did actually lean back rather than being hunched over the keyboard, as he’d written. His concern had been to capture the intensity of his approach. Lupu playing Schubert’s last sonata D960 will, for me, be a lasting reminder of the affinity Andrew instinctively felt for a musician of such profound commitment.Rian Evans, music critic, the GuardianI’m so very sad to hear of Andrew’s death. Post CD release or premiere, there was nothing quite like the suspense of wondering if the Great Andrew Clements would pen a few words about your latest offering. I’d expected my first CD to be little more than a deluxe drinks coaster, and was flabbergasted when Andrew wrote some lovely things about it. If words wore out, those sentences would be utterly threadbare, the use I’ve got out of them: proudly displayed at the top of every funding application I’ve ever done, his seal of approval has advanced my career, tangibly. Many of us composers liked to opine that, while a good review from Andrew was a badge of honour, a bad write-up was something to be even more proud of: I myself became particularly convinced of this after he labelled a big new piece of mine “almost hackneyed”! Rest in peace, Andrew: your opinions (particularly the flattering ones!) will be greatly missed.Cheryl Frances-Hoad, composerExplore more on these topicsClassical musicOperafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But whose fault is it if you remain dry-eyed?Zoe WilliamsFri 16 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 03.22 ESTShare‘Is it porn or is it art?” A familiar, even dated question where nudity is involved, and (forgive thumbnail) pretty well-resolved– which is to say: we let the tastemakers decide, and it tips the scale towards “art” if one or both protagonists are not that good-looking.“Is it grief-porn or is it grief-art?” is a more vexed question. Grief-porn, in relation to cinema, would suggest that the film in question is emotionally manipulative, formulaic; grief-art would suggest the film unleashes feelings both universal and true.It’s curiously circular. In a film about grief, the valorised quality is depth of feeling; it stands or falls by how profoundly the hero(ine) experiences emotion, and the audience proves its acuity, buys itself into the imaginative contract, by its ability to mirror that profundity. You only get to decide whether it’s art if you’re already feeling it so deeply that it must be, in other words. If the death left you cold and you found the ensuing emotionality manipulative and domineering, this logic is quite annoying.I’m talking in the first instance, of course, about Hamnet, the dramatisation ofMaggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel.On paper, it must be art:Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescalare more than brilliant, they both have qualities of magnetism and believability that are always evident; they probably couldn’t switch those off if they tried. It’s visually sumptuous and the dialogue is contrastingly spare and intelligent.It can’t be a spoiler – but if you know nothing, look away now – to say thatHamnet, the only son of William Shakespeare and Agnes, née Hathaway, died of the plague at the age of 11. The death of a child is a peerless tragedy, so any observation about the onscreen charm of the actor – for instance, “I didn’t find him that charming, I preferred the daughters” – is verboten, and that’s fair enough.There are a number of principles of screen grief that give it intellectual heft, an agenda: the first is that women feel things more deeply than men, particularly their parental bond, but also their connection with the natural world, and with unspoken things, like magic. Buckley curls up in the roots of trees and sometimes can’t breathe with anxiety for her daughter, anxiety whose wellspring is maternal love spliced with witchy premonition. She has foreseen her deathbed, and it features only two children, therefore, having three, something terrible is bound to happen.View image in fullscreenOrnithological bond … Claire Foy in H Is for Hawk.Photograph: Roadside Attractions/Everett/ShutterstockThose womanly qualities also define the film adaptation ofHelen Macdonald’s memoir H Is for Hawk– again, two wonderful actors,Claire Foy and Brendan Gleesonas daughter and father, performing the only way they know how, which is to say, well. When her dad dies suddenly, Foy retreats into isolated commune with a bird of prey, a reach back to her ornithological bond with him, a stalwart refusal, via obsessive hand-feeding of Mabel the bird, and corresponding neglect of self-care, to let Gleeson be dead. True grief stops all the clocks, is the message, and only women know how to do that, partly because only women feel it truly, and partly because only they can mess with time.It feels a little dogmatic, but what makes it grief-porn is that you can only join the character in her mire; whether Buckley’s roaring or Foy’s eerie silence, the emotionality allows in no externality; you either unquestioningly feel it with them or you don’t understand.“Natural world” is a generalisation. What I’m really talking about is birds; Agnes has a hawk, and Shakespeare’s first dating overture is to make her a glove (he is from a glove-making family). Birders were vexed that the film used a Harris’s hawk, an ornithological impossibility in 1580s England (they weren’t introduced until the 1960s – why oh why couldn’t they have found a goshawk, other people, not me, have asked). In the book it’s a kestrel and it signifies Agnes’s soaring free spirit, defiance of convention; in the film, the winged creature performs a more Ted Hughes-lite role, as does the hawk in H Is for Hawk, the size-altering macaw in 2024’sTuesdayand the crow in last year’sThe Thing With Feathers. These birds, one way or another, are all death.View image in fullscreenJulia Louis-Dreyfus as Zora in Tuesday.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyTuesday starsJulia Louis-Dreyfusas Zora, the mother who cannot accept the impending death ofLola Petticrew’s extremely winning titular character. The Thing with Feathers is an adaptation of Max Porter’s extraordinarily movingGrief is the Thing With Feathers, which doesn’t come close to even reminding you of the power of the novella. As memento mori, birds no longer signify liberation, but rather, its opposite; the camera lingers on their eyes, their eerie watchfulness, their sudden movements – particularly in H Is for Hawk: all the bits about birds, in other words, that make you freak out if one flies into your house, because they’re disgusting.Again, there’s something prescriptive about the imagery in every case; if you don’t prefer feathers to fur, if you can’t see the majesty in a creature unless it will let you pet it, if you can’t tolerate its autonomy, love it and set it free, if you can’t relish it for its very ugliness, itsdeathiness,then you are missing some qualities of authenticity and of wisdom.Tuesday stands out among all these films for having a sense of humour: it got lukewarm reviews, which were fair, but also reflected the fact that nobody knew then that so many other bird-as-death films would follow that were worse. Louis-Dreyfus’s avoidance is genuinely funny; she is constantly embarked on some ridiculous, urgent task – selling her collection of taxidermy rats, needing a wee – as her daughter tries to get her attention in order to die.View image in fullscreenBenedict Cumberbatch in The Thing With Feathers.Photograph: Vue Lumiere/PAGenerally speaking, the grief film will brook no comedy; you’ll get the odd hackneyed nod to the hilarity of loss, classically (as in H Is for Hawk) the family getting the giggles as a funeral director shows them some trashy coffins, but the broader absurdity of mortality cannot be borne. Denial, delusion, avoidance, the brutal intrusion of trivial normality into moments of existential agony – it’s all pretty funny, as you’ll know from any lived experience of grief; but grief-porn can’t brook laughter any more than regular porn can. This might be the best single litmus test for whether or not it’s art.Hamnet review – Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley beguile and captivate in audacious Shakespearean tragedyRead more“Crow is everything to Dad,” saysBenedict Cumberbatchin the press notes for The Thing with Feathers. “He’s a provocateur.

He’s a protector.” The Thing is, of course, grief in a man, so when he’s inarticulate, that’s masculine shortcoming rather than feminine mystique, and when he attaches to his feathered phantasm, that’s his flag to pull back from the abyss, rather than a portal out of numbness, back into the world (as Mabel is for Helen).Men get quite a raw deal from grief-as-depth tropes, because it would be so unfashionable to find dignity in their inarticulacy.Chloé Zhao, Hamnet’s director, said that in its making she discovered that “feminine leadership – and that doesn’t mean just women, it means the feminine consciousness in all people – [draws] strength from intuition, relationships, community and interdependence”. Which, again, is a little circular, since Agnes’s grief cycle largely displays none of those values, yet they must be there, because a woman is feeling them, and if any man is feeling them, it’s because he’s tapping into his feminine consciousness.Whether it’s grief-porn or grief-art, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying it, by the way. Each to their own.Explore more on these topicsFilmDeath and dyingHamnetChloé ZhaoJessie BuckleyPaul MescalClaire FoyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The HFPA was disbanded in 2023 after allegations of racism, but 95 former members retained voting rights and on Monday, the show went on.And what a year it was for the second Penske Media Golden Globe awards, featuring not only a commercial tie-in with the betting tool Polymarket (“integrated branding and real-time market insights designed to enhance audience engagement”) but a new category for poor-relation-to-the-screen, best podcast. Against stiff competition from Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy and The Mel Robbins Podcast, the award went to Amy Poehler’s Good Hang, a show in which she yuks it up with her friends to remind us how important Tina Fey was in their partnership.One Battle After Another and Adolescence dominate 83rd Golden GlobesRead moreIn the TV awards, meanwhile, there was well-earned recognition for the actor and thought leader Stephen Graham, for Adolescence, his Netflix show exploring the complexities of men’s rights, and I was happy HBO’s The Pitt won best drama, even though you still need a VPN to watch it in Britain. (I was also happy Michelle Williams won for Dying for Sex, a hugely under-rated FX show that wasn’t helped by its terrible title.)One thing that struck me as the camera swept over the audience during standup comedian Nikki Glaser’s affable opening monologue: is there any circumstance on Earth that would make these people skip this thing entirely? The HFPA was a joke, the awards then and now are a joke, but short of some kind of Pompeii-like event reducing nominees on the red carpet to ash, we have to assume they’ll keep turning up in their finery. I know, I know; it’s aboutthe work.TuesdayA low-key flex in New York used to be to say you saw Hamilton when it was on at the Public (I didn’t see it at the Public). The newest version of this is to claim you saw Oh, Mary!, the hit Broadway show that recently transferred to London, when it opened downtown at the Lucille Lortel theatre. (I didn’t see it at the Lucille Lortel. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything before everyone else saw it and told me to go.)I did, however, see Oh, Mary! this week at the Trafalgar theatre in the West End and it made me so happy I got off the tube at the wrong stop on the way home. Cole Escola’s starring role as a depressed, alcoholic, former cabaret star, Mary Todd Lincoln, is reprised by Mason Alexander Park and any concern that we’d missed the only version worth seeing evaporates in the first five minutes.Not everyone feels this way. Escola tells the story of hapless folk from New Jersey showing up to the Broadway production anticipating a sombre engagement with American history rather than a series of jokes about Abraham Lincoln being gay, and huffing out after five minutes. I don’t know if that has happened in London yet.But while the show here is sold out, there’s no question Oh, Mary! hasn’t had the same impact that it had in New York, partly, perhaps, because the American history part is off-putting and partly because London, in my view, is a much straighter town. I have heard more than one puzzled or disapproving reaction from Londoners who might have been happier at the Michael Jackson musical or Wicked. On which score I feel towards Oh, Mary! a certain combative protectiveness that makes me think if you didn’t like it, it wasn’t for you in the first place.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage: ‘Look, I can’t be a vampire, I’ve got a shadow.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWednesdayIf it’s risible to show up at the Golden Globes, how do you like AARP’s Movies for Grownups awards featuring – no stage too obscure, no appearance too lowly as long as there are cameras to record it – the former leading man George Clooney. It’s quite the turn up, isn’t it, that Noah Wyle, ever the bridesmaid on ER back in the day, has leapt over Clooney with his role in The Pitt, while Clooney is reduced to moping about in ponderous films by Greta Gerwig’s sad-looking husband, Noah Baumbach.Anyway at least someone at AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) liked Jay Kelly and this week Clooneyshowed upon stage to collect an award for it, during the course of which he defended Paul Dano from something Quentin Tarantino had said about … Oh, I can’t even bring myself to get into this.What interests me is the AARP itself, an organisation of immense if invisible cultural reach in the US. Like Costco magazine (circulation: 15.4m), AARP’s publications arm is one of the few juggernaut media enterprises that isn’t slowly circling the drain. It is a behemoth of a brand that reaches 38 million members in the US, has the highest circulation of any print media in the country and a readership at least partly made up of people with money. I take it all back; smart move by Clooney.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson: ‘My regard for Jeffrey Epstein was the size of a matchbox! Or a shoebox at most. Definitely not bigger than a shoebox.’Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/AFP/Getty ImagesThursdayI wouldn’t take a kid to see Oh, Mary!, obviously, but I’d also hesitate to take anyone under 15 to see Sondheim. Clever programming at the Barbican, however, means I might do it. News this week of a forthcoming production of Sunday in the Park with George featuring Wicked co-stars, Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey, is a clever piece of programming for the theatre’s 2027 season that will be even harder to get tickets for than Kenneth Branagh’s forthcoming The Tempest at the RSC.I have a soft spot for Grande after being made to sit in a room for what seemed like decades while Sam and Cat played in the background. But even the attraction of a former Nickelodeon star won’t take the edge off this hard sell. Sondheim is long, and to get my kids out of the house I’ll have to lie about the running time, again, despite poor results in this area. I told my kids Operation Mincemeat was only 80 minutes long and by the end of the pushing-towards-three-hour-long production on a school night there were some very cranky faces indeed.FridayLovely to read about Alan Rickman inall the tributes collated by the Guardianthis week to mark the 10th anniversary of his death. It sent me back to his diaries, one of the great reading experiences, in which Rickman is waspish, indignant, very pissy indeed and wonderfully, warmly entertaining. One anecdote that stayed with me: after attending a party thrown by the Guardian in the late 1990s, Rickman remarked that, even for an actor accustomed to this kind of thing, he had never seen a group of people more uncontrollably drunk and disorderly. Proud, yes, surprised, no.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekTelevisionTheatreAwards and prizesGolden GlobesTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

But a few years ago, the Los Angeles saxophonist Aaron Shaw realised he was becoming increasingly breathless. In 2023, aged 27, he was diagnosed with bone marrow failure, meaning he wasn’t producing enough oxygen-carrying red blood cells. A change of approach was required.Shaw had risen quickly. He studied withKamasi Washington, worked alongside Herbie Hancock and Anderson .Paak, and tutoredAndré 3000in music theory. Shaw works regularly with LA bandleaderCarlos Niño, and played on his 2024 new-age jazz album Placenta and last year’s collaboration with poet Saul Williams. In turn, Niño has produced and played percussion on Shaw’s forthcoming debut album And So It Is, which has something of the West Coast jazz haze you find in both Niño’s and Washington’s music. But Shaw’s sound is actually a lower, darker fog, which he navigates with quiet caution.Shaw mostly plays tenor saxophone and alto flute on the record. It is easier for him to play the latter – less breath is required – yet he persists with his original instrument, floating, Lester Young-style, over the top of Chick Corea’s Windows to the Soul, and battling through long sustains on Heart of a Phoenix. Throughout the record you hear a young musician coming to terms with the end of one musical road, and cautiously feeling around for what comes next. Intimate loops and unexpected flourishes on flute provide optimistic notes on this remarkably open record.Hugh MorrisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenKim Gordon.Photograph: Moni HaworthKim Gordon – Not TodayTo date Gordon’s solo career has been so abrasive and noisy that to hear her singing, quite forlornly, over warmer, racing synths rather than her usual industrial clatter is genuinely disarming.LSMorgan Nagler – Grassoline“I know Jesus ain’t gonna save me / And if he does that’d just be crazy,” the LA songwriter sings in an instantly indelible ode to green, all shambolic, endearing twang.LSRaf-Saperra – Butcher’s Scale (ft Benny the Butcher)Streatham Hill’s finest heads to the US, blending his Punjabi flow and instrumentation with boom-bap beats and a Benny the Butcher guest verse; Ghostface Killah is among the other guests on his new EP.BBTWu Lyf – Tib St TabernacleThe Mancunian rockers amassed cultlike fans in the 2010s, and this return could summon them all over again: it’s an 11-minute anthem that goes from spirited march to pell-mell gallop.

A Church of England moralist warned any “invert” who may have been listening in of “transitory attachments, disillusionment and loneliness in his old age”.The educationist John Wolfenden recommended “a healthy and normal” home life as “the best sort of prophylactic against all sorts of troubles of this kind”.The subject of homosexuality, then a crime, was so taboo that the finished radio programme was shelved until a heavily edited version was broadcast on the Home Service three years later.Then it was forgotten until the original script was rediscovered by the historian Marcus Collins. The script has been brought to life for a new stage play titled The BBC’s First Homosexual, which will tour England in February as part ofLGBT+ History Month.The play tells the story of the radio programme, shines light on the experience of gay men in the 1950s and explores themes that still resonate today, including so-called conversion practices.Collins, aprofessor of contemporary historyat Loughborough University, said there were a number of gay “scandals” in the 1950s that made headlines and led to debates on whether there was a need to clamp down on the “immorality” or to decriminalise.“The BBC saw this ruckus and thought that as the BBC, the voice of balance and authority, it should say something definitive about homosexuality,” Collins said.View image in fullscreenMarcus Collins, left, and Stephen M Hornby.Photograph: Shay RowanThe playwrightStephen M Hornbyhad access to the script and other archive materials, including internal BBC memos and letters from the public after the edited broadcast in 1957.“The overwhelming message I got from reading it [the original script] was either naked, foaming-at-the-mouth homophobia of people like Lord Hailsham. Or the more liberal voices who say conversion therapy works, you ought to give it a go at least – and if not you can live a quiet life of abstinence and not do anything which would scare the horses,” Hornby said.The programme was presented by CR Hewitt, later chair of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, who in the programme described homosexuality as “a sort of infantilism” and “a state of arrested development”. Wolfenden, one of the participants, would later author areport recommending decriminalisation.The only remotely gay voice on the programme, titled The Homosexual Condition, was an anonymous “reformed homosexual” who believed in the value of “sheer will power” to sort people out.Collins has also discovered that programme makers attempted to involve the author of a big, albeit anonymous, article for the Sunday Times about the subject.The writer of the article was described as the “wife of a businessman in the Midlands and mother of three sons”. It was in fact Mary Whitehouse, who wrote: “It may seem a strange thing that a woman should write about homosexuality. But I think many mothers suffer from the fear that, through no fault of their own, their boys may be tempted or warped.”View image in fullscreenA read-through by the team.Photograph: Shay RowanWhitehouse, who later became a household name for hercrusades against “filth”, did not participate. But she will appear as a character in the play, which tells the story of Tom, a 19-year-old who works as a Burton’s tailor in Manchester.The BBC’s director general decided not to broadcast the programme after internal debates, including over whether it might increase homophobia. Another argument made, Collins said, was simply “that the BBC doesn’t talk about sex”.When the edited version was broadcast in 1957, the backlash was such that bosses took the decision there should be no more programmes on the subject “except for special purposes and special occasions”, Collins said. “They say we’ve covered the Wolfenden report, that is the end of discussing homosexuality … there’s nothing more to say.”The play will open in Salford before touring. The plan is to have Q&A sessions afterwards.It is a story from 70 years ago but audiences may see contemporary resonances, including on the topic of conversion practices, which is, tangentially at least, back on the BBC with the participation of Matthew Hyndman on The Traitors. Hyndman experienced it and helpedfound a groupcampaigning for conversion practices to be banned.Hornby said: “Hopefully we’ll have some really interesting conversations with our audience about conversion therapy and why government after government has announced they are going to ban it. And nobody has.”The new play was a development of a “tiny script-in-hand proof of concept 30-minute piece” done three years ago, Hornby said. It will premiere at theNew Adelphi theatreat the University of Salford on 4 Februarybefore a tourto Birmingham, Brighton, London, Liverpool and Loughborough.Explore more on these topicsTheatreLGBTQ+ rightsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, a supreme court judge authorised the disgraced former president to take part in the scheme after a request from his legal team.Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper famed for his hostility to democracy, minorities, the Amazon rainforest and the arts, is unlikely to appreciate the approved reading list. It includes Brazilian works on Indigenous rights, racism, the environment and the violence meted out by the country’s 1964-85 dictatorship – a regime Bolsonaro openly supported.One title, Ana Maria Gonçalves’ 950-page Um Defeito de Cor (A Colour Defect), tells “the history of Brazil … from the point of view of a Black woman”.Also featured isDemocracy!, a children’s non-fiction picture book by the English-born author-illustrator Philip Bunting.Some of the books on the list, such as Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote, are more than 1,000 pages long. Bolsonaro did once appear in public with a similarly sized tome – Winston Churchill’s 1,000-plus page Memoirs of the Second World War – but it is unclear if the former president read it.In order to benefit from the sentence reduction scheme, prisoners must prove they have actually read the books by submitting written reports to prison authorities.Asked to name his favourite book during the 2018 presidential election, Bolsonaro plumped for one byCarlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a notorious army colonel accused of torturing hundreds of prisoners during the dictatorship. “It’s a real story about Brazil … with facts, with data, with places with real episodes,” enthused Bolsonaro who was this week transferred toa maximum security prisonin the capital, Brasília, after spending Christmas imprisoned at a federal police base.Ustra’s book does not feature on the justice system’s reading list but it does contain one title,Marcelo Rubens Paiva’s I’m Still Here, about the plight of prisoners who disappeared into such torture centres.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasLiteracynewsShareReuse this content"

They know that it will be impossible to rule over people. Perhaps their only goal right now is to bring the country to the verge of complete collapse and try to destroy it.”Protests caused by an ailing economy have swept through Iran since late December and were met with deadly crackdowns by the security forces over the weekend, with reports ofmore than 2,500 people killed.A internet blackout imposed last Friday, which blocked 95-99% of the country’s communication network, was a “sign that there would be a very big massacre on the way”, Panahi said. “But we never predicted that the crackdown would have such dimensions and numbers.”View image in fullscreenJafar Panahi directed It Was Just an Accident, a part thriller, part black comedy about Iranians who have been tortured in prison.Photograph: Neon/APPanahi, 65, spoke to the Guardian from the US, where he is promoting his latest film, It Was Just an Accident. The film won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival last year and is a leading contender for the 2026 Oscars in the international feature category.Part revenge thriller, part black comedy, the French entry for the Academy award follows a group of Iranian former political prisoners who try to decide on whether to exact revenge on a man they believe to have tortured them in prison.“What I have been depicting in this film is when the cycle of violence continues, then it becomes very difficult to stop it,” Panahi said. “Unfortunately, because of the savagery that is being carried out by the state, the fear is that this cycle of violence will continue.”It Was Just an Accident review – Jafar Panahi takes us on a nightmare trip into a land of bribes and brutalityRead moreIn December the director was handed a one-year prison sentence in absentia on charges of creating propaganda against the political system, but he has stated his intention to return to the country.He has been jailed twice, for protesting against the detention of two fellow film-makers who had been critical of the authorities in 2022, and for supporting anti-government protests in 2010.Panahi said while the collapse of the government led by the clerical leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was inevitable after the latest bloody suppressions, its timing was impossible to predict.“The regime will collapse, 100%,” Panahi said. “It is what has happened to dictatorship governments throughout history. When it will collapse, no one knows. We want it to be as soon as possible, in the next few minutes, but there are many factors that have to come together for it to happen.”View image in fullscreenIranian police officers stand guard at a protest in Tehran.Photograph: Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu/Getty ImagesHe warned western governments about engaging with the clerical regime as rational actors. “In other dictatorships around the world, you will see that there will be at least a few people who will act based on rationality and who will not let it get to this point,” he said, speaking via his interpreter Sheida Dayani. “But unfortunately in this system there is no rationality. All they can think of is crackdown and how they can stay in power even just one more day. The last thing they’re thinking about is the people.”Some anti-regime protests, in Iran and among the Iranian diaspora in Europe and the US, have called for the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah. The Washington-based Pahlavi, whose late father ruled Iran as an autocratic monarch from 1941 to 1979, has called for people to take to the streets.Panahi recognised that calls for the son of the shah’s return were “the voice that is coming out [of the protests] indeed”. However, he added: “As Reza Pahlavi as said himself, after the transition there must be a referendum in Iran, and that is when people will decide what type of government they want and whom they want to rule over them. During this period of transition, we should all be united.”Asked whether Pahlavi could be trusted to oversee a post-regime transition, he said this would be for the people of Iran to conclude. “Whether we agree with Pahlavi or not, we know that the overwhelming majority of the population of Iran want the current regime to go.”Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiJafar PanahiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The alleged assaults by the singer are said to have taken place in his Caribbean mansions.Photograph: Carlos Giusti/APSpainJulio Iglesias denies sexual abuse claims of two former female employeesWomen allege Spanish singer subjected them ‘to inappropriate touching, insults and humiliation … in atmosphere of control’Sam Jonesin MadridFri 16 Jan 2026 02.58 ESTShareThe Spanish singer Julio Iglesias has broken his silence overallegations that he sexually abused two womenwho worked in his Caribbean mansions, saying he has never “abused, coerced or disrespected any woman”.The 82-year-old entertainer, whose career spans six decades, had been accused by two female former employees who allege they had been sexually assaulted and subjected “to inappropriate touching, insults and humiliation … in an atmosphere of control and constant harassment”.The alleged assaults, which are said to have taken place in 2021, came to light on Tuesday after a three-year joint investigation by the Spanish news site elDiario.es and the Spanish-language TV network Univision Noticias.“With great regret, I am responding to the allegations from two people who used to work in my house,” Iglesias wrote in a post on Instagram early on Friday morning. “I have never abused, coerced or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and pain me deeply.”The singer said he would “defend my dignity against this serious affront” and thanked “so very many dear people for their messages of love and support”.The two women – a domestic worker and a physical therapist known by the pseudonyms Rebeca and Laura – have filed a complaint against Iglesias at Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, accusing him of sexual assault and human trafficking. The allegations are the subject of a preliminary investigation by prosecutors at the court.Rebeca has alleged that Iglesias, who was 77 at the time, would often call her to his room at the end of the working day. She claimed he would then penetrate her anally and vaginally with his fingers without her consent. “He used me almost every night,” she said. “I felt like an object, like a slave.”Laura alleged to elDiario.es and Univision Noticias that Iglesias had kissed her on the mouth and touched her breasts without her permission and against her will. “We were at the beach and he came up to me and touched my nipples,” she said, adding that a similar incident took place by the pool at the singer’s villa in Punta Cana, a luxury resort in theDominican Republic.On Wednesday, elDiario.es published testimony from Rebeca and another former worker, Carolina, in which they allegedbeing required to have medical teststo check for sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and chlamydia.The women said they were then asked to send the results to one of Iglesias’s housekeepers. ElDiario.es also obtained medical documents apparently showing that five women employed at Iglesias’s villa in the Dominican Republic in 2021 underwent gynaecological examinations.In an interview with elDiario.es, Laura said she and Rebeca had decided to file a complaint against Iglesias to encourage other women to come forward. “I think by taking legal action we’re sending a message to all the victims of this person – Julio Iglesias – so that they can speak out and believe in justice,” she said. “It’s so they can understand that this wasn’t something that just happened to them.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeSexual harassmentDominican RepublicAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hilarious. The plots are daft, the cameos are often left-field but work well, and it has loads of great nonsensical gags. It’s a shining example of a sitcom with an unlikable protagonist that you can’t help but root for anyway. I must have watched it from beginning to end at least 15 times. Every friendship and relationship in my life eventually reaches a crossroads: will they like Toast or not?Rhys, 24, CardiffLark Rise to CandlefordI discovered Lark Rise to Candleford just in time to take me away from the nightmare of living in the current political climate. I avoid all news programmes, reality shows, and prefer to settle down with a much simpler, kinder world.Tim K, 60, Brooklyn, New York, USMapp & LuciaThe 1985 adaptation of EF Benson’s novels have a cast that is impeccable. The location, sets and costumes are immaculate and the story so disconnected from modern life that it’s a perfect place to retreat to. I first watched it with my husband to be and we introduced it to friends. We must have seen it a dozen times over the 38 years we were together. Watching with a friend was comfort when I lost him to cancer two years ago. It still holds up. A perfect fictional retreat.Ben, BedfordshireSaving Lives at SeaView image in fullscreenStrangely relaxing … Saving Lives at Sea.Photograph: BBC/Lynsey MelvilleI find watching the RNLI docuseries Saving Lives at Sea strangely relaxing. It’s the combination of jeopardy – people underestimating or overwhelmed by the power of water and weather – with the bravery and commitment of the volunteer lifeboat men and women who, at least in the series, always dash there just in the nick of time to pull them out of the waves. The comforting sense that there are people out there ready to rescue you in extremis must be what appeals about all those hospital and ambulance reality programmes. The difference with SLAS is that I’m unlikely to find myself on a boat out in a storm any time soon!Maddy Paxman, 67, LondonDetectoristsView image in fullscreenAlways brings a lump to my throat … Andy (Mackenzie Crook) and Lance (Toby Jones) in Detectorists.Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC/Channel XEvery winter, my wife and I rewatch Detectorists religiously. When it’s bitterly cold and wet outside, it promises us the sights and sounds of long hot summer evenings in the country that seem so far away right now. It’s hard to analyse but the detail and humour is so rich, layered and nuanced that we often notice new visual gags and strands each time. It’s based on a slow humour that gently teases rather than abuses the eccentrics who pursue the escapist hobbies and eccentricities that we all have. The Suffolk countryside is a beautiful backdrop to Andy and Lance’s adventures and the brilliant Johnny Flynn’s theme tune alone always brings a lump to my throat.Sam, Ely, CambridgeshireSchitt’s CreekView image in fullscreenA gem … Catherine O’Hara in Schitt’s Creek.Photograph: APSchitt’s Creek is my perfect comfort show. I knew I would love it; Catherine O’Hara is always amazing. I started watching her and Eugene Levy in Second City Television (SCTV) in the 70s. I was in tears at the end of it, but good tears. I am amazed thatnone of the Guardian writerspicked this gem.Meg, 58, SussexAround the World in 80 Days with Michael PalinMichael Palin’s Around the World in 80 Days brings together a sense of adventure and nostalgia. When I first saw it 30 years ago, it held out the prospect to see places I had not yet visited or may never get to. Watching it now there is an obvious nostalgia for how travel was before the ubiquity of smartphones. The shot that captures it all for me is Palin watching the sunset over the Bay of Bengal trying to catch the football scores on BBC World Service. The beauty of the world and its mundane pleasures. A travelogue that feels more spontaneous than all of the imitators it spawned.Robert Smith, 59, Newcastle-under-LymePerry MasonPerry Mason (the original TV series, 1957-1966) is the template for most television legal dramas (especially Law & Order): suspects and murder in the first half-hour, courtroom drama in the second. The stories are generally intelligent and engaging, if formulaic, but the cast is wonderful. All had careers as supporting players in noir and B-movies and play their roles that way; that is, as though they’re all supporting players in an ensemble. All performances are in service of the story. And it doesn’t hurt that the truth always wins out and justice is always served. You know: a fantasy world.Phil Hundley, Chicago, USGilmore GirlsGilmore Girls arrived in my life, as many things do nowadays, via its relocation to Netflix. Snappy, sassy and only just past its prime despite some outdated references (though certainly fewer than Friends) it has strong yet brilliantly flawed women at its impossible-to-believe Connecticut heart. Pumpkins, picturesque winters, then the hopeful bright American sunshine take us through the years. Male leads waiting for these women to notice them are not diminished either. Fair, romantic and sure, it brings joy to both my daughter and I who are not remotely like the mother-daughter duo depicted but probably wish we were a little bit.Jayne Stead, YorkPoirotView image in fullscreenDavid Suchet as Poirot.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyWe have watched all the series of this TV adaptation of the investigations of Agatha Christie’s detective at least twice and are watching them again. There is always something else to look out for – Miss Lemon’s hairstyles, Hastings’ Shetland jumpers, Poirot’s moustache. The sets are wonderful. We can never remember who committed the murder, probably because sometimes that’s the least interesting part of the programme.Carol Bloomfield, 67, DurhamSuperstoreAs I mainly work from home, I have the luxury of being able to take a midday nap. I always put on Superstore and follow the pattern of watching one episode, sleeping through the second (about 20 minutes) and waking up in the third. Hearing those beloved characters talking in the background is so comforting and almost feels like having family close by. I wonder what the folks at Netflix would think if they found out there’s someone who has rewatched a show more than 60 times?Elisabeth Kaplan, Vienna, AustriaThe PlanetsI’m a sucker for any documentary about space, but find myself repeatedly going back to Brian Cox’s series. I think it’s the sense of wonder, that every time we learn more about these places we find that they’re more incredible, more diverse. They’re also tantalisingly out of reach. There’s also a contrast with nature documentaries (which I also love), which necessarily come with a sense of loss and guilt about what we’ve done to those habitats. The planets remain perfect and our exploration of them (at least so far) highlights the best of humanity – working together to reach out and to learn.Tom, 48, BrightonHow to With John WilsonHow to With John Wilson is a really original, unique and interesting documentary series that’s at times hilarious, philosophical, sad, whimsical and utterly bizarre. It’s never boring, despite its mundane, everyday topics. It looks so breezy and simple, but I should imagine there are hundreds of hours of footage to edit, and a lot of hard work to bring every single different topic to our screens. I’ve recommended it to everyone I know. I love it.Matthew Grundy, ManchesterFirst DatesView image in fullscreenFeel-good factor … Fred Sirieix on First Dates.Photograph: Channel 4I love watching Fred Sirieix’s dating show. It has the essential feel-good factor – it’s always such a relaxed and happy show, set in nice surroundings. You get to meet lots of different people from different backgrounds, and it reminds me of when I was younger and found my own first dates so exciting and happy. Not many activities match the excitement of a first date and the show captures that feeling, for me at least. Plus, you have the brilliant Fred and Merlin to take you through it.Laurie, West MidlandsFriendsView image in fullscreenMakes me feel less lonely … Friends.Photograph: NBC/Getty ImagesI don’t usually rewatch TV shows (or films) but I make an exception for Friends. Over the years I have caught re-runs on TV, and last year when I was going through a low time in my life, I rewatched all seasons from episode one on Netflix. I remember the first time I watched the pilot and thought it was silly, but I soon became a fan. Decades later, it made me feel less lonely, like having real friends around.Vanessa, DorsetTime TeamView image in fullscreenMy happy place … Time Team.Photograph: Channel 4I’ve always followed archeology. I discovered Time Team in the US during the pandemic and watched them all – thank you, YouTube. The programme is still my comfort: Tony, Carenza, sweet Mick with his jumpers and wine and Phil, my hero. My husband is very indulgent and knows Time Team is my happy place. For an American facing going home, I do need a happy place.Patti Powell, Tunbridge Wells, KentRichard Osman’s House of GamesRichard Osman’s House of Games is where “minor” celebrities gently compete against one another for an awful trophy. Richard is very good at reading the room and encouraging those trailing in the points. It’s so nice to see such good tempered contestants who are never brash or shouty. A perfect end to the day.Pamela Leemeijer, 78, Buntingford, HertfordshireExplore more on these topicsTelevisionMatt BerryMackenzie CrookMichael PalinBrian CoxFriendsRichard OsmanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But despite the haunted house trappings, this is a place where the ghosts are mostly memories. Tilda Swinton, always a sensitive performer, takes dual roles: film-maker Julie and her elderly mother, Rosalind. They come to stay at the rural venue – which used to be the home of Rosalind’s aunt – as a nostalgia trip and a birthday treat for Rosalind. But Julie is unsettled by unexplained noises, while her buttoned-up parent’s recollections of childhood visits there encompass the bad as well as the good. A poignant tale of love, loss and remembrance.Friday 23 January, 11pm, BBC TwoHarveyView image in fullscreenHallucinating? … James Stewart in Harvey.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy“For years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.” James Stewart’s amiable everyman qualities are to the fore in Henry Koster’s warm-hearted1950 comedy. He plays Elwood P Dowd, a harmless drunk who hangs out in bars with an invisible 6ft white rabbit/fairy spirit called Harvey. Or is his alcoholism giving him hallucinations? The townsfolk either keep their distance from him or play along, but his sister Veta (a terrifically flustered Josephine Hull) is at the end of her tether. Despite his possible mental health issues, Elwood’s ethos of enjoying all life has to offer is a persuasive one.Sunday 18 January, 11am, Film4CharadeView image in fullscreenNear-perfect … Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyShe may have been going on half his age, but Audrey Hepburn’s partnership with Cary Grant in this1963 crime caperis a near-perfect Paris match.

Now comes Macon Blair’s ineffably sillyremake. Peter Dinklage stars as mild-mannered chemical factory janitor Winston Gooze, who turns into a green-hued, superpowered crusader against his company’s dubious health and safety policies after being thrown into a pool of unsavoury liquid.

Herb was once in a romantic and musical partnership with Carey Mulligan’s Nell, who unexpectedly turns up too as Charles gets the band back together for a private gig. But their reunion unearths Herb’s lingering pain, which vies with widower Charles’s loneliness for the drama’s biggest emotional impact.

Obnoxious jewellery dealer Rodney Manderson has been killed outside the Bowery auction rooms, stabbed through the eye with the Victorian hatpin that his boss, Rose Bowery, has brandished in front of the nation on Bargain Hunt. As she discussed the pin’s virtues as a deadly weapon as well as its millinerial uses, the fiercely loyal Rilke decides – while feeling grateful to have skipped lunch and trying not to think of jelly – to remove it before calling the police. They soon decide they’ve got their man, but Rilke’s not so sure; the roots of the crime may lie in the past – in particular, a notorious reform school. With a central character who feels like an old friend, The Cut Up is as sharply observed, humane and beautifully written as its two superb predecessors.The Persianby David McCloskey (Swift, £20)Former CIA analyst McCloskey’s fourth novel centres on Jewish Iranian dentist Kam Esfahani. Dissatisfied with life in Sweden, where his family relocated when driven out of Iran, and wanting the wherewithal to move to California, he accepts an offer from the chief of Mossad’s Caesarea Division. Returning to Tehran, he runs a fake dental practice as cover for assisting in “sowing chaos and mayhem in Iran”. Things go awry when he enlists double agent Roya Shabani, widow of an Iranian scientist killed by the Israelis. The book takes the form of a series of confessions that Kam, now caught and imprisoned, is forced to write by his torturer, and these documents – which may or may not reveal the whole truth – are interspersed with flashbacks. Kam’s cynical tone and mordant humour serve to underline not only the horror, but also the inherent hypocrisy of the endless cycle of violence and retribution: this masterly novel is tragically topical and utterly gripping.View image in fullscreenThe 10:12by Anna Maloney (Raven, £16.99)In screenwriter Maloney’s debut novel, fiftysomething art lecturer Claire Fitzroy is on her way home from Manchester, preoccupied by a marital crisis, when a ragbag of angry screw-ups, their antisocial tendencies inflamed by internet rage-bait, hijack the 10:12 to Euston. With other brave passengers, Claire fights back, but some of her actions have drastic consequences; and when the surviving terrorists are put on trial, Claire finds herself in the court of public opinion, with many viewing her not as a life-saving heroine but as an unhinged menopausal murderer. Now she wants to put the record straight – and, unsatisfied by what she’s heard at the Old Bailey, to discover the whole truth. Gripping and immersive, this salutary tale of how we stereotype and underestimate others is a white-knuckle read that also gives food for thought.View image in fullscreenVery Slowly Allat Onceby Lauren Schott (HQ, £16.99)This tense, pacy debut novel is a cautionary tale about living beyond one’s means. Trying to maintain their dream home and lifestyle in an exclusive Cleveland suburb has left the Evans family – divorce attorney Hailey Evans, lecturer Mack, and their two young daughters – financially stretched. To make matters worse, Mack is suspended from work; Hailey’s most lucrative client reneges on payment; ominous cracks are appearing all over their newly built house; and they are about to have to start picking up the tab for Mack’s mother’s care home.

The war of words that laid waste to the 2026 Adelaide writers’ festivalHow a boardroom flare-up sparked an international boycott – and a looming defamation battleKelly BurkeFri 16 Jan 2026 01.29 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 16.04 ESTShareIt began as a quiet programming dispute in the genteel city of churches.But by Wednesday morning, a frantic, six-day war of words had culminated in the end of the 2026 Adelaide writers’ week and total institutional collapse.What started with the discreet exit of a business titan and arts board veteran spiralled into boardroom carnage last weekend, with mass resignations, lawyers’ letters of demands and allegations of racism and hypocrisy flung by all sides.British indie band Pulp agree to play Adelaide festival after boycott U-turnRead moreBy the time the writers’ week director,Louise Adler, walked, the boycott of writers, commentators and academics had gone global and the state’s premier cultural event had become a hollowed-out shell.The cancellation of AWW may only be the opening act. The wreckage has now cleared the way for a supreme court showdown between the state’s telegenic – and until now, Teflon – premier, Peter Malinauskas, and the polemic Palestinian Australian academic Randa Abdel-Fattah – the writer at the heart of the row,whose invitation to the 2026 event was withdrawnless than two weeks ago.At the centre of the looming legal battle is the premier’s now-notorious Bondi analogy that even Malinauskas’s allies admit may have finally scratched his protective coating.‘Spewing anti-Zionism’The seeds of this spectacular collapse were sown not in the heat of January but in the spring thaw of last October, with the resignation of Tony Berg, a former managing director of Macquarie Bank and Boral, and a key festival benefactor. The resignation may have been discreet but theletter sent to the festival’s boardand the South Australian government on 22 October was a snapshot of a board in its last throes, allegedly held hostage by an unyielding artistic director.Berg, a self-described Zionist and a governor of the Israel Australia Chamber of Commerce, accused the festival’s leadership of presiding over a “blatantly one-sided” mission that had traded open debate for a “vendetta against Israel and Zionism”.He alleged that Adler had resolutely failed to provide balance in her programming since her appointment in 2022, and of “spewing anti-Zionism” through her choice of speakers. Abdel-Fattah came to national attention with an Instagram post declaring “Zionists have no claim or right to cultural safety” shortly after the conflict broke out in Gaza. For Berg, her inclusion in the 2026 lineup was the final “travesty” – a move he claimed crossed the line from political criticism into the territory of antisemitism.View image in fullscreenSouth Australia’s premier Peter Malinauskas.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianWatching the fallout from the other side of the world this week, Berg doubled down on his position.On Sunday Guardian Australiareported on a leaked letterfrom the board saying a Jewish New York Times columnist, Thomas Friedman, had been cancelled from the 2024 program due to scheduling issues. On Tuesday Bergissued a statementaccusing both Adler and Abdel-Fattah of displaying a “selective” and “utterly hypocritical” approach to free speech, alleging that it was Adler and Abdel-Fattah who had led the charge to de-platform Friedman, who had written a controversial column comparing the Middle East conflict to the animal kingdom.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAccording to Berg, Adler and the festival’s top leadership had issued a comply-or-resign ultimatum to the board to force Friedman’s withdrawal, an irony Berg noted was seemingly lost on the authors boycotting the festival.Adler reacted by attacking Berg’s integrity as a board member but has neither confirmed nor denied she issued an ultimatum.Randa Abdel-Fattah speaks to Nour Haydar about the Adelaide festival – podcastRead moreAbdel-Fattah disputes the allegation that she, along with Adler, led the charge to cancel Friedman, but does not deny she was one of 10 Indigenous and academics of colour “who wrote a researched letter with references and footnotes about the harm of racial tropes”.“We write letters on Google Docs to boards,” she said. “The people who want to cancel us have premiers intervening.”Since last Thursday Malinauskas has been steadfast in hisdenials of any direct interference, insisting that the board had acted independently. He pointed to his own defence of the festival in 2023 – when he resisted calls to pull funding for the event over a different set of Palestinian writers – as proof of his longstanding commitment to artistic autonomy.But he has admitted that he began to lobby for Abdel-Fattah’s removal from the writers’ week around Christmas, when he had “a number” of conversations with the board chair, leading to him penning a letter to the board on 2 January, “advocating” his point of view.According to political observers on the ground in North Terrace, the fingerprints of political interference are difficult to ignore. By the time the board took action the premier’s office had effectively seeded local press with enough “security and harmony” concerns to ensure the author’s removal was viewed as an act of public safety, rather than a political hit.‘Despicable’During the collective national grief over the Bondi terrorist attack, the festival’s board and the SA government quietly conducted a cultural safety audit. In between Christmas and new year festivities, it reached its terminal conclusion.The board chose to ignore concerns raised by Adler during these deliberations – but she was not the only one. With theVenice BiennaleandBendigo writers’ festivaldebacles still fresh in public memory, the festival’s executive director, Julian Hobba, warned the board during multiple meetings of the inevitable fallout from any move to dump a writer on the grounds of their strident political views.Nevertheless on the morning of 8 January the board allowed the first domino to fall.Abdel-Fattah’s response to her cancellation was swift, framing the decision not as an act of community harmony but one of “blatant and shameless” anti-Palestinian racism and censorship. The board’s attempt to associate her with the Bondi massacre was “despicable”, she said.The influential progressive thinktank the Australia Institute fired the next salvo, abruptly withdrawing its partnership and sponsorship.View image in fullscreenCrowds at an Adelaide writers’ week event.Photograph: Andrew BeveridgeWhat followed was a global literary mutiny. By the time the headline act – the former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern –confirmed she was pulling outon Monday, more than 70 literary luminaries had already turned the Pioneer Women’s Memorial Garden into a contagion site, announcing their boycott of the 2026 event on social media or via their agents. The British novelist Zadie Smith, the Pulitzer prize winner Percival Everett, the Greek economist and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis and the Russian-American journalist M Gessen, along with the local star attractions Helen Garner, Melissa Lucashenko and Michelle de Kretser, were among them.At least as many participants again had quietly informed either AWW or Adelaide festival management they were pulling out – and behind the scenes, festival organisers were begging the legendary British band Pulp and their uncompromising frontman, Jarvis Cocker, not toformally cancel their contractto play at the festival’s free opening night concert on 27 February at Elder Park.The premier’s carefully curated message of social cohesion was being lost in the static of an international outcry.And Adler retreated to the tranquility of her home, tuning out the persistent thrum of media inquiries and quietly drafting her resignation manifesto.Open letterOn Saturday morning the board met to discuss crisis management. It was “not enjoyable”, according to the wry understatement of one person present.“It’s not over by a long shot,” said another.Before them was anopen letterfrom the elder statesman of the SA arts scene, Rob Brookman, a former executive director and artistic director of the Adelaide festival. Demanding the immediate reinstatement of Abdel-Fattah, it was signed by luminaries of festivals past, including the former artistic directors Neil Armfield, Peter Sellars, Jim Sharman and Anthony Steel. By Monday that list of signatures would grow to 17, including Stephen Page and Robyn Archer.I cannot be party to silencing writers, which is why I am resigning as director of Adelaide Writers’ Week | Louise AdlerRead moreBy the meeting’s end, the exodus had begun. Nicholas Linke, a senior partner at the major law firm Dentons, and the board’s primary legal expertise, was the first to walk. Then departed Donny Walford, the founding director of the leadership and coaching company Behind Closed Doors, and Daniela Ritorto, a former BBC journalist and wife to federal health minister Mark Butler.Its chair, Tracey Whiting, switched the lights off with her own resignation at the meeting’s end.On Sunday, unaware the board was now inquorate, Abdel-Fattah’s legal team at Marque Lawyerssent it a letter. It was a formal challenge to the “cultural sensitivity” grounds used to dump her, demanding her immediate reinstatement and an apology for the “malicious” characterisation of her views as a threat to community safety.With no board left to govern and a list of boycotting authors that had swelled past 170, Adlerannounced her own resignationin Guardian Australia on Tuesday morning.“I cannot be party to silencing writers,”she wrote, describing the board’s capitulation as a “terminal betrayal” of the festival’s mandate. She noted that the pressure to self-censor had made her position “utterly untenable”.View image in fullscreen‘I’m fed up with the vicious bullying and lies about me,’ Abdel-Fattah says.Photograph: Flavio Brancaleone/AAPBy the end of the day, the Adelaide Festival Corporation had pulled the plug. The 2026 writers’ week was over before it began. A new skeleton board was announced, somewhat ironically including one of the board’s fiercest critics – Brookman, who had initiated the directors’ petition.The Bondi analogyStanding amid the wreckage on Tuesday, the premier emerged to deliver the now-notorious “Bondi analogy”.Seeking to justify the exclusion of Abdel-Fattah, Malinauskas asked the media pack: “Can you imagine if a far-right Zionist walked into a Sydney mosque and murdered 15 people? Can you imagine that as the premier of this state, I would actively support a far-right Zionist going to writers’ week and speaking hateful rhetoric towards Islamic people? Of course I wouldn’t, but the reverse has happened in this instance.”By Wednesday morning, as the festival corporation emailing patrons promising refunds for the few ticketed events AWW has each year, another letter from Marque was fired off.Signed by the firm’s managing partner, Michael Bradley – who is also representing thepianist Jayson Gillhamin his discrimination case against the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra – it wasa show cause notice to the premier himselfover alleged defamation.On Instagram, Abdel-Fattah accused Malinauskas of going even further than previous statements supporting her removal from the festival by linking her to the Bondi atrocity and suggesting, by way of analogy, that she was “an extremist terrorist sympathiser”.Jewish American columnist Thomas Friedman says he was uninvited from 2024 Adelaide writers’ week over ‘timing’Read moreThe new board met twice the day after it was formed. Led by Judy Potter, a veteran arts administrator and go-to institutional fixer for the SA government, it voted topublicly apologise to Abdel-Fattahand promise her a gig at next year’s AWW.As for this year’s event, members deemed it “tragically irretrievable”.The academic in the eye of the storm accepted the apology wholeheartedly. But Abdel-Fattah isn’t finished with the premier.“There is an extraordinary imbalance and abuse of power here,” she said, adding: “I’m fed up with the vicious bullying and lies about me.”When asked if he had gone too far with his Bondi remarks, the premier remained unrepentant: “My only motivation has come from a place of a desire for people to treat each other civilly with compassion, in the interest of humanity more broadly,” he said.That such concern for humanity has resulted in the institutional silencing of one of the country’s premier platforms for intellectual discourse suggests a new, more cautious era for a state that, since the high-water days of theDon Dunstanera, has prided itself on leading Australia in all that is radical and provocative.The city of churches, it seems, has proven to be no sanctuary for free speech or difficult ideas. Instead, it has become a place where the rowdy pursuit of social cohesion has ended in the absolute quiet of a cancelled festival.This story was amended on 16 January 2026 to remove a reference to the Adelaide Festival Centre, which is not affiliated with the Adelaide Festival.Explore more on these topicsAdelaide festivalAntisemitismIsrael-Gaza warIslamophobiaAustralian booksSouth AustraliaSouth Australian politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her new novel, Chosen Family, is a smart, funny tale of a complicated, life-changing relationship between two women.Nell and Eve meet aged 12 at a girls’ school in Sydney. Gray’s narrative moves smoothly back and forth from the 00s to the present day; as in David Nicholls’s One Day, we learn about our protagonists by meeting them at different moments in their lives, from the pressures of high school to the alcohol-soaked freedoms of university to the frustrations and joys of early parenthood.We are told at the outset that, although Nell and Eve have a young daughter that they coparent, Nell is no longer around – and her mysterious absence keeps us deeply invested in their story. What went wrong? Who betrayed whom? And can it be fixed?When they first meet, Nell is a lonely kid with rich parents who give her their credit card details but not much else. She is resigned to being friendless until she meets Eve, a new girl with a flaky single mum. The two are instant allies, devoted to each other, but mean girls soon begin to circle. There are rumours Eve is a “lez”. Sensing social disaster, Nell cuts Eve loose to save herself.Gray evokes the horrors of school perfectly – “there is something almost sublime about the cruelty of preteen girls; the absolute acid of it”. Without Nell, Eve is a solitary “ghost”. But when we meet Eve again at university, we see her coming back to life, making new friends (the scene-stealing Marcus and Tae) and beginning to embrace her sexuality. She Googles “how to look even gayer” before going to class and, on her first outing to a gay bar, asks if it’s acceptable to buy another woman a drink, or “patriarchal”.Gray beautifully depicts Eve’s discovery of her new queer identity, showing how vital and exciting it can be to find a community. But even as Eve is revelling in the newfound joys of lesbian sex, she is careful not to let anyone get close to her. And when Nell comes back into her life – a subdued and apologetic version of her high-school self – Eve is both a magnanimous friend and someone acutely aware of the power of being a magnanimous friend.Beneath their tentative reunion, questions linger: what do they really feel for each other? Are they friends or something more?Beneath their tentative reunion, other questions linger: what do they really feel for each other? Are they friends or something more? Were those school bullies on to something? The wounds that linger from their younger years come into even sharper focus when Eve suggests they bring up a child together as friends, using sperm donated by one of their gay male housemates (“Inseminate me, babe!”). Despite misgivings, Nell goes along with it.Relationship novels typically use female friendship as a place where the characters go to discuss their love lives – a kind of narrative breakout area – but there is often an intensity equal to the “main” romances. Sally Rooney’sBeautiful World, Where Are You, for example, features long emails sent between two women, whose relationship to each other is arguably as compelling as the ones they have with men. Chosen Family explores that unspoken possibility: could a deep love between women be put at the centre of the story? Could it form a different kind of partnership, a new kind of family?But alongside that runs the terror of losing your best friend if it all goes horribly wrong. Both Nell and Eve are obsessed with the story of Medusa. Nell becomes an artist and her work features images of the snake-headed gorgon’s admirers being turned to stone. The idea of being petrified – in both senses of the word – runs through the novel. Both women conceal things from each other because the stakes are so high.This brilliantly sharp and readable book explores friendship, parenting, love, lust, self-deception and all the ways those things overlap. It reveals the cruelties we inflict on those we are closest to and asks if we might be able to find new, more honest, ways to love.Chosen Family by Madeleine Gray is published by W&N (£20).

But as the former’s apocalyptic sequelGreenland 2: Migrationlingers in the top five and the latter’s action rompShelterprepares to premiere, we find two more prominent stars – Oscar winners Ben Affleck and Matt Damon – resigned to the small screen instead.28 Years Later: The Bone Temple review – Ralph Fiennes is phenomenal in best chapter yet of zombie horrorRead moreIn a non-Netflix world, a film like The Rip – flashy, action-heavy, led by two household names – should be available this weekend on the biggest high-format screens across the country. But then in that same world, at this particular time, it’s doubtful that a film like this would even get made, granted a budget that’s reportedly close to $100m, highly unusual for R-rated non-IP. The streamer was, in fact, so keen to get it made that it has briefly agreed to change its pay structure, allowing Affleck and Damon to bring across their profit-sharing Artists Equity rule, by which each member of the cast and crew gets a bonus if the film performs well. So, as with many films at this weird moment, it’s a take-what-you-can-get situation and while it would have been preferable to see a film like this, which looks and feels like it was made in 2002, on the big screen, the landscape has dictated that the small will have to do.It’s made by Joe Carnahan, a writer-director who broke out in that same year with crime thriller Narc, a film that was saved from direct-to-video ignominy by Tom Cruise, who boarded as exec producer. Since then, Carnahan has continued to attract other Hollywood action junkies such as Liam Neeson (The Grey and The A-Team), Gerard Butler (Copshop), Mel Gibson (Boss Level) and Affleck, whom he first worked with on 2006’s rather annoying caper Smokin’ Aces. I’d argue that Carnahan has only made one truly great film in The Grey, a grim, gruelling and surprisingly poignant survival thriller about men at the end of the world facing the end of their lives, but he’s proven himself to be a mostly solid genre hand. The system hasn’t found a place for him in the last few years (hands up if you’ve seen Kerry Washington dudShadow Forceor Zachary Levi disaster flick Not Without Hope) but The Rip, a project he developed with TV writer Michael McGrale, is a comfortable fit, the kind of film he would have been making back in his heyday.As with Affleck’s last Netflix action vehicle, 2019’sTriple Frontier, it’s a sturdy, straightforward throwback to the theatrical movies of yesteryear, and as with that film it also concerns a fight over a considerable bounty. A film called The Rip led by cops might cause gruesome flashbacks to 2013’s Jeff Bridges-Ryan Reynolds paranormal police flop RIPD, but here a “rip” means something thankfully rather different and more of the real, physical world. Inspired by alleged true events, it refers to a stashed amount, here tipped off to a group of Miami officers led by Damon’s Dane and Affleck’s JD. They descend upon a seemingly normal suburban house, and led by an excitable money-sniffing dog, find more than $20m hidden in the attic. The team, which also includes Oscar-tipped Teyana Taylor and Oscar nominees Steven Yeun and Catalina Sandino Moreno, must then safely transport it – but who can be trusted with a rip like this?Cue plenty of talk about jacking or robbing the rip, which no actor is quite able to normalise, and as talented as Damon and Affleck might be, some of their more bro-y, puffed-chest theatrics also ring a little false at this stage of their careers. But it’s otherwise something of a treat to watch them take on roles that would usually be sleepwalked by Butler and Statham, a sprinkling of truffle oil on a greasy roadside burger. There’s their obvious longtime chemistry, but they’re also serious dramatic actors who are able to bring some humanity to rote, underwritten tragic backstories (dead kid versus dead girlfriend, etc). There’s little else for the other actors to really chew on, although, as the young woman living in the house, Sasha Calle has a real striking presence, her rising, clammy fear at what’s to come helping crank up the tension.Carnahan, working with a budget he hasn’t been this close to for years, is a brash, cocksure and entirely unsubtle director, raised on Simpson-Bruckheimer cinema, and, while it might not look quite as expensive as it actually is (one imagines the Damon-Affleck paydays were considerable), the film has a forceful swagger to it. The mystery, when over-unfolded, isn’t as tantalising and Agatha Christie-adjacent as Carnahan would have you believe, although I did get a kick out of seeing a flashback-heavy sub-Poirot explanation delivered in the back of a DEA truck. After that it’s wall-to-wall action and while it’s competently staged, it’s a shame the female characters are sidelined, despite the three possessing enough tenacity to easily play the boys at their own game. The Rip is ultimately a game for the boys, though, and taken as a piece of boisterous macho pulp, it’s a propulsive enough four-beers-in watch. A movie to be enjoyed on Friday night and forgotten all about by Saturday morning.The Rip is available on Netflix on 16 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsMatt DamonNetflixBen AffleckAction and adventure filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Adapted froman award-winning book(which also becamethe film Purely Belter), the play has its own rags-to-riches story, of sorts. Written and directed byJamie Eastlake, it began life at a 60-seater social club in north Tyneside in 2022. Now, here it is in the West End, full of vivid characters, in-your-face demotic and subtly damning commentary on the political betrayals of this region, drained of resources – and sometimes hope itself.Jonathan Tulloch’s original novel, The Season Ticket, was published in 2000 but could have been written for our age of austerity, though its tone wavers between comedy and tragedy. The picaresque exploits of young, disenfranchised friends Gerry (Dean Logan) and Sewell (Jack Robertson) – whether scouring the banks of the Tyne for stuff to sell or carrying out burglaries – are spliced with dark family drama involving poverty, domestic violence, alcoholism and sexual abuse.Eastlake tries to capture it all, adding song and dance. There are vibrant performances and effective choreography (by Lucy Marie Curry and Sean Moon) with a balaclava-clad ensemble. There is also some grittily romantic spoken-word poetry. But the script as a whole is messy and incohesive, its various parts pulling away from each other.View image in fullscreenA ton of heart and soul … Jack Robertson (Sewell) and Katherine Dow Blyton (Mrs McCarten) in Gerry and Sewell.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSome numbers work, especially those sung by Gerry’s sister Claire (Chelsea Halfpenny), who is an aspiring singer. But sudden breakouts of music, club beats and pop songs do not progress the story and bring confusion at times.There are a few powerful family scenes in the second half, especially featuring Gerry’s other, elusive sister, Bridget (Erin Mullen), including one monologue with shades ofGary Owen’s Iphigenia in Splott. But these are isolated, diluted by long comic diversions around a dog that Gerry and Sewell adopt. There is toilet humour, meta-comedy and jokes about Sunderland FC, which seem to try too hard to turn this into feelgood fare when it might gain depth by embracing the story’s darkness a little more fully. The season ticket storyline is beached by the end and some basic plotlines remain fuzzy.Still, there are sparks of brilliance and much potential – as well as a ton of heart and soul.AtAldwych theatre, London, until 24 January.

Broadway star Levi Kreis plays a version of himself, battling his demons and facing his past, only to conclude that, however flawed he often feels, he is in fact – ah, you’ve guessed.This Levi stumbles off stage, inked and emotional, having been dumped by text during a matinee. After 11 sober months, he reaches for the crystal meth – but his soft-eyed sponsor Ben (Yiftach “Iffy” Mizrahi) urges him to confront his inner child, ideally in song. Levi is unconvinced – “my inner child is like Chucky, but he’s human, he’s gay and he thinks he’s Elvis” – but sits at the keyboard and yowls through the pain.Matthew (Levi’s given name) slides through a crack in the wall; this cocky twink, excellently played by Killian Thomas Lefevre, takes the hero through self-hating adolescence (conversion therapy and rejection) into self-destructive adulthood (drugs and terrible men). Older and younger selves glower and snipe and slowly make their peace.View image in fullscreenYowling through the pain … Levi Kreis in Already Perfect.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianKreis’s untrammelled, often lachrymose dialogue leaves no room for nuance. Instead it whops you about the ears, spelling out exactly what Levi is deflecting or denying. He unpacks and explains his feelings – there’s nothing for the audience’s imagination to do.His lyrics, too, tend to be on the nose – but his music has a compulsive secret life. It prowls from the Pentecostal rumble of a revival meeting to a bereft Nashville sob and a broken-hearted ballad which young Matthew diagnoses as Aretha meets Tori Amos. The alluring melodies offer the compulsive rhythms of old time religion, the irresistible drama of rejection – you see how these might hold Levi’s heart even as they damage him.In Dave Solomon’s nifty production, a workaday dressing room transforms into a theatrical playground (design by Jason Ardizzone-West). Piano chords summon coloured lights, the wardrobe spills costumes, while a snap of the fingers prompts a spotlight and a prop dropping from the ceiling.There’s no doubting the talent and sincerity involved in Already Perfect, and Kreis himself brings a big voice to this small stage. He tears the heart out of his songs and brandishes it, palpitating, above his head.AtKing’s Head theatre, London, until 15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

They’re back with a big show and their first album together since 1995Fri 16 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShare‘There isn’t one songwriter, and so the flavour of the band is always going to change,” says Dave Vanian, reflecting on 50 years of the group of which he has been the sole constant member, the Damned. “Captain Sensible is a great fan of syrupy pop music and prog and glam rock. So his writing is very poppy, melodic and quite wonderful. My writing is more melodramatic, more theatrical. And Rat Scabies was a mod who really loved bands like the Who. That melting pot would either not work at all, or be an absolute firecracker.” As the history of the Damned attests, it has, on occasion, been both.There have been three break-ups: in the late 70s, late 80s and early 90s; Sensible and Scabies have had repeated spells out of the band; Scabies only started working with them again in 2022, after 27 years away. “The rift was really between him and Captain,” says Vanian, though at one time or another, it seems as though each of the three principals has been in a relationship-ending rage with one or both of the others.In 1977, Scabies was so sick of the others he left the band while on tour in France, later to be replaced by the future Culture Club drummer Jon Moss. Then the founding guitarist and songwriter Brian James split the band in 1978, only for the other three to reunite. In the 80s, the others were unhappy at Captain Sensible’s chart-topping parallel solo career, which led to him in turn leaving the band and having a breakdown. Vanian himself considered his friendship with Scabies over after the drummer licensed the release of the Not of This Earth album in 1995 against Vanian’s wishes. But the trio are now reunited, releasing a new album and gearing up to mark their half-century with a gig at Wembley Arena.View image in fullscreenBack to black … Captain Sensible, Dave Vanian, Brian James and Lu Edmonds in 1977.Photograph: Erica Echenberg/RedfernsThe Damned’s history, in fact, is so convoluted it’s actually done them harm. Where everyone understands who and what their contemporaries the Sex Pistols and the Clash were, it’s much harder with the Damned. They released the UK’s first punk single, New Rose, before diverting to psychedelic pop, but to many listeners they’re one of the definitive goth bands. Their 13 studio albums are spread between nine labels, so there’s never been the career-spanning reissue programme a band of their status might expect. That hasn’t stopped anyone and everyone from trying to take their piece of the Damned: there are also 23 live albums of varying degrees of quality, and a preposterous 30 compilations. “It’s all out of our control,” Scabies says. “We signed those pieces of paper, and we never really thought about the consequences.”Then there’s the matter of the 33 people who have played with the Damned. But these days, regardless of the long service of the other band members, the idea of the Damned is once again fixed as Vanian, Sensible, Scabies. And, at last, they all seem to be getting on.I get so many people from other bands telling me, ‘If it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t have started my band’Dave Vanian“They’re genuinely funny blokes,” says Captain Sensible. “They’re very amusing to travel with. No one knows what Dave Vanian is really like, but he does very good impersonations from Carry On and On the Buses. And Rat has his ongoing hunt for the holy grail.” He really does, as documented in the bookRat Scabies and the Holy Grail: “Worth a read,” Sensible says. If you search, YouTube even has a trailer for a film about his hunt, called Rat Scabies: Grailhunter. “You should hear about the exploits he gets up to in the south of France with a shovel in the dead of night,” Sensible says. “Well, I won’t go into it.”As for the old enmities? A proposed sit-down with the three of them became individual video calls with Scabies and Sensible, before a weeks-long wait for a separate chat with Vanian. But relations are solid. “I didn’t want us standing around a grave saying, ‘We should have done that while we had the chance,’” Scabies says of their reunion. “Life’s too short. And it was quite a relief to be able to say, ‘You know what? It’s all water under the bridge. They say, ‘Forgive and forget,’ and we’ve benefited from that, for sure.”When the Damned began, punk didn’t even exist as a word. Brian Robertson, Chris Millar, Ray Burns and David Lett were part of the original tiny coterie of punks, coming together through the same array of half-formed bands as the other early punk groups did. Robertson became Brian James, to avoid confusion with Thin Lizzy’s guitarist, Lett became Dave Vanian (as in Transyl-), Millar became Rat Scabies, because he looked like a dead rat and had suffered scabies, and Burns became Captain Sensible, because he wasn’t.“Everyone in the band thought they were the best one in it,” Scabies says. “Any one of us could have fronted their own band.”View image in fullscreen‘Genuinely funny blokes’ … Dave Vanian, Captain Sensible, Rat Scabies and Brian James outside the Stiff Records office in 1977.Photograph: Ian Dickson/REX/Shutterstock“Each member was almost a frontman in themselves,” Vanian agrees. “Now there’s a lot more give-and-take and letting others shine.”Their forthcoming album – the first featuring the three of them since 1995 – is dedicated to James, who died in March 2025, and consists entirely of covers of the kind of songs the four of them all had in common when they first came together. “The one thing we all agree on musically is 60s garage bands,” Sensible says. “They were all doing their utmost to sound great, but with more passion and less skill they created this lovely sound.” And so Not Like Everybody Else serves as a whistle-stop tour of the Damned’s formative tastes: the Kinks, the Stones, the Creation, the Lollipop Shoppe, the Stooges, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd.The Damned, the three of them all admit, will always be known as “punk band the Damned”, despite their not being a punk band since 1978. Even on their first post-James album, Machine Gun Etiquette, they were stretching far beyond ramalama on Smash It Up Pt 1, I Just Can’t Be Happy Today and Plan 9 Channel 7. From 1980, The Black Album featured the 17-minute prog-psych epic Curtain Call, still a feature of their live sets (“I could probably take a minute and half out of that,” Sensible says, “but no more.” Vanian says they feared “it could be the kiss of death”). By the mid-80s, they were major label gothic psychedelic hitmakers with Grimly Fiendish, The Shadow of Night, Is It a Dream, and their cover of Barry Ryan’s Eloise.Vanian has regrets from those times, namely that they couldn’t translate those British hits into US success. He begins talking about his contemporaries – Billy Idol, John Lydon – who went to the US and remade their careers with the backing of their labels. And their relative financial circumstances have clearly occurred to him.“I get so many people from other bands telling me, ‘If it wasn’t for you I wouldn’t have started my band.’ And that’s very nice and flattering, but it hasn’t helped me, and I’d like to have a little bit of luxury before I pop off.”View image in fullscreenPatricia Morrison, Captain Sensible, Dave Vanian, Pinch and Monty Oxymoron at the Fillmore in San Francisco, 1999.Photograph: Anthony Pidgeon/RedfernsIn fairness, though, the Damned often didn’t help themselves: their instrument-smashing, pie-throwing mania wasn’t confined to the stage, and one reason they tore through so many labels is that they could be tiring signings. “There were several incidents when we were invited to go to see record companies and chat to the people there,” says Sensible. “And of course the first thing we’d do is head to the booze cabinet. Once we were left for about an hour in this bloke’s swanky office, because he’d said he had to go off to a meeting. By the time he got back, we’d demolished the place. Needless to say, we didn’t get signed.”Where Sensible and Scabies were always the outright maniacs of the band, Vanian, the Bela Lugosi of Hemel Hempstead, was more enigmatic. His image launched a million copyists: any singer who has ever worn black clothes and white face paint owes him a debt. He invented the goth image, without ever being a goth. Music fans might have a clear picture of him, but they perhaps have less of an idea of him, unlike Lydon and Joe Strummer, whose personalities were part of their image.“I don’t know if he knows himself,” Sensible says. “He would have made a very good actor.”“Dave’s the frontman, he’s been there the longest,” Scabies says. “If Dave doesn’t think something’s a good idea, there’s no point trying to do it.”“I was a reluctant frontman,” Vanian says. “Frontmen want to be the star of the show, but I didn’t even want to be in a band. I was chosen because of what I was before I was in a band. Brian had said to Rat, ‘Who’s that guy? He looks like a singer.’ I didn’t need an excuse to be like this; I would have been who I am, no matter what.”In the 2015 documentaryThe Damned: Don’t You Wish That We Were Dead, Vanian is a fleeting presence – in the background, and spoken about by the others, but never interviewed himself. That, he says, is because he saw the story the makers wanted, and didn’t want to be part of its telling. The story it ended up with was one of Vanian as at times both the Jagger and Richards of the band: he appeared to be the one keeping it running and very much the boss (at one point Sensible decides not to say something, for fear of upsetting Vanian), while also prone to following his own whims, down to not turning up to shows on occasion, leaving the others to carry on without him.“I’d love to do something with a proper film-maker – with actors – about the band’s inception,” Vanian says, reflecting on the film. “But I’m a private person – when the band started I thought about wearing a mask and being an unknown singer. But we got pictures taken too soon, and that was the end of that.”The Damned provided a chance for its members to live as the people they wanted to be, making the music they wanted to make. All three of them might wish they’d had the full backing of a major label but that would have brought pressures of its own, and their brief stint with MCA – the hits period – ended with them too exhausted to come up with new material. Doing it their way might have been chaotic, but it ensured they remained the Damned rather than another rock band reliving past glories.“We went on a musical adventure,” Sensible says. “For me, the purpose of punk was to be creative and do something for yourself. I was a toilet cleaner, then five minutes later I’m trashing a guitar on stage and girls find me attractive. So punk was my saviour.”We’re all knocking on. I don’t want to go out being miserable. I want to go out having a good time on a full bellyRat Scabies“There were no rules,” Scabies says. “It was a bunch of kids having a laugh. And a lot of our audience probably related to the fact that we were quite disjointed – all of the band came from kind of broken backgrounds in one way or another. I think a lot of dysfunctional youth related to the fact that we weren’t being packaged. We didn’t all wear the same clothes. We didn’t have a corporate logo or sign to a major.”In what might have been their dotage, the Damned are now bigger than ever. April brings that Wembley Arena gig; their recent albums have been the highest charting of their career. Things seem to be, for the first time ever, peachy.View image in fullscreenRat Scabies, Brian James, Dave Vanian and Captain Sensible c. 1978.Photograph: Chris Gabrin/Redferns“We’re all knocking on,” Scabies says. “I don’t want to go out being miserable. I want to go out having a good time on a full belly.”“We wouldn’t still be playing if we’d got stinking rich,” Sensible says. “I’m glad we did it this way because I bloody enjoy the shows and travel. None of us got lazy and lost our drive.”As long as he can still swoop across the stage like a vampire, and deliver those songs in that stern baritone, Vanian will continue, too. “You’ll know it’s time for me to quit when I start leaning on the mic to sing Sinatra songs, and reading letters from the fans.”Not Like Everybody Else is released 23 January on earMusic.

In the world of hip-hop, where even A-list stars such as Rocky’s friend and collaborator Tyler, the Creator are prone to releasing multiple albums a year, this is a lifetime. In the time since Rocky released his third album, 2018’s Testing, Kanye West has rebranded as a born-again Christian, swerved to the rightandreleased five albums. Rocky hasn’t been sitting around: he’s been a press mainstay, thanks to his relationship with pop superstar Rihanna, with whom he now has three children, and last year was acquitted of firing a gun at a former friend, dodging up to 24 years in prison. He has also found acclaim as an actor, starring opposite Rose Byrne in the lauded dark comedy If I Had Legs I’d Kick You and Denzel Washington in Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Don’t Be Dumb.Photograph: Publicity imageAside from a few one-off singles, such as the Tame Impala collaboration Sundress, Rocky has released music in fits and starts in recent years. (In terms of mainstream stars, perhaps only Rocky’s romantic partner outpaces him when it comes to leaving fans waiting: it has been a decade since Rihanna’s last record.) Testing yielded the Skepta-featuring hit Praise the Lord (Da Shine), but otherwise fell flat with mainstream audiences and critics alike, lacking the dynamism and potent charisma of his breakout albums. That album seemed to leave Rocky at a crossroads. Would it serve him best to continue exploring its slipshod experimentalism, or to make an attempt at retrenchment, and return to the more straightforward music that made him famous?Don’t Be Dumb, Rocky’s fourth album, attempts both options at the same time: Despite its hour-long runtime, it feels brash and fleet-footed, excising Testing’s ponderous avant garde samples and experiments with singing, and reigniting some of the fiery, shit-stirrer attitude that animated Rocky’s 2013 major-label debut, Long.Live.A$AP. But it’s hardly a slam-dunk. Some songs feel phoned-in lyrically, and others feel overstuffed with production elements; as is so often the case with years-in-the-making albums, an edit feels necessary. Even so, it’s coherent and plainlyfunto listen to: the guest list might feature everyone from Hans Zimmer to Tyler, the Creator to indie folk luminary Jessica Pratt, but Rocky is the star here, and he’s worth the price of admission.As ever, Rocky’s charisma knows no bounds. Stole Ya Flow is ostensibly a Drake diss track, but it succeeds because Rocky sounds like he’s having so much fun: “N***** gettin’ BBLs / Lucky we don’t body shame,” he raps, relishing in the line’s petty faux-altruism. (Drake has denied having some plastic surgery procedures.) On the warm, dazed Playa, Rocky sounds positively avuncular, rapping as if he’s giving advice to someone in love for the first time, though the advice is, admittedly, very specific and kind of callous: “No receipts, don’t text.” On Air Force (Black Demarco), he raps over the kind of harsh, glitchy beat that would feel at home on a Playboi Carti album, before a beat-switch into stoned psych-rock; it feels like a canny fourth-wall break, a sly taunt to anyone who trashed the indie-leaning Testing.A$AP Rocky: Helicopter – reviewThese sharper moments bump up against lyrics that can sometimes feel purely lazy: his observation on Helicopter that people would “do anything for a blue check” – as in, on X – is a potent reminder that Rocky is now a father of three. Later, on the Gorillaz collab Whiskey, he seemingly zones out into full-blown free association: “Tipsy, kiss me so wet, they make bridges / I don’t burn no bridges / Tryna hold it in, I don’t burn no friendships,” he mumbles, his lethargy so strong that it threatens to sink the whole record. These flabbier sections are, thankfully, outweighed by Don’t Be Dumb’s sprightlier moments: altogether, it’s Rocky’s strongest album since his debut, buoyed by a sense of playfulness he seemed to have lost for a second. Fans dumbfounded by Testing can breathe easy.Explore more on these topicsA$AP RockyRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

Homoerotic paean to Morrissey, anyone?Alexis PetridisThu 15 Jan 2026 19.01 ESTLast modified on Fri 16 Jan 2026 13.02 ESTShareThe arrival of Robbie Williams’s 13th album has been a complicated business. It was announced in May 2025 and was supposed to come out in October, when its title would have chimed with the 90s nostalgia sparked by theOasis reunion. Williams spent the summer engaging in promotion, unveiling fake Britpop-themed blue plaques around London and staging a press conference at the Groucho Club. There was alaunch gig at storied Camden venue Dingwalls, at which he performed not just his new album in full, but his 1997 solo debut Life Thru a Lens.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for BritpopIt was a bold choice, given that Life Thru a Lens initially threatened to derail his solo career: at the time, the now nakedly obvious supernova hitsAngelsandLet Me Entertain Youwere overlooked while people criticised Williams’s muddled attempts to fit in with, well, Britpop. On stage at Dingwalls, he made the surprise announcement that the album now wasn’t coming out until mid-February, admitting with winning candour that he didn’t want to compete with Taylor Swift’sThe Life of a Showgirl. Now it’s suddenly appeared, without explanation, two weeks into January: presumably because Williams will have fewer competitors in the albums chart this week, giving him a greater chance at breaking the record he currently jointly holds with the Beatles for the most UK No 1 albums ever.It is all a little strange, but then theBritpopalbum itself feels peculiar. Williams has trailed it as “the album I wanted to make when I left Take That” and a celebration of “a golden age for British music”. Yet you wonder why he would want to revisit the mid-90s, a time when he was lost, in the grip of addiction, subject to a lot of pretty unpleasant public mockery, completely unaware that he was about to become the biggest British artist of his era. You could suggest it’s an act of closure, but you might reasonably have thought Williams got closure when he released Angels: one of the most-played songs on UK radio over the next year; a song so ubiquitous that it “evicted Wonderwall from the national psyche”, as John Harris put it in his Britpop history The Last Party, its success suggestive of a distinct sea change in popular tastes away from the at least putatively alternative to the unashamedly mainstream. Certainly, there were substantially more takers for Williams’s subsequent solo work than for the artists the music press predicted would rule 1998: Symposium, Ultrasound, Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s old band theaudience, and the Warm Jets.Robbie Williams: Spies – videoSo what is going on here? Initially, you get the impression that Williams thinks he has unfinished business with the sound he initially pursued as a confused ex-boyband member, returning to it with the confidence of a man who has sold 75m records and can call upon Black Sabbath guitaristTony Iommifor openerRocket. It doesn’t always work – the ungainly glam of Cocky sounds like Oasis, but alas Oasis circa Heathen Chemistry rather than Definitely Maybe – but when it does, Britpop makes Williams’ plan seem a good idea. There’s no mistaking who influenced the vocal intonation of All My Life, with its vowels drawled into multiple syllables, or the wall of distorted guitars onSpies. Like Liam Gallagher’s 2019 solo tracks Once and One of Us, Spies casts a ruefully nostalgic eye over mid-90s hedonism: “We used to stay up all night, thinking we were all spies, praying that tomorrow won’t come.” But there’s a swagger and sparkle to the melodies that shift these songs past the realm of pastiche, and the results are hugely enjoyable.Do you remember the first time? Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go awayRead moreJust as you think you’ve got the general idea of the album, it unravels. There is Morrissey, a jokey, faintly homoerotic synth-pop paean to the former Smiths frontman co-authored by Gary Barlow, which, if nothing else, wins points for sheer improbability. There is It’s OK Until the Drugs Stop Working, a track that, melodically, at least, sounds remarkably like the British bubblegum pop that briefly flourished in the charts between the end of the 60s and the rise of glam: the province of White Plains, Christie and Butterscotch, not artists anyone writing an album review in 2026 might reasonably have expected to invoke. And there isHuman, a beautiful, lambent electronic ballad about AI, featuring Mexican pop duo Jesse & Joy (Williams is famously a very big deal in Mexico, where 2005’s Intensive Care remains the eighth biggest-selling album of all time) as well as Coldplay’s Chris Martin on guitar and keys. It might be the best song here, but what it has to do with the Britpop concept is anyone’s guess, lambent synth-pop songs about AI having been pretty thin on the ground in the mid-90s.Still, conceptually sound or not, Britpop is never less than engaging. The one thing it doesn’t have is a track that might conceivably have the same impact as Angels or Let Me Entertain You, which leaves it in an odd position. It may well be the albumRobbie Williamswanted to make when he left Take That. Equally, he must be incredibly glad that he didn’t.This week Alexis listened toDaphni – Talk to MeDan Snaith returns to his dancefloor-focused alias, effortlessly conjures up hypnotic, tripped-out 3am mood.

Tragic Magic, the pair’s first collaborative album, evidences this bond: born out of a short series of improv sessions in Paris, it’s a wonderfully immersive set of new age and ambient tracks, where Barwick’s airy, reverbed vocals and atmospheric synth washes interweave with, and accentuate, Lattimore’s twinkling harp.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Tragic MagicThe album sessions took place shortly after last year’s California wildfires, which the two musicians experienced as residents. Accordingly, tragedy and hope cut through the dreamlike haze of these unfurling compositions. With its delicate harp loop and hushed whispers, openerPerpetual Adorationis as sweet and dreamy as a lullaby, while the gorgeous, moving Haze With No Haze carries a quiet desperation in the brittle, staccato melodyand Barwick’s yearning high register. As always, her lyrics are indiscernible, words blurring into texture and shapeless whispers, but teem with feeling.Even at their most spartan, the songs feel more grand and cinematic than the pair’s respective solo work; Lattimore’s harp is given particular room to shine. Occasionally, the duo reach towards epic heights, as in their murky take on Rachel’s Song from Blade Runner, which rushes into an effervescent flurry in its final minute, or on Stardust, the album’s climax, where soaring synths and celestial harp flickers are bolstered by a drum kick five minutes in, the closest things get to pop sensibilities. But just then, they strip it all back for the fluttering, near-nine-minute closerMelted Moon– the emotion lingering where the fullness doesn’t. The effect is both intimate and expansive.Also out this monthAquáticos, the new collaborative album from Brazilian guitaristFabianodo Nascimentoand Los Angeles producerEddie Ruscha, is a lush, meditative listen (Music from Memory). Across these nine wandering tracks, the trickling percussion and spritely guitar plucks and strums are buoyed up by warm, bubbling synths, a combination that evokes slow summer days. Even the most stripped-back recordings inTashi Dorji’s discography are characterised by a quiet freneticism that comes from his improvisational approach. On his new album Low Clouds Hang, This Land Is on Fire (Drag City), however, the Bhutanese-American guitarist opts for something much calmer. These reverb-drenched recordings are spacious, soft and introspective – his attempt “to find the silence”. French composer and sound artistCharlène Dannancierpaints an eerie portrait of ambiguous relationship dynamics on her new album Baisée (Strange Therapy). Across 10 haunting tracks, each devoted to a different relationship stage or feeling, her breathy vocals fragments twist around dense, discordant electronics.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicExperimental album of the monthreviewsShareReuse this content"

So what does it mean, what is its significance for the Koreas, and why did BTS choose it?What is Arirang?Arirang is the title of the Korean peninsula’s most beloved folk song, an unofficial and sentimental national anthem that has resonated across generations. Its origins arebelieved to stretch backcenturies.There is no single agreed-upon definition for what Arirang specifically means. Some scholarssuggest“ari” derives from an old Korean word meaning “beautiful” or “aching”, paired with “rang” meaning “beloved”, though this remainscontested folk etymology. The imagery of crossing the Arirang ridge or mountain pass alludes to moving from despair to hope, or a journey from hardship towards something better.Thesong existsin more than 60 versions with more than 3,600 recorded lyrical variations, with the most famous version using the refrain “Arirang, arirang, arariyo”, where “arariyo” likely functions more as an emotional refrain than a literal word.The melody is simple and flexible, easy to learn and easy to adapt. Anyone can sing Arirang, and anyone can add verses to reflect their own experiences.Across generations, Koreans have poured their joys, sorrows, longings and resilience into its lines. Arirang has been sung in rice paddies and at protests, at family gatherings and national ceremonies.Why does Arirang matter to Koreans?Arirang became a symbol of resistance during Japan’s colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945, particularly after the1926 silent filmof the same name. The film told the story of a Korean man driven mad after being tortured by Japanese authorities. When its theme song played, audiencesreportedly wept. The colonial government laterbanned the song.Yet Arirang’s significance extends far beyond resistance or politics. It’s one of the few cultural elements that has historically transcended the division of the Korean peninsula, even as political relations have deteriorated.BothNorthandSouthKorea have registered it with Unesco as intangible cultural heritage. When athletes from the two Koreas marched together at the2000 Sydney Olympicsand2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, Arirang played instead of either national anthem.The song has become a kind of cultural ambassador for Korea, and what it means to be Korean.Why is this significant for BTS?At a time when many mainstream K-pop groups adopt international images and aesthetics to appeal to global audiences, BTS’s choice to name their new album Arirang is already signalling a clear affirmation of their identity.The group has consistently embraced their Korean roots, from incorporating traditional attire known ashanbok in music videosand addressing Korean social issues in lyrics to previously performing anArirang medleyon stage.By choosing this title, BTS frames its comeback not as reinvention but as return. Their label, BigHit Music,saysthe album captures “the longing and deep love” at the heart of BTS’s story, with Arirang serving as a symbolic expression of those emotions.For millions of fans worldwide encountering or rediscovering the charm of Arirang through BTS, the album is set to offer an entry point into the cultural foundation that has shaped the world’s biggest pop group.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaBTSK-popPop and rockNorth KoreaexplainersShareReuse this content"

On their 13th LP, Williamson again convinces in the role of a potty-mouthed bystander, baffled and infuriated by what goes on around him, whetherempty lives in the digital age(“Weights and wanking / Hard bodies and phone lights / That’s all we got”), Trump’s US (“Maga’s off their tits”) or minor daily irritants: “Lazy dog walkers on short walks, mate, wanker!”View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Demise Of Planet XHowever, developments here should gently broaden their appeal. Williamson displays a welcome new vulnerability on the harrowing Gina Was, about a childhood incident. Meanwhile, Fearn is subtly developing his production, venturing beyond electro-punk to use classical strings on Double Diamond and a broader range of collaborators. The combination of Willliamson, Game of Thrones actor Gwendoline Christie’s furious rap and Big Special’s David Bowie-ish crooning onThe Good Lifemakes for one of the most hauntingly catchy things they’ve done.And on the album’s unexpectedly charming highlight,No Touch, Williamson and formerLife Without Buildingssinger Sue Tompkins sound like a comically bickering soap opera couple as she amusingly teases out the human being behind Williamson’s grumpy facade. “You’re not miserable, you’re nice,” she tells him, as he protests – unconvincingly – “I’m not”.Explore more on these topicsSleaford ModsPop and rockIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

The last time this Cinderella of the brass section had a major moment in the spotlight was in 2022, when theProms hosted their first solo trombonistin almost 20 years. Before that, you have to go back to 2008 for headlines – when a dazzling 12-year-old broke records asthe youngest ever winner of BBC Young Musician. The trombone player in each case? Peter Moore.Now with a decade-long stint at the London Symphony Orchestra under his belt, Belfast-born Moore is one of the great champions of his instrument, whose growing concerto repertoire has a lot to do with his persuasive advocacy. He had an intriguing platform inDai Fujikura’s Vast Ocean II (2023) – a reworking of the composer’s 2005 trombone concerto, given its UK premiere here by Kazuki Yamada and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.Stanisław Lem’s sci-fi novel Solarisprovides the starting point: Fujikura’s orchestra the teeming, sentient, otherworldly ocean, the trombone a human adventurer. “He’s George Clooney,” Fujikura joked of Moore in the pre-concert talk. The musical effect, though, is less Hollywood and more Tarkovsky – a pointillist canvas of glinting sounds and textures that only rarely coalesce into anything conventionally developmental, preferring to circle and echo, dissolve and re-form. Moore made his instrument sing, finding shifting colours in the score’s insistent, repeated notes, coaxing slides into vocal sighs and howls while Yamada conjured a rich, elusive backdrop. Does it all add up to more than a sequence of gorgeous sonic episodes? I’m not sure. But Fujikura is, after all, the master of the musical unanswered question.We swapped other worlds for more familiar territory after the interval, and the earthly – and earthy – landscapes of Mahler’s Symphony No 1. It’s a work that suits Yamada’s heart-on-sleeve, instinctive musicianship, a symphony painted in the broadest of strokes. The second movement’s lilting peasant-Ländler swayed with more than a whiff of schnapps in the deliciously woozy string portamenti, the finale whipped up thunderclaps of timpani before a blinding climax, brass on their feet, instruments triumphantly raised. Only in the third movement, with its sinister minor-key version of Frère Jacques – bells chiming not for matins but a funeral – did we miss something. There were grotesques here, hints of sleazy horror in the klezmer-esque theme, but not the bleak nullity that is the necessary counterweight to all the symphony’s overflowing life and optimism.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicCity of Birmingham Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Piotr Anderszewski sees in it a testament of sorts, but one that keeps as many secrets as it reveals. By selecting a dozen of these intimate miniatures to make up an absorbing 48-minute programme, the Polish pianist opens a markedly individual window on to the composer’s solitary artistic maturity.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Brahms: Late Piano Works.Photograph: Warner ClassicsHe opens with the aching B-minor Intermezzo from the Op 119 set, the tempo measured and laden with melancholy reflection. Phrasing is fluid across concentrated interpretations that exhibit a distinctive emotional core. The moderate pace continues throughout, with Anderszewski preferring to avoid leavening the mood merely for the sake of contrast. The cumulative effect is one of penetrating regret.The Op 118 set features a heart-rending account of the tender A-major Intermezzo, the steady pace ramping up its sense of loss. The shadow of death hangs over the Op 116 A-minor Intermezzo, its pent-up grief unleashed in the subsequent G-minor Capriccio. Bringing the recital to a close is the tragic Op 118, No 6, a reading shrouded in otherworldly sorrow.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”Foddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors:I spent a weeklast year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.Baby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! Andyouwill suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He wouldnevergo outside for a hike.”View image in fullscreenPre-hike Nate in his onesie in his parents’ basement: unprepared and out of shape.Photograph: Devolver DigitalNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.Talking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.Like (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Baby Steps developers Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzillo, and Bennett Foddy.Photograph: Boch/Cuzillo/FoddyFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”Another of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.As they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker ofDespelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.View image in fullscreenNate and Mike, mid mountain climb.Photograph: Devolver DigitalBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”There is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding theplayerwould be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s somethingheloves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”The inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”That is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way youareNate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.Baby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.After Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Funby Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

Abbie Vandivere, a paintings conservator at the museum, says: “[The bull’s] balls were bigger and lower, his whole back end was shifted – but, indeed, the balls are the biggest change.”More details here.What we learnedIan McKellen will lip-sync to previously unheard audio tapes of LS LowryPerformance artist Tehching Hsieh lived in a cage, jumped from a window and spent a year tied to a friendDavid Bowie visited a psychiatric clinic in 1994 to spend time with outsider artistsJoseph Beuys’ bathtub contains all the horrors of modern historyPiet Mondrian may owe his success to a cross-dressing lesbian artist who lived in a Cornish coveAbstract painter Sean Scully uses loss, breakdown and schooling by ‘scary nuns’ to fuel his artTrump has put museums and galleries in jeopardy across the StatesMartin Roemers’ remarkable photo series Homo Mobilis tells us what a person’s vehicle says about themMasterpiece of the weekSaint Cecilia by Pietro da CortonaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesWomen often take centre stage in the religious art of the baroque – the emotive, sometimes lurid, often spectacular style that emerged in early 17th-century Italy to serve a renewed Catholic church in its battle for hearts and souls. This paved the way for a female visionary, Artemisia Gentileschi, to depict women as heroes and avengers: but as this work by one of her male contemporaries in early 1600s Rome reveals, that focus on the female was not unique to her. Perhaps it was a way for the church to involve and control women, for Cortona portrays Saint Cecilia as a bland-faced icon of chastity: the story of this early Christian figure had it that she refused to let her husband touch her. She also stands by a pipe organ, for Cecilia became patron saint of music in the middle ages. Harmonious and virtuous, Cortona’s Cecilia urges women to emulate her, and do as they are told by the church.National GallerySign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get in TouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In that same spirit, our cocktail list nods to the classics, but also features all sorts of Chinese and Asian ingredients and spices.Serves1For the pandan gin10g piece fresh pandan leaf, green part only175ml rice ginFor the drink25ml pandan-infused rice gin(see above and method)15ml white vermouth15ml green chartreuseRoughly chop the pandan leaf, put it in a blender with the gin and blitz.

There’s not too much going on: just a good, buttery crumb, melt-in-the-mouth texture and chocolate-dipped ends, which are a must. While they’re pretty straightforward to make, issues often arise when it’s time to pipe the dough, and it can be tricky to strike a balance between a consistency that has enough butter but still holds its shape once baked. I find that the addition of a little milk helps make it more pipeable, as does using a large, open-star nozzle to avoid cramped hands and burst piping bags.Viennese fingersPrep5 minChill15 minCook40 minMakes10130g very softsalted butter50g icing sugar½ tsp vanilla extract170g plain flour2 tsp custard powder1 tsp milk70g milk chocolateHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Put the soft butter, icing sugar and vanilla in a bowl and beat with an electric whisk for three to four minutes, until very pale and creamy.Add the flour and custard powder, then mix to make a smooth dough. Mix in the milk, then spoon the dough into a piping bag fitted with a large open-star nozzle (I use Wilton 8B).Pipe 10 finger-shaped biscuits on to the lined tray, then chill for 15 minutes. Take out of the fridge, then bake for 18-22 minutes, until the biscuits are lightly browned. Leave them to cool completely on the tray.Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in short bursts in a microwave or heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water. Dip each end of the biscuits into the chocolate, then place on a rack to firm up before serving.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBiscuitsChocolateBakingSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"
