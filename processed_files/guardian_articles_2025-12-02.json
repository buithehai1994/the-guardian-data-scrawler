Oh, wait – everyone already isJonathan LiewContrast the furious reaction to Rachel Reeves’s ‘mansion tax’ to the response offered to those living with real housing injustice: indifferenceTue 2 Dec 2025 12.37 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 13.09 ESTShareThe new “mansion tax”announced by Rachel Reevesin last week’s budget is estimated to affect around 165,000 property owners, and on current trends the British media is forecast to have interviewed every single one of them by the end of the year. How else to explain the chorus of squealswe’ve been exposed tofrom the impoverished victims of Esher and Pimlico, whose only crime was to own a house worth over £2m in an era of egregious wealth inequality?We hear, for example, from Philippa in Kensington, whotells the Telegraphthat the new council tax surcharge on her two small mews houses will “wipe me out”. Wehear from Paul, who owns a £2.5m house in Cobham, who tells the same newspaper that the move has wreaked havoc with his retirement plans. Wehear in the Timesfrom a property investor called Mark in Wimbledon, whose £9.5m house has been on the market for over a year, and gripes that he has had “almost no viewings in the last five or six months”. The Sun, for its part, evokes the spectre of “grannies being forced to sell up”, and condemns the levy as “a back-door way to seize chunks of family homes when hard-working Brits pass away”.Perhaps in a country ever more dramatically stratified by wealth, nobody ever truly believes themselves to be rich. On Nicky Campbell’s BBCRadio 5 Live show last week, we heard from eight separate people who thought the tax was a bad idea until, almost half an hour into the show, Campbell finally read out a text from someone who liked it. By which time we had already been treated to a long and lavish diatribe from Kirstie Allsopp, self-appointed champion of the Great British mansion owner, distraught at the impact of the tax on our ailing luxury homes industry.Radical Reeves? The chancellor’s mansion tax is a small but brave step forward | Phillip InmanRead moreFor Allsopp, expensive houses are what make this country great. “People who live in £2m houses aremaintainingthem,” she said, sidestepping the question of what she thinks the rest of us are doing. “They are improving the gardens … Part of what attracts tourists to this country … is the look of our streets. I live in Notting Hill and you should see the number of tourists walking around taking selfies.”Quite apart from the unforeseen impacts on the selfie-taking economy of Notting Hill, there is a sly subtext at work here. That those who own big houses are, in fact, the true heroes of the economy: more assiduous, more valuable, perhaps even more noble. And perhaps it is no coincidence that as well as being significantly more affluent, these people also trend older, and congregate overwhelmingly in London and the south-east. The former chancellor Philip Hammond has described the tax as “a very clear transfer of spending power from the south to the north”, to which the only legitimate response is: don’t threaten us with a good time.But, of course, this is more than simply a small group of concerned citizens pushing their interests. Attention, column inches, the cogs of public discourse and the ear of policymakers: none of this is an infinite resource. Whoever gets it denies it to someone else. And 200 miles from Kensington, a group of homeowners in much more modest houses are discovering this the hard way.Since the start of the summer, the residents of the Henford estate in Tyldesley, Wigan have been watching in horror as the developer PLP beganconstruction of four logistics warehousesjust metres from their homes and gardens. When complete, the structures will stand 18 metres high: blocking out light and overlooking a nearby primary school.Cracks have reportedlybegun appearing in nearby houses andgardens have begun to flood. In the meantime, residents have been forced to endure the roar of around 250 lorries working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.But beyond a few local journalists, there has been no media stampede to Tyldesley. No bombardment of the airwaves, no blue-chip property experts being quoted on how the slump in local property prices might affect the wider economy. PLPhas reportedly refused to answerseveral key questions put to them by local reporters. For its part, Wigan council insists there have been no breaches of planning controls, and have rejectedan application for a temporary pauseon the basis that it might expose the council to legal action. And so despitea 10,000-signature petitionand the tireless work ofa local action committee, the residents of the Henford estate have very few levers left to pull. Perhaps they should have taken better care of their gardens.All across the country, families are living in substandard housing, half-built housing, overpriced housing, housing under threat. Students in York have seen their rentsnearly double in six years. New homeowners in Darlingtonare living on unfinished estatesafter a developerstopped work, citing“unforeseen technical challenges and ecological requirements”. Elderly residents in Southend are protestingabout the neglect of their sheltered housing block, claiming at leasteight lift breakdowns in a year. Imagine if just a fraction of the spume and righteous fury over the new surcharge could be redirected to those who really need it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He drives a horse and cart through a piece of Dominic Grieve sophistry, and tries his best to skewer the institution based around a jewelled velvet hatJack SealeTue 2 Dec 2025 17.00 ESTShareSettling down in front of David Dimbleby’s new three-parter, and looking at that confrontational title, you wonder why the question it asks is not debated more often. Dimbleby himself has trailed the series by worrying aloud that during his stint as a BBC staffer he was part of an organisation that didn’t challenge the monarchy robustly enough. But retirement means the shackles he wore when he was the corporation’s top politics presenter have been loosened.The opening episode cleaves closest to the titular question – parts two and three are more like “Is theMonarchya Giant Ponzi Scheme?” and “Are the Monarchy Personally Repellent?”, respectively – with its theme of how much power the monarchy has and how it wields it.Much of the hour is spent trying to ascertain whether King Charles influences government policy by advocating for his own beliefs. He certainly has politicians’ ear: the prime minister takes a weekly trip to Buckingham Palace for an in-person chat, while nobody interviewed here denies that letters from the king – he is a notoriously prolific epistolarian – are routinely placed at the top of the relevant minister’s pile.David Cameron says he appreciated going to see Queen Elizabeth every week when he was PM, it being a chance to clarify his thoughts by rehearsing them in front of a well-briefed listener who could be relied on not to blab to the media. It was therapeutic. But is the monarch’s access to top politicians democratic?Here is where the inherent absurdity of a monarchy taints any serious analysis of it. Dimbleby presses the point with several interviewees: why should the king’s opinions hold sway, when nobody voted for him? But this is an institution that celebrates the installation of a new boss by re-running an ancient ceremony where they wear a jewelled velvet hat. Nobody is pretending it makes sense. Pinning down its internal inconsistencies can feel like chasing round in a tight circle.It is, however, entertaining, particularly in the hands of this newly combative Dimbleby. He ably drives a cart and horses through a plain silly piece of sophistry from Dominic Grieve, who during his time as attorney general refused a freedom of information request from the Guardian to publish Charles’s letters. Charles is entitled to advocate for certain positions, argues Grieve, and his letters inevitably reveal his personal views, but if you want to have the benefit of his experience being fed into government, it has to be done in confidence, because of his need to maintain public neutrality. When Dimbleby points out that this is pure hypocrisy – Charles has the right not to be neutral, but also has the right to maintain the appearance of neutrality? – a floundering Grieve weakly denies it.Dimbleby establishes that Charles has for a long time attempted to change policy: when Grieve and his government lost their 10-year court battle to keep the letters secret, the contents revealed lobbying on matters from beef farming to unreliable army helicopters. The amount of influence Charles has cannot be zero. But whether significant policy changes are often made upon receipt of the crested notepaper seems unlikely.Evidence of the limits on royal power accumulates further when Dimbleby tackles the2019 prorogation of parliament. He observes that this invoked the one important power the monarch is meant to have: to stop a leader acting unconstitutionally. But every contributor agrees that in reality, the queen couldn’t prevent Boris Johnson from shutting the house down when he insisted on doing so. Jeremy Corbyn points out that the resistance to Johnson’s plans could have been characterised as being driven by opposition MPs; the queen would have been siding with Labour over the Conservatives, which wouldn’t do.The third leg of the investigation concerns “soft power”, ie the work a head of state can do to affect how the UK is seen abroad. Dimbleby chooses Queen Elizabeth’s visits to Ireland, making gestures such as speaking in Irish and shaking hands with Martin McGuinness, as examples of royal duties helping to achieve results that politicians could not. But he also observes that the monarch is again doing what elected leaders tell them: from Harold Wilson obliging the queen to receive a state visit from the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1978 when a trade deal was on the table, to Keir Starmer presenting Donald Trump with an invitation to the palace this year, the monarch is a tool of government.It’s a pretty faint damnation so far, but Dimbleby is sliding his knife in slowly. An essentially powerless monarchy is not much better than one that undemocratically brandishes too much power. Next week we’ll learn just how staggeringly expensive the indulgence is for us, and for what? As demonstrated here: not much.What’s the Monarchy For? aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid DimblebyMonarchyKing Charles IIIQueen Elizabeth IIreviewsShareReuse this content"

Queen of tablescaping Laura Jackson’s advice? Forget the stiff old rules and have fun with itJess Cartner-MorleyTue 2 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 13.31 ESTShareAfeast is not just about food. Just to sit at a table surrounded by the faces of your people: nothing beats it. A feast is about togetherness, whether there are two people at the table, or 16. The primal joy of good food taps into something even more fundamental than hunger; if food is a love language, a feast is a big hug.Is it sacrilege to say that being a host matters more than being a cook? Not to disparage the skill of the chef. Quite the opposite, it takes skill to make really good gravy, concentration to remember to take the cake out of the oven before it burns, and years of experience to time a roast to come together at the right moment. It takes no skill to fold a napkin and light a candle, yet with a beautifully laid and bounteously laden table, the night feels special before dinner is served, which takes the pressure off.Forget about matching dinner services and solemn soldiers of cutlery; this is not about whether you inherited a soup tureen or which way the blade of a knife should point. The old-fashioned rules of laying the table have made way for the modern art of tablescaping, where mixing trumps matching, and the point is to make sure everyone is having fun, not to catch anyone out for not knowing which is their side plate. Hurrah for that. Snobbery always was terrible taste.View image in fullscreenCheckerboard cheese and blackberries.Photograph: Sam Nicklin/The Guardian“I’m not too particular about which cutlery goes where,” says Laura Jackson. “I think it’s nicer when the table feels relaxed rather than overly formal or fussy. I always include a glass for water and another for wine or a cocktail, and that’s really all you need. It should feel inviting, not intimidating. The secret is to approach it playfully rather than treating it as a task that has to be done a certain way.”Jackson is a broadcaster, writer (of the cult lifestyle newsletter the Margarita Chronicles) and co-founder of homeware brand Glassette. If the rise of tablescaping as a hobby for the coolest millennial mums at the school gate has so far passed you by, it is perfectly possible that you have never heard of her, but if you are one of the Instagram-literate generation she is basically your Princess of Wales. Curating your lifestyle has become more than a hobby: it is culture, and Jackson is one of its headline acts.View image in fullscreenLaura Jackson says tablescaping should be approached playfully rather than as a task.Photograph: Jermaine Binns/The GuardianI once read that the mark of a good restaurant is that you leave feeling closer to the people you ate with, and the same goes for home feasts. The best bring you together, which is why they feel extra important around the holiday season. And it starts with making everyone feel that you are delighted to have them, because then they can relax.This is not about putting on a grand show, like Buckingham Palace preparing for a visit. Exhausting yourself doing what I recently heard described as the “no signs of life clean” – surfaces scrubbed clean of every fingerprint, hallway clutter banished behind closed doors – is counterproductive. You will be frazzled, vaguely resentful, and your guests will pick up on your vibe. Similarly, staying up till the early hours with a glue gun trying to build aChristmastree-shaped centrepiece out of lychees because it looked great on Pinterest is a bad idea. ChillDon’t be too precious. Remember that by the end of the meal, your ribbon napkin ties will be on the floor or in someone’s ponytail, and that’s a good thing. Aim to put a smile on your guest’s faces when they walk in, not to stun them into submission.“Thoughtful, warm and homely” was the mood that Jackson and her team wanted for their tables here. “For me, a warm and cosy atmosphere is the ultimate goal in winter,” says Jackson. “I’m someone who has a hot-water bottle glued to me pretty much all of winter, so naturally I want the space to feel comforting and inviting. I’ll dim the lights, light plenty of candles, and use lots of soft textures for tablecloths or napkins.”A well-dressed table has the power to make time slow down. When you take a place that has been arranged with a touch of ceremony, and spread a napkin on your lap, you put yourself in a very different place psychologically than when you are perched on a stool in Pret munching a baguette against the clock. This is why if any table calls for an elaborate setting, it is your Christmas feast – whether that is happening on 25 December, the night before, or whatever date makes sense for your work schedule or extended family obligations. Christmas dinner can not, and should not, be rushed. You want time for second helpings, for the pop of more bottles, for the candles to burn down.View image in fullscreenKeep the decorations low so that diners can see each other. Tablescaping: Laura Jackson. Styling: Lily Gisborne and Jess JonesPhotograph: Sam Nicklin/The GuardianTablescaping is a silly word, and I mean that as a compliment. Laying the table was once a chore your mum made you do; tablescaping is about fun. At fashion events I’ve been to recently, I’ve seen a vogue for tables that look positively surreal: candelabras with a peeled boiled egg on each stem, instead of a candle. Once my name was carved into a baked potato, instead of a placecard. I’m not suggesting adding “carve a chess set out of butter” to your already groaning to-do list (although, not gonna lie, it looked epic), but if you have any small little helpers to hand, you could put them to work pressing softened butter into silicone biscuit molds to chill for a few hours, so that everyone has a butter star or angel on their side plate. Delicious.But the joy of Christmas is that you don’t need to spend hours curating a moodboard (unless you fancy it), because you have memorised it already. The visual language of Christmas is imprinted into all of us along with the words to Away in a Manger. Our Christmas table here has pops of Santa red – the taper candles and water glasses, the crimson calla lilies and decorative piles of crunchy radishes. It is fun to lean into a traditional aesthetic, because everyone loves Christmas; tartan and holly, crackers and baubles bring the generations together. Still, you don’t want your table to look like a regional department store window display, so by adding some unexpected elements – aubergines peeled into stripes, in place of candy canes – you make the atmosphere personal.View image in fullscreenA Christmas table with tree from Green Elf Trees. Stylists: Lily Gisborne and Jess Jones.Photograph: Sam Nicklin/The GuardianFamily silver is not required: stash scraps of ribbon from packaging to tie into bows as impromptu napkin rings, or fold napkins into shapes. Again, dexterous small hands are useful here: TikTok has an endless stream of how-to videos, and last year I successfully delegated the Christmas tree-shaped napkin folds to my niece. A vegetable peeler is all you need to carve spiral strips from oranges and lemons to pile on to the table, which looks pretty and smells divine (and you can still use the fruit the next day).Flowers are limited and expensive at this time of year, so nab some sprigs of foliage or silvery twigs from the garden or a hedgerow – they last longer, and are sturdy enough to hold a few small decorations borrowed from the tree, which will sparkle under candlelight. A tablecloth is an instant mood-changer; like theatre curtains, it brings a swoosh of instant drama. Most of us don’t use them often, which is precisely why they are fun to bring out on a big occasion – and it will come into its own for unifying a big table you’ve fashioned by wedging one from the garden against the kitchen one in order to cram everyone in.A festive table looks glorious when your guests walk into the room, but what matters most is how it looks while they are sitting at it. “Keep the decorations low, so that they don’t block anyone’s view across the table,” says Jackson. Tall, slim candles add glam without getting in the way, and are safer than low-level tea lights, especially if there are children at the table and/or wine being consumed. If you drink a nice champagne or wine at a celebration, keep the bottle – it will make a tall candlestick, keeping flames safely aloft, and bring back good memories. But if you are nervous of flames, small rechargeable table lights – widely available on the high street now for about £30 – bring instant posh-restaurant vibes, and are endlessly useful at this time of year. Later, you can move them to the coffee table to illuminate a jigsaw without having to have the big light on, or as a makeshift bedside lamp for a guest who sleeps on the sofa.Squeezing in extra people cheek by jowl? No problem. In fact, it’s better: chairs set wide apart feels a bit like a board meeting, and seating people close together makes the atmosphere more sociable, says Jackson. Place settings are useful if space is tight, making everyone feel welcome at a squished table. Jackson likes to place a napkin on the plate, draping it slightly over the edge of the table, and a bunch of red grapes, split into individual sprigs, to top each one adds a cute touch of bacchanalia.Dressing a table is much like creating an outfit. Pick a colour scheme, add some textures – and, as Coco Chanel famously advised, the final chic touch is to take one accessory away so that it’s not too much. Do this in the centre of the table, to leave space so that dishes can be passed around for people to help themselves. (If you’ve got some spare tiles left over from a DIY project, these make great ad-hoc hotplates.) You are a host, not a waiter: let people serve themselves. Oh, and don’t create too much work for yourself: a simple colour scheme (Coco would have approved) means you can shove the linens all together in one hot wash to lift the wine and butter out overnight. Life is too short for multiple napkin laundry batches, my friends.Your table should be part of the fun, not a job that gets in the way of it. “How much time does it take? Exactly as long as you want to give it,” says Jackson. “It doesn’t have to be a big production. Some of my favourite tables have come together in 10 minutes. It’s not about perfection.” When the turkey is a carcass and the wax is in clumps on the table, what lingers are the stories, the memories, the feeling of being part of something together. That’s the real feast. The rest is just gravy.Explore more on these topicsChristmasWinter food 2025Christmas food and drinkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he said it anywayJohn CraceInvestment was not enough to save the courts, said the justice secretary. At least, not the amounts he was prepared to put inTue 2 Dec 2025 12.09 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 16.11 ESTShareSpare a thought forDavid Lammy. Not so long ago he was foreign secretary. His dream job. Turning left on boarding planes to go to meet his counterparts around the world. An important player in global geopolitics. Then he found himself out on his ear. Replaced by Yvette Cooper, who had been booted out of the Home Office for being perceived to be soft on asylum seekers.But at least Yvette got to fail upwards. Lammy just found himself downgraded to justice secretary. A department that has been unloved, downgraded and underfunded for years. Worse still, David now finds himself being forced to advocate policies the old David Lammy never once dreamed of himself making. Even as foreign secretary he would have been shaking his head in disapproval. Yet needs must.Still, one man’s pain was another woman’s gain. For Rachel Reeves there was the relief that the dial had finally shifted on the budget. The worst of the storm had passed, most of the rightwing papers had dialled down their interest and only Kemi Badenoch and Mel Stride were still to be found howling to each other in a cupboard at some imagined wrongdoing.So it was that at lunchtime on Tuesday, Lammy appeared in the Commons to make a statementon curtailing the right to trial by jury. This was once-in-a-generation reform, he said. The justice system was falling to pieces. The court backlog was now running at 78,000 and would soon reach 100,000. Defendants were pleading not guilty to buy some time in the hope that victims and courts would lose patience and drop their cases.Now you might have thought that the sensible answer was to fund the system properly. To make sure there were more sitting days. To fix the heating and air-conditioning units. To build new courts and prison stock. To train more barristers and judges, and increase legal aid funding. But that would require a level of time and investment no one is prepared to make. People like to moan about the justice system but no one wants to pay for it. So it falls apart. And instead we get sticking plaster solutions that even the government doesn’t believe will really make a difference.Investment was not enough, said Lammy. At least, not the amounts he was prepared to put in. So there would now be judge-only trials for either-way cases with a sentence of three years. This would be a good thing, he insisted. A balance in favour of the victims. It was one of the founding principles of Magna Carta. More important than the right to trial by jury was the article stating that justice delayed is justice denied. It had just taken successive governments 800 years to properly implement it. This is what the barons had wanted all along at Runnymede.In any case, when you came to think about it, a judge-only trial was in many ways fairer than trial by 12 men and women. Because at least when judges deliver their verdict they have to give their reasoning. A jury just came back with a guilty verdict. No explanation. So they could just have all had it in for the defendant. Taken exception to the way he looked. We were entering a new era of transparency.The same with the decision to increase cases that magistrates could judge to ones with a sentence of 18 months. Let’s face it. Magistrates lived in the community and were part of the community. Much like jurors. Judges lived on their own private islands. So actually being tried by a magistrate was exactly the same as being tried by a jury. I’m not sure Lammy was entirely persuaded of this argument that had been prepared for him, but he said it nonetheless.Lammy ended by pointing out this was no big deal, as 90% of cases were already tried by magistrates and only 3% went to jury trial. So you rather wondered why he was going to so much trouble to do something that wouldn’t make much difference. But David was nothing if not hopeful. There would be more people banged up, he declared. At least there would be if the prisons weren’t already full and there was somewhere to put them. Maybe accidentally releasing a further 12 prisoners was a cunning plan all along. Who knows? All the escapers could form their own roving jury.In reply, the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, was condescension personified. Speaking … extra … slowly … to … sound … clever. He seems to think everything is an audition for a TV gameshow, “So You Think You Want To Be Tory Leader”. He is ever optimistic that Kemi might implode.Honest Bob has had it in for judges ever since the Daily Mail told him they were the “enemies of the people”. But his newfound enthusiasm for the rights of defendants to a trial by jury is an unexpected development. Not so long ago he seemed to be all for summary justice for most offenders. Especially asylum seekers. Do what you like with them. Just as long as they don’t take up any of our time and money. But now he was coming over as a latter-day Rumpole of the Bailey. The quality of mercy is not strained. He sounded fake. A man in search of a soundbite rather than solutions.Not even his own backbenchers take him seriously. Jeremy Wright ignored him and commended Lammy for at least trying to come up with a solution to the court backlog. Just not the right one. Would it not be better if the jury reform was made temporary? To be reinstated once the system was functioning again?Lammy didn’t realise he was being offered a life belt. Something that might appease MPs who were queasy about a permanent change. Even if the system was hardwired never to work properly. Instead he mumbled something about “jury trials being a peculiar way to run a public service”. What? Sometimes he is his own worst enemy.MPs on his own side of the chamber were less than impressed. Diane Abbott observed that judge-only trials would result in a greater number of miscarriages of justice. Many judges came from the same class and had the same unconscious biases. And it was defendants like her and the justice secretary who would be the victims.Richard Burgon wondered what would happen if Reform – “Putin’s Pals” – were in power and started appointing their own judges. Unlikely, said Lammy. Yes. But the Lammy of just a few months ago would have been one of the most vocal in saying that cutting jury trials was the hallmark of an authoritarian regime.Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyThe politics sketchUK criminal justicecommentShareReuse this content"

She talks about fleeing persecution in Nigeria – and what she learned from French new waveCath ClarkeTue 2 Dec 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 17.39 ESTShareJoy Gharoro-Akpojotor had a little wobble when she stepped on to the stage after the screening of her debut feature, Dreamers, at the London film festival. The Nigerian-British director’s film is a love story set in an immigration detention centre. It had already premiered in Berlin earlier this year. But showing her semi-autobiographical film to a home crowd in London felt exposing. “I suddenly had this feeling: Oh my God, everyone can see me. Everyone knows everything about me.” She laughs.Gharoro-Akpojotor has built a reputation as a rising star producer. Her company Joi Productions makes films telling black, female and gay stories. (“All of the above, sometimes individually.”) Her credits include Rapman’sBlue Storyand Aml Ameen’s romcomBoxing Day, and she is currently working on Ashley Walters’ directing debutAnimol.I sound like a bumper stickerWe’re speaking by video call at the end of a long day’s work. Behind her on a shelf cardboard boxes have the titles of film projects neatly labelled with a Sharpie. Within five minutes you can see why directors pick Gharoro-Akpojotor to produce their films. She takes her work very seriously, but has a good laugh at herself – and is in possession of such an air of calm, not even the apocalypse would faze her.View image in fullscreen‘My immigration lawyer said it was 50/50’ … Joy Gharoro-Akpojotor.Photograph: Shane Anthony Sinclair/Getty Images for BFIDreamers is inspired by her own experience seeking asylum in the UK aged 25. It tells the story of Isio (Ronkę Adékoluęjo), a Nigerian woman being held at a removal centre while the Home Office decides whether or not it believes that she is who she says she is – a lesbian whose life would be in danger if she were sent back to Nigeria.“I always say it’s loosely based on my life,” Gharoro-Akpojotor says. She herself did not experience the trauma that is her character’s painful backstory. Nor was she detained while her asylum application was processed, though it was a close shave. “My immigration lawyer said it was 50/50.” The night before her own appointment, Gharoro-Akpojotor had a leaving party with friends. “Because we weren’t sure I was going to come back. The next morning I got on the bus at 6am to Croydon.” After giving her fingerprints she was allowed to leave.But some of the scenes in the film in which Isio is being interviewed by a Home Office caseworker are practically verbatim, Gharoro-Akpojotor says. Before her own interview, her legal aid lawyer advised her to take along a copy of her written statement. “She told me that the Home Office hates to read. They won’t have read it.”Her lawyer wasn’t wrong. “When I got there, the caseworker hadn’t read it. He knew nothing about where I’m from. He knew nothing about my case. He hadn’t read anything I sent him. Yet 202 questions later he would be making the decision about whether I get to stay or not.”The interview included some remarkably uninformed questions. “My caseworker asked me, ‘Is there a Brighton in Nigeria?’”Was he was asking if Nigeria has a gay-friendly city in which she could live? “Yes! He then asked, ‘OK, if your family are in the south and they know you’re gay, why can’t you go up north?’” Gharoro-Akpojotor explained to him that in many northern states of Nigeria, Sharia law criminalises same-sex activities. The maximum penalty is death.Next came a grilling about her sexuality. “He said to me, ‘Tell me the name of a gay bar in London … What have you done sexually with a woman? … What have you done sexually with a man?’” Then at the end of the interview, “‘How do I know you’re not straight?’”Gharoro-Akpojotor counts herself as one of the lucky ones. She had been warned a decision about her asylum claim could take years. But five days later a letter landed on the door mat; her application had been approved. She has a hunch that her bonding with the caseworker over Dagenham had something to do with it. She had been working in a bookmaker’s in Dagenham, and it turned out the caseworker was from there. “We spent a lot of time talking about Dagenham. I think that was a privilege for me because we could find that rapport. But a lot of people don’t have that.”View image in fullscreen‘I just wanted to see myself on screen’ … Gharoro-Akpojotor on the set of Dreamers.Photograph: Rob Baker Ashton / Copyright Dreamers Film Ltd 2024In Dreamers, she portrays the grimness and bureaucratic indifference of UK immigration. A system that processes people without listening to them or looking them in the eye. That is not mindful of trauma. But it is not a grim film. There are female friendships, and a gorgeous love story between Isio and another woman in the detention centre, Farah (Ann Akinjirin). The script subtly challenges stereotypes about refugees. Between them, Isio and Farah have degrees in politics and philosophy, and bicker about Karl Marx. Like its director, the film is funny and warm.We meet before the government announces proposals for sweeping new changes to the asylum system, which would include making refugee status temporary. But I ask Gharoro-Akpojotor what she thinks about the recent protests against hotels housing asylum seekers. “I feel like the protests are in the wrong place,” says answers. “Those guys coming in, they didn’t make any of the rules. They didn’t make any of the policies. If anything, you should be at No 10 protesting. That’s where the rules are being made.”While Gharoro-Akpojotor was growing up in Nigeria, her father worked for Shell. She loved telling stories and wrote a book in her bedroom aged 11. “Well, I say book …” she grins. “I think it was called The Vampire Busters. My teacher told my mother that I could be an author.” Her mum was having none of it. “She said, ‘There’s no money in that! My daughter will be an English teacher.’”After her father died, Gharoro-Akpojotor’s mother sent her three brothers to the UK to boarding school. She followed when she was 16. And it was after moving to London that she discovered films. Every week Gharoro-Akpojotor and her mate would buy two-for-one cinema tickets: “We’d get a ticket and then just stay in the cinema watching films back-to-back. I was like: Oh my God, I love cinema.”At the same time, she was thinking about her sexuality. “I always knew I liked women, but I didn’t really understand it.” In Nigeria she couldn’t do anything about her feelings. “Now I thought I should probably watch more gay cinema, to understand what it means to be black and gay and Nigerian. But I couldn’t find anything to watch.” It sparked an idea: “What if I could make it myself? That’s where my journey began. I just wanted to see myself on screen.”Gharoro-Akpojotor wrote her first script while doing her A-levels. It was a murder mystery about characters high on mushrooms. She studied cinema at university, which was not quite the degree she thought she was signing up for. “Admittedly, I believed it was more of a practical course,” she says grinning. But at university she learned about cinema. Watching films by Wong Kar-wai, François Truffaut and Ousmane Sembène, the world grew bigger. “I learned that art is an expression of yourself. French new wave taught me that. It’s an expression of who you are as a person. That was something I was trying to do with Dreamers, to find myself in it.”After university, her mother advised her to get a sensible job at the BBC. “But I always felt like I needed to do more.” She worked part time in the betting shop while studying for a master’s part-time, and making short films.It was on the set of a short that an actor told her that she had a knack for producing. And she liked it too. “I enjoyed the organisational part, I enjoyed talking to people. I enjoyed seeing the film come together.” It got her thinking. “What stories do I want to put in the world? I need to find things that speak to me, and make me feel fulfilled as a human being. I need to feel like I’m giving something back. I really wanted to make films that allowed other people to see and hear themselves on screen.”She achieved exactly that with the first feature film she produced, Blue Story. It was a drama about two friends who get caught up in gangs from rival postcodes in south London, directed by the rapper Rapman. Blue Story was the sixth best opening of any British film during 2019: “There were people in the audience who just went to see it over and over again.”Then it became embroiled in controversy, after a brawl in a cinema foyer in Birmingham. Two cinema chains pulled the film off screen, leading to accusations of “institutional racism”. The cinemas swiftly backtracked. At the time Gharoro-Akpojotor says she didn’t understand why it was banned. It didn’t glorify gangs: “It’s an anti-violence film. The film was all about calling young people to question why they joined gangs. I guess we felt a bit demonised.”What she wants more than anything is to make films that challenge people to see the world differently. Her next project is about a young man with mental health problems. “By the end of that I want you to be like, next time you see a guy on the road, and you hear him shouting, take time to think. We’re so used to walking by. We treat people as the other. It’s the same with immigration – it’s those guys over there. We forget the human links that tie us all together. I think it’s about empathy. ”She laughs. “I sound like a bumper sticker. But I really do believe that if we had more understanding of social issues, we would have so much more care for each other.”Dreamers is released in the UK on 5 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its widely used AI assistant, Claude, has become particularly popular among business customers.View image in fullscreenThe decision to ‘let go’ of the reins on AI is likely to come between 2027 and 2030, Kaplan says.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesKaplan said that while efforts to align the rapidly advancing technology to human interests had to date been successful, freeing it to recursively self-improve “is in some ways the ultimate risk, because it’s kind of like letting AI kind of go”. The decision could come between 2027 and 2030, he said.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“If you imagine you create this process where you have an AI that is smarter than you, or about as smart as you, it’s [then] making an AI that’s much smarter.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“It sounds like a kind of scary process. You don’t know where you end up.”Kaplan has gone from being a theoretical physicist scientist to an AI billionaire in seven years working in the field. In a wide-ranging interview, he also said:AI systems will be capable of doing “most white-collar work” in two to three years.That his six-year-old son will never be better than an AI at academic work such as writing an essay or doing a maths exam.That it was right to worry about humans losing control of the technology if AIs start to improve themselves.The stakes in the race to AGI feel “daunting”.The best-case scenario could enable AI to accelerate biomedical research, improve health and cybersecurity, boost productivity, give people more free time and help humans flourish.Kaplan met the Guardian at Anthropic’s headquarters in San Francisco, where the interior of knitted rugs and upbeat jazz music belies the existential concerns about the technology being developed.View image in fullscreenSan Francisco has become the epicentre of AI startups and investment.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesKaplan is a Stanford-and Harvard-educated professor of physics who researched at Johns Hopkins University and at Cern in Switzerland before joining OpenAI in 2019 and co-founding Anthropic in 2021.He is not alone at Anthropic in voicing concerns. One of his co-founders, Jack Clark, said in October he wasboth an optimist and “deeply afraid”about the trajectory of AI, which he called “a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine”.Kaplan said he was very optimistic about the alignment of AI systems with the interests of humanity up to the level of human intelligence, but was concerned about the consequences if and when they exceed that threshold.He said: “If you imagine you create this process where you have an AI that is smarter than you, or about as smart as you, it’s [then] making an AI that’s much smarter. It’s going to enlist that AI help to make an AI smarter than that. It sounds like a kind of scary process. You don’t know where you end up.”Doubt has been cast on the gains made from deploying AIs in the economy. Outside Anthropic’s headquarters, a billboard for another tech company pointedly asked “All that AI and no ROI?”, a reference to return on investment. A Harvard Business Review study in September saidAI “workslop”– substandard AI enabled-work that humans have to fix – was reducing productivity.Some of the clearest gains have been in using AIs to write computer code. In September, Anthropic revealed its cutting-edge AI, Claude Sonnet 4.5, a model for computer coding that can build AI agents and autonomously use computers.View image in fullscreenAttackers used the Claude Code tool to target various organisations.Photograph: AnthropicIt maintained focus on complex multistep coding tasks for 30 hours unbroken, and Kaplan said that in some cases using AI was doubling the speed with which his firm’s programmers were able to work.But in November Anthropic said it believed a Chinese state-sponsored group hadmanipulated its Claude Code tool– not only to help humans launch a cyber-attack but to execute about 30 attacks itself, some of which were successful. Kaplan said allowing AIs to train the next AIs was “an extremely high-stakes decision to make”.“That’s the thing that we view as maybe the biggest decision or scariest thing to do … once no one’s involved in the process, you don’t really know. You can start a process and say, ‘Oh, it’s going very well. It’s exactly what we expected. It’s very safe.’ But you don’t know – it’s a dynamic process. Where does that lead?”He said if recursive self-improvement, as this process is sometimes known, was allowed in an uncontrolled way there were two risks.“One is do you lose control over it? Do you even know what the AIs are doing? The main question there is: are the AIs good for humanity? Are they helpful? Are they going to be harmless? Do they understand people? Are they going to allow people to continue to have agency over their lives and over the world?”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“I think preventing power grabs, preventing misuse of the technology, is also very important.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“It seems very dangerous for it to fall into the wrong hands”The second risk is to security resulting from the self-taught AIs exceeding the human capabilities at scientific research and technological development.“It seems very dangerous for it to fall into the wrong hands,” he said. “You can imagine some person [deciding]: ‘I want this AI to just be my slave. I want it to enact my will.’ I think preventing power grabs – preventing misuse of the technology – is also very important.”Independent research into frontier AI models, including ChatGPT, shows the length of tasks AIs can do has beendoubling every seven months.The future of AIThe rivals racing to create super-intelligence.

But we really don’t think that’s the case. We think it’s going to keep getting better.”He added: “It’s something where it’s moving very quickly and people don’t necessarily have time to absorb it or figure out what to do.”Anthropic is racing with OpenAI, Google DeepMind and xAI to develop ever more advanced AI systems in the push to AGI. Kaplan described the atmosphere in the Bay Area as “definitely very intense, both from the stakes of AI and from the competitiveness viewpoint”.“The way that we think about it is [that] everything is on this exponential trend in terms of investment, revenue, capabilities of AI, how complex the tasks [are that] AI can do,” he said.The speed of progress means the risk of one of the racers slipping up and falling behind is great. “The stakes are high for staying on the frontier, in the sense that you fall off the exponential [curve] and very quickly you could be very far behind at least in terms of resources.”By 2030, datacentres are projected to require $6.7tn worldwide tokeep pace with the demandfor compute power, McKinsey has estimated. Investors want to back the companies closest to the front of the pack.View image in fullscreenSome of the biggest gains have been in using AIs to write computer code.Photograph: Cheng Xin/Getty ImagesAt the same time, Anthropic is known for encouraging regulation of AI. Itsstatement of purposeincludes a section headlined: “We build safer systems.”“We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like, ‘Oh, wow, AI is a big deal’ … We want policymakers to be as informed as possible along the trajectory so they can take it into account.”In October, Anthropic’s position triggered a put-down from Donald Trump’s White House. David Sacks, the US president’s AI adviser, accused Anthropic of “fearmongering” to encourage state-by-state regulation that would benefit its position and damage startups.After Sacks claimed it had positioned itself as “a foe” of the Trump administration, Dario Amodei, Kaplan’s co-founder and Anthropic’s chief executive, hit back by saying the company had publicly praisedTrump’s AI action plan, worked with Republicans and that, like the White House, it wanted to maintain the US’s lead in AI."

Some, including Peter Wright, the chief constable of South Yorkshire police at the time of the disaster, have died.Steve Kelly, whose brother Mike, 38, died at Hillsborough, said: “No one should be beaten by the passage of time. We should have truth, justice and accountability, at least within a person’s lifetime.”Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was one of the 97 people killed at Hillsborough, said in response: “How lucky are they [the police officers] to have died in their own home, not traumatised like we all were. The youngest who died at Hillsborough was 10, how lucky are they to grow old. I’m so angry with their response.”Ten of the men whom the IOPC said would have faced gross misconduct cases were in the South Yorkshire force, including senior officers responsible for safety at Hillsborough. The IOPC listed six gross misconduct allegations against Wright, including for seeking to minimise the force’s responsibility and deflect blame on to the victims,Liverpoolfootball club supporters.Two other men were senior officers in West Midlands police, which was appointed to investigate the South Yorkshire force after the disaster. Mervyn Jones and Michael Foster would have faced allegations that they “failed to investigate effectively” and were “biased against supporters in favour of South Yorkshire police”.Hillsborough disaster timeline: decades seeking justice and changeRead moreIn a statement, the South YorkshirePoliceFederation criticised the IOPC report as “not fair or balanced” and said: “Former police officers – some of whom are very elderly and some who have sadly passed away – do not have any kind of due process or the ability to formally respond to the allegations made in this report.”The 366-page report, delivered to bereaved families in recent days, marks the culmination of 14 years’ work by the IOPC,which describes itas “the largest independent investigation into alleged police misconduct and criminality ever carried out in England and Wales”.The investigation, based in Warrington, began in 2012 after theHillsborough Independent Panelhad madelandmark findings on police culpability, which led to the quashing of the verdict of accidental death from the first inquest in 1991.The IOPC said in the report that it had found 110 complaints upheld or cases to answer against former officers, including for “falsehood and prevarication”, “discreditable conduct”, “abuse of authority” and “neglect of duty”.Some people whose relatives died at Hillsborough told the Guardian they welcomed the findings, but were outraged that the IOPC did not find more cases to answer against South Yorkshire police officers for falsely blaming Liverpool supporters.The IOPC has explained its view that in the absence of a duty of candour to positively assist an investigation, in 1989 the South Yorkshire force and its officers were not breaking the law or conduct rules by “presenting their best case” about the causes of the disaster, even though it involved withholding crucial information and amending hundreds of officers’ statements.There has also been disappointment among survivors that the IOPC has not criticised the West Midlands police investigation more extensively. The watchdog did uphold some complaints, but said it had not found West Midlands officers were generally intimidating towards the survivors they interviewed, asked them excessively about supporters drinking, or were biased towards South Yorkshire police.Ninety-seven men, women and childrenwere killed as a result of the crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989.View image in fullscreenDavid Duckenfield.Photograph: Richard Martin-Roberts/Getty ImagesThe jury at the second inquests into the disaster found in April 2016 a series of failings by South Yorkshire police, and that the victimswere unlawfully killedowing to gross negligence manslaughter by the officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield. The jury also determined that no behaviour by Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster.Duckenfield was thenacquitted in a criminal prosecutionin 2019. No police officer has been convicted of any criminal offences in relation to the Hillsborough failings, and none faced disciplinary proceedings at the time they were serving.After Operation Resolve, an investigation overseen by the IOPC into how the disaster happened, the watchdog has found Duckenfield would have faced 10 gross misconduct cases, including for his notorious lie that Liverpool supporters had forced open an exit gate to gain entry to the stadium. In fact Duckenfield had ordered the wide gate to be opened, to relieve serious congestion outside the ground.Supt Roger Marshall and Supt Bernard Murray, who had senior crowd safety roles, would also have faced gross misconduct cases, the IOPC said, as would the then South Yorkshire police assistant chief constable Walter Jackson. He was off duty but on call, and was at the match; the allegation against him was that: “ACC Jackson failed to organise and direct junior-ranking police officers to help save lives … ACC Jackson failed to take control of the disaster.”View image in fullscreenNorman Bettison.Photograph: Andrew Yates/ReutersSir Norman Bettison, who was a chief inspector at South Yorkshire police and later became chief constable of Merseyside police, would have faced allegations that he “provided misleading and inaccurate press statements” which minimised his role at South Yorkshire police after the disaster, and was “deliberately dishonest about his involvement in the disaster” when he applied for the Merseyside position. The Liverpool MP Ian Byrne has written to the Cabinet Office calling for Bettison to be stripped of his knighthood.A mounted police officer, PC David Scott, would have faced the allegation that he lied when he said that his horse had been burned by Liverpool supporters.Bereaved families have campaigned since 2017for a “Hillsborough law”, which was finallyintroduced into parliamentby Keir Starmer’s government in September, aimed at deterring official cover-ups by introducing a duty of“candour, transparency and frankness”for police officers and public officials.Aspinall said: “I cannot accept or understand how 97 people can be unlawfully killed, the police can lie, and nobody is held accountable. I recognise that the IOPC and Operation Resolve have worked hard and some of these findings are strong. But it’s absolutely ridiculous that so few people have been accused of gross misconduct for the lies and cover-up we’ve had to fight for 36 years.”Nicola Brook, a solicitor at Broudie Jackson Canter acting for several bereaved families, said: “Yes, the law has now changed so this loophole cannot be used in future. But for those affected by this case, that is no consolation. They are left with yet another bitter injustice: the truth finally acknowledged, but accountability denied.”The IOPC deputy director general Kathie Cashell said she sympathised with families who still felt they had not received proper explanations or justice, describing it as “deeply unsatisfactory” to be “still looking for those answers” 36 years on.“There was absolutely a defensive approach by South Yorkshire police, there were allegations made about fan behaviour that have been repeatedly disproven. But there is a difference between that as a fact, and then finding individuals culpable for gross misconduct or misconduct,” she said.“In order to meet the evidential threshold, it is a high bar to prove not just that [a statement] was a falsehood but that it was knowingly put forward as a falsehood.”The IOPC made clear that it supports the Hillsborough law, saying in the report: “If such a duty had existed in 1989, it may have helped bring the full facts of what occurred to light far sooner.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterPoliceLiverpoolEnglandIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

This means “whales” are often deployed to place bets on their behalf. As someone known for high-stakes betting, Cottrell has the profile of a “whale”.“Cottrell was not a particularly successful gambler, and frequently lost large sums of money,” the documents allege. This is what led the claimant, who describes himself as an “introducer”, to put Cottrell in touch with Bloom’s syndicate, it is claimed.Substantial profits were made by Bloom and other members of Starlizard Betting Syndicate “by utilising online betting accounts held in the name of an individual called Mr George Cottrell to place bets on sporting fixtures, predominantly football matches”, the document alleges.The paper claims that “Mr Cottrell had given control of his betting accounts to Mr Bloom and the Syndicate so that it was not necessary for bets to be sent to Mr Cottrell for him to place.”The document refers to Cottrell’s 2017 conviction for wire fraud, for which he served several months in a US prison.According to the papers, an arrangement was reached between Bloom, the syndicate and Cottrell that benefited all parties. Cottrell received a 33% share of any wins but appears to have been covered for any of his losses.It is alleged that losses sustained by an individual whose account was used to place bets would generally be borne by Bloom or his syndicate and that the individual therefore achieved their share of the winnings “risk free”.The bets were placed using online gambling accounts held by Cottrell with Stake.com, an offshore casino where users transact in cryptocurrency, the document alleges.Cottrell also tried to procure English and Welsh clients from Dudfield for an offshore gambling site, Tether.bet, despite the firm not holding a UK gambling licence, according to the filing.It is alleged that the agreement reached between the syndicate and Cottrell included that the syndicate would “cease to place its bets via gambling platforms in which Mr Cottrell had a financial interest, such as Tether.bet”.Lawyers acting for Cottrell previously said to the Guardian that he was not a director, shareholder or stakeholder in Tether.bet and had had “no involvement” in any companies that use cryptocurrencies.According to the document, Cottrell indicated a “willingness to proceed” with the agreement that betting accounts in his name could be used by Bloom in February 2022, while at Daphne’s restaurant in west London, with his ex-girlfriend Georgia Toffolo.Starlizard Consulting was originally owned by Blue Lizard Consulting, of which Bloom is the majority shareholder. According to court documents, it provides services to Bloom and others in order to “facilitate the operation of Mr Bloom’s private betting syndicate”.The syndicate’s total winnings are unknown.Dudfield claims he could be owed $17.5m because of a profit-share arrangement in which he says he was entitled to receive 7% of its winnings.The exact membership of the syndicate is also unclear but employees of Starlizard Consulting were given different levels of entry into it as part of their compensation, the document alleges.They claim that Cottrell and one of Bloom’s key associates, Ian McAleavy, continued the syndicate arrangement after Dudfield had been told it was no longer operating.“The claimant was told … that the Syndicate’s use of Mr Cottrell’s betting accounts had ceased,” the documents allege.“In fact Mr McAleavy and Mr Cottrell both knew that the Syndicate was continuing to make use of Mr Cottrell’s betting accounts and they both knew that very significant profits had/could be made as a result of the bets that had been placed and were to be placed,” the documents claim.Dudfield claims he became aware of betting activity that suggested it was ongoing and is therefore seeking his share of the profits it has made, alleging that they lied to him about it being shut down.Lawyers acting for Cottrell were approached for comment. Bloom was approached for comment via Brighton and Hove Albion FC.Bloom has yet to file a defence to the claim.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This must stop, and our new reforms will ensure that survivors are not demonised for the abuse they have suffered.”Under new laws, “bad character” evidence related to a victim’s past sexual history or abuse will no longer be allowed, unless lawyers have evidence to suggest a complainant has previously lied. Previous compensation claims for experiences of crime by victims will be banned under similar conditions.The changes will make it easier for prosecuting barristers to introduce “bad character” evidence about defendants in domestic abuse cases. New legislation, expected to be put before parliament next year, will mean a domestic abuse offence of any type – even if against a different victim – will be admissible in court.The measures come a day after the government announced£550m of funding for victim support, which it said would help rape complainants by formalising special measures such as companions for victims, the use of courtroom screens and the court’s power to pre-record evidence.The move is designed to encourage complainants to keep faith in the criminal justice system, which Lammy has described as on the “brink of total collapse”. Official projections suggest the crown court backlogcould reach more than 105,000 cases by March 2029, and reports of trials now being listed as far away as 2030.Rape victims, who are waiting up to four years for a court date in some cases, are abandoning trials in record numbers. According to an analysis by the Criminal Bar Association,published in the Observer, victims and witnesses abandoned five times more cases in 2024 than before the pandemic.Alex Davies-Jones, the minister for violence against women and girls, said the shake-up was a key part of the government’s mission to halve violence against women in a decade.She said: “This is probably the biggest [change] in how victims experience trials for a generation. It’s about making sure that victims are giving the best evidence possible, they don’t feel like they are the ones on trial and they are able to see justice being done.”Prof Katrin Hohl, the government’s independent adviser on sexual violence, said the new measures would help keep “the focus where it belongs” instead of “over-focusing on the credibility of the victim”.Asked if current laws around violence against women and girls were misogynistic, she said: “Parts of it, yes. For example, this practice.”She added: “I think somewhere in there is an admission that some of the law we currently have is based on deeply problematic beliefs about sexual violence. It’s a recognition that some of our law is shaped by myth and misconceptions, and we need to fix that. Admitting that is a big step.”The move was welcomed by campaigners, who have lobbied for a change in laws to provide greater protection for victims.Maxime Rowson, the head of policy at Rape Crisis England andWales, said that with half of rape survivors experiencing sexual violence more than once in their lifetime, current laws meant they could be penalised for their own vulnerability and the failures of the state.She said: “If implemented well, we hope this new law will mean an end to women being undermined and cross-examined on irrelevant and unrelated past experiences.”‘I just froze … I asked the judge: “Do I need to answer this?”’Penelope* had steeled herself for her court appearance after telling police that her ex-partner, a man nearly twice her age, had raped and coercively controlled her.But she had no way of preparing herself for the moment that her ex-partner’s barrister asked her, without warning, about the sexual abuse her father had inflicted upon her as a child.“I just absolutely froze, and I didn’t really know what to do,” she said. “I asked the judge ‘do I need to answer this?’ and she just told me to answer the question.”During the trial at a magistrates court, during which her ex-partner was facing a charge of coercive control but not rape, she had already been asked about buying sex toys and told she “loved sex”. At no point did the prosecuting barrister from the Crown Prosecution Service intervene, she said.“I just froze, and my heart just started beating, and I went completely cold,” she said. “I just felt so vulnerable and so in shock. I didn’t feel like I could answer many questions after that.”She had never spoken about the abuse, except with her ex-partner and said she was grateful that her mother was not watching. The ex-partner who she says abused her, was acquitted.Penelope hopes a change in the law, which will ban barristers from asking about past complaints, whether or not they lead to a conviction, will stop other complainants having to go through similarly “horrendous” experiences. “It will absolutely help other survivors of abuse,” she said.* Names have been changedInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The royal collection of works were personal gifts owned by the Russian, Danish and British royal families.The Winter egg is a rock crystal engraved with a frost design on the inside while the outside has rose-cut diamond-set platinum snowflake motifs.On Tuesday it was sold for £22,895,000, beating the world record auction for a Fabergé. Theprevious record was set in 2007when the Rothschild egg was sold for £8.9m.According to Christie’s, the auction is the third time the Winter egg has set a record-breaking price for a Fabergé piece. It has been sold numerous times as its history attracts collectors.After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the egg was taken from St Petersburg to the Kremlin armoury in Moscow alongside other valuable possessions of the royal family.In the 1920s the Soviet government began selling off art treasures from the Hermitage Museum and other collections, often for a fraction of their value. It was later acquired by Wartski of London and in 1934 sold to a British collector for £1,500.For two decades between 1975 and 1994 the egg was believed to be missing, before being sold for £6.8m at Christie’s. Eight years later in 2002 the auction house sold it again for £7.1m.Margo Oganesian, Christie’s head of department for Fabergé and Russian works of art, said: “Christie’s is honoured to have been entrusted with the sale of the exquisite Winter egg by Fabergé for the third time in our history.“Today’s result sets a new world auction record for a work by Fabergé, reaffirming the enduring significance of this masterpiece and celebrating the rarity and brilliance of what is widely regarded as one of Fabergé’s finest creations, both technically and artistically.“With only a handful of imperial Easter eggs remaining in private hands, this was an exceptional and historic opportunity for collectors to acquire a work of unparalleled importance.”Explore more on these topicsArtRussiaLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs byJulia KochetovaTue 2 Dec 2025 09.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 18.25 ESTShareFor a time Pokrovsk was a haven, a wartime Ukrainian boom city because of its strategic position in the east, 30 miles (48km) from the front. But that was before the summer of 2024, when a rapid Russian advance engulfed the industrial centre in a shattering conflict,a duel only now reaching its endgame.The 18-month battle for Pokrovsk epitomises the current state of theUkrainewar: an attritional struggle in which gradual Russian advances have been made at extraordinary human cost. Though it demonstrates Russia cannot easily capture urban areas, the fight has also drained Ukraine, and consequences are emerging elsewhere.Such has been the level of destruction that Pokrovsk is no longer even strategically significant. Its population is decimated, its industry destroyed and supply routes are re-routed; instead it has become a bloody signpost as peace negotiations restart.“There are fairly strong military arguments for Ukraine giving up ground,” said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. “But politically, Ukraine recognises that giving up territory won’t necessarily stop the war. Giving up land would mean fighting the same battles on different terrain.”View image in fullscreenUkrainian police from the White Angels unit, which specialises in evacuations, in Pokrovsk city centre in May.An industrial city, with a prewar population of 60,000 and five-storey communist apartment blocks in its centre, Pokrovsk was already significant before the Russian invasion. A mine 6 miles (10km) to the west was the largest supplier of coking coal, an essential raw material for the steel-making process, in post-2014 Ukraine. Producing 6m tonnes a year, it employed, with a sister mine, 10,000 people.View image in fullscreenMaryna Krut, a Ukrainian singer, performing Shchedryk (Carol of the Bells) with a bandura, a Ukrainian instrument, by the entry sign of Pokrovsk city in December 2024. The composer Mykola Leontovych lived and worked in Pokrovsk in the beginning of the 20th century.People deserted the city rapidly after Russia launched its full-scale assault in February 2022. But while the invaders swept through the south and eastern edge of Ukraine, the prewar lines held in Avdiivka 30 miles south-east. As the frontlines stabilised elsewhere, Pokrovsk’s location made it strategically important.MapIts rail station became a distribution hub for the region, while its roads were the principal through connection from the central city of Dnipro to Kramatorsk and Ukraine’s fortress belt in Donetsk province, bringing troops and supplies forward, andferrying casualties back by night.By the summer of 2022, Pokrovsk became a lively base in the rear, even allowing for a 7pm curfew, its population at prewar levels. The Hotel Druzhba, with its Soviet attitude to service, was filled with off-duty soldiers and their partners as well as humanitarian workers, military trainers and journalists.View image in fullscreenA wounded soldier before evacuation at the stabilisation point of the ‘Ulf’ medical service of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion in April 2025. This unit was treating soldiers at the Pokrovsk front.“The city gained a boost from all the people that were arriving,” said Oleksandr Nesterenko, a public activist from Pokrovsk. An apartment that might have cost $100 a month to rent before the war “at the peak in 2023 cost anywhere from $350 to $600”, he said, with shops selling military gear springing up “seemingly every 3 metres”.That began to change in August 2023. A few weeks before a warning had been circulated that the Russians were targeting frontline hotels. On 8 August,two Iskander missiles slammed into an apartment block near the Druzhba, landing about 40 minutes apart; the second an apparent effort to kill or maim those responding to the initial attack. Seven were killed.For journalists, Pokrovsk became a place to pass through. Its economy had begun to change with a handful ofwomen taking on traditionally male jobsworking in the coalmines. But it was thefall of Avdiivkain February 2024 (caused partly by a suspension of military aid by the US Congress) that led to a dramatic change.View image in fullscreenThe evacuation of a local library in Pokrovsk in August 2024.A relatively rapid Russian advance followed in the next six months, across poorly defended rear lines, and the invaders reached within 7 miles of the south of the city by August. Civilians were told to evacuate. Library books were packed up, and shop signs were being taken downwhen the Guardian visited in August 2024. Gradually most residents abandoned their homes and lives.Pokrovsk was expected to fall in weeks, but did not. Some pressure on the sector was relieved by Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia, also in summer 2024, while the defenders became more organised. Russia’s military, unable to take the city directly, began instead what turned out to be a gradual semi-encirclement – eventually outnumbering the defenders eight to one, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said last month.Russian advance on Pokrovsk graphicRussian forces focused heavily on locating and eliminating Ukrainian FPV (first-person view) drone crews with its Rubicon drone units, achieving an aerial dominance in the summer, and targeting the remaining supply routes covered by anti-drone netting to the north. Rotating forces and evacuating wounded became increasingly dangerous, leaving defenders exhausted. A shortage of Ukrainian artillery weakened the defensive position further.View image in fullscreenAnti-drone netting covers a Ukrainian supply route into Pokrovsk in May 2025.Nesterenko abandoned his apartment in Pokrovsk in the autumn of 2024, but returned, despite the growing risks, for a few months thereafter to help people in the city. His last visit was in March this year. The least dangerous way into Pokrovsk was to walk – a car being too obvious a target for an FPV drone; the sound of explosions, he added, was constant.“At that time there was still one shop working, a general store, and it had a Starlink internet and a generator, so you could still pay by card,” he said. “No young people were left. All the customers were 50 or older, and none of them would flinch or squat whenever an explosion was close. They were so used to it, they didn’t react in any way at all, it was so noticeable.”View image in fullscreenPokrovsk’s ruined city centre in May 2025.The coking coalmine closed in January, its tunnels deliberately collapsed. Because it is not actively being maintained the mine has flooded. The last shop shut in August. About 1,200 civilians are estimated to live in Pokrovsk and 900 in nearby Myrnohrad, mostly waiting for the Russians, while Nesterenko said the city was “a complete ruin. It has no gas, no water, no electricity and no heating”.Russian troops began to infiltrate in ones, twos and small groups, to avoid drone attack, from October, increasingly taking advantage of rainy or foggy autumn weather to hide from drones. Their aim was to seal off the city, though a dramatic Ukrainian special forces helicopter raid at the end of October unblocked an exit route.Meanwhile the Russian infiltrators keep coming: on foot, on motorbike, even in pickup trucks. A larger but equally irregular group nicknamed the “Mad Max convoy”, appeared in a video on 10 November, emerging from under the cover of fog. Their goal was to accumulate in Pokrovsk, before finding and attacking Ukrainian positions.0:35Russian forces roll 'Mad Max-style' into battered Pokrovsk - videoIn October, the Russians suffered 25,000 casualties, killed and wounded, mostly around Pokrovsk, according to Zelenskyy. In January, the figure was 15,000, according to another Ukrainian estimate. That suggests capturing the rest of Donetsk, the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which Vladimir Putin is demanding in the latest peace negotiations, would be more bloody.View image in fullscreenMilitary personnel from unit Code 9.2 setting a vampire drone for launch in a counterattack operation in May 2025.Meanwhile, perhaps because of Ukraine’s stubborn 15-month defence, problems are emerging elsewhere: its front is giving way near Huliaipole, 60 miles to the south-west, with 6 miles lost in November.“Ukraine is in a very difficult position, though it is a large country and only losing territory slowly,” Reynolds said. “Meanwhile, even if Russia continues to advance, it is not clear to what degree its civilians will in future put up with the numbers being recruited and killed.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They scored it when we left the European Union. They should score both the improved trade relationships that we’ve negotiated and this youth experience scheme.”View image in fullscreenRichard Hughes’s resignation letter.Photograph: OBRReeves’s allies have made no secret about the lack of rapport between her and Hughes – a blunt former IMF and Treasury official, whosepast career involved advising the Zimbabwean government about hyperinflation.Longtime observers of the relationship between the Treasury and OBR point out that last year marked the first time Labour has had to tangle with the watchdog since it was created by George Osborne. A former Tory adviser joked: “Osborne’s trap laid in 2011 paid dividends.”Unable to respond to the “leakfest” publicly before the budget, the OBR chair and his colleagues had raised concerns privately with Treasury officials, Milesrevealed.With the search now on for a replacement, some senior economists said any credible successor would probably seek reassurances that the institution would not face a similar onslaught in future.Jonathan Portes, a former government adviser now at the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, said Hughes’s departure was “not good for the UK in fiscal governance terms” and the government should have encouraged him to stay. “I don’t think his resignation is good for the government’s fiscal credibility”.The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, underlined the importance of the OBR’s independence on Tuesday, telling journalists: “Attacks on the OBR: in terms of the principle, I would say ‘no, can we please remember why it was done and the principles underlying it’.”Hughes’s unprecedented letter last Friday, setting out the evolution of the OBR’s forecasts, reflected weeks of pent-up frustration within the concrete headquarters it shares with the Department of Justice.He had intended to send it earlier – mentioning it in the OBR’s budget document, the Economic and Fiscal Outlook – but as Hughes’s colleague Miles confirmed on Tuesday, it was delayed by the chaos surrounding the budget’s accidental publication.The letter was read by some at Westminster – including the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, and some journalists – as impugning Reeves’s honesty, revealing as it did that even before her gloomy 4 November speech, the OBR was assuming she would just meet her fiscal rules.Miles, who oversees the OBR’s forecasts and represented the watchdog at the Treasury select committee on Tuesday, scotched that idea firmly, however.The chancellor was right to point to the shaky state of the public finances, he said. Her “headroom” by the end of the five-year forecast was “wafer thin” – and indeed, as Miles and his colleague Tom Josephs made clear, while Reeves plans to raise taxes and cut spending to expand it, there are significant questions about whether that is realistic.Without aiming its fire directly at Reeves, however, the OBR did want to highlight the contradiction between the evolution of its forecasts – which were broadly complete by 30 October – and the excitable government briefing on 14 November.That was the daybond markets reacted badly to news Reeves and Starmer had dropped the idea of raising income tax rates. Scrambling to calm City nerves, Treasury sources told some journalists that the change of heart resulted from improved OBR forecasts.Miles told MPs this improvement simply “didn’t exist”. To the extent the forecasts had got better, it had happened a couple of weeks earlier, before 31 October; and there was concern inside the watchdog that all this briefing made it look as though its forecasts were “wildly fluctuating”, making the budget process “chaotic” – which, of course, it was, but not for that reason.As the dust settles on the budget, Reeves is now looking both for a chief economic adviser – after thescaling back of John Van Reenen’s role– and a new OBR chair, at a time when she and her policies are under intense political pressure.Plausible candidates to succeed Hughes include Bailey’s deputy, Clare Lombardelli, who has known Reeves for many years; Carl Emmerson, until recently of the Institute for Fiscal Studies; or if they prefer a consummate Treasury insider, director of public spending, Conrad Smewing. Senior government economist Nick Joicey, now at the Blavatnik school of government, might also be a solid candidate, were he not married to the chancellor.Whoever takes on the role may take some convincing that they will be given the freedom to do their job without being publicly – and privately – second-guessed by government insiders. And investors in bond markets, which were unmoved by the leak farrago, will be watching closely to ensure whoever is appointed has the credibility and independence needed for such an impossible job.Explore more on these topicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityRachel ReevesBudgetEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

She lives in the small town of Maullín, on the edge ofChile’s Patagonia, an area where almost everyone works in the fishing industry.Outside, it is drizzling and the sky is darkening as she recalls 1 May 2019, one of the worst days of her life. “Two men knocked on my door and told me they had bad news: my husband had had an accident while working at sea,” she says. Since then, she has discovered that the accident seems to have been caused by negligence.An autopsy proved that Arturo Vera, 59, a diver at one of Chile’s salmon farms, was struck by a boat’s propeller and injured in the head, ribs and throat. He had been working at the Taraba fish farm in Puerto Natales, in Magallanes, the southernmost region of Chilean Patagonia. Divers working in the salmon farm saythe fatal injuries happened in violation of safety regulations, at a time when the boat’s engine was supposed to be turned off. The family claims to have received compensation in court.Following Vera’s death, the company was fined for violations of labour and safety regulations identified by the labour inspector. The company was approached but did not respond to requests for comment.View image in fullscreenJulia Cárcamo López’s husband, Arturo Vera, was killed when he was struck by a propeller while working as a diver at a salmon farmChile’s fast-growing salmon industry has been tied to deadly labour conditions, rampant antibiotic use and severe environmental damage, putting workers and communities at risk. Indigenous groups and small-scale fishers report polluted waters, vanishing wildlife and threats to their cultural practices.“Over the last 12 years, the salmon industry in Chile has had the highest rate of accidents and deaths at work in the aquaculture sector globally,” says Juan Carlos Cardenas, director ofEcoceanos, a conservationist NGO. “Between March 2013 and July 2025,83 workers diedin accidents in the sector.”Meanwhile, Norway has reported only three worker deaths in the salmon industry over the last 34 years, according to Ecoceanos.“Those who eat Chilean salmon cannot imagine how much human blood it carries with it,” says one source working on a farm in Chilean Patagonia.Salmon is not native to Chile’s waters. The first specimens were imported from Norway more than 40 years ago during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.View image in fullscreenA salmon farming centre in Chilean Patagonia, where salmon are not a native speciesChile’s salmon farms, orsalmoneras, are the world’ssecond-largest producer of salmonafter Norway, and fish is one of the country’sbiggest exports. Between 1990 and 2017, the industryincreased production by almost 3,000%, withmore than 750,000 tonnesexported tomore than 80 countries.Chile is theleading supplier of salmon to the US, exporting 56,474 tonnes of the fish worth US$760m (£575m) in the first quarter of 2025 alone.According to data from the Chilean government, from 2003 to 2024, imports of Chilean salmon into Europe grew from $56m to $204m, and the EU is now the sixth-largest market for Chilean salmon imports.Yet the industry’s expansion has been at least partly driven by poor production practices that pose risks to human safety and the environment. A widespread use of chemicals and antibiotics pollutes water, destroying ecosystems and threatening other marine species.While in 2024, Norway declared that it had used virtually no antibiotics in its farms, Chilean farms usedmore than 351 tonnes. This figure represents an improvement over 2014,when 563 tonnes were used, but it remains very high, given thatstudies suggest70% to 80% of the antibiotics administered to salmon can end up in the environment.Eating animals that have been treated with antibiotics can lead toantimicrobial resistance, and could promote the transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans.Small-scale fishers say they can no longer survive on fishing because many species, including sea urchins and mussels, are scarce due to pollution from thesalmoneras.View image in fullscreenFishers prepare to search for sea urchins in Carelmapu, Los LagosJorge Ampuero González, head of the provincial Labour Inspectorate in Puerto Natales, says he does not have the personnel or equipment to inspect farms that can take up to 12 hours to reach by sea. His team of seven oversees 30 salmon farms but has no boats or helicopters.“Realistically, we can visit each centre once a year, at most twice. However much we want to, it is really difficult to change things with these tools,” says Ampuero González, who believes the industry needs improvement. “There is a lack of understanding that the sustainability of the industry does not depend only on how much salmon we produce, but on the conditions in which we produce it.”The Chilean minister for the environment, the undersecretary for fisheries, the director of Chile’s national fisheries and aquaculture service (Sernapesca), the director ofSalmonchile, the leading trade association of Chilean salmon producers, and the companies involved were approached for comment.Pollution affects not just the Patagonian Sea, where salmon are raised, but also the freshwater stages of fish farming. The initial phase, including fertilisation and egg hatching, occurs mainly in Chile’s rivers in Araucanía and Los Ríos. A notablecasealleging contaminationinvolves the Chesque Alto community in Araucanía, which has been engaged in a lengthy legal fight against a local salmon company.View image in fullscreenSalmon being filleted at a market in ValparaísoIllness, animal deaths and water shortages: life inside Chile’s polluted ‘sacrifice zones’Read moreNear the polluted Chesque River stands a small wooden house where Angelica Urrutia, 35, and her family live. In a separate case, her community, the Mapuche – the largest Indigenous group in Chile – has taken legal action against the Sociedad Comercial Agrícola y Forestal Nalcahue (Nalcahue Agricultural and Forestry Commercial Society Ltd), which farms salmon in the area.“Since the company set up shop,” says Urrutia, “the fish in the river have disappeared, as has the rest of the wildlife, especially the birds. When they were forced to stop in 2021 because of our complaint, the fish and other animals returned.”According to community members, some parts of the Chesque River have turned reddish and slimy due to pollution, a phenomenon also observed in other areas of Chile where salmon farms have been set up near rivers.“In 2005, four of our cows drank water near the company’s drain and all died. The vet who examined them said they had ingested a lot of formalin,” says Urrutia, referring to an allegedlycarcinogenicchemical frequently used in salmon farming in Chile to eliminate parasites.View image in fullscreenA stream that appears to have been polluted in the Araucanía regionUrrutia says representatives of a salmon farming company came to their home and offered to buy them some sheep. “They do this so they can continue to work in peace,” says Urrutia. “Many of our neighbours are in favour of the company setting up here precisely because of these ‘incentives’.”Yet, many residents are concerned about their health because they drink river water and use it daily in their homes. The salmon company was established in the area almost 30 years ago, in 1998, and, thanks to the legal battle fought by the Urrutia community in 2021, its activities had to be halted for about eight months. The company now faces an administrative sanctioning procedure, but continues to operate while it is ongoing.Urrutia, who is a “machi”, an ancestral figure who is a pillar of support for the Indigenous groups in the area, treating its members with medicinal herbs and rituals, says there are other aspects of her people’s lives that are affected by salmon companies.View image in fullscreenNative plants, including medicinal herbs, are affected by the water pollution“I can no longer gather the medicinal herbs that grow around the river,” she says. “And the company has contaminated several areas of the river that my community has always used for our ancestral ceremonies. When the company had to stop, we were able to perform our sacred ceremonies in the river again. It was beautiful.”Journalismfund Europesupported this story.Explore more on these topicsChileSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanFish (Environment)Fish (Food)FishingFishing industryOceansConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Authorities have alreadyarrested 13 people, including several from a construction company, on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the blaze. No official has yet taken responsibility for the tragedy.The death toll from the fire will loom over the legislative council (LegCo) elections on Sunday, Hong Kong’s equivalent of a general election. But where in previous years there was feisty campaigning from different political parties and a rowdy public debate between candidates, this year, for the second time since the pro-democracy protests, it will be a “patriots only” affair, with only government-approved candidates being allowed to stand.“Having eliminated all opposition parties, the government no longer fears that a large number of candidates could win seats in the legislative council who want to challenge the status quo and might raise embarrassing questions during debates over bills backed by the chief executive,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, the chancellor’s professor of history at UC Irvine and author of Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink. “What it does worry about now is something else that can be embarrassing: a small turnout.”In 2021, the first time that LegCo elections were held under the “patriots only” policy, turnout hit arecord lowof 30.2%. In 2016, turnout was 58.3%.Refusing to vote is one of the only ways that Hongkongers can safely voice their dissent against the government as other forms of protest have been criminalised. Over the weekend, Miles Kwan, a student,was arrestedover a petition that demanded accountability from the government over the fire. Local media reported that two other people had been arrested.“Before the national security law, there wouldn’t be any repercussions for people just for speaking out,” Wasserstrom said.In mainland China, however, there are not any kinds of major elections – patriots-only or otherwise – that citizens can boycott.It is also impossible to imagine China’s leader, Xi Jinping, participating in an unscripted press conference like the one Lee held on Tuesday. An AFP journalist asked: “You have spoken about leading Hong Kong from chaos to order and from order to prosperity. And yet this prosperous society allowed 151 people to burn to death. Can you tell us why you deserve to keep your job?” Such a question would never reach the ears of Xi in a public forum.Similarly, although Hong Kong’s national security laws have done a lot to muzzle independent media, there is still a vastly more open information landscape than in mainland China, in part because Hong Kong does not block western social media platforms and Google.Last week, an article published in the Chinese media about the “hidden dangers” of cities in mainland China following in the footsteps of Hong Kong’s high-density housing model was scrubbed from the internet.The most direct comparison to a recent tragedy in mainland China is the Urumqi apartment fire in 2022, which killed at least nine people and sparkedmassive protestsacross China against the harsh zero-Covid measures in place at the time, which were believed to have prevented people from leaving the building. Those protests, which became known as theWhite Paper movement, spiralled into one of the biggest challenges to CCP rule since the 1989 Tiananmen protests, more than 30 years earlier.The Chinese government has tried to erase the 2022 and 1989 protests from public memory. The authorities will try to do the same in Hong Kong but are unlikely to be as successful.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongChinaAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

From special-edition whisky to sparkling wine and a sherry that will knock your nan’s Harveys Bristol Cream out of the park, there’s something for everyone. Merry Christmas!The best Christmas drinks for 2025Best retro festive drink:Warninks Original AdvocaatView image in fullscreen£11 for 70cl at Asda£11 for 70cl at AmazonIt’s not Christmas in my house without a Snowball. Warninks’ rich and creamy brandy-based custard liqueur advocaat has been made in the Netherlands since 1616, and it’s been a staple of British drinks cabinets since the 1970s, thanks to the runaway success of the snowball cocktail. Brighten up dark, dreary December nights with this nostalgic-feeling yellow liqueur in the ultimate Christmas kitsch cocktail: two shots of advocaat over ice with the juice of quarter of a lime, topped up with lemonade and garnished with maraschino cherries.Best mulled wine:Waitrose mulled roseView image in fullscreen£6 for 75cl at WaitroseThe nation’s love of rose knows no bounds – to the extent that there are even a few mulled roses circulating this Christmas. I like this version from Waitrose, a lighter take on the usual ready-to-drink mulled reds; lots of citrus and gentle baking spice flavours mingle with the berry-fruit of the wine, and it works weirdly well warmed. Serve with slices of orange, apple and cinnamon sticks – you can up the ante with a slug of spicy gin if you like.Best festive cider:Sandford Orchards figgy pudding ice ciderView image in fullscreen£25 for 50cl at John LewisSandford Orchards makes top-quality craft cider from an independent, family-run cider mill in Devon. Here, it’s given its usual fare a Christmas makeover by freezing the apple juice to create a stronger, sweeter concentrated liquid (rather than harvesting frozen fruit, as with ice wine). This is then fermented and aged in oak barrels, then steeped in dried fruit. The result is a deeply aromatic and happily not-too-sweet festive tipple that pairs as well with after-dinner cheese as it does with mince pies.Best festive liqueur:Lyme Bay Winery fruit cake liqueurView image in fullscreen£14.99 for 35cl at Lyme Bay WineryIf sweet and sticky is your thing, this decadent fruit cake liqueur from the Lyme Bay Winery in Devon is a nice fireside treat. A warming brandy-based liqueur bursting with rich raisin, fig, damson and elderberry notes and a huge whack of sweet spices, this is Christmas cake in a bottle. Divine over ice, even better poured over vanilla ice-cream.Best cream liqueur:Baileys x Terry’s Chocolate Orange Irish cream liqueurView image in fullscreen£10.98 for 50cl at Asda£12.50 for 50cl at AmazonTwo Christmas legends unite with this Baileys x Terry’s Chocolate Orange Irish cream liqueur, and it’s everything you could want. More chocolate creaminess, more decadence and that signature Irish whiskey flavour, but laced with the recognisable orange oil of Terry’s. Fun for mixing up indulgent festive cocktails this Christmas, or spiriting up your hot chocolate.Best festive rum:Project #173 gingerbread rumView image in fullscreen£20.95 for 50cl at Master of Malt£26.97 for 50cl at AmazonProject #173 loves to play around with flavour, and it’s nailed it with this gingerbread and rum pairing. You can taste the quality and depth of the Dominican rum, but it’s been thoughtfully imbued with the authentic taste of real gingerbread using root ginger, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s wonderfully peppery, bright and spicy rather than cloying. I love sipping it on its own, though it would also make any rum and coke or hot beverage decidedly more festive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The distillery is B Corp certified and has a “plastic-free” approach. Its Mermaid Winter Gin is a small-batch gin infused with seasonal ingredients such as fig, cassia, orange peel, dried fruit and Isle of Wight honey, creating a triumphantly wintry, figgy, spicy gin that’s tasty and smooth enough to drink alone. Swap in to your usual G&T for a nod to the season; I like it withFever Tree Spanish clementine tonicand a slice of orange.Best festive fizz:Nyetimber classic cuveeView image in fullscreen£42 for 75cl at Waitrose£42 for 75cl at MajesticDecember requires festive sparkle on standby at all times, and what better bottle of bubbles to keep in the fridge than Nyetimber classic cuvee? The signature – and most affordable – bottling for the renowned English wine estate is a sure-fire hit bound to get any Christmas party started. With tons of creamy, toasty brioche thanks totime on the lees, this sparkling wine is full of orchard fruit and citrus flavours, making it the ideal fizz for all festive occasions. Nyetimber’s winemaker Cherie Spriggs recently won sparkling winemaker of the year at the International Wine Challenge for the second time, and is the only woman ever to have won the award: cheers to that.Best festive beer:Vocation Brewery the Nutcracker chestnut & vanilla winter aleView image in fullscreen£4 for 440ml at Vocation BreweryIndependent Yorkshire-based brewer Vocation has Christmas covered for beer-lovers. Its limited-edition festive ales range from the tropical, hoppyWham-A-Geddonto the crispSnow Pines IPA, plus a few interesting stouts. My pick is the Nutcracker, a spiced, slightly sweet full-bodied winter ale with a comforting chestnut note and lots of roasted flavours that nod to the season.Best festive whisky:Master of Malt Craigellachie 11-year-old (Christmas) single maltView image in fullscreen£49.95 for 70cl at Master of Malt£57.62 for 70cl at AmazonNot everyone wants an in-your-face festive flavoured drink. This Christmas edition of Craigellachie Speyside single malt has been aged for 11 years in bourbon, oloroso and pedro ximénez (PX) sherry casks, imparting a welcome dried fruit flavour with some wintry fireside smoke; think mince pies and roasting chestnuts on the nose. One to hunker down with stollen and those fancy Christmas nuts on chilly nights – far too good to leave out for Santa.Best sherry:González Byass Solera 1847 cream sherryView image in fullscreen£16.50 for 75cl at Master of Malt£17.50 for 75cl at the Whisky ExchangeCream sherry is not just for nans; this Solera 1847 cream sherry from renowned family-owned winery González Byass is the perfect winter warmer. Made using 75% nutty, savoury oloroso, topped up with rich, raisin-heavy PX, then aged for eight to nine years, the liquid is complex with toffee, vanilla and oak velvetiness just made for chilly nights. González Byass recommends pairing it with cheese or dessert, but I’d probably stick to puddings or have it as an aperitif unless you were choosing your cheeses carefully.Best alternative cream liqueur:Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference pistachio & chocolate Irish cream liqueurView image in fullscreen£12 for 70cl at Sainsbury’sEvery year an influx of flavoured Irish cream liqueurs hits the shelves, and 2025’s standout is this pistachio Irish cream liqueur from the Taste the Difference range. Inspired by the viral trend forDubai chocolateand all things pistachio, this blends natural pistachio flavour with Irish whiskey, fresh cream and Belgian chocolate – we’ve been spared the kataifi. Get past the creme-de-menthe-esque hue and the pistachio flavour is bang on. While it’s certainly rich, indulgent and creamy, it’s not too thick or sickly sweet. Great over ice or in mudslide-type cocktails.For more, read our rundown ofthe best ginandbest whiskyJoanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Elias’s terminal cancer diagnosis compelled Gilbert to reveal her feelings, despite being married at the time. She admits to enabling Elias, a self-described “ex-junkie”, to access hard drugs and alcohol during her final months as a warped act of care.“I needed Rayya at a level that was far beyond healthy,” Gilbert writes of wanting to demonstrate her commitment with extreme acts.Confronted by her compulsion to seek meaning through the highs of romantic intensity, Gilbert eventually diagnoses herself as a “sex and love addict”, exploring the label via self-reflection and 12-step recovery communities such asSex and Love Addicts Anonymous(SLAA).Love and sex addiction can overlap and are often discussed together, but Gilbert focuses less on her sex life than on the extreme ways she pursues love, acceptance, validation and approval, abbreviated in recovery communities as “Lava.” Some of these recovery communities, such asLove Addicts Anonymous(LAA), engage primarily with love addiction as its own unique form of unhealthy obsession.Love, intimacy and acceptance are universal needs, and western society venerates romance,lionizing extreme behaviorsin its pursuit. So one may wonder: at what point does love become dysfunctional?What does love addiction look like, and what can be done about it?What is love addiction?Love addiction has been a research topic for decades. But experts still debate whether “addiction” appropriately describes destructive romantic fixation, or whether it would be better understood as a confluence of attachment disorders, behavioral patterns and relational dysfunction.While it’s clear people can suffer from relationship patterns, experts worry about over-pathologizing normal human experiences. “I’d be more tempted to say ‘a person struggling with boundaries,’ or ‘a person experiencing enmeshment,’” says sex therapist Erin Davidson; the term “love addict” can be reductive or shaming, or used as an abdication of responsibility for abusive behavior.‘Our fantasy of love has to do with need and dependency’: Melissa Febos on her year of celibacyRead more“Partly what we call love is just being addicted to another person,” says Dr Brian Earp, associate professor of biomedical ethics, philosophy, and psychology at the National University of Singapore. Some philosophers of addiction are uneasy about conceiving of love as a harmful addiction, arguing that love is an “inherent good”, and as such should not be associated with addiction, which connotes harm, Earp says.Nonetheless, many researchers use the concept of “love addiction” as a shorthand for exploring maladaptive romances.According to a2023 research survey, love addiction can be considered a type of behavioral dependence, a broad category of conditions that includes gaming, shopping and food addictions. Demographic data is scant, but in 2011, psychology researchersestimatedthat 3% of the US population are love addicts.Love addiction “presents itself as an incessant need” for romantic relationships in which “dysfunctional behaviors associated with a recurrent fear of abandonment” arise, write the authors of the 2023 survey.Characteristics of the condition may include high levels of “salience”, or directing most thoughts and feelings toward the object of love; “mood modification”, or coping with negative feelings through thinking about or spending time with the loved one; and “conflict”, an interference with daily activities due to focus on the beloved, according to behavioral addictionresearch models.The authors also note there is “real danger in the psychopathological manifestation” of love addiction; it can indicate a serious mental disorder, and is not just a hyperbolic way to describe romantic misadventure.But due to insufficient expert agreement, neither sex nor love addiction is a formal diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Thus, there is no absolute medical consensus on who might qualify as a love or sex addict, or how they should seek treatment.Can love be addictive?Love, approval and validation are associated with feelgood neurotransmitters such as oxytocin and dopamine. Because of this, researcherscommonlydraw parallels between the euphoria of romance to the high of drugs likealcohol, heroin or cocaine.Love is “phenomenologically identical to being high”, says Earp, “an altered state of consciousness that’s very pleasurable and thrilling, somewhat scary, but very, very enjoyable”. Being in love “feels somehow more true or more real than ordinary life”, compelling people to disregard, to varying degrees, ordinary norms while chasing intensity, he says.The threshold for addiction is when a behavior, or set of behaviors, becomes uncontrollable, disrupting a person’s ability to live a reasonably balanced, fulfilling life and causing them or those around them to suffer. In love addiction, the euphoria of love can become maladaptive and begin “getting in the way of what a person wants for their life or relationships”, says Davidson.What are the symptoms of love addiction?According to addictionexperts, no case is exactly like another. However, love addicts may exhibit traits of “immature” love, “feel desperate and alone” when single, continue pursuing a love object long after a relationship has ended or “replace ended relationships immediately”,wroteUniversity of Southern California psychologist Dr Steve Sussman in 2010.Other patterns could include expecting the right relationship to “fix” one’s life or consistently jeopardizing existing relationships to feel the thrillof a new love’s first bloom.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s why I choose to think of it as empoweringRead moreFor Cyn Posner, 50, a self-identified love addict working on, andwriting about, recovery, addictive patterns looked like becoming involved with unavailable people despite wanting a stable monogamous partnership, and “not being able to walk away” from relationships where she was “being emotionally mishandled”, and cheated on. “I wasn’t able to be OK just by myself,” Posner says.Love addicts may feel “so viscerally drawn” to a person that they cannot bring themselves to leave, even in the face of harm, says Earp.Love addicts may not be aware of their patterns – perhaps because of cultural normalization of romantic dysfunction or because irrationality is acharacteristicof addiction. Coming to accept that you have aproblem beyond their controlis, in recovery communities, a crucial first step toward healing.Dominic McClintock, a 43-year-old military IT professional, is now in recovery and working with a therapist. But previously, he might have met a woman – a client or colleague, or strangers he sought out on Reddit – and begin fantasizing, oversharing and flirting with her, hiding it from his wife.“It wasn’t sexual,” says McClintock, who also uses the label “fantasy addict”. This made it feel innocent, he says. But the strength of his need eventually gave him pause: “I couldn’t stop.”What causes love addiction?Like any other addiction, love addiction has no single cause and likely arises from a complex interplay of genetic, psychological, social and developmental factors, says Earp.Shena Lashey, a Houston-based counselor who has specialized in the issue for over a decade, traces clients’ compulsive emotional patterns back to childhood trauma, such as abuse, abandonment, displacement and emotional neglect.“How many of us can say we got everything we emotionally, physically needed as a child? Probably close to none,” says Courtney D, 27, a queer California-based stylist who identifies as a love addict. “There’s so much self love that we’re not taught in western society.”Lashey and Davidson say clients often find learning aboutattachment theoryand “codependency” illuminating. The latter – unboundaried enmeshment in which a person takes so much responsibility for a partner that they lose their sense of self, sacrifice their own wellbeing, and experience low self-esteem and a declining quality of life – is particularly characteristic of love addicts.“Not all codependents are love addicts, but all love addicts are codependent,” says Lashey.I don’t like dating apps – I went to a ‘flirting party’ insteadRead moreLove addiction can co-occur with other disorders, particularly conditions associated with impulsivity and control, says Davidson. For instance, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, some manifestations of autism,anxiety and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder can all intersect with all kinds of addiction, due to underlying psychological and neurobiological traits.For an estimated40%of love addicts, the condition overlaps with substance use disorders. Posner used to relapse with alcohol and pills after a breakup, she says. Trying to self-soothe by switching to a new addiction is not uncommon among attenders of 12-step programs, she says; many of the people she has met in recovery for love addiction have also attended Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous, “because we tend to need an escape from our reality”, she says.How can love addicts develop a healthier relationship with romance?There are no evidence-based treatments for love addiction recovery, but therapy from a qualified provider can help a patient understand their relationship to trust, love and partnership, and build self-esteem, says Lashey. A therapist can help cut through “fantasy, rumination and falsehood”, so individuals can clarify and pursue what they really want, she says.Recovery groups are an accessible way for people to find support, community and information. There have been no controlled studies on the outcomes of self-help groups, but in 2023, researchers studying treatment options for love addictionwrotethat group interventions can be “fundamental to breaking out of isolation and experiencing new, healthier, and more functional forms of relationality”.“It’s very reliable and very consistent,” says Courtney of recovery meetings. “It’s on every day.”Yet, with their emphasis on spirituality and rigid structure, 12-step recovery groupsare not for everyone. And because such groups bring unhealed love addicts into contact, attenders say they can present opportunities for new, ill-advised romantic entanglements. Gender-specific meetings can help reduce those complications for heterosexual attenders.The 12-step program’s sponsor model, in which a more experienced member of the community guides a new member through their recovery, was useful for Posner. The sponsor helped her to write a list of goals, or “top line” behaviors, including communicating openly about seeking stable, monogamous, long-term partnership at the start of new relationships. She also created a “bottom-line” list of behaviors to avoid, including “ex-stalking on social media”.Unlike in substance-use recovery, full abstinence is not the goal in love-addiction programs; the aim is for individuals to cultivate healthy, fulfilling relationships. Frameworks vary, but in Posner’s experience participants are encouraged to go a year without engaging in bottom-line behaviors before pursuing new romance, and to reset their sobriety date if they slip.In All the Way to the River, Gilbert writes of the lonely boredom of withdrawal from love addiction, describing how it took months to reorient away from high-adrenaline love affairs toward more steady satisfactions, and a belief in self-love and internal strength.Perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that debilitating, destructive love has been around for millennia. In the first century BC, the Roman poet Ovid wroteRemedia Amoris, or The Remedy for Love. His recommendations are timeless: space and distraction from the object of one’s yearning, and seeking deeper fulfilment from within. “Let your swift mind encompass what it is that you love,” he writes, “and withdraw your neck from the collar that hurts you.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyRelationshipsSexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Huskies, for example?OK, then: as opposed to overweight.Are there many fat huskies?There are certainly lots of fat dogs – in the US it’s estimated that 60% of pets are obese, andsome studies suggestup to 65% of British dogs may be overweight or obese.I blame the owners. And the pet food industry. And all those greedy dogs and cats.Fortunately a solution is now at hand – weight-loss jabs.For pets?That’s right.

How does it work?GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone that slows digestion and suppresses hunger.How much would the treatment cost?That remains to be seen, but the company conducting the trial is hoping to keep the price under $100 (£75) per month.What? £75 a month?

It’s so thorough in its harrowing detail that it will surely block any chance he ever had of a return to stardomStuart HeritageTue 2 Dec 2025 10.50 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 14.23 ESTShareIf its subject gets his way, the new documentary series Sean Combs: The Reckoning might not be available on Netflix for long. On Monday, lawyers on behalf of Combs sent a cease and desist letter to the streamer, demanding that the series be withdrawn based on the inclusion of footage that they claim violates copyright, and involves discussions of “legal strategy that were not intended for public viewing”.After watching the series, you can see why Combs might be rattled. This is a man whose fall from grace last year was sudden and comprehensive, and yet Sean Combs: The Reckoning feels like the moment of no return for him. It does such a thorough job of laying out and backing up so many horrific allegations that his way back to stardom is surely blocked for ever.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs decries Netflix series by 50 Cent as ‘shameful hit piece’Read moreCombs – variously known throughout his career as Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Diddy and Love AKA Brother Love – is serving a 50-month prison sentence for transportation to engage in prostitution. Additionally, he faces a tidal wave of civil cases from former girlfriends, employees and associates, hitting him with a laundry list of accusations that includes (but is not limited to) rape, sex trafficking, false imprisonment and physical abuse.Many of these allegations are addressed in Sean Combs: The Reckoning. And while this means that the series isn’t a pleasant watch, it does feel like a grimly necessary one. Over the course of four episodes, the director, Alexandria Stapleton, paints a pattern of behaviour that starts to feel horribly inevitable.We meet Combs as a hungry youngster, willing to work longer and push harder in his thirst for success. We see him grow into an all-powerful mogul, before making the leap to becoming a rapper himself; draped in furs, swigging champagne from the bottle, J-Lo on his arm. We see his uncanny sense of timing, watching him pivot to reality TV fame at precisely the moment his music career starts to wane. But, at the same time, the series paints a picture of a rise fuelled by darkness.There’s his lacklustre planning and lack of insurance for the overattended basketball game in 1991 that resulted in nine people dying in a stampede. There’s talk of him demanding employees sign over their stake in his business, holding baseball bats over their heads. There was a shooting in 1995, in which Combs allegedly attempted to bribe a driver with $50,000 to claim ownership of the gun (he denies this).And then there are the allegations of sexual assault from women. We meet Joi Dickerson-Neal, who says that Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1991, taping the act in order to show it at parties. We meet the singer Aubrey O’Day, who only learns that she was allegedly drugged and raped by Combs after reading it in a witness statement several years after the fact. We meet Rodney Jones, a music producer who claims he was drugged and sexually assaulted in a home riddled with hidden cameras.One figure we don’t meet is Cassie Ventura, who nevertheless forms the centre of gravity in The Reckoning. It was CCTV footage of Combs punching, kicking and dragging Ventura through a hotel corridor that first brought the walls crashing down on him, and the series is highly insistent that this was far from a one-off event. Ventura sued Combs for rape and domestic violence in 2023, and reportedly received a $20m settlement.However, what caused Combs to demand Netflix remove the series is something even more eye-opening: footage filmed in the week before his arrest. Knowing that he was about to face the music, Combs apparently hired a videographer to follow him, in order to plead his innocence in the court of public opinion. At one point he talks to a lawyer on the phone, telling them that the narrative is slipping away from him on social media and demanding “somebody that’ll work with us that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirty business”.Thankfully, the existence of The Reckoning seems to suggest that the arch manipulator has finally been outmanoeuvred. Although there are certainly elements of this story that have not been told – Combs’s infamous “freak-off” parties are presented as an afterthought, and none of their long line of celebrity attendees are mentioned – the series does what is most needed right now. If Combs is able to uncancel himself in the face of evidence this damning, it will be nothing less than a miracle.Sean Combs: The Reckoning is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Paul Sagar at home in London.  Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/The GuardianAfter I was paralysed in a climbing accident, I discovered how inconsiderate, illogical and incompetent many wheelchair providers can beByPaul SagarTue 2 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 12.19 ESTShareIwas lying on my back in an east London hospital, sometime in August 2023. I don’t know what day it was, exactly; by that point I’d mostly given up caring. My phone rang. I managed to answer, even though I had largely lost the use of my hands. (Luckily, a member of staff had left it lying on my chest.) Also, I wasn’t feeling great. In the early stages of coming to terms with the fact I was paralysed, I had just been informed that the doctors wanted to drill a hole directly into my guts, inserting a plastic tube to drain away my urine, effectively making my penis redundant. It was proving quite a lot to take in.Nonetheless, I answered.The person on the other end said they were calling from my local wheelchair service. I sort of registered this was important. By this point, I’d started to get my head around the fact I was never going to walk again. Wheelchairs were going to be a big part of my life. But given I wasn’t going to be discharged from hospital for at least six months, I figured the local wheelchair service could wait until I was a bit more up for the conversation. I apologised, probably somewhat incoherently, and said I wasn’t able to talk right then. I assumed they would understand it wasn’t a good time, and call back later.I assumed wrong.A month or so went by. My mum was down from Merseyside, staying in my old flat in north-east London while I remained in hospital. (I never saw that flat again. The stairs made it just another inaccessible location for me, my former home part of a cut-off world.) She checked the post and found a letter from AJM Healthcare’s Waltham Forest wheelchair service, a regional subsidiary of AJ Mobility Ltd – described in its annual report as “leading integrated wheelchair service provider for the NHS, delivering services to a population base of over 8.1 million people”. The letter stated that because AJM had been “unsuccessful in our attempts to contact you … your referral has now been closed”. In other words, because I had failed to engage on the phone the one time that it called me, I had been removed from the waiting list for a wheelchair.Just to spell that out: I was in hospital, paralysed. I could not leave hospital until I had a wheelchair. The local wheelchair service notified me that I wouldn’t be getting a wheelchair, after speaking to me on the phone for less than 30 seconds. It did so by writing to my home address. Which I could not reach, because I was in a hospital. Without a wheelchair.So began my involvement with England’s wheelchair services, the patchwork of private companies contracted by theNHSto provide disability equipment to some of the people who need it most. It would prove to be quite a ride.The rock climbing accident thatleft me paralysedfrom the collarbones down happened in June 2023. It took a lot away from me. Continence (both kinds), sexual function, the ability to wash, dress and feed myself and basically anything that requires the proper use of hands (I’m writing this using voice dictation). And yes, most obviously, it also took away my ability to walk.But it also gave me some new things. Like a sudden introduction to being dependent on bureaucratic entities, to whom you are just another annoying statistic, clogging up the phone lines.Before the accident, I was a very fit and healthy 36-year-old man, in gainful employment as a university lecturer. I owned my own home, drove my own car and was happily cruising along in a world that made life easy for me.I did not yet know what it meant to be driven mad by the Department for Work and Pensions’ hold music for an hour, before the government computer hangs up because the phone linesare too busy. (I was calling in response to a threatening letter that said if I didn’t talk to them, I could expect my application for disability benefit, the personal independence payment, to be dismissed.) I did not yet know what it meant to try to organise wheelchairambulances through G4S(yes, the security firm – don’t ask, because I don’t know). I did not yet know that local wheelchair services are a lottery, in which some of the most vulnerable people in society roll the dice. A lottery in which the taxpayer acts as permanent lender of last resort – while private companies profit.‘The thing with wheelchair services is that they massively vary in England – it depends on your postcode,” Sarah told me. She is a physiotherapist who has been working with people with spinal cord injury for more than 20 years. “Some are good, but some are just awful.”Many of her clients are discharged from hospital in heavy manual wheelchairs that an able-bodied person would struggle to push. Frequently, they are the wrong type or size, and are at the very least uncomfortable. “Often,” she said, “people who have impaired function in their upper limbs cannot push these wheelchairs themselves, and become effectively housebound, in some cases confined to their bed. Sometimes, they develop complications from poorly prescribed wheelchairs, and it lands them back in hospital.”On average, she adds, people have to wait at least 10 months between being discharged and being assessed, let alone getting the wheelchair that is right for them. Often this is because local wheelchair services will refuse to assess a patient until they have left hospital and are back at home. Specifics vary depending on which company has the contract for a given area, but this can either involve a home visit at the convenience of wheelchair services, or a patient having to travel to the local depot to be measured and assessed. This often takes months after hospital discharge, with the result that people who, more than anything, just want to get on with their lives, are stranded in limbo.Ben, 37, was, like me, injured in a sports accident in the summer of 2023.Like most quadriplegics, he left rehab in a heavy manual wheelchair he could not push outdoors by himself. One afternoon, he asked his live-in care worker to push him down the street so that he could at least go outside. At 65kg he isn’t especially heavy, but the care worker hurt her wrist trying to get him up a slope. She complained to the agency that employs her, and the agency forbade any of Ben’s care workers from pushing him in the manual chair.“From that point on I was basically under house arrest,” Ben tells me. “It was 10 months before I got my power chair from wheelchair services – even though it was clear long before I was discharged from hospital that I was going to need one.”And even that wasn’t straightforward. “The crazy thing is, a wheelchair service’s mandate is only to make sure you can mobilise indoors, in your home. On a flat smooth surface, I can do that in a manual wheelchair. But outside, on rough and angled surfaces, I lack the hand and upper body strength.”As a result, he faced being issued with a wheelchair that would have kept him housebound. “My aim was to go back to work, rebuild my life,” he says. “But to do that, I had to lie to wheelchair services and make out I was more disabled than I am, so that I could get a power chair and access the outdoors.” It was either lie, or give up on having any kind of a life.“Am I not disabled enough? Surely I should not have to pretend to be even more disabled, just to get something as basic as a wheelchair I can go outside in.”Like Ben, I waited about 10 months for my prescription wheelchair to be ready. Collecting it meant visiting an industrial estate in Leytonstone, about a 20-minute bus ride away. It was then a 15-minute schlep to the AJM offices. My live-in carer accompanied me, as is now required for me to go pretty much anywhere.When we got there, I met the clinical lead. He was relatively new to the job, but we managed. Moving into the side room where the new wheelchair would be set up, he asked me to get out of the one I was in, and position myself on the nearby plinth. I explained I couldn’t do that, because I’m a quadriplegic, and require hoisting in situations like this. He looked somewhat concerned. Hoisting?I gestured with my useless hand at the nearby wall, where an array of hoist slings were hanging. And then at the ceiling, which had a mechanical track hoist attached to it. Using a special mechanical contraption. Hoisting.He excused himself and got a colleague, who then directed the clinical lead through the hoisting process. It struck me as quite odd that the clinical lead at a wheelchair service didn’t seem to be familiar with hoisting. But I opted to say nothing.View image in fullscreen‘The new chair certainly felt weird. But new wheelchairs normally do’ Paul Sagar at home.Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/The GuardianIt took a while for my new chair to be set up, but when I was in it the lead asked: “Do you feel comfortable?” Now, this is a tricky question. You see, I don’tfeelanything below my collarbones. It is just a dead zone. Although I can roughly work out when my hips aren’t straight, or my bum is too far forwards, this is a deductive process that I was taught to do in spinal rehab. Strictly speaking, I rely on a trained professional to look at me and determine whether my posture is correct, or whether things need adjusting. And this really matters. Postural mispositioning, if uncorrected, leads to pressure ulcers, scoliosis (twisting of the spine) and a host of musculoskeletal deformities.Still, these guys were the professionals, right? The new chair certainly feltweird. But new wheelchairs normally do. I figured I’d just have to get used to it. After all, if things weren’t set up correctly, how was I to know? Surely, they would tell me.Once the chair was apparently set up to the clinical lead’s satisfaction, it was time to head home. Unfortunately, the heavens had opened and I didn’t fancy the 15-minute slog back to the bus stop in the tipping rain. Annoyingly, no taxis were accepting my booking on the various apps I was trying. I asked the desk staff if they could call me a wheelchair-accessible taxi. They said they didn’t have any numbers. I tried the apps a little longer. In the end, I just got wet.Sitting on the bus home, it increasingly felt like something was wrong with the chair. My legs were jutting out at a weird angle, bashing into things when I moved. Breathing felt much harder than it normally did, my diaphragm struggling even more than usual to make up for my emaciated intercostal muscles. Still, I told myself, I’d just have to keep trying. I used to be an athlete; I used to know how to train. Different context, same principle. You have to tolerate the suffering until it becomes easy.A few days later, my private physiotherapist came round to do my weekly rehab session. She took one look and ordered me out of the chair – with strict instructions not to sit in it again until an engineer had been out to make it safe. At present, she said, I was running the risk of getting pressure sores and muscle damage. She hoisted me on to my bed, and spent most of our session writing down the measurements required to adjust the wheelchair to fit my body.If I hadn’t had her, who knows how long I would have spent in a chair that could have landed me back in hospital? It was becoming apparent that – just like everywhere else – in the world of wheelchairs, having a bit of money makes life a hell of a lot easier.In many ways, I am lucky. I was able to keep my job teaching at a university, including a generous year of paid sick leave after the accident. I also had climbing insurance, which meant I got a lump sum payment through the British Mountaineering Council. This wasn’t megabucks, but it helped pay for things such as home adaptations to make my new flat accessible. Also, friends and family clubbed together to raise extra money through GoFundMe, enabling me to buy a high-spec private wheelchair that the NHS would never have agreed to pay for.I still need the NHS one provided by AJM. Kind of like shoes, one needs different wheelchairs for different purposes – especially when they break down (which they do). But because I was lucky to have a bit of money behind me, I was able to get by without using the AJM chair until it was properly set up. Without it, and without my private physio, I might not have had the issues fixed before finding myself back in hospital. Obviously, that wouldn’t have been great for me. But also, not great for taxpayers, given that the going rate for a hospital bed is now about £900 per day.Meanwhile, AJMrecently reportedthat its turnover in the financial year to April 2024 increased significantly, to £36.2m (up 29% from 2023). Profit, after tax, was £5.8m.In last year’sstrategic report, AJM listed “reliance on NHS contracts” as a risk to its financial sustainability. I struggle hard to take such a statement at face value. Because how much of a risk is it, really? As the political commentator Sam Freedman has pointed out in his bookFailed State, a great deal of public service provision in the UK is going wrong because it has been farmed out under the mantra of privatisation, even in cases where privatisation makes no economic sense. Wheelchair services very much fall under this rubric.To see why, consider where privatisation does make sense. Take, for example, contracting a private company to do the cleaning at NHS hospitals. It is straightforwardly the case that a private company can do this more efficiently, and therefore more cheaply, than keeping the operation in-house as part of the sprawling NHS behemoth. But more than that, if a contracted company starts failing to do the cleaning properly, it is easy for the NHS to get an alternative company in, virtually the next day, to do exactly the same job. Competition, here, works. Rival firms have to offer generally competitive prices and services to the NHS, because if they don’t, the NHS can easily go elsewhere. Here is a case where privatisation is good for the taxpayer, and in turn, good for the NHS.Compare this with wheelchair services. Suppose NHS managers somehow became aware of, and dissatisfied with, the performance of AJM in Waltham Forest. It is not like they can just suddenly bring in an alternative wheelchair provider. This is not simply because the NHS is locked into a contract with AJM that would probably prove very costly, even just in legal fees, to get out of. It is also because of the immense difficulty of replacing one wheelchair provider with another.View image in fullscreenPaul Sagar in Nyckelviken crag, Sweden, in 2022.Photograph: Courtesy of Paul Sagar/Shaun HurrellJust think of the immense disruption involved in handing over the confidential details of thousands of disabled people to a different company, while also overseeing a complete change in stock provisions of expensive and complex medical equipment, much of which is now scattered around the local community. AJM may describe reliance on NHS contracts as a “risk”, but to an outside observer it looks more like the safest bet imaginable. Hence, indeed, why a company that employed under 350 people could post nearly £6m in profit last year.The result is a strange situation. Insofar as there really is privatisation, it consists of people like me, with enough money in the bank, bypassing local wheelchair services to ensure they get the medical equipment they need. After all, if I want to go through the NHS, I must use AJM, simply because of where I live. AJM have the contract for Waltham Forest wheelchair service provision, so if like me you’re registered with a GP in this borough, they are the only option (unless you want to pay entirely out of your own pocket, which of course most people can’t afford). Patients find themselves at the mercy of whichever business their local council has employed.The result is an inevitable doom loop. Because when private companies effectively enjoy state-backed local monopolies, and when they are subject to no meaningful competition, they lack any incentives to improve the services they offer, or to provide value for money.This is a situation that no straight-thinking person should be OK with. Well, unless you’reLivingBridge, the private equity firm that owns AJM, I suppose. Last year, it posted £13.4m in operating profit. (“As a national provider, AJM offers excellent value to our NHS partners through our significant procurement economies of scale,” a spokesperson for AJM told the Guardian. “Our NHS contracts are all fixed budget, with clear and measurable KPIs focused on achieving positive outcomes for patients. AJM contracts are all awarded as a result of competitive tendering, following an NHS procurement process which determines both quality and value for money. Our performance is consistently above the national average.”)Afew weeks after AJM finally sent out an engineer to resize my chair, I got a call from the clinical lead. He said that he needed a barcode number from the chair I’d gone home with, which he’d forgotten to note down. Could I please get out of the chair, crouch down on the floor and read out the number off the bottom?I wish I could say I kept my cool. But I was never very good at that, even before my accident. Instead, I raised my voice. I used words I shouldn’t have. Do I regret it? Not really. Because by that point, I knew I wasn’t an outlier.Take a look at the publicly viewableGoogle reviews pagefor AJM Waltham Forest. One comment describesan elderly woman being made to wait more than 19 weeks for a wheelchair. Another is written by a frustrated father whose daughter’s wheelchair is so unsafe that her day centre refuses to take her out in it. The most recent begins: “AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!”It is presumably for reasons like these that theparliamentary ombudsman wrote to AJM in May 2024, raising concerns after a rise in complaints reported by wheelchair users. In October 2025, the government was forced to acknowledge these complaints – though, rather uselessly, it thenadvised those with concernsto contact “the relevant integrated care boards”.The high cost of living in a disabling worldRead moreWhat amuses me about the Google reviews is not their content, but the fact that under most of them someone from AJM has offered a reply. It’s the usual mealy mouthed corporate stuff: “Thank you for taking the time to leave a review”; “We are sorry about your experience”; “We always want to find ways to improve our service”.The reason it amuses me is because after the clinical lead called me up and asked me to get out of my wheelchair, I sent a formal written complaint to AJM Waltham Forest. I never received any reply – not even an acknowledgment of receipt.I later escalated this to the AJM head office, and got the predictable polite fobbing off. (“You have our assurance that [we] have undertaken an internal investigation and managed the matter through the appropriate AJM Healthcare conduct policy and procedure. In accordance with those, staff disciplinary outcomes remain confidential.”) Still, at least they bothered to reply.AJM also sent a short statement in response to the claims in this article. It began: “While we cannot comment on individual cases, we are actively supporting those affected to prevent any further delays or miscommunication.” It continued: “We are proud to exceed NHS averages, with 97.4% of 12,830 Friends and Family Test responses rating our service as good or very good. We also recognise the crucial role wheelchair services play in people’s independence, which is why every case matters and we remain focused on continually improving our performance and communication.”As you’ve probably guessed, by this point I try to have as little to do with AJM as possible. I mostly use the privately bought wheelchair that my friends helped me afford, and rely on the excellent small businessBeyond Mobilityfor help with engineering and maintenance. Still, there’s one thing that continues to bug me.As a quadriplegic, I am at constant risk of developing pressure ulcers. This is more than just an inconvenience. When pressure ulcers go bad, at best they leave a person bedridden for weeks. If the skin breaks down, a sufferer can end up back in hospital needing surgery, followed by months of inpatient recovery. In the worst cases, the surgery doesn’t work and infection from the ulcer penetrates underlying bones, eventually killing the patient. This is what ultimately saw off the actorChristopher Reeve.To try to prevent this, the NHS has prescribed me a special pressure-relieving wheelchair cushion. Due to being utterly paranoid about developing pressure ulcers, I long ago bought one for myself. (A cool £650, since you asked. Yes,fora cushion.) Still, it would be very handy to have a spare. Not least because I sometimes shit myself (the delights of spinal cord injury), and I can’t use the privately bought one when the cover is in the wash.When AJM finally came through with my NHS wheelchair, the cushion I was sent wasn’t right. I asked if the correct make and model could be provided. OK, I was told. That was in October 2024.I called up every so often, to check on its status, and kept being told it was “on order”. Until May this year, when the chap on the phone denied any knowledge, or record, of me ever having ordered any such cushion. After a few days of tense calls, I was once again assured that the right cushion was “on order”.It is now December 2025. I called up again the other day. The pressure-relieving cushion, the one to make sure that I don’t end up back in hospital, costing the NHS yet more money, or potentially even dead?Still on order.An earlierversion of this articleappeared inDispatch.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe best stories take time.From politics to philosophy, personal stories to true crime, discover a selection of the Guardian’s finest longform journalism, in one beautiful edition.

What a cheering thoughtMarina HydeIt’s week two of budget black-hole gate. When will it all end? Probably after the May electionsTue 2 Dec 2025 08.43 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 13.59 ESTShareGood times for Britain when the chancellor is saved by the Office for Budget Responsibility being slightly more inept than her at a single convenient moment. Following the accidental early publication of the fiscal watchdog’s market-sensitive budget document, chair Richard Hughes has nowfallen on his sword. Although it’s possible he meant to fall on his feet but just mistimed it. On Monday we discovered that the OBR’s website is not securely hosted but wasbuilt using WordPress. Oh man. That’s definitely budget, but is it responsible? It may as well just have had a Tumblr.This series of unfortunate events meant the OBR bigwigs were a man down when theyappeared beforethe Treasury select committee this morning, butching out the decision to go to war with Rachel Reeves by releasing their draft economic assessments in the weeks leading up to the budget. Did the chancellor seriouslymislead the countryabout the state of the public finances? That is the£4.2bn question. Are our problems going to turn out to be a whole lot bigger than something that could be addressed with £4.2bn? The answer to that is regrettably too obvious to state.Even so, we must return to the chancellor’s endlessly self-referenced black hole, which seems in fact to have been a multibillion-pound surplus. Astrophysically speaking, there may be precedents for what Reeves did. Back in 2019, some astronomers breathlessly reported the discovery of aMilky Way black holeso massive that it actually contradicted known stellar-evolution theory. Unfortunately, follow-up research revealed the black hole didn’t actually exist at all, and was just an illusory light effect.Quite embarrassing at Big Astronomy’s annual Christmas drinks, no doubt, but obviously much less cosmically excruciating than Reeves’sweirdo press conferencenearly four weeks ago, in which she kept warning she was facing “the world as it is”. It’s possible the chancellor needs to employ a science consultant in the vein of those ones who advise Marvel movies, and make assessments like “if there was a substance you couldn’t touch, it’s my considered and lucrative opinion that Agent Carter could move it using magnetic fields”. Or: “Yeah, a wormhole called the Devil’s Anus could definitely transport Thor and Hulk back to Asgard.” Or: “A black hole of £20bn could simultaneously be a surplus of £4.2bn, and also in no way mark the event horizon of your frontbench career.”And with that, let us take a highly scientific quantum leap to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is also, unsurprisingly, attempting to butch things out. Most recent Labour leaders have had a fundamental/fundamentalist belief in their own moral rectitude. It is one of the rare shared traits to unite Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn, two men who always see the very best in themselves. And there is increasingly no denying that the current PM has grown swiftly into this tradition. “I am proud to have scrapped the two-child limit,” Keir intoned yesterday, in a speech designed to shore up the budget, “proud to have lifted half a million children out of poverty.” Fascinating to hear that Starmer is extremely proud ofdoing somethingthat he last year suspended seven of his MPs for voting for.As indicated, the rolling budget fiasco had coaxed Starmer out of his bunker and into a London community centre on Monday morning, where he offered a bullish defence of the budget to remind the world that if they wanted to bring down his chancellor, they would have to go through him first. An ultimatum to which the prevalent answer among the general public would be: fine, let’s do this. We’re literally free right now.But politicians are more sophisticated and special, aren’t they? Thus Labour malcontents keep briefing that they are waiting for what are widely expected to be disastrous local election results in May before moving against Starmer. This feels like me briefing that I am waiting for the toddler to drop the vase before I remove the vase from the toddler. It’s apparently called being strategic: look it up.So in the absence of anyone having anything in the same galaxy as a plan, we keep being advised to simply accept that Starmer and Reeves come as a package. Yet in truth, they are an odd pairing. Reevespresents herselfas the hapless victim of circumstance who has little free will in any matters at all. “Any chancellor of any party would be standing here today, facing the choices I face … ” Starmer, on the other hand, presents himself as a man of action who can nonetheless deliver a two-and-a-half-thousand-word speech featuring only a handful of verbs.For a man who chides populist opposition politicians for offering “easy answers”, the prime minister doesn’t half rely on some himself. It seems to be different when he does it, though. Not to play the hotshot economist, but anyone can reduce energy bills if they raise the sums people are required to pay in tax. And I’m not saying anyonecould trumpet“our free childcare expansion”, but the Tories could, since the policy of expanding free childcare to 30 hours by this September was, in fact, apledge made in 2023by the previous chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As with many others though, it looks like a reverse ferret could be in the worksTue 2 Dec 2025 11.21 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 14.23 ESTShareI’m not some sort of secret Reform voter, OK? As a Brit (albeit a Brit abroad), I’ve got no problem with rich immigrants coming to the UK and taking all our mansions. I just think they really ought to integrate and not bring their funny foreign ideas with them.Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, I’m talking to you. The California couple arrived in the UK last year, just before Donald Trump won the election. As soon as the votes were in, they declaredthey weren’t goingback, and would stay on the saner side of the Atlantic. I’m not sure how the immigration logistics worked, but it seems “one in, one out” schemes don’t apply to people coming in on big jets, only small boats. The pair bought a fancy pad in the Cotswolds and DeGeneres buttered up the locals during a publicappearancein July by declaring “Everything here is just better.”It’s easy to be upbeat during a British summer, when all is green and pleasant. Now that the winter gloom has set in, however, rumour has it that the fairweather Brits are plotting a return to Trumpland. According to theMail on Sunday(so take all this with a few pinches of salt), the couple miss their friends and can’t stand the thought of another British winter. I understand being homesick, but you lose a bit of street cred if you flee creeping fascism only to run straight back to it because you’re not used to being a bit chilly. As my mother would say: just put on another jumper, Ellen! Abandon your weird American ideas about how the sky ought to be blue.DeGeneres and De Rossi aren’t the only celebs apparently rethinking just how averse they are to living under Trump. Ever since Trump burst on to the political scene, Hollywood has resembled an airport lounge: so many people have been announcing their imminent departures. But few have followed through. In 2016, for example, the comedianAmy Schumertold Newsnight that she would “move to Spain or somewhere” if Trump won the election. She later explained this was “said in jest” and, to be fair, it can be hard to know when Schumer is trying to be funny.Miley Cyrus also pulled out the “just joking” card to explain why her relocation plans changed. In March 2016 she announced she would move if Trump became president,adding:“I don’t say things I don’t mean!”Cyrus later clarifiedthat she does, in fact, say things she doesn’t mean.Barbra Streisand, meanwhile, threatened to leave ahead of both the 2016 and 2024 elections but still doesn’t appear to have made any moves.There are, however, a handful of US celebrities who have actually fled and don’t appear to have any plans to return. In March Courtney Love, who has lived in London since around 2019, said she was planning to get her British citizenship. While this doesn’t seem to be purely because of Trump 2.0, she called the political situation in the US “frightening”.At about the same time, the comedian Rosie O’Donnell revealed that she had relocated her family to Ireland, citing concerns for hernon-binary childClay. “When you know it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” she said in a TikTok video. While it’s easy to make fun of self-deporting celebrities – many of whom are insulated by their wealth from the effects of Trumpism – O’Donnell was probably sensible to leave. The comedian has been in a long-running feud with Trump and, earlier this year, the president said he was consideringstripping her of her US citizenship. He might not be able to do this legally, but when a man with a cult-like following is calling you out in a country with escalating political violence, it’s natural to feel worried for your personal safety.There may not be a massive celebrity exodus yet, but the US does seem to be experiencing a brain drain because of Trump. A poll from the journal Nature foundthat 75% of researchersin the US are considering leaving; international students also seem to be losing interest inventuring stateside. Meanwhile, some experts in authoritarianism see the writing on the wall and are packing their bags. “We Study Fascism, and We’re Leaving the US,” the headline of a video op-edthree Yale professorsmade for the New York Times earlier this year read before they left for Canada. A chilling message indeed. But nothing compared with a damp winter in the Cotswolds.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Assisted dying cannot go ahead until politicians right that wrongTue 2 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 08.30 ESTShareTime is running out to right the wrongs of England and Wales’s assisted dying legislation. TheHouse of Lordsis holding committee sittings, which involve line-by-line examinations of the bill, on 5 and 12 December. Meanwhile, the second stage of the Scottish assisted dying for terminally ill adults bill has recently been completed. In many ways, the Scottish legislation is even more troubling.The shocking revelations from the National Audit Office and Hospice UK in October about theworsening financial crisisfaced by end-of-life care are a sharp reminder of what needs to be changed if we are to be fair to dying people.No one can doubt the sympathy that the bill’s supporters feel for the plight of those struggling with pain and fear at the end of their lives. But the starting point should not be a hastily implemented law to allow doctors to administer death – it should instead be improved end-of-life care.The report revealed that financial shortfalls faced by hospices are growing by the year. Out of 2,000 beds in England,380 are now out of use, removing thousands of days and nights of care every year. Staff at Hospice UK are aware ofat least 20 hospicesthat have recently announced cuts, one of them beingDerbyshire’s Ashgate Hospice, which can now only afford to staffsix out of its 15 inpatient beds. The result is that the number of patients cared for by hospices in the UK –310,000 last year– has plateaued for the first time, and many hospices are now running waiting lists.According to the Commission on Palliative and End-of-Life Care, between 450,000 and 540,000 of the 600,000 people who die each year in the UKwould have benefitedfrom but didn’t receive palliative care, either in a hospice or through hospice care in the community. Although 56% of those with a preferencesaythey would choose to die at home, 43% of deaths take placein hospitals.With its proposed overhaul of thepalliative care system, the government has, to its credit, promised better access to care at home and fewer trips to A&E.But there is a long way to go when, as of today, just half (51%) of those who need it have had specialist palliative care at some point during their final days. And while ministers have recently given£100mtowards adult hospices and£80mfor children’s care, Hospice UK says this has been wiped out by rising staffing costs and by local health authority decisions. Not having proper contracts for the services they provide and with no agreed costs for commissioning palliative care, hospices report having to fall back on the funding they receive from theircharity shops. Nearly 60% of hospices ended their last financial year in deficit, and this year the sector isissuing warningsover longer-term funding.It is the poorest communities that lose most from the patchwork of end-of-life care. More thanone in four peoplewho die between the ages of 20 and 65 are in poverty. Yetevidence from St Christopher’s hospicein south London found poorer communities are less likely to have a hospice service than wealthier ones. As Dr Jamilla Hussain, a palliative care consultant in Bradford, hasalso shown, ethnic minority communities are less likely to access end-of-life care services.If the House of Lords has a purpose that is easily understood by the public, it is bringing expertise, experience and wisdom to a debate that requires sensitivity. For the problem it has to confront is that the most consequential parliamentary bill of our generation – a law that will determine the rights to live and the rights to die – privileges the legal right to assisted dying without guaranteeing anything approaching an equivalent right to quality palliative care for those close to death. The Lords could suggest that the assisted dying law should not be implemented until we have delivered on the excellent recommendations of anend-of-life care reportrecently submitted to the government.And this is the position I would propose be taken by elected MPs, who should make the final decision when, as is inevitable, the amended bill is sent back to them.We are also facing the possibility of a two-tier system in Britain.The Westminster bill includes asix months or lesslife expectancy timeframe as part of the eligibility criteria. The Scottish bill currently does not. The Scottish bill is now much thinner in terms of steps in the process. Whereas the Westminster bill has a multidisciplinary panel (senior lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker), which must issue a certificate of eligibility before assistance is provided, the Scottish bill is entirely doctor-led with no external input. So there is a sharp divide between what Scotland proposes – to allow assisted dying when a condition is reasonably expected to cause premature death, with decisions left to doctors – and what the English bill requires. Because this could lead to people moving between the two territories, there is a case for intensive consultations between the two parliaments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who it was really forAditya ChakraborttyLabour backbenchers have been cheering it as a win for the most vulnerable in society. In fact it was aimed at the bond marketsTue 2 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 11.16 ESTShareThe charge is a grave one: that Rachel Reeves has just lied to Britons, spooking them into paying billions in extra taxes that she can splash out on higher benefits. However hyperbolic, this isn’t the usual Westminster sparring; this time, someone might get hurt. A week ago, critics of Reeves and Keir Starmer were, rightly, calling their budget “chaotic”. Today, it’s denounced as lies, and Kemi Badenoch is demanding the chancellor quit.It’s an accusation that demands straightforward answers, so let me give mine. Did the chancellor tell lies? On the available evidence, no. There were no whoppers, no falsehoods, no porkies. But despite Starmer’s comments yesterday, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to see here and we can all move along. Reeves did mislead the public about the factors shaping her decisions. Was it all to funnel cash to “benefits street”, as the Tories claim? No, and the figures prove it.Reeves has sustained another hit to her reputation but, if facts still have anything to do with politics, Badenoch should call off her lynch mob. Perhapsthe resignationyesterday of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) chief, Richard Hughes, over the leak of its own documents will quench SW1’s thirst for blood.Yet the real tale is far stranger than the headlines suggest, and stretches wider and further than the careers of Starmer and the class of ’24. At its heart, this is a story about how much say you and I get in the running of our own country. And it should worry you.First, to brass tacks. When the OBRpublishedlast Friday some of the forecasts it shared with Reeves as she wrote the red book, the shock was immediate. Not only had the OBR never done such a thing before (an “unusual step” as the watchdog wryly said), its numbers apparently contradicted the chancellor’s words. Even as leaks from Westminster were about how bleak the budget would have to be, the OBR’s own predictions were improving.Take the government’s most “iron-clad” rule, that by 2030 daily spending on hospitals and schools and the rest would be wholly funded by taxes: at the end of October, the watchdog reckoned it would just about be met, albeit by a tiny margin.A few days later, Reevesgave a press conferenceso extraordinary it forced breakfast TV to break from its usual fare. Weeks before the actual budget, the country was put on alert: taxes were going up, and the main reason was gloomy numbers from the OBR, in particular its finding that the UK was less productive, putting more into its economy but getting less out.And lo! It came to pass. Despite what Telegraph editorials and Tory broadcast rounds implied over the weekend, this is essentially what happened at the budget, which was big and painful and bleak.Where Reeves misled us was her alibi, because those OBR forecasts didn’t force her hand. She could have made other choices; she could have given other reasons, including on budget day itself. Before last year’s election,Starmer promisedexactly such people power. “The hope of democracy. The power of the vote. The potential for national renewal.”A year on, and it’s powerlessness that jumps out from Reeves’s breakfast speech. Our first Labour chancellor in 15 yearscasts herselfas an apolitical figure buffeted by forces beyond her control: “In the context of the long-term challenges on our productivity … any chancellor of any party would be standing here today, facing the choices that I face.”She did make a choice, just not oneLabourcares to broadcast. From April 2029 British workers and businesses will be paying another £26bn a year in tax – and most of that will not be spent on better hospitals or new libraries or happier lives. Whatever bilge comes from Nigel Farage, Badenoch and others, it isn’t getting splashed on “benefits street”.Rather than being spent, more than 50% of the extra cash will instead give Reeves a buffer against her own fiscal rules. About 25% goes on paying for the government’s own U-turns. Examiningthe OBR’s calculationsand being as generous as possible to a Labour chancellor, only 17% of the taxes will go on actual new spending, such as scrapping the two-child cap on child benefit. Its abolition “costs” the Treasury a mere £2.5bn, because it was always a bit of theatrical cruelty by George Osborne. A Labour government could and should have binned it in its first 100 days (although everyone was of course very busy with Sue Gray).The Tories, Reform and the entire Blue Pravda have spent days barking about how Reeves fits the stereotype of Labour chancellors, soaking strivers to spend on shirkers. Labour backbenchers have been cheering her budget as balm for their troubled consciences, protecting the most vulnerable. Both sides are 180-degrees wrong: Reeves’s budget was largely aimed at asset managers, hedge funds and the others in the bond markets.Downing Street can make a strong case for itself. The margins forecast by the OBR were too small for comfort, especially considering bond investors charge the UKthe highest interest rateof all G7 rich countries – higher than France, which lost a prime minister in October, higher than Japan which has way more debt. Coupled with our measures to hold down fuel bills, prescription charges and train fares, Starmer and Reeves can say, this budget allows the Bank of England to cut its key lending rate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As one independent adviser to Downing Street says, Reeves has “weaponised” the bond market as an instrument of discipline against her own party and the voters. It’s the reason the chancellor can’t resign, no matter what promises she breaks. It’s the reason Labour MPs will have to knuckle down and vote to take billions off social security, as Starmer promised yesterday.What’s missing from this is any sense of statecraft, of mobilising the Treasury and the Bank to reach a new accommodation with markets. Also absent is any intuitive knowledge of voters, who were promised change. However hard the kicking given to Rishi Sunak last summer, one facet of the budget – from income-tax thresholds to the overall tax burden to our dependence on the kindness of strangers to finance our borrowing – is how far the UK remains stuck on the same sinking trajectory he set out in the wake of Brexit and Covid. Britain clings on to an exhausted 40-year-old economic model, to which it makes odd small adjustments in the hope they will change things. But they don’t. Performing a Thatcherite raindance (à la Truss) didn’t alter course; acting like grown-ups and repeating the phrase “world-leading” hasn’t helped.When working-class Americans turned out to vote last year, many said they were protesting against “the uniparty”: . However unfair the term, one understood its significance: the calcified consensus that meant Democrats and moderate Republicans couldn’t respond to their needs. Just over a year into the first Labour government since 2010, the British are being shown their own uniparty: a Westminster class too removed from voters to represent them, focused instead on court politics and presenting data centres for AI as golden investment. In the US, the uniparty got beaten by Donald Trump. What replaces the British version?

The Home Office’s latest actions show little has changed. After the devastation of Hurricane Melissa, a tropical cyclone that made landfall across the Greater Antilles area in late October, eight-year-old Lati-Yana Stephanie Brown wasleft destitutein Jamaica. But after her UK-resident parents appealed for the Home Office to expedite her visa application, officials rejected it and Lati-Yana has been left to sleep on the floor of her elderly grandmother’s destroyed home.But the rejection rested on factual errors, according to Lati-Yana’s mother, Kerrian Bigby. Dawn Butler, her MP, shared a letter with me raising concerns about “misrepresentations” in the decision notice, including the claim that Bigby does not have full parental responsibility for the child, which she says is false.The Home Office doubling down on this decision rather than acting on a humanitarian emergency speaks to a broader truth: Britain’s immigration system routinely separates children from their parents with little regard for the devastating consequences this brings.This is not an isolated bureaucratic blip. It reflects a long historical continuum in Britain’streatment of Caribbean families.Family separation was built into the slavery plantation system: children were sold away, transferred or used as leverage against their parents. Britain spent centuries extracting wealth from theCaribbean, then walked away after abolition without rebuilding the economies it had gutted or paying reparations to the formerly enslaved. Instead, it compensated the slave owners for their “loss of property”.The result was an underdeveloped region where work was scarce, wages were low and opportunities for the Black majority were limited – which is why people such as my grandparents migrated to Britain in the first place. When they arrived in postwar Britain, expats and migrants were met with low wages, overcrowded housing and racist landlords. There was no affordable childcare, and many believed they would stay only a few years, save money and return home. Bringing children over immediately was often impossible. By the time many parents were finally ready to “send for” them, Britain had tightened its borders.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the Jamaican High Commission in London demand that Jamaica stops cooperating with deportation flights, on 3 February 2020.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesThe 1971 Immigration Actmade it far harderfor Commonwealth citizens to enter, let alone settle, and families scrambled to reunite before the door slammed shut. My father and aunt were among the thousands of children left behind in the Caribbean and the intergenerational scars left by that separation still shape families, including mine, today.The children left behind came to be known as “barrel children”,raised at a distance, sustained by love, remittances and parcels, yet carrying the emotional weight of separation.The emotional and psychological fallout is unmistakable; in my dad’s case, he never quite came to terms with being separated from his parents and being displaced thereafter; it affected him until his premature death, at the age of 49.The tragedy is that in Lati-Yana’s case, you can see how this fallout is still being passed down through generations. Like Lati-Yana, many Caribbean-born children are being raised away from their parents because immigration policy in countries such as Britain makes the prospect of reunification difficult.During the Windrush scandal, ministers repeatedly apologised and framed the harm caused to Caribbean families asunintentional. Yet Home Office policy continues to inflict harm by design. And when Caribbean communities are disproportionately disadvantaged – in mental health, education, family structure or health outcomes – Britain pretends not to understand the roots of that instability.What is happening to Lati-Yana is the latest echo of this devastating pattern of family fragmentation and the perpetuation of intergenerational trauma across the Caribbean diaspora. A mother migrates to Britain in search of stability. A child is left in temporary care with a plan for reunion. Disaster hits. Britain’s immigration system responds with suspicionand delay. Rinse, repeat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What makes this case especially stark is that Caribbean diaspora groups have been urging Britain to temporarily relax visa rules for vulnerable Jamaicans affected by the hurricane, as many children, and elderly and sick people, are struggling in the region.Jamaica is thought to be theonly countrywhere King Charles is head of state whose citizens still require a visa to enter the UK. It’s a striking contradiction in this so-called “special relationship”, especially now that UK MPs arecalling for flexibility.In recent reporting, I revealed that campaigners have beenpushing for emergency visa measuresafter Hurricane Melissa and that the Jamaican high commissioner hasraised the issuewith the Foreign Office. Unicef has launchedan appealto help an estimated 1.6 million children in the region get access to essentials, while White Ribbon Alliance UK iscalling for helpfor mothers and babiesIf the Home Office wants to show it has moved on from the cruelty of the past, it can start by righting its wrongs, acknowledging the urgency of the situation and reuniting this family now.

I think my original plan was that some of the draws could contain something other than chocolate, not because I’m the kind of almond mum who won’t let anyone eat sweets before breakfast, but because their dad and I are separated and have them half the time each, so it wasn’t unusual for them to wake up and have six Lindt chocolate balls to chomp through before they’d opened their curtains.The tiny drawers are a curse. Some years I could only find stuff for one of the kids (erasers in the shape of hedgehogs; lip balm); other years, a different one was in luck (Lego Yodas; magnets). It was never, ever fair. One year, I found tons of different batteries for the drawers, and I thought it was the most genius thing I’d ever done, but they said: “How is this a fun gift? If we needed a battery, we’d just go to the kitchen drawer, which is supposed to have batteries in it.” I realised in about 2019 that I’d just have to start planning earlier, around July, if I wanted to strike the perfect balance of parity, festivity and usefulness, and that was a good year, actually. I found some tiny business cards with swear words on them that they could just leave around the house, and ear-splitting whistles and unisex lip balm. We have enough erasers and pencil sharpeners now to last until nobody ever makes a mistake because the written word is just a memory.Then, wham, this year it happened: I forgot. One minute it was November and all about the fireworks. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be December next. Whatever goes in those drawers now, it’ll have to be so good, and so surprising, and so unprecedented to make up for this. I’m going to need 72 reptile eggs.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChristmasOpinionChildrenFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

The reaction was compounded when it emerged that Wayne Couzens, who is serving a whole-life term in prison, had previously committedsexual offences that the police had ignored.In her latest report on these events, Lady Angiolini frames sexually motivated crimes against women in public places as a “whole-society problem”. She exposes ashocking lack of actionon earlier recommendations and reveals that basic facts, such as how many women each year are sexually assaulted or raped in public in England or Wales, are not in any single dataset.The report recommends a national rollout of Project Vigilant, which protects women in the night-time economy, and Operation Soteria, which raises standards in rape and sexual assault investigations. Alongside a “clear-sighted and unrelenting” focus on predators, it rightly highlights early intervention and prevention, including education work with boys. Other recommendations include a clearer focus on women’s safety in planning rules and a call for ministers to respond more fully to theindependent review on pornography.Detailed recommendations on police recruitment, culture and policy will come later, as will findings about David Carrick, the former police officerconvicted of 50 rapes. But police chiefs and the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, must set out their responses to what has been uncovered so far. While Couzens and Carrick are in prison, we already know ofgrave shortcomingsin the way that complaints against both men were handled by colleagues. While individuals must be held accountable whenever possible, systems and policies also need to change.The deadly consequences of policing’s culture of impunity are also made clear ina new report on the Hillsborough disaster. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found that 12 officers would have faced disciplinary cases of gross misconduct if they had not retired or died. Those named include Peter Wright, who was chief constable of South Yorkshire police in 1989 and responsible for fans’ safety, and officers who worked for the West Midlands force that failed to investigate properly the police’s role in the deaths of 97 people and the cover-up that followed.While the 14 years taken by the IOPC to produce its report is hard to understand, by far the most damaging delay was in thetwo decadesafter the disaster. In the end it took the non-legal process known as the Hillsborough Independent Panel to get to the truth about police lies. The latest findings provide further backing for thenew duty of candourbeing placed on public servants. Had this been in place at the time, police officers could have been penalised for not being open and honest. But while this vindication of their efforts has been welcomed by campaigners, it does not dispel their fury that not a single one of the officers involved has been convicted of a criminal offence, or faced disciplinary proceedings when they were serving.What these two reports, issued on the same day, make brutally obvious is that the culture as well as laws governing policing must be overhauled. Accountability must become a guiding principle. It should not be up to traumatised families to ensure that deaths like those of the Hillsborough victims andSarah Everardcan never happen again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The country needs investment, not the hollowing out of justiceTue 2 Dec 2025 13.38 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTShareCan Labour save a failing system by hollowing out its safeguards? David Lammy, the justice secretary, thinks so. Under hisproposals, jury trials in England and Wales will be effectively halved. Currently, defendants charged with “either-way” offences have the right to choose whether to be tried by magistrates or a jury. But Mr Lammy wants any case where the likely sentence is less than three years – everything from sexual offences to theft to violence to narco-crime – to be judge-only. This is the most sweeping change to criminal justice in modern British history. Only the gravest crimes – such as murder and rape – will retain lay participation.Mr Lammy once said juriesfilterprejudice. He shouldrethinkplans to strip away ancient rights without evidence they will speed up justice. Jury trials account for less than 3% of all criminal cases. They are not what clogs the system. Sir Brian Leveson, whosereviewMr Lammy cites as inspiration, did not recommend a blanket scrapping of defendants’ right to opt for a jury. He did not suggest using speculative sentence predictions to determine the mode of trial. He did not propose removing lay participation from “either-way” trials. He did not call for expanding magistrates’ sentencing powers to two years, nor for judge-only trials across whole categories of crime.Instead, Sir Brianproposedthat for most “either-way” offences a judge would sit with two magistrates – a change that would retain the lay element for fairness but speed up trials. That protection is what Mr Lammy wants gone. As the former lord chief justiceLord Thomas told the BBC, removing lay input is “the most controversial and serious aspect of the reforms proposed”. It strips away ordinary citizens’ involvement in deciding guilt – a right that has survived monarchs and wars, but apparently not Mr Lammy’s inability to stand up to the Treasury.The justice secretary said that the system was at breaking point with a backlog of78,000 crown court cases, some listed into the next decade. This is not the fault of juries, but was caused by a decade of cuts. Mr Lammy thinks that magistrates can take up the slack – and there’s something in that – but they already face361,000 pending cases. The delays in justice are down to courts being closed while staff and judges have not been replaced.Digital forensicscollapsed under the weight of modern evidence. Legal aid wasgutted, driving barristers from the profession. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was starved of resources.A serious plan to rebuild justice would reopen courts and recruit judges. Legal aid needs to be rebuilt, as does the CPS. There needs to be investment to repair what austerity destroyed. But Mr Lammy’splansare for fewer juries, more magistrates and longer sentences. Prisons are already bursting at the seams and real-terms day-to-day spending by theMinistry of Justicethis year is 14% lower than in 2008.The rightwingplaybookis to first defund the public realm. Once it collapses, politicians declare it inefficient and replace safeguards with “managerial efficiency”. The goal is to shrink the state’s obligations permanently. Removing jury trials for offences under three years opens the door to raising that limit to five. A party founded to expand democratic participation may destroy one of its oldest privileges. In surrendering to such dismal logic, Mr Lammy risks not only weakening the justice system but forfeiting Labour’s own moral inheritance.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters from other readers on how being bullied at school affected them their whole lifeTue 2 Dec 2025 12.36 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 14.23 ESTSharePeter Ettedgui’s account of the antisemitic taunts he endured as a teenager (Don’t believe Nigel Farage’s denials. He targeted me for being Jewish – and it hurt, 25 November) reminded me of a simple truth about bullying: the bullied remember far more clearly than the bullies ever do. That’s how trauma works. The moment lodges for one person, yet barely registers for the other. So yes, forgetting is plausible. But failing to apologise when you’re reminded is revealing. “Sorry” is a measure of character or, at the very least, the mark of basic human decency.Earlier this year, I came across someone who had bullied me at school. I’d had a drop or two, so I asked if he remembered reducing me to tears. He didn’t – why would he? But he did manage: “If I did that, I’m really sorry.” And that mattered. It closed a circle I hadn’t realised was still open. A small word, offered without defensiveness, made all the difference.This is why arguments about “banter”, memory or the passage of time ring so hollow. What matters now is whether an adult can acknowledge harm, show contrition and take responsibility. When a public figure responds instead with denial, minimisation and accusations of dishonesty, the missing “sorry” speaks volumes. We should listen to what it tells us.Anthony RichardsLondonNigel Faragequestions the memory of Peter Ettedgui regarding antisemitic and racist comments in the 1970s. I can remember exactly where I was, who I was with and what we were doing when my friend and I (both 13 and overweight at the time) were told: “You two must eat a lot of chips.” This was in 1976.Ours was a direct grant girls’ convent. Bullying by pupils and staff was common. My memory is crystal clear, and that foul, denigrating comment has travelled with me throughout life, despite losing weight and wearing a size 10 since 1977. Sorry, Nigel Farage, but people do not forget.Kirsty PierceWhaley Bridge, DerbyshireNo, Mr Farage. We do not forget upsetting events at school. I am 80, but cannot forget the insults that I got at school because of my facial appearance. They hurt then, and have shaped my life since. Like Peter Ettedgui, I have not spoken out since those days, but I am now.Barry NevilleWokingham, BerkshireNigel Farage says “I can tell you categorically that I did not say the things that have been published in the Guardian” (Three more ex-pupils at school with Nigel Farage reject ‘banter’ claims, 25 November), yet he claims that this happened so long ago that people could not possibly remember such experiences. Who is more likely to misremember these attacks: the person who thinks it’s just banter or the traumatised person on the receiving end?Keith MasonLondonIn the mid to late 1970s, I attended a private school in Hull for my secondary schooling. As a Jewish child, I was subjected to daily taunts similar to those used by Nigel Farage for the whole of my time there. It was “the language of the time”, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt deeply. It led to me leaving the school at 16, which affected my education. I carried the hurt and shame for years and I can attest to the fact that it is possible to remember those taunts as if they happened yesterday.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageRaceAntisemitismlettersShareReuse this content"

Well, we don’t – and never have. What those of us in liberal artsdotry to encourage are ways of thinking that cross boundaries: bringing together ideas and methods from wherever they’re useful, whether that’s the sciences, the social sciences or the humanities. And this isn’t some modern reinvention. From the start, a liberal education paired logic, grammar, rhetoric and music with geometry, maths and astronomy.The subjects may look different today, but the underlying attitude hasn’t really changed. The problems we face now, as well as the ones coming down the tracks tomorrow, simply don’t fit neatly into single disciplines. Good critical thinking depends on drawing from as many perspectives as possible. Criticising the liberal arts by taking its name too literally misses what it’s actually trying to do.Dr William RuppHead of liberal arts, University of WarwickThe suggestion that liberal arts educators should acknowledge that they don’t have a “monopoly on cultivating critical thinking” contains a misconception at its heart – ironically one that was immediately obvious to someone with a liberal arts degree.Critical thinking isn’t about logic or problem-solving, it’s about the ability to critically interrogate information, including looking for hidden meanings, thinking as much about what you’re not being told as what you are, and always considering context, motive and other factors that might affect the veracity and intent of what you’re being told. Globally, that seems more important now than ever.Kat Harrison-DibbitsHorwich, Greater ManchesterJianyang Geng’s letter demonstrates why the liberal arts are vital and deserve support. When Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is replaced by Steam – integrating arts into Stem disciplines – evidence shows that the benefits include enhanced creativity, design skills and creative planning. Other benefits include an entry point to Stem for underrepresented groups, and the development of the holistic viewpoint, emotional intelligence and communication skills vital to leadership in avolatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous(Vuca) world, which Stem subjects alone do not. They also touch the human spirit and provide hope. Jianyang Geng presents a theology in which the market is God. The liberal arts teach us to set our sights higher, to the benefit of the planet, and the human race.Sara LodgeConwyMay I, as one who has studied, researched and worked professionally in both science and the arts, assure Jianyang Geng that the most assured way to broaden one’s horizons of thought, wisdom, insight, empathy, and the need to quantify the values or otherwise of scientific and technical changes, is a grounding in the arts, philosophy and humanities, these being the means to see every person’s need for respect, self-awareness and status of the best sort. Science is an invaluable materialistic discipline that I value and cherish. But literature, painting, music, philosophy, logic, drama, religions and performance have taught me, I hope, immeasurably more than strict science ever could. I owe everything to my teachers and fellow listeners.Dr Ian FlintoffPhD, BSc, BAFormer member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatreand the cast of Coronation StreetYour letters pages on 25 November contained two submissions that merit from reading in tandem. One laments the “worship” of the liberal arts, suggesting, instead, a more applied and transactional approach to teaching non-Stem subjects.The other laments the use of generative AI toolsin preparing teaching materials – a heartfelt lament from a young academic who imagines their future role being replaced by software tools.The underlying ethos behind both is, I fear, a reflection of the more transactional approach that higher education has been forced to adopt in recent years – stemming from a viewpoint that sees value only in terms of economic return, and has little respect to learning for its own sake.Most universities question this approach (the value of promoting critical thinking in all disciplines) and recognise that the engagement of enquiring minds in the entire spectrum of human knowledge, based on individual engagement and enlivening discourse, is where higher education comes alive.Phil CardewDeputy vice-chancellor (academic), Leeds Beckett UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Under the floodlights of this storied old ground you were welcome to take your pick. The inevitable Erling Haaland smashed through the 100-goal barrier and a Premier League record. Phil Foden scored hissecond double in four days. City raced to a 5-1 lead before an hour was even on the clock only for Fulham to come agonisingly close to parity by the end. All of that resulted in the seventh highest-scoring match in three ­decades of the Premier League. Not bad.The pendulum swung throughout the contest in movements big and small. City set off with gusto and looked to have sealed the result with two short spells of dominance before and after half-time. But Fulham had more shots and more possession and were in charge of the match from the moment Alex Iwobi calmly scored their second 12 minutes into the second half. City have the points on the board in theirongoing pursuit of Arsenal, they could not disguise defensive vulnerabilities. Fulham, meanwhile, were unable to halt a run of defeats against City that now runs to an astonishing 19, but yet showed they could compete with anyone.Manchester City’s win at Fulham ‘impossible’ to enjoy, says GuardiolaRead moreThere were signs this match might prove exceptional within the first five minutes, when Haaland conspired to miss a one-on-one. Played in by Foden, he wrapped a shot beyond Bernd Leno but watched stunned as the ball hit the post and ran across the face of goal. Was this a bad omen for the Norwegian, who had been sitting on 99 goals in the English top flight for all of two games? It turned out not: 12 minutes later he opened the scoring, ­punching the ball through a sprawling Leno after Tijjani Reijnders had dummied a Jérémy Doku cross.A calm celebration followed, arms quietly aloft, but it was quite the achievement. Despite the 180‑minute wait Haaland had become the fastest player to register aPremier Leaguecentury and by some distance. Alan Shearer, the previous record holder, required 124 games to reach the milestone, Harry Kane 141. Haaland had done it in just 111.The travelling City fans, who were in good voice, belted out the name of their No 9 and Haaland soon produced another decisive moment for his team. With 37 minutes on the clock and Rúben Dias on the ball on the halfway line, he dropped deep from his customary hunting ground, and sent his marker Joachim Andersen for a loop. Spinning past the Dane as he tried to close ground, Haaland prodded a pass into the vacated space where Reijnders ran on to scoop the ball over Leno and double the lead.Two then became three when Leno opted to punch clear a corner he could have caught and the ball dropped into Foden territory on the right-hand side of the box. Hot on the heels of his exploits against Leeds, the England man was in total control of matters as he took a touch and bent a beautiful left-foot effort inside the far post. Even then, the half still was not over asFulhamgave themselves a modicum of hope when Emile Smith Rowe looped a diving header over Gianluigi Donnarumma from a sweet Harry Wilson cross.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland shows his delight after becoming the fastest player to score 100 Premier League goals.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat hope endured the length of the half-time break, and another 120 seconds or so, then City once again pulled away. They scored their fourth in the 48th minute, a three-man break still enough to cut Fulham open with Doku’s cross finding Foden via ­Haaland’s back-heel and the midfielder finishing calmly. Six minutes later City made it five; Doku robbed Andersen on the edge of the penalty area and his shot took a big deflection off Sander Berge and in past Leno.That would surely be that. But Fulham never looked cowed and when the dependable Iwobi ­sidefooted home from the edge of the box after City failed to clear a Wilson cross, there was a sudden change in atmosphere. The crowd led the shift, roaring the team on with an almost perverse sense of encouragement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first was drilled home from the edge of the box but took the video assistant referee an age to confirm. The second came after Donnarumma delivered his own weak punch from a corner, Chukwueze drilling it back past the Italian with interest.When the assistant referee flashed eight minutes of added time, it felt like the most chaotic of draws was almost inevitable. And when the sprightly Josh King received the ball in the box, shifted and got a low shot off, it felt like the moment had arrived.But Josko Gvardiol scooped the ball clear while on his heels, the whistle blew shortly afterwards, and whatever magic had descended on south-west London was dispersed into the night, along with an enraptured crowd.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They are still doing some treatment on the grass,” the England manager, Sarina Wiegman, joked. “It was very special for her, having everyone around her.”It was a full-circle moment, the Winchester-born Southampton academy graduate returned to the ground of the club that nurtured her to score England’s opener in the 2-0 win less than five months after she left the south-coast side to take the next step in her exciting career.If there is a highlight to pick out from England’s “Homecoming Series”, their four friendlies to see out 2025 after thatphenomenal European title defencein the summer, it is the emergence of Kendall from the relatively anonymity of the under‑23s team into the senior spotlight.Her rise has been so rapid that England’s ever‑present Lucy Bronze admitted she had not known who Kendall was when asked about the joy and energy she gets from the young players who make the step up to the senior side. “It’s been really fun,” the right‑back said, afterEngland’s 8-0 defeat of Chinaon Saturday.“Lucia is a great example. To be honest with you, I didn’t know who she was at the start of the season and she’s got a huge future ahead of her. I think she’s one of England’s stars in the future.”Wiegman was effusive in her praise of the dynamic 21-year-old. “Things have happened so quickly but she just keeps up her levels and shows she is a good player and that is impressive,” she said.Kendall’s emergence is a testament to an under-23 side that Wiegman was keen to see relaunched in 2021 in order to better prepare players for the jump to the senior team. She was one of seven changes the manager made to the lineup that started against China.View image in fullscreenLucia Kendall opens the scoring for England.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockGhana presented a different challenge to the Lionesses than the one posed by China. The scoreline may not have been as flattering, but England were rampant in their first meeting with the African side, dominating possession, accruing 24 shots to Ghana’s three and 10 on target to Ghana’s one. The only thing missing was the end product, Wiegman’s charges denied by the woodwork four times.That failure to be clinical could be partly attributed to bad luck, but also to the presence of a starting XI that had not played much football together. However, you only build those connections through minutes on the pitch to complement the work on the training ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following a VAR check, a penalty was awarded and Russo – the newly crowned Football Supporters’ Association women’s player of the year – converted. The home crowd of 20,252 celebrated wildly, their patient wait for a second goal after the promise offered by the early opener having been rewarded. The only lowlight was an injury which forced the withdrawal of Kelly.England end 2025 with two wins, rotation, and lots to think about. The emerging talent from the under-23s adds excitement and competitiveness 18 months out from the 2027 World Cup.Meanwhile the solo bidto host the 2035 World Cup– with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – has been submitted to Fifa, giving the next generation of girls up and down the country hope of emulating Kendall, Aggie Beever‑Jones, Maya Le Tissier and more.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Our ability to react to setbacks was great. At first we suffered but, after that, we were brave on the ball and calm going forward.”As Brentford’s manager, Frank prided himself on achieving a decent work life balance. Back then he managed eight hours sleep a night, five exercise sessions a week, regular downtime with his beloved Wilbur Smith novels and relaxing family holidays.Judging by the technical area evidence a few months at Spurs have left him looking in urgent need of a destressing spa break.Frank’s increasingly animated touchline gesticulations and manic first-half gum chewing came freighted with evident tension, particularly when Romero was booked for fouling Joelinton.At least the latterly much criticised Guglielmo Vicario played well following recent mistakes. Frank, creditably, insisted he would not drop Vicarioin the face of hefty criticismfrom fans and, perhaps taking the hint, the travelling supporters perched high in the Leazes End dutifully sang the goalkeeper’s name on repeat after Vicario saved a Lewis Miley shot.Newcastle were, as is invariably the case here, pressing high and hard. At times Spurs looked in peril of being blown away by so much home aggression and, presumably in damage‑limitation mode, attempted to counter Newcastle with a fairly direct approach rather than risk too much fancy footwork playing out from the back.View image in fullscreenCristian Romero races away in delight after his unlikely double.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PABoth teams ceded possession too cheaply, though, and Frank winced when Mohammed Kudus attempted a spot of ball juggling in his own half.No matter, Tottenham’s hopes of improving on a woeful record of one point from their previous fourPremier Leaguematches and averting a fourth successive defeat in all competitions were enhanced when Lucas Bergvall met Kudus’s low cross and attempted an audacious back‑heel flick that arced just over the bar.Although Joelinton was unfortunate to see a shot rebound off a post, Spurs had improved and Howe could not have failed to notice that his suddenly flat side had looked rather burned out – mentally more than physically – as the interval approached.The trouble with Howe’s, albeit hugely exhilarating, heavy metal style is that it is near impossible to sustain for too long and the irrepressible version of Newcastle seencantering to victory at Evertonlast Saturday had gone missing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His goal began with Gordon accelerating down the left and removing Pedro Porro and Romero from the defensive equation before crossing low for Woltemade.

When Newcastle failed to properly clear a corner Kudus outwitted Lewis Hall and crossed for the captain to head Spurs level.Chaos ensued. First, a penalty area wrestling match involving Dan Burn and Rodrigo Bentancur concluded with a video assistant referee review deciding Burn had been fouled. “It was never a penalty,” Frank said. “It was a mistake by VAR.”As Gordon made no mistake from the penalty spot, Spurs looked beaten – but Romero had very different ideas.When Ramsdale punched a corner, the captain’s spectacular overhead kick flew into the back of the net. “It was a beautiful goal,” Romero said. “But every day with the national team, I watch Leo Messi.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Each tournament since 2003 has included 20 competing nations, and the previous format moved straight from the pool stage to the quarter-finals. There will be a total of 52 matches in 2027, up from 48.How will 24 teams change the format?Instead of four pools of five there are six pools of four. The eventual winners will still be obliged to play seven matches to claim the trophy, but will play one pool match fewer, before the last-16 game for a place in the last eight. The top two in the six pools qualify for the knockouts, plus the four best third-placed teams.What decides who ends up in which pool?Teams are split into four bands dependent on their world ranking in the draw that takes place at 9am UK time on Wednesday. As hosts, Australia are automatically assigned to Pool A, and will play in the opening game at Perth Stadium, but everything else is up for grabs.What can hosts Australia expect?The Wallabies had a final chance to climb the rankings last month in the autumn internationals: but a winless trip to Europe for Joe Schmidt’s side confirmed their Band 2 status with Scotland, Fiji, Italy, Wales and Japan. The hosts, therefore, are destined to face a powerful Band 1 nation in their pool: one of South Africa, New Zealand, England, Ireland, France or Argentina. Andy Farrell’s Ireland have fallen from second to fourth this year, while England’s 11-match winning streak has seen them climb from seventh to third.What about Scotland and Wales?Scotland’s dramatic recent defeat by the Pumasended any hope they had of reaching Band 1, while Wales clung on in Band 2 despite losing three out of four autumn internationals, including a 73-0 thrashing by the Springboks last Saturday.A late 24-23 win against Japanin Cardiff on 15 November crucially removed any danger of Wales dropping into Band 3 for the draw and the prospect of a far harder pool.Any dark horses in Bands 3 and 4?Band 3 consists of Georgia, Uruguay, Spain, USA, Chile and Tonga, with Samoa, Portugal, Romania, debutants Hong Kong China, Zimbabwe and Canada in Band 4. Georgia will be the team to avoid in Band 3, ranked 13th, and 14th-ranked Uruguay are traditionally tough opponents, while their South American rivals Chile return after their debut in 2023. One of the most compelling subplots is the potential for Samoa, in Band 4 having squeaked through qualifying – being drawn against Steve Borthwick’s England, which would open the possibility of Manu Tuilagi lining up against his former team.Tuilagi, now playing for Bayonne, will qualify for Samoa early in 2027. Also in Band 4, Portugal’s reappearance will be eagerly anticipatedafter they lit up the 2023 tournamentin France, beating Fiji in dramatic style and drawing with Georgia.View image in fullscreenPortugal's Rodrigo Marta scores their third try against Fiji in 2023.Photograph: Stéphanie Lecocq/ReutersIs the draw potentially unfair to some pool winners in the last 16?There are a few wider intricacies to consider. The winners of pools A, B, C and D will meet a third-place team in the round of 16, while the winners of pools E and F will play a side that finished second in their pool. “While on the surface that may seem slightly unfair, that imbalance is addressed in the next round,”World Rugby states. “The team that wins Pool A will face a third-place team in the Round of 16, but in the quarter-finals could potentially meet the winner of Pool B if that team wins their round of 16 match.” The winners of Pool E and Pool F will, in theory, have a harder task in the last 16, but cannot face a pool winner until the semi-finals.Will the draw change the favourites to win the World Cup?The dominant form of South Africa, winners of the past two men’s tournaments, makes them strongly fancied to win a third straight title although Borthwick’s England, if they continue on an upward curve, will be confident of a deep run. Much will change between now and 2027 but the favourites can start planning in earnest once the draw is made.Explore more on these topicsRugby World CupRugby unionexplainersShareReuse this content"

For English cricket fans of the late 80s and early 90s, it was a nudge in the ribs that, underneath the pastings, the dismal collapses and Rentaghost selections, the national team would fight another day.Smith’s cut, alongside a David Gower cover drive, gave hope where there was little left in the bucket. Those famous forearms – half oak, half baobab – the white shirt unbuttoned past the clavicle, the chain glinting through his chest hair, smelt enticingly like bravery, and old spice and one last throw of the dice.‘He was a batter ahead of his time’: Robin Smith, former England cricketer, dies aged 62Read moreThe sight of Smith marching out to bat – as an opener (in four Tests), No 3 (six), No 4 (30), No 5 (19), No 6 (14) or No 7 (twice) – those charmingly indecisive selectors never could quite place him – was a high point in a largely post-Botham era, a clear-the-bars alarm for those in the ground and a stay‑your‑ground sign to those on the sofa.Like fellow South Africans Tony Greig and Allan Lamb before him and Kevin Pietersen after him, Smith was bigger and better and more sexy than his Test average – which, incidentally, was a healthy 43.67 – second only to Graham Gooch among English batters during the period of his Test career. He was utterly fearless in the face of extreme pace, beyond any expectation, as fast bowlers reared up at meeting their match and came harder.Watch the highlights of him batting against Ian Bishop at Edgbaston in 1995, just six months before he played his final Test. Bishop is relentless, skilful, brutal – and Smith, with barely a flinch, takes blows on the elbow, the shoulder, the rump, but he evades even more. Dainty back bends, swaying leather-sniffing, dinky knee drops, all were part of his back catalogue long before yoga and pilates were the staple of a sportsman’s daily routine. Smith hit 41 in England’s second innings of 89 all out in that match – opening because Alec Stewart couldn’t bat after injuring a finger behind the stumps on a pitch that the captain Mike Atherton said later was the worst he had encountered in any Test. Atherton also told everyone that Smith’s 41 would have been worth a hundred had it been made anywhere else.View image in fullscreenRobin Smith played for Hampshire for more than two decadesPhotograph: John Gichigi/Getty ImagesSmith made his England debut in 1988, dropped into an England team in disarray during the famous summer of the four captains. Chris Cowdrey was his captain for that match – and would never play for England again. But Smith took it all in his stride and the next year scorched two hundreds and a 96 during the 4-0 thrashing by Australia in England.Of all his nine Test centuries, two stick most memorably in the mind. His 101 in the fifth Ashes Test at Trent Bridge that dismal 1989 summer, after Australia had racked up 602 for six declared, and Smith had stormed in with the score one for two – Martyn Moxon and Atherton back in the pavilion for ducks. He ravaged the Australians, those square cuts screaming across the Nottingham grass and you can sense the joy in the crowd that someone, at last, is giving them something to cheer at, a stick of some sort to wave at the gimlet-eyed baggy greens. I don’t think that, even in this Indian Premier League era, anyone has cut the ball harder.And his 175 against the West Indies at St Johns in April 1994 – an almost forgotten innings as it came in the same match as Brian Lara grabbed the headlines with 375. But against Curtly Ambrose, and Courtney Walsh, it was an innings of pure-gold defiance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We could smell their fear and see the frustration in their eyes. Smith would wear a cap when he could, otherwise his helmet was without bars or visor, balanced on that famous hair, which panned behind him in a series of shampoo‑and-set waves.In the end, it turned out that the larger-than-life cricketer and the cavalier cape didn’t match the vulnerable human underneath. His autobiography The Judge, written with Rob Smyth, revealed the loneliness and sadness behind those big-man strokes, and the bereft figure left once cricket had decided he was no longer needed. “The Judge was a fearless warrior,” he wrote. “Robin Arnold Smith was a frantic worrier.” I hope he knew how much we all loved him.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamHampshireCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am immediately at odds with the board when I launch a rogue bid to sign Aitana Bonmatí, which is immediately rejected.I manage to recruit Alex Greenwood to shore things up in the wake of Leah Williamson’s injury and my late bid for Patri Guijarro, who wants to be part of my project, falls through at the last minute with the budget once again the problem. I demand answers from the board as to why they will not release more funds when the player-in-question wants to join, pointing out that our scouting report says she’s a necessary replacement for Lia Wälti.The 100 best female footballers in the world 2025 – Nos 100-41Read moreDespite the off-pitch drama that has almost certainly put me in the line of fire within days of my unveiling, we win our opening game 5-0, a Chloe Kelly hat-trick and Emily Fox wonder-goal contributing, and Greenwood makes a solid first impression on her debut. All in all, Football Manager 26 is fun, and being able to play as the women’s team I grew up supporting and with the players I have in-depth knowledge of on the back of covering them week-in week-out is really cool, albeit a little bit of a busman’s holiday.The introduction of women’s football into the Football Manager universe has been a long time coming, initially part of the 2025 launch of the game developed by Sports Interactive, before the entire edition was cancelled and focus turned instead to the 2026 edition, which was released last month.Alongside EA Sports FC, Panini and Topps, Football Manager is playing its part in the women’s game being absorbed into football’s cultural space. For the companies involved this move is partly the right thing to do and partly a way to draw in new customers, as well as giving existing customers something new to engage with – on the basis they are open-minded in regards to there being ponytails on some of the players on the digital pitch.“If someone who’s been playing this game for so long has not really had much of an interest in women’s football but just loves Football Manager, possibly even going as far back as the Championship Manager days, and wants to experience a new league or club they now have a new space to do that in,” says the Sports Interactive women’s football research coordinator, Chloe Woolaway. “If off the back of that they go on to watch a women’s football game or learn a few of the big names in women’s football that’s something that is really powerful. On the flipside of that, we’re introducing this world to the younger generation too.”View image in fullscreen‘Gaming can be seen as this male-dominated industry. We wanted to break down those barriers.’Photograph: SegaThe introduction of women’s football into Football Manager, and into EAFC, also influences two major male dominated spaces: football and gaming. “We knew that women’s football was going to become as big as it can and that there is a space for it,” says Woolaway. “Gaming can be seen as this male-dominated industry. We wanted to break down those barriers and create a space for the women’s football community within it because it is growing community and a growing game. It’s really important that we create that space for people to express themselves and their love of football and gaming.”The task of introducing women’s football into Football Manager was far from an easy one, in part due to a dearth of relevant information. As Woolaway puts it, the last few years have been “a bit of a madness”. The game ultimately launched with more than 30,000 female players with more than 300 fields having to be filled out for each and every one. Everything is in there, including: natural foot, dominant foot, current ability, potential ability, contract details, wage details and transfer fee.“When you look at male players all it takes is a quick Google search. We quickly realised we would have to adapt the way that we research and recognised it was going to be a bit more time consuming and we would need to go to extra lengths to find information that should be readily available,” says Woolaway.There was unique challenges to contend with, too. “The database has been moulded around the men’s game and we had to be solution focused to make it work for the women’s,” says Woolaway.“Where do we fill in that a player’s now married and using their married name on their kit? Where do we show that a player wears a hijab when they play? What do we do with dual registrations? How do we reflect hair lengths? We also made the decision to remove player weights entirely, partly because when women are on their periods it can fluctuate so much that we felt it was not something that we should be putting in the game.”For those involved it is now about building on a beast of a dataset. “There’s never going to be an end point,” says Woolaway. “Football is ever changing and there’s always going to be a new club, a new player, a new league, an error to fix or educated guess to tweak as the data becomes more accessible. There’s always room to progress and develop.”“We were just going to create a computer game and I was the research girl helping to do that,” Woolaway adds. “Over time it came up in conversation more and more that we were and are creating one of the most extensive databases in the world for women’s football. I don’t think I quite realised that before and now that’s something I’m really proud of.”Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

The coin went up, Nasser Hussain decided to have a bowl, and Steve Waugh’s Australians cashed in on generosity.Having not returned until 2017‑18, and then covered the Covid tour four years later, the Sydney finale in 2003 remains the only time I have seen England win a Test on Australian soil. Even then I missed the last day: flat broke and forced to head back to Queensland to find work, I eventually found myself on a farm upstate, shovelling melons like a scrum-half for eight hot hours a day while dodging venomous snakes underfoot.England abandon all-out pace attack with recall of Will Jacks for second Ashes Test in BrisbaneRead moreIt was three dollars to the pound back then, but the main difference before the tour started was expectation. There was precious little, other than of a good time ahead, a chance to watch that great Australia team first hand, and the hope that one or two Englishmen might stand up in the heat. Michael Vaughan’s glowing bat answered that call, at least, peeling off 633 princely runs in an otherwise one‑sided 4–1 defeat.Australians could be forgiven for wondering why expectations were higher this time around given England’s record since. The 3–1 win under Andrew Strauss in 2010-11 remains the one island of bliss in an ocean of otherwise thwarted trips, with two whitewashes and a couple of 4–0 scorelines underlining how hard it can be to swim against the tide.Optimism came chiefly from England’s fast-bowling stocks and a positive outlook, plus an Australia side deemed to be approaching its end. But a two‑day bunfight in Perth – one that hinged ultimately on an hour of ruinous batting – paused all that talk, triggering a wave of derision towards England and sending them into must‑win territory at the Gabba this week.Mathematically this is not true, of course, but those who cover Ashes tours are hard-wired with one particular statistic above all: no team have overcome a 2–0 deficit to win a series bar Australia in 1936-37. And they had a certain Don Bradman leading the fightback with scores of 270, 212 and 169 across the final three Tests.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Will Jacks during a training session at the Gabba in Brisbane.Photograph: Jason O’Brien/EPABen Stokes tends to reject the relevance of history which, at a ground such as the Gabba – an unconquerable citadel for England for nearly 40 years – is probably for the best. Although tactical tidbits from previous “Gabbatoir” ordeals go slightly out of the window anyway, with the second Test that starts on Thursday a first Ashes day‑nighter on Vulture Street.A sport already built on myriad variables gets a whole heap more when the pink Kookaburra ball comes out to play. It can zip around in the day –India were rolled for 36in bright Adelaide sunshine five years ago – and it can also go soft, forcing fielding sides to sit in. But even when tired, it can still suddenly burst into life before bedtime – the so-called “witching hour” that readers with young children will doubtless recognise.All this led to the floodlit format recently being dubbed “a lottery” by Stuart Broad but Australia’s record of played 14, won 13 suggests otherwise. Notwithstanding Mitchell Starc’s pink-ball pre‑eminence and greater exposure for their batters, it still comes down to deft in‑game management, an appreciation of conditions, and superior split‑second decision making.Given events on the second and, ahem, final day in Perth, these challenges will likely be of greater concern for England’s supporters than the Gabba factor itself. On Tuesday, before training, Stokes doubled down on a belief that his players have the wherewithal to get it right in the moment.This may induce eyes being rolled but the one day-night Test Stokes has overseen is the267‑run victory against New Zealandin Mount Maunganui in 2023. There was a smart declaration on day one and, for all the talk of one‑dimensional batting, an even smarter slowdown on day three that allowed Broad to wreak havoc with a new ball under lights.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the humidity high, passages of attrition possible, and the quick men likely to need breathers, the option of a spinner does seem reasonable enough.The question in the short term is whether Jacks, a serviceable part‑timer who also bolsters the batting, can give Stokes the desired control. The broader one is what this all means for Shoaib Bashir, who after two years of investment with this very tour in mind has been leapfrogged by a wildcard pick.Australia’s one enforced changeis Usman Khawaja making way with the back issue that blighted him in Perth. While Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are still out – Cummins has been in Brisbane, amid whispers of a possible late surprise – the hosts appear stronger for the loss of Khawaja, not least if the dangerous Josh Inglis comes into the middle order.It all adds up to a pivotal week for the tour and this England team. The melon fields of north Queensland are unlikely to follow but, given what 2–0 down would mean, their only option is to go for broke.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamBen StokesThe AshesCricketAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Whatever else might beckon for the eight-year-old – and a recent 160+ rating over timber suggests that he could compete at a very decent level on the Flat – this is a horse that should not be asked to jump a hurdle in public again.Henderson’s competitive streak is as fierce as ever after nearly half a century in the game, and so too his appetite for a challenge. As such, it would be odd if the urge to attempt a repeat of Sprinter Sacre’s unlikely return to Grade One-winning form at the 2016 festival was not nagging away at the back of his mind somewhere. Sprinter Sacre’s second Champion Chase victory was one of the great Cheltenham moments of recent decades, andConstitution Hill, after all, set off as the 4-11 favourite for the Champion Hurdle just eight months ago, with an unbeaten 10-race record to his name.Constitution Hill falls again as Golden Ace storms to Fighting Fifth Hurdle winRead moreFestival racegoers also love nothing more than a returning champion, and the compelling narrative of a triumph against all odds. But Constitution Hill’s decline has been so steep and abrupt, and so obviously the result of a loss of confidence at the obstacles, that the risk-reward calculation – for the horse, his connections and for the sport in general – is entirely different.Whatever else ailed him during a stop-start second half to his career, Sprinter Sacre’s jumping was always rock-solid. Constitution Hill’s problem, though, was as plain as day at Newcastle on Saturday: the mid-air moment when uncertainty kicked in. Henderson reported in the run-up to the Fighting Fifth Hurdle that Constitution Hill’s schooling had gone well, but back on a racecourse and at racing speed, his split-second of indecision made a fall all but inevitable.As Barry Geraghty, who was closely involved in buying Constitution Hill as a foal and then steering him towards the Henderson stable, told RTÉ afterwards: “You can school at home, jump perfectly in a relaxed environment, but you go to the racecourse and have that energy, that tension, and boom, he takes a chance. It’s a really difficult thing to un-train out of a horse, if you like.”Perhaps it is a sign of a flight animal’s survival instinct coming to the fore. What Constitution Hill wants to avoid above all is another fall, and an unfortunate result is that in the heat of competition, that actually makes a fall more likely. But the implication is that if Constitution Hill’s first fall at Cheltenham in March planted the seed of uncertainty in his mind, no amount of home schooling will do much to reduce the chance of another fall if he returns to the track.It also feels like a stretch to suggest, as Henderson did on Sunday, that the padded hurdles which are being steadily rolled out across all British jumps tracks are to blame for Constitution Hill’s jumping issues.View image in fullscreenNicky Henderson with Constitution Hill at the trainer’s stables in Lambourn.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA“I know we like Kempton [where Constitution Hill has won three Christmas Hurdles], but it is those hurdles I would want to avoid more than anything,” Henderson told PA Media.“For all the words that have been said from the people who have very kindly rung up trying to advise us, the most common denominator – and I believe they are right – is those padded hurdles, they are horrible.“The poor The New Lion did the same thing as Constitution Hill [at Newcastle on Saturday], and State Man did the same in the Champion Hurdle [in March], they have all made the same mistake. The trouble is we happen to have done it three times, whereas they have only done it once, the poor devils.“Out of all the people ringing up, by far the most common thing they have said is they should get rid of those hurdles and I couldn’t agree with them more.”The British Horseracing Authority, though, was quick to defend the padded hurdles on Monday, pointing to clear statistical evidence that both falls and injuries have been reduced since their introduction.“Since their phased introduction 10 years ago, the hurdles have shown that they reduce the risk of falling by 11% compared to birch hurdles,” a spokesperson said. “Since 2016 the overall faller rate over hurdles has decreased from 1.96% to 1.65%, with other factors such as the move from orange to white obstacles also contributing to this.“They have also shown a reduction in injuries, including those caused by splinters which sometimes associated with the birch hurdles, as well as fewer skin-related injuries.”There was perhaps a slight element of misfortune in Constitution Hill’s first fall back in March, as he jumped a panel which came back at him slightly after being rattled by Brighterdaysahead, who jumped it a couple of lengths in front of him.But it is also the case that the astonishingly quick, brave and accurate jumping style that was a key element of Constitution Hill’s brilliance in his prime left little margin for error. When, suddenly, it let him down, it was the fall itself, rather than the finer points of hurdle design, that seems to have become lodged in his brain.Again, it is only natural for Constitution Hill’s connections to look for reasons – and so, presumably, possible remedies – for his sudden decline, but his standing as one of hurdling’s all-time greats has long since been secure. Henderson’s initial instinct was spot on. There is no need to attempt to write a glorious final chapter, when an alternative ending does not bear thinking about.Online auction for John Hunt familyAn online silent auction has been launched with proceeds going to the Hunt Family Fund, which has been established in memory of the family of the BBC racing commentator, John Hunt, and his daughter, Amy, to raise funds for charities and causes that help and inspire young women.Items on offer in the auction include behind-the-scenes experiences at Match of the Day and Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football, a trip for two to visit Willie Mullins’s stable in Ireland and a VIP package including two tickets for the Carabao Cup final in March.The auction is open until the evening of Thursday 11 December, and bids can be submitted online via the link:www.bidaid.com/auction/HFF.Explore more on these topicsConstitution HillTalking HorsesNicky HendersonHorse racingcommentShareReuse this content"

There is a lot of work to be done.”Calling the meeting “extremely useful, constructive, and informed”, Ushakov nonetheless said the two sides had not come to an agreement on key issues, including the potential lines of territorial control in a potential peace deal between Russia andUkraine.“We did not discuss … specific American proposals, but discussed the essence of what is embedded in these American documents,” Ushakov said of the peace plan presented by the US side. “We could agree with some things … and the president also did not hide our critical and even negative attitude towards a number of proposals.”Some aspects of the negotiations would not be revealed, Ushakov said, and he indicated that another summit between Trump and Putin was not imminent.Ushakov’s remarks were an underwhelming conclusion to talks that the Trump administration had suggested could create a framework to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The downbeat assessment of Tuesday night’s diplomacy follows combative opening statements from Putin as Witkoff and Kushnerarrived for talks at the Kremlin, in which he accused European powers of sabotaging peace in Ukraine and that “European demands” on ending the war were “not acceptable to Russia”.“Europe is preventing the US administration from achieving peace on Ukraine,” Putin said, adding: “Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now.”Putin did not clarify which European demands he found unacceptable.“They are on the side of war,” Putin said of European powers.Witkoff, on his sixth trip to Moscow this year, was expected to present Putin with an updated version of a US peace proposal drafted with input from a senior Russian official and reworked to make it more acceptable to Kyiv.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he was “awaiting signals” from the US delegation after its meeting with Putin, in an intense round of shuttle diplomacy that the Trump administration has claimed is its best chance yet of bringing an end to the war.But there remains significant skepticism that Russia is ready to accept any concessions, rather than continue the war and await a further breakdown in relations between the Trump White House and its European allies.“I am ready to receive all the signals and ready for a meeting with President Trump,” Zelenskyy posted on X. “Everything depends on today’s discussions.”Several US media outlets reported that Zelenskyy was expected to meet with Witkoff and Kushner in Europe after the meeting.A short video feed from the Kremlin showed the two small delegations sitting on opposite sides of an oval white table, with Putin seated next to his advisers Kirill Dmitriev and Yuri Ushakov. Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner about a short tour of Moscow they had taken before the meeting, with Witkoff calling it a “magnificent city”. The feed then cut out.The two Trump allies arrived in Moscow on Tuesday after meeting Ukrainian officials at the weekend in Florida to discuss revisions to the original28-point peace plan, which overwhelmingly favoured Moscow.Zelenskyy, on a diplomatic push to rally support among European capitals that have backed changes to the original plan, said in Paris that the updated version of the proposal “looks better” but emphasised it was “not over yet”.Zelenskyy has objected in particular to provisions in the 28-point plan that would have required Ukraine to surrender territory in the east that it currently controls, and impose limits on the size of its military. He has also demanded clear, enforceable security guarantees from the west to prevent a future Russian invasion.View image in fullscreenJared Kushner (left), Kirill Dmitriev (centre), the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, and Steve Witkoff arrive to meet Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.Photograph: Kristina Kormilitsyna/APPutin, for his part, has said that only the original US proposal could serve as a basis for further talks, while also stating that it required significant revisions.Despite intense shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks, which has produced several revisions to the US peace plan, bridging the gap remains difficult: Russia’s maximalist demands in effect require Ukraine’s capitulation.Trump said in remarks to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the Ukraine war was a “mess” and not an easy situation to resolve.Putin’s comments appeared aimed at driving a wedge between Washington and European capitals. European officials have had some success in pushing back against the original US plan, though it remains unclear to what extent Washington is taking their concerns into account.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier on Tuesday said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the “understandings” reached recently between Washington and Kyiv, adding that Russia remained open to talks but would insist on achieving the goals of its “special operation”.Those goals amount to sweeping demands that would severely erode Ukraine’s sovereignty, including deep cuts to its armed forces, a ban on western military assistance, far-reaching limits on political independence, and the handover of Ukrainian-controlled territory in the east of the country.On the eve of the talks with the US delegation in Moscow, Putin claimed Russian forces had taken control of thestrategic city of Pokrovskin Ukraine.Dressed in military fatigues during a visit to a command centre on Monday evening, the Russian president hailed what he called the “important” capture of Pokrovsk, once a major logistical hub for the Ukrainian army, though Ukrainian officials later disputed the claim.Russia has spent more than a year attempting to seize the frontline hub, seen as a gateway to Donetsk, and has suffered heavy losses in the process.0:35Russian forces roll 'Mad Max-style' into battered Pokrovsk - videoUkrainian analysts and military bloggers have acknowledged that Russia now holds most of Pokrovsk, with battlefield maps showing its forces largely in control.Buoyed up by recent gains at the front, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.The Russian leader also on Tuesday threatened retaliation against Ukraine’s ports and shipping after Kyiv in recent days struck several vessels in Russia’s so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea.The Russian president threatened that Moscow would “step up strikes on Ukrainian ports and on any ships entering them” in response to attacks on Russian tankers, which he described as “piracy”.Echoing the Kremlin, Russian state media on Tuesday struck a confident tone before the US visit. Komsomolskaya Pravda, often described as “Putin’s favourite newspaper”, wrote that the president’s remarks suggested “more and more Ukrainian territory is coming under our control – and that next time Russia’s terms may be tougher”.The paper implied that Moscow viewed the latest US-Ukrainian talks as a dead end, claiming Kyiv was refusing to capitulate. “The US has tried for the third time in the past 10 days to pressure Ukraine, and Washington has once again failed,” it wrote.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVladimir PutinRussiaUS foreign policyJared KushnerEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is getting worse. The weather’s going to change again in a couple of days. You know, there has to be a plan … I said: ‘This could be lives lost if you don’t take some sort of action, genuinely.’ But they just said: ‘No, there’s no plan.’”The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has been contacted for comment.The Indian authorities evacuated the last of more than 330 of its stranded nationals from Sri Lanka on Monday.Chetak helicopters from Indian aircraft carrier INS Vikrant airlifted several people to safer locations, while Indian Air Force helicopters were said to have aided the Sir Lankans in carrying out search operations in areas with no road access due to landslides and flooding.On Sunday Sri Lanka’s president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, described the fallout from Cyclone Ditwah as the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history”.Beeching said her mother and friend, who had left for a holiday on 21 November and were due to return this Wednesday, had been able to communicate intermittently since the cyclone hit.She said: “They were travelling down from Kandy to the south-east. They were originally going to take the train, but they were advised not to take the train and to drive.“They’re not on a tour or anything, it’s just them. As they were driving down, it hit – this is where the worst of the cyclone has hit, in the mountains, in the plantation region.“On Thursday midday we basically got messages, which said: ‘This is really scary, there’s landslides everywhere, we’ve seen a bus go over the side of the cliff.’“Where they were had the highest lives lost because obviously the landslides just cover people’s houses. Their driver turned around and they were heading back to Kandy but they got as far as a place called Pussellawa.”Beeching, who works for an NGO and was previously at the National Crime Agency, said she had liaised closely with the Foreign Office in the past.She said she had been dismayed by the lack of effort from British officials and that she had been unable to speak to the UK’s high commissioner to Sri Lanka, Andrew Patrick.“[The Sri Lankan tourist police] said the military would have been there a few days ago and that they still haven’t,” she said. “They can hear helicopters flying over, but they’re apparently retrieving bodies.”Explore more on these topicsSri LankaAsia PacificSouth and central AsiaFloodingExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

That total translates to about 22m views, meaning season 5 saw a 171% increase, according toVariety, though it should be noted that the fifth season total included five days of viewing, while Stranger Things 4’s premiere only counted three.The day before thelong-awaited final season, all previous Stranger Things seasons landed in Netflix’s top 10, a first for any show on the streaming platform. The influx of viewers caused the platform totemporarily freezeduring the premiere, even after Netflix “increased bandwidth by 30% to avoid a crash”, according to the series co-creator Ross Duffer on his Instagram.Stranger Things premiered on Netflix in 2016, and quickly became one of the most popular English-language series on the platform. The show launched the career ofMillie Bobby Brown, one of the first in-house Netflix stars, as well as those of Joe Keery, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, Sadie Sink and Gaten Matarazzo.The fifth season returns once again to Hawkins, Indiana, the fictional small town beset by increasingly ominous otherworldly activity in the 1980s – though with a time jump this time, to accommodate for the former child stars who have now aged into adults. Series regulars Winona Ryder and David Harbour also reprise their roles.The final chapter has been three years in the making and hotly anticipated, with the co-creators, brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, teasing that it will feature “the most violent death of any season”.The Guardian’s Jack Sealepraisedthe first half of the finale – particularly the fourth, feature-length episode, a “solidly thrilling 90 minutes of flame-throwing, bullet-dodging spectacle that makes good use of what looks like a virtually limitless effects budget, and which culminates in a moment that will have fans standing on their chairs and hollering joyfully”.Stranger Things 5 will wrap later this month, with three episodes premiering on Christmas Day. The series finale will air on 31 December.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsUS televisionTelevisionNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, he listens. Making a whistle, the former logger points up to a flash of white and reddish fur in the canopy. Inquisitive eyes peer back – a cotton-top tamarin, one of the world’s rarest primates.“I used to cut trees and never took thetitísinto account,” says Centena, calling the cotton-tops by their local name. “I ignored them. I didn’t know that they were in danger of extinction, I only knew I had to feed my family. But now we have become friends.”Weighing barely a pound (half a kilogram), the tiny monkeys are among the most threatened primates in the world, driven to the brink by medical experiments, rampant deforestation and the illegal pet trade. Today, they arecritically endangered, withfewer than 7,500remaining in the wild.View image in fullscreenLuis Enrique Centena uses radio telemetry to track the tamarinsThey are found only in the tropical dry forests of northern Colombia, an ecosystem that has been reduced to8% of its original size, largely by cattle ranching and logging; their survival depends on the restoration of this landscape, which has been stripped bare.Bonobos transformed how we think about animal societies. Can we save the last of the ‘hippy apes’?Read moreIn the hills outside San Juan Nepomuceno, a team of former loggers, farmers, environmentalists and biologists are working to bring the forest back, and with it the monkeys that have become famed for their punk-like manes.“Nobody knew anything about the cotton-tops, they were not on anyone’s agenda,” says Rosamira Guillen, who leadsFundación Proyecto Tití,a conservation initiative that has spent decades protecting the species and rebuilding its forest home. “But they exist only here and are at great risk – we must protect them.”The cotton-tops are strikingly human-like, Guillen and Centena say. They live in tight family groups, normally of between five and seven individuals, communicate in a complex system of calls, and fiercely defend their territory. They also play a vital role in the ecosystem: dispersing seeds, pollinating flowers and keeping insect populations in check.“Titís are a lot like us,” says Centena, who is a member of the foundation’s forest restoration and research team. “They teach you things. They look after their young. The only thing missing is that they don’t speak Spanish.”View image in fullscreenThe illegal pet trade continues to take its toll with the monkeys being sold as exotic petsThe monkeys’ numbers first plummeted in the 1960s and 70s, whentens of thousandswere exported to the US for medical research. Later, their habitat was stripped back to only720,000 hectares(1.8m acres) by clearance for traditional cattle ranching and agriculture. The illegal pet trade continues to take its toll, with poachers capturing and selling the tiny monkeys as exotic pets.Franklin Castro, an environmental guard, has spent the past decade trying to stop the capture of titís for the illicit market. “I started the task 10 years ago,” he says, sharing photos of the rescued animals. “More than 200 have passed through my hands. Traffickers pay people to catch them – 60,000, 70,000, sometimes 100,000 pesos [between £12 and £20]. We find the titís trembling and dehydrated. It’s a terrible sight.”Fundación Proyecto Tití began with a handful of biologists and field assistants monitoring the monkeys, but after receiving a grant nearly a decade ago, the NGO was able to buy a patch of degraded land to begin restoring the remaining fragmented forest.View image in fullscreenBiologists Aura Suárez Herrera and Marcelo Ortega check trays of seedlings being grown as part of the foundation’s forest restoration workMarcelo Ortega, who leads the foundation’s tree restoration work, says the first plot of land was barren. “There was nothing left,” he says.The cotton-tops are starting to come into the new forest to forage. It’s amazing to seeRosamira GuillenToday, Fundación Proyecto Tití manages more than 13 plots across nearly 1,000 hectares and works with more than 100 farmers, providing them with plants to restore strips of their land. About 120,000 trees and shrubs have been planted to date, with 60,000 more planned next year.The team plans its plot purchases to stitch isolated patches of forest back together, planting dense mixes of native species to form wildlife corridors. “Our goal is to restore what once existed,” says Ortega.They are already seeing the results. “The cotton-tops are starting to come into the new forest to forage,” says Guillen. “It’s amazing to see.”They monitor the monkey populations by fitting a small transmitter – “a little backpack” – to the dominant male of each family group. It sends a signal to an antenna carried by field researchers as they follow them through the forest.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of the foundation’s work in the forests of northern ColombiaCentena is one of them. “I’m not a biologist, I’m not a scholar, but I’ve learned so much,” he says. “I was cutting trees down for 25 years.

Roughly 90% of them, including 22,000 sites in the UK, predate pollution control regulations such as landfill linings to prevent leaching. Modern landfills which are well managed are likely to pose a low risk.More than 61,000 landfills have been identified across Europe, with 28% located in areas vulnerable to flooding. Modelling indicates the true number of flood‑risk sites could be as high as 140,000.This mapping effort, based on requests for landfill data from 10 countries and supplemented with open-source information, highlights a deeper issue: EU institutions lack centralised landfill records, while data from individual member states remains fragmented, inconsistent and often inaccessible.“We have inadequate records, differences in ways of categorising these sites and that makes it really difficult to deal with,” said Spencer.“It’s the worst possible scenario. Most landfills will be fine, but you only need a small number of sites which contain very toxic chemicals to be a problem. We just don’t know which ones.”More than half of the mapped landfills are in areas where groundwater fails to meet chemical quality standards, suggesting the landfills may in some cases have contributed to the contamination.The EU landfill directive, adopted in 1999, banned unlined landfills and created strict waste acceptance criteria. But before this there were few or no pollution containment measures.View image in fullscreenMany older sites across the UK and Europe were built before modern protections.Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Global Warming Images/Alamy“There could be many other sources of pollution, such as farming and industry, but one of the main ways chemicals migrate away from landfills is through groundwater,” said Byrne.Byrne found leachate leaking from the historic landfill at Newgate nature reserve in Wilmslow, Cheshire, into a small stream. His tests found toxic Pfas “forever chemicals” at 20 times the acceptable levels for drinking water. In Greece, tests found levels of Pfas many times above drinking water standards, as well as mercury and cadmium leaching into the Nedontas river from the former Maratholaka landfill site in the Taygetos mountains, which are visited by thousands of hikers every year. The local mayor of Kalamata says the site has ceased to operate since June 2023 and that “there is currently no evidence or data to substantiate any environmental impact from the operation of the site”.Some of these waters could be sources of drinking water and analysis found almost 10,000 landfills in drinking water zones in France, the UK, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. More than 4,000 of these are historic landfills in England and Wales and are therefore unlikely to have pollution controls. It was not possible to confirm whether landfills in Europe predated regulations or not.“We don’t and won’t know how much risk to human health and our drinking water there is until you can identify where all the landfills are, what is in them, whether they’re leaching and if treatment processes are filtering them out,” said Byrne.A spokesperson for the European Commission said that “under the drinking water directive the quality of the water has to be ensured ‘at the tap’ in the whole EU. The directive includes several parameters to be monitored and the corresponding limit values have to be complied with. In case of exceedances of these limit values, member states must ensure that the necessary remedial action is taken.”In the UK, water companies undertake risk assessments and monitoring of their public water abstractions under regulatory guidelines.Landfills that are most visibly at risk of exposure are those along the coast. The analysis found 346 landfills in coastal erosion zones in England, Wales and France, and 258 landfills across Europe within 200 metres of the coast, which could be at risk of erosion or exposure from storm surges.“This is the tip of the iceberg,” said Spencer, who is helping the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to rank the most high-risk landfills out of 1,200 identified priority sites in England and Wales. She tested two eroding landfills on the coast and found Lynemouth in the north-east released elevated concentrations of arsenic, and Lyme Regis in the south-west discharged high levels of lead, both of which could cause ecological harm.“We now need to understand the potential risks of climate change and associated pollution release at all our historic landfill sites, not just the coastal ones,” she said, adding that money will be needed to tackle these sites.“Essentially we are all living on a garbage dump,” said Spencer, who explained that about 80% of the British population lives within 2km of known landfill sites, and disproportionately in the most deprived parts of the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We have important wetlands around these areas, so if the leachate goes there it could accumulate in wildlife.”Illegal waste dumping is also a significant problem, whichEuropol has identifiedas one of Europe’s fastest-growing areas of organised crime. In February,Croatian authorities arrested 13 peoplesuspected of illegally dumping at least 35,000 tonnes of waste from Italy, Slovenia and Germany in Croatia, generating a profit of at least €4m for the criminals.In England, Environment Agencydatashows 137 open investigations into illegal dumps, involving more than 1m cubic metres of material.In the Campania region of southern Italy, illegal toxic waste dumping by the mafia has been blamed for the increased death and disease rates in the area.In England and Wales, at the current pace of use ourremaining landfill capacitycould run out in about 2050. New sites often face environmental concerns and public opposition.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “Our job is to protect people and the environment, and we are working closely with the landfill industry, water companies and across government to better understand the impacts from Pfas chemicals in landfills.“Environment Agency teams are undertaking a multi-year programme to improve evidence about the sources of Pfas pollution in England. Alongside this, we are also running further studies to investigate the potential contribution of Pfas in landfill leachate to a limited number of sewage works.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We want to prevent waste from occurring in the first place, but where waste occurs, we need to manage it in the most appropriate way.“We are committed to reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfill, supported through our collection and packaging reforms. Alongside this, the forthcoming circular economy growth plan will outline measures to drive greater reuse and recycling, safeguarding the value of our resources and preventing the nation’s waste going to landfill.”Disclaimer:This dataset may contain duplicate records.

On a daily basis, residents here live with about twice the levels of fine particulate air pollution as those in Los Angeles, which has long been the most polluted major metro in the US. And on bad days, the area sometimes has among the worst pollution levels in the world.Air pollution in Mexico’s largest metros have largely stayed high, while pollution in US metros has declined.Long-term exposure to this kind of air pollution has been linked to thousands of deaths per year in the area.Monterrey is one of the only major metro areas in the three nations where such air pollution has remained stubbornly high, at a time when most cities are accomplishing vast reductions in harmful pollutants.The findings come as residents have mounted protests about the air quality in Monterrey, with some carrying signs saying “We want to breathe” and demanding that the federal government take action.“You have to wonder: How are we not suffocating?” said Aldo Salazar, an environmental activist, who said he didn’t realize he was living in a fishbowl of pollution until he began hiking into the mountains that surround Monterrey, where he could stand in the clear sunshine and look down at the gray basin of smog beneath him. The mountains themselves are frequently not visible from the city owing to the dirty air.View image in fullscreenAbout 40 residents in a neighborhood in San Nicolás de los Garza protested near the Zinc Nacional recycling plant on 20 April 2025. They demanded the cease of operations of the company in this area.Photograph: El NorteThe Monterrey urban area has quadrupled in size since 1990 as it has become an industrial boomtown. And although vehicles and small businesses also contribute to pollution, about 60% comes from industrial emitters, including privately owned factories and public energy plants, according to a government estimate. This pollution consists of fine particles that are harmful if inhaled, and can include small quantities of dangerous metals.Many of the major factories in Monterrey produce goods that go to the US market – ranging from tractors and beer mugs to chocolate cookies – or recycle toxic waste and scrap metal sent from the US, the research shows. Among the top emitters are factories that recycle US car batteries and hazardous waste, and those thatship finished products back to the US.In one example, the analysis found that a single European steel company reported emitting more lead – which can cause brain damage in children – into the air in a year than all the companies combined in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, the most populous metro in the US. The company acknowledged these emissions but said future reports would show less pollution.The analysis also revealed that some facilities in Monterrey emit carcinogenic cadmium and arsenic at levels that are rarely reported in densely populated areas of the US.Top Mexican officials have promised to address air-quality problems in Monterrey. Alicia Bárcena, Mexico’s secretary of environment and natural resources, said in a statement to the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab that her administration is aware there is a problem with pollution and “actions are being taken to address this,” including updating emissions standards and improving industrial monitoring. She added that “there is a long-term trend towards improvement” in pollution levels.side-by-side images of an area in different yearsA view of the Santa Catarina river and Fundidora park in the city of Monterrey, seen with pollution on 19 November 2024 and without pollution on 2 November 2025. The mountains of the Sierra Madre (left) and Cerro de las Mitras (right) sometimes disappear from sight in days with bad air.Credit: José Villasaez, El NorteMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in July that she was awaiting research about Monterrey’s air pollution that was being coordinated by the “best scientists in our country on these issues”, and which would show “who is polluting, how much they are polluting and where they are polluting.”While industry representatives argue that facilities serving the US market have modern and effective pollution controls, some experts say the industrial growth in Monterrey may come at the price of residents’ health and lives.“Monterrey is paying a price for being too aggressive in getting foreign investment,” said Rafael Fernández de Castro, director of theCenter for US-Mexican Studiesat the University of California San Diego.“This will backfire,” he said. “Because this pollution is going to result in a big-time impact on public health. The remedy is going to be very, very costly and it will offset the short-term benefits of this very hot market that is Monterrey.”Polluting plants operate in highly populated areasTo find the top industrial polluters, the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab combed through emissions reports for thousands of facilities, which journalists obtained through records requests andgovernment databases, as well as a leaked government inventory.The emissions reports used in this investigation, which companies self-report to the Mexican government, are not complete. There are gaps for certain plants, pollution types and years. But they provide an overall picture of what the companies themselves say they are pumping into the air.The investigation revealed that Monterrey contains a huge number of polluting industrial plants operating in highly populated areas. Particularly troubling were some that report emitting large amounts of heavy metals into dense, urban neighborhoods.Map of Monterrey, with hundreds of markers representing industrial sites with reported pollutionProducers of metals, glass, ceramics and cement, as well as power plants and a government-run refinery, dominate the emissions reports.Chronic exposure to even small quantities of the heavy metalshave been shownto cause an array of health effects like kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, birth defects, and cancer, as well as causing increases in learning disabilities and behavior problems in children that can affect the economic prospects of an entire population.The US has cracked down on air emissions of these metals due to their very harmful effects. But evidence suggests Mexican residents near plants making and recycling goods for US customers are still breathing in lead, cadmium and arsenic.The emissions numbers for each heavy metal are striking.Lead emissions more than that of all companies in many US statesPlants in Monterrey reported releasing a total of 4,362lbs (1979kg) of toxic lead into the air per year on average between 2021 and 2023 – more than all the companies in many US states.Top emitters in recent years included two steel plants and a half dozen companies that recycle old car batteries, often shipped down from the US. Among these is US company Clarios, which owns five plants that reported lead emissions in the Monterrey area.In response to questions, the company did not dispute its emissions but said that it operates “in full compliance with – and often exceed[s] – the environmental, health, and safety regulations in Mexico.”In another example, Ternium, a steel company headquartered in Luxemburg that supplies metals crucial to the North American auto industry, reported releasing over 1,000lbs (458kg) of lead into the air in 2023 from a factory in a crowded Monterrey neighborhood. That is more than all companies combined in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, the United States’ most populous metro.Ternium said that its treatment system captures 99% of lead emissions, and that its forthcoming lead and cadmium reports would show substantial decreases. “If we compare our emissions, they are similar to or lower than those reported by steel plants in the United States and Europe,” the company said.Hazardous cadmium emissionsIn the case of cadmium, which is considered even more hazardous because of its significant carcinogenic potential, facilities here reported emitting a total of 301lbs (137kg) in the average year.View image in fullscreenA general view shows Mexican state oil firm Pemex’s refinery in Cadereyta, on the outskirts of Monterrey, Mexico, in 2021.Photograph: Daniel Becerril/ReutersThat is more than in all but four places in the US – but those places are mostly rural locations far from dense populations, such as in Alaska’s Northwest Arctic Borough. The only place where comparably large amounts of cadmium were emitted near an urban population in the US was around two solar panel plants that are 10 miles (16km) south of Toledo, Ohio.Top emitters included zinc and steel plants, and power plants providing electricity to the city.US-owned glass producer Crisa Libbey reported emitting 45lbs (20kg) of cadmium into the air. The company did not respond to requests for comment.Top arsenic emittersMeanwhile, facilities reported emitting 66lbs (30kg) of arsenic per year into the air.Zinc Nacional, which recycles steel dust sent from the US to recover zinc, was the largest reporter in this category in recent years.It recycles US hazardous waste in a tightly packed neighborhood and has reported emitting about 20lbs (9kg) of arsenic per year since 2017.By comparison, most plants that emit large amounts of arsenic in the US operate well away from large urban populations. Only one US plant that reports arsenic at these levels operates in a dense neighborhood in a major metropolitan area – the US Steel plant in Gary, Indiana.Zinc Nacional disputed that its emissions are this large. It said that its reports are only estimates that do not take into account its pollution-control technologies and that “our actual emissions are considerably lower.”View image in fullscreenZinc Nacional plant seen in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, on 13 September 2024.Photograph: Bernardo De Niz/The GuardianAn industry group, the Institute for the Environmental Protection of Nuevo León, which advises Zinc Nacional and many other major Monterrey companies went further, saying in a statement that emissions reports submitted to the Mexican government “may include materials retained in filters or chimneys, or treated” and should only be used as “trend indicators”.However under the law, “only what is emitted into the air should be reported, without considering what is retained by the control equipment,” said an official from the Mexican environmental regulator, Semarnat.Other top arsenic emitters included the multinational cement company Cemex, a refinery and several energy plants.Cemex said that it is in full compliance with regulations and is investing in technologies to reduce its emissions, including using real-time air monitors and drones to detect and control any increased emissions. The company has “a long history of seriously embracing our environmental commitment.”Overall, about 40% of the heavy metals emissions reported came from a handful of companies operating plants within 5 miles (8km) of each other in the most densely populated area of Monterrey, called San Nicolás de los Garza. Its population of mostly working-class residents has exploded over the years.“Many of these factories have been there for 80 or 90 years and now they are absolutely surrounded by people living there, so that makes this problem a lot bigger,” said Glen Villarreal Zambrano, a state legislator who lives in the area and was, until recently, the head of the Nuevo León parks and wildlife department.“We are victims of our own success,” he said. “We have economic growth – now we have to put order to it.”‘We’re breathing in a capsule of poison’The health consequences are becoming increasingly clear to residents. Chronic exposure to fine particulate air pollution causes as many as 2,500 deaths every year in the Monterrey metropolitan region, as well as contributing to a multitude of chronic ailments, ranging from respiratory and neurological problems and cancer, according to a 2023 study issued by the state of Nuevo León.Guadalupe Rodríguez, director of the regional public nursery school system, has long worried about the effects of Monterrey’s air pollution on her young students. On the worst air quality days, when winds pick up dust to mix with the industrial pollution, monitors hung in the rafters of schools scattered around the city report air quality levels so high that they are symbolized with pictures of children wearing old-fashioned gas masks.View image in fullscreenGuadalupe Rodríguez, director of the regional public nursery school system, organized lead testing for all the children in her schools.Photograph: El Norte“We’re breathing in a capsule of poison throughout the entire metropolitan area,” she said. “Out of a school month, I’d say we get five good days and 15 bad ones”.She says about half the children, from infants to six year olds, suffer some kind of health condition, including repeated respiratory infections and allergies. She is also concerned about high rates of autism among her students.But it wasn’t until the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab published aninvestigationin January into Zinc Nacional that she was able to organize lead testing for all the children in her schools.That investigation revealed heavy metals contamination in homes and schools surrounding Zinc Nacional, which recycles hazardous waste from the US steel industry.View image in fullscreenChildren play at a school in the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza, near numerous facilities that have reported large emissions of heavy metals, in September 2024.Photograph: Bernardo De Niz/The GuardianZinc Nacional responded that the investigation was based on a study “that lacks scientific validity and institutional backing”. It said that its recycling process is crucial. “If these materials were not recycled, they would end up landfilled or released into the environment, posing real ecological risks”This spring medical teams began showing up at nine nursery schools to prick the fingers of children three to six years old whose parents signed up for the testing, which is ongoing.Rodríguez, who is also a state legislator, said she and other environmental activists have been trying to draw attention to the worsening air pollution problems for years, without tangible results.“There are laws, but they aren’t enforced,” she said.Guadalupe Martínez, 63, lived for 30 years in a neighborhood that sits in near several of the plants reporting the highest heavy metal emissions in the region.One morning in 2021, she began coughing and spitting up blood and her children took her to the emergency room, according to Martínez and her son. Her condition was so critical that she spent six months in an induced coma and more than a year in the hospital. Today she can barely speak because of her tracheotomy tube and is dependent on oxygen and constant care.“I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t stay up late,” said Martínez, whose family now wonders if living in the midst of so much pollution might have affected her health.View image in fullscreenRicardo González and his mother, Guadalupe Martínez, who depends on oxygen and wonders whether living near several of the plants reporting the highest heavy metal emissions in the region has affected her health.Photograph: Courtesy of El NorteHer son, local attorney Ricardo González, is taking legal steps to demand that the government investigate the health effects of pollution in the urban area.“The authorities are failing to fulfil their duty to guarantee legal, physical and material safety for the people,” he said. “And by doing so, they are enabling and allowing the population to be poisoned.“CO2 emissions and outdated environmental regulationsThe Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab investigation also examined the region’s top emitters of carbon dioxide, a measure which shows not only how much of this global-warming gas each factory is sending into the atmosphere, but is often also an indicator of air pollution.In 2022, the roughly 200 plants that reported their annual CO2 releases in Monterrey emitted more of the greenhouse gas than more than 100 countries, and were similar to Paraguay, Panama and Costa Rica.One of the highest emitters in recent years was the Cadereyta refinery, run by Mexico’s state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex). The plant can also be seen from satellites in space as one of the biggest emitters in the world of sulphur dioxide, which contributes to smog.The company did not respond to a request for comment.Experts said Pemex emissions have worsened in recent years, as the previous presidential administration ramped up processing of dirtier oil. Mexico’s refineries, including the nearly 50-year-old Cadereyta, are in a poor state of repair.The Cadereyta refinery has been “operating purely on inertia, without filters or anti-pollution measures – it simply degraded into what we’re seeing now”, said Gonzalo Monroy, an energy consultant.Since 2015, investment in refinery maintenance has decreased dramatically.“Most of the sulfur [capturing equipment] in the refineries and in the gas processing plants in Mexico are out of operation for lack of maintenance”, said Francisco José Barnés de Castro, an oil industry expert and former head of the Mexican Petroleum Institute.The Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab investigation also raised concerns about the effectiveness of Mexico’s environmental regulation of industrial facilities.Companies that would face tight air pollution regulation in the US are able to operate under decades-old Mexican environmental standards. These “are a real disgrace”, said Samuel García, the governor of Nuevo León, Monterrey’s home state, in a social media post this summer. They allow thresholds for air and heavy metals pollution that are “extremely high”.Additionally, emissions records for toxic chemicals at many facilities are missing, while others are removed from the record by the Mexican environmental regulator because of doubts about their accuracy.A ‘circular economy’ gone awry?Experts say the city’s relationship as a supplier to the US is crucial in explaining the pollution crisis. Monterrey has long prided itself on its entrepreneurial spirit and centuries-long history of teaming up with US businesses.Monterrey is still a place “where the factory, the facility, the smokestack is a source of pride,” said Eduardo Enrique Aguilar, a professor of political economics at University of Monterrey.But he said, since the North American Free Trade Agreement opened the trade borders between the US and Mexico in the 1990s, Monterrey has seen an over-accumulation of factories.“They come here, pay very low wages, and offload all the environmental harm – which is ultimately borne by us, by the people who live here,” said Aguilar.Since 2006, international exports from the metro have tripled. About 90% in sales go to the US – totalling at least $46bn dollars in 2024.Map showing the flow of material so recycle from the US to Monterrey and goods exported back from Monterrey to the US.As part of this manufacturing boom, he said the region has become a “recycling hub” for the US companies, who want to process US waste into new goods in what is now dubbed “the circular economy.”Some of the highest emissions figures found by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab came from factories recycling waste and scrap exported out of the US for Mexican companies to process and use as raw materials.These imports included hazardous waste from the US,including toxic steel dust and millions of old car batteries.But Monterrey also receives vast quantities of everyday recycling that US consumers throw into their bins, including household paper recycling, and nearly 2m metric tons a year of scrap metal.“Ultimately, the United States has to send its waste somewhere, and clearly, there was already infrastructure here – highways, energy usage, and technological capacity,” said Aguilar, who said the pollution it foists upon the population is “a real injustice.”But an industry group, advising Ternium, Zinc Nacional, Clarios and numerous other large companies on environmental issues, pointed to Monterrey’s role in recycling US materials as an environmental benefit to the planet.“These are not uncontrolled wastes, but valuable inputs that are reprocessed under federal permits and supervision,” the group, Instituto para la Protección Ambiental de Nuevo León, said in a statement. Recycling can “replace primary mining, reduce global emissions and deforestation, and promote the circular economy.”The group said that Monterrey’s industrial boom has been accompanied by hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in environmental improvements in the region.“The industrial boom and nearshoring have gone hand in hand with an unprecedented process of industrial modernization in environmental matters,” it said.‘Mexico is not the trash dump for the US’Calls for action on the industrial pollution problems have intensified since the journalistic investigation earlier this year.Neighbors have staged several protests outside the Zinc Nacional plant, with signs such as “Mexico is not the trash dump for the United States”, and government officials have instituted five different temporary closures of the plant. The company announced it would move some of its operations elsewhere. (It said it followed all applicable regulations, and that the wellbeing of the community was a priority.)State and federal officials have responded by saying they will crack down on industrial polluters citywide.“The metropolitan area of Monterrey is one of the most polluted regions in terms of air quality in our country,” said Mariana Boy Tamborrell, the federal attorney for environmental protection, appointed last fall, who said her agency plans to step up inspections and sampling to make sure industry complies with the laws.“We want to prevent companies from merely simulating compliance or engaging in greenwashing,” Boy Tamborrell added.García,Nuevo León’s governor, has amplified that message in various statements this summer, saying that “there will be zero tolerance” for those who pollute and that “industry has completely failed” to handle pollution.But Hugo Barrera, an air pollution researcher, said solutions might not come so easily. His organization, the Mario Molina Center for Energy and Environment, has recommended that government and industry should work together to relocate polluting factories outside the urban area.But companies “don’t seem interested”, he said. “It’s very costly to move industry, and it’s both politically and economically difficult.”Ultimately, activists hope the huge groundswell of public anger that has now built around the air pollution issue in Monterrey will spark meaningful improvements.“If people don’t know the air is dangerous, the government doesn’t have to act,” said Vivianne Clariond, who is pushing for the government to do something about the smog.Clariond’s own background is a sign of how broad the movement has become. Her grandfather founded a major steel mill, which was later bought by the international conglomerate Ternium and is now considered one the biggest polluters in the city. She is also the daughter of a former governor, and has herself served as a councilor in local government.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in a protest demanding the closure of the Pemex refinery, blaming it for polluting the air, in Monterrey, Mexico, on 28 January 2024.Photograph: Daniel Becerril/ReutersNow a wide array of Monterrey residents – from the affluent to the working class – are joining the fight to reduce pollution. And many hope that Sheinbaum, a trained climate scientist, will take up the cause and make the changes to environmental law and enforcementthat will be needed to improve the situation.“What we need is someone with the guts to act,” Clariond said. “When Mexico City was the most polluted city in the world, they introduced vehicle inspections, bike lanes, cable cars, a metro. They made decisions – even if unpopular.”“Here in Nuevo León, nobody wants to sacrifice the economy or their political capital.”El Norte newspaper contributedreportingQuick GuideMethodologyShowTo find the top industrial polluters in Monterrey, the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab analyzed emissions data for the region from multiple viewpoints.This included filing public records requests to obtain a database of each facilities’ reports to the Mexican government, as well as their itemized accounts of their releases from each part of their operation. We also obtained a leaked draft of an emissions inventory that was never published.Ultimately the numbers we decided to publish in this piece are from the Mexican government’s Registro de Emisiones y Transferencia de Contaminantes program, which compiles emissions data to share with the public and the international community through the North American Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (NAPRTR) initiative.We downloaded these from awebportalrun by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC), an international organization created as a side accord to the 1994 free trade agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico to facilitate cooperation on environmental issues across the three countries.The reports only include emissions from facilities that are federally regulated (generally industrial facilities in sectors like chemicals, metals, automotive components and power; and those that generate more than 10 tons of hazardous waste each year.)We gathered data on all facilities that reported their emissions in the most recent three years available (2021-2023) and used their most recent report for each type of pollutant. Some facilities had no reports for certain types of pollutants in certain years.To calculate the total amount of heavy metals emitted  – lead, cadmium and arsenic, and their compounds – we used three-year averages for each.To calculate CO2 emissions for the entire metro region, we used 2022 emissions reports. It was the year with the most complete dataset, due to the fact that many of the largest reporters’ records were removed from the 2023 final report by the government as “inconsistencies”, which the regulator said meant there were reasons to suspect the reliability of the information. (Some heavy metals reports are also disqualified for being “inconsistent”.)To compare emissions in the US and Mexico, we analyzed analogous reports submitted by US polluters. The CEC itself publishes such national comparisons and has an initiative to improve the comparability of pollution reporting.But there are some differences in the data gathered in the US and Mexico – most notably the minimum reporting thresholds. For instance, in the case of lead, US facilities that use 45kg per year must report their lead emissions; while, in Mexico, plants that use 5kg must report. In the case of cadmium and arsenic, Mexico requires reporting by plants that use at least 5kg of a substance; whereas the US standards do not require reporting by facilities unless they handle at least 4,530kg.We found that the vast majority of emissions in both countries come from large reporters. The comparisons were designed to focus on large reporters.As part of our right-of-reply process, we sent letters outlining our findings to the top emissions reporters. In consequence we removed reports from two facilities, Forja de Monterrey and Tenigal, from our heavy metal emissions totals because the companies demonstrated that their reports were in error.Comparisons of Monterrey’s fine-particulate pollution with other metro areas, including Los Angeles, are based on a 2025 study led by researchers at George Washington University. They used data from satellites, air monitors and computer models to look at pollution levels in 13,189 metro areas around the globe over a 20-year-period.We analysed this data to focus on metros with populations over 1 million in the North American free trade zone countries of Mexico, the United States and Canada. The year 2020 was excluded from this analysis because of the pandemic, when emissions temporarily plunged in many places (though fine-particulate pollution estimates increased in Monterrey that year as well).Editors: Alastair Gee, Alejandra XanicData editor: Will CraftData visualization: Andrew WitherspoonFactchecking: Bojana PavlovićWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmerica's dirty divideAir pollutionPollutionAmericasHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Massachusetts and Connecticut last year became thefirst states to banthe use of Pfas in turnout gear, and Illinois enacted a ban this year.Turnout gear, including jackets, pants, boots, gloves and other protective equipment that firefighters wear, is treated heavily withPfas, making it resistant to water and heat, and helping the textiles breathe.But occupational cancer is the leading killer of firefighters nationwide, and the regular exposure to the highly toxic Pfas is thought to be a driver of the deaths. The International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) estimates cancer from turnout gear accounted for 66% of firefighter deaths from 2002 to 2019.The bill would also require testing of the city fire houses’ water supplies, and establish a voluntary program that allows firefighters to test their blood for Pfas.The New York city council minority leader, Joann Ariola, a Queens Republican who authored the bill that has bipartisan support, noted that safer options were readily available.“Those carcinogens are in their [turnout gear] and they are wearing it over and over and over, and occupational cancer is the number one killer of firefighters,” Ariola said. “We have to do something to protect our protectors.”Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they can accumulate in humans and the environment. The compounds are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems.Pfas can be absorbed through the skin, and they are volatile, meaning they can effectively break free from textiles and move into the air where they are inhaled, or end up on surfaces in the firehouse.A 2020 University of Notre Damestudythat tested 30 samples of new and used turnout gear found they contained alarming levels of fluorine, a marker of Pfas. Turnout gear has three components – a thermal layer that presses against skin and includes a moisture barrier, and the outer shell that provides heat resistance.Notre Dame researcher Graham Peaslee found high concentrations of flourine on the moisture barrier and outer shell, meaning the chemicals are probably absorbed by the skin, while the Pfas in the outer shell end up in the environment at the station or elsewhere.“Could some of these chemicals come off on the thermal layer and get into the skin? The answer is probably,” Peaslee said in a statement.The proposal has the backing of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, the union that represents most of the city’s firefighters.“Cancer is the number one killer of firefighters, and we can’t keep kicking this can down the road,” said the UFA vice-president Bobby Eustace. “This stuff is killing us, and we need to protect ourselves.”The department’s administration has expressed some support for the idea of switching to Pfas-free gear, Ariola added, but it has yet to take action. The new law puts in place a 2028 deadline for the department to transition.Several New York City firefighters are involved in an ongoingclass-action suitagainst chemical companies and turnout gear producers. It alleges that industry knowingly put the firefighters at risk, and is part of dozens of similar suits nationwide.State efforts to move to Pfas-free gear have been fiercely opposed by the American Chemistry Council, the trade group that represents Pfas producers, and the turnout gear industry.The bans “may have unintended consequences for the performance of PPE that our firefighters need”, the ACC previously said in a media statement. “[It] is designed to withstand extreme hazards they face on the job, including exposure to open flames, high temperatures, and potentially dangerous combustion by-products.”However, the tide may be fully turning against the chemical makers. The National Fire Protection Association, which sets firefighter protective gear standards, in Septemberupdated the standardsto allow for Pfas-free turnout gear, and more departments are expected to follow New York City’s lead.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkPfasnewsShareReuse this content"

A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that consolidating China’s seven existing diplomatic sites in London into a single embassy “clearly brings security advantages”.The Chinese government has agreed to combine all its diplomatic premises inLondoninto the Royal Mint Court site, which spans 20,000 sq metres near Tower Bridge in London.The final decision on whether to grant planning permission has been delayed to 20 January, around the time when the prime minister is planning to travel toChinafor bilateral talks. It is the third time ministers have deferred the decision.Starmer would be the first prime minister to visit Beijingsince Theresa May in 2018. In a speech on Monday night, he argued that the government could not continue to blow “hot and cold” on China and needed to strike a balance.“We had the golden age, which then flipped to an ice age. We reject that binary choice,” he said, describing China as a “nation of immense scale, ambition and ingenuity” and “a defining force in technology, in trade and global governance”.“Our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism,” Starmer said.In a letter sent to concerned parties and released by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said their departments had “carefully considered the breadth of considerations” related to the proposed embassy.They said they had worked with police and others to ensure national security issues had been addressed and recognised “the importance of countries having functioning diplomatic premises in each other’s capitals, whilst maintaining the critical need to uphold and defend our national security”.The plan has met fierce opposition from some local residents and campaigners who are concerned about Beijing’s human rights record in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region.Several protests have taken placenear the site in recent months.A government spokesperson said: “An independent planning decision will be made by the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government in due course.”“The Home Office and Foreign Office provided views on particular security implications of this build in January and have been clear throughout that a decision should not be taken until we had confirmed that those considerations had been completed or resolved, which we have now done.“Should the planning decision for a new embassy in the London borough of Tower Hamlets be approved, the new embassy will replace seven different sites which currently comprise China’s diplomatic footprint in London which clearly brings security advantages.”China bought the Royal Mint Court site for £255m in 2018, but its plans to build an embassy there stalled afterTower Hamlets council refused planning permission in 2022.The Conservative government declined to intervene but Labour took the matter out of the council’s hands by calling it in soon after taking power last summer.Explore more on these topicsChinaForeign policyAsia PacificKeir StarmerLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Magistrates’ powers will be extended from dealing with maximum sentences of one year to at least 18 months, he said, and a new judge-led court will be established.The deputy prime ministerhas backed downon plans to remove jury trials for all cases involving a maximum jail term of five years after an outcry from MPs, lawyers and campaigners.The proposals are closely aligned with the sentencing review by the retired judge, Sir Brian Leveson, who had suggested diverting more offences to magistrates courts or to a new intermediate court called the crown court bench division.The government has said:Jury trials will be reserved for cases in “indictable-only” offences such as murder and rape and “either-way” offences with a likely sentence of more than three years in prison.Defendants in “either-way” offences with likely sentences of three years or less will no longer be able to choose a jury trial.Magistrates court sentencing powers will be increased from one year to 18 months. The powers could also be extended to 24 months if necessary.A new tier of judge-only “swift” courts will be created to hear cases without a jury.There were about 15,000 cases dealt with by jury trial in the year to June, according to criminal court statistics. Under the new proposals, civil servants estimate that 2,500 of those would have been heard in the new “crown court bench division” and 5,000 by magistrates. The remainder would have been heard by juries.The move means defendants accused of burglary, theft, fraud, sexual assault, stalking, sharing indecent images, drug dealing and criminal damage up to £10,000 could be denied the right to put their case to a jury.Lammy told MPs: “As Sir Brian has made clear, investment is not enough. The caseload is projected to reach 100,000 by 2028 and without fundamental change, could keep rising, meaning justice will be denied to more victims, and trust in the system will collapse.“Mr Speaker, to avoid that disaster, I will follow Sir Brian’s bold blueprint for change.”Labour MPs said the changes would make it harder for defendants and may not reduce the backlog.Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, said jury trials only accounted for 3% of cases, asking how much difference curbing them would make. “It’s hard to see how this measure … will address that backlog,” she said.Clive Efford, the MP for Eltham and Chislehurst and a leading member of the Tribune group, said it could penalise working-class defendants and could lead to an “us-and-them in the criminal justice system”.Richard Burgon, the left-leaning MP for Leeds East, said the policy sent “a chill through my heart”, and compared it to policies enacted by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.“Doesn’t the justice secretary want to think again?” he said.Writing on X, Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said the proposals were a “massive mistake” and would never get through parliament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the entire house is also concerned about the many women who will undoubtedly suffer miscarriages of justice if the right to trial by jury is curtailed,” Abbott said.Helena Kennedy, the Labour peer and human rights barrister, said Lammy’s claim that rape victims were missing out on justice because of delays fuelled by jury trials was “shameful”.She told Times Radio that those calling for curbs on jury trials usually had a “snooty view of the general public’s ability to try a case”.“I think that we should recognise that this would be the end of jury trial,” she said.A memo leaked last week had suggested Lammywas looking at going further, making jury trials applicable only for public interest offences with possible prison sentences of more than five years, removing the ancient right of thousands of defendants to be heard before a jury.The justice secretary suggested on Sky News that discussions in cabinet had led to the current proposals, raising the prospect there had been a backlash to such radical reforms.Lammy will face opposition from human rights organisations, barristers and some race campaigners who believe there should be no erosion of the right to a jury trial.Riel Karmy-Jones KC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said the proposals bring “a wrecking ball” to a system that has been in place for generations. “Juries work – they do their job superbly, and without bias. Juries have not caused the backlog,” she said.A review conducted by Lammy in 2017 concluded that juries remained “fit for purpose” and “act as a filter for prejudice”.Speaking in the Commons, the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “His past is catching up with him, because the best opponent of the justice secretary’s plans to curb jury trials is the justice secretary himself.View image in fullscreenRobert Jenrick, the Conservative MP and shadow justice secretary, speaks in the House of Commons.Photograph: House of Commons/PA“In 2020 he said: ‘Criminal trials without juries are a bad idea. You do not fix the backlog with trials that are widely perceived as unfair.’ In 2017, in his report into prejudice in the criminal justice system, he found juries, and I quote, ‘act as a filter for prejudice’.“But now he’s become justice secretary, he’s scrapping the very institution he once lauded. Which is it? Will the real David Lammy please stand up.”Jenrick also brought up previous comments made by Keir Starmer, saying: “And what about this? ‘There should be a right to trial by jury in all criminal cases.’ Any ideas, Mr Speaker?

In 2003 he paid a £1m premium plus £7.5m upfront for refurbishment and agreed to pay a “peppercorn rent (if demanded)”.The crown estate also revealed details of Forest Lodge, the new home of the Prince and Princess of Wales. It said William and Catherine, who moved into the property during the October half-term, held a 20-year non-assignable lease on the property and were paying “open market rent”, but gave no further details. “Negotiations were conducted on an arm’s length basis to ensure appropriate market terms were agreed,” the crown estate said.It also provided information on other homes including the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh’s Bagshot Park and Thatched House Lodge, leased by Princess Alexandra, in London’s Richmond Park. The inquiry will examine the value for money to taxpayers.The committee will consider what witnesses to call to give evidence once it has considered all the written submissions. In theory it could summon Mountbatten-Windsor to appear. But there is no precedent in modern times for a member of the royal family giving evidence in person to a parliamentary committee, and the committee does not have the power to force him to attend.In its briefing to the committee, the crown estate – an independent commercial business and public corporation – said: “Our initial assessment is that while the extent of the end-of-tenancy dilapidations and repairs required are not out of keeping with a tenancy of this duration, they will mean in all likelihood that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor will not be owed any compensation for early surrender of the lease … once dilapidations are taken into account.”Mountbatten-Windsor gave the minimum 12 months’ notice that he would surrender the lease on 30 October. If no end-of-tenancy repairs had been required, he would have been entitled to £488,342.21 for ending his tenancy on 30 October 2026.The crown estate said that in determining the Royal Lodge lease, relevant factors considered were the property’s location within Windsor Great Park, its state of repair and the security requirements concerning the Royal Chapel, which lies within the grounds of the property and was regularly used by the royal family at the time.Mountbatten-Windsor took out the lease on Royal Lodge and its eight cottages in 2003 after the death of the queen mother, who had lived there, and the property needed significant refurbishment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”The White House has repeatedly used popular songs, often tied to memes, in their social media content putting a glossy spin on raids that have spurred protests across the country. The latest video layers the most viral lyric from Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?” Carpenter asks, referring to sex positions – over several clips of ICE agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing different people, only some of whom have their faces blurred.Taylor Swift’s silence on the Trump administration using her music speaks volumes | Alim KherajRead moreEarlier this month, the White House used the same formula on Carpenter’s friend and collaboratorTaylor Swift. That video used Swift’s recent track The Fate of Ophelia over a montage of Trump’s many social media posts disparaging the megastar, whoendorsedKamala Harris in the 2024 election. Swift has not publicly commented to the president’s use of her music.The White House continued to refer to Carpenter’s music in a statement on her comments. “Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson, referencing Carpenter’s 2024 album Short n’ Sweet and her recent single Manchild.Carpenter joins many other artists, fromBeyoncéto theFoo Fighters, who have condemned the Trump team’s use of their music for promotional purposes, and is the latest to be embroiled in the Trump administration’s efforts to put a cheeky spin on its immigration crackdown. Earlier this month, pop singer Olivia Rodrigo reportedlycondemnedthe Department of Homeland Security’s use of her songall-american bitchto soundtrack a video encouraging undocumented people to voluntarily leave the US. “Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” she wrote in now deleted posts on social media.Weeks prior, Kenny Logginsblastedthe administration’s use of his song Danger Zone in a widely decried, AI-generated video depicting Trump dumping human feces on protesters in New York City. In astatementposted to his website, Loggins said he did not authorize the use of the song for the video, widely considered to be Trump’s retort to the nationwideNo Kings protestsagainst his second presidency.“Nobody asked for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on the video is removed immediately,” he said. “I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together.”Earlier this summer, the British singer Jess Glynne was more blunt, after the White House used her 2015 single Hold My Hand – repopularized by theviral Jet2 holiday advert– to soundtrack a video promoting its many ICE deportations. “This post honestly makes me sick,” she wrote on social media.“I’m devastated to see my song used in this way,” she latertoldthe Guardian. “Hold My Hand was written about love, support, and standing by someone through everything – it’s meant to offer hope and empowerment. Using it to promote something I fundamentally disagree with goes completely against the message of the song.” Jet2 also condemned the video, saying it was “disappointed to see our brand being used to promote government policy such as this”.As with the video using Carpenter’s song, the White Housepostedthe Glynne song clip to its official social media channels, along with the caption: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”Olivia Rodrigo condemns Trump administration’s use of her music for ‘racist, hateful propaganda’Read moreIn the 10 months since Trump took office for a second time, the US president hassuperchargedthe country’s immigration enforcement, authorizing a sweeping system of mass arrests, incarcerations and deportations. Human rights experts have raised numerous concerns about the detention of children with their parents, as well as the arrest of people without charge or due process. Official White House social media posts often celebrate these arrests and thefear they have instilledin immigrant communities across the country, as part of what Trump claims is an effort to fight violent crime.Though Trump has maintained that his administration seeks to deport “dangerous criminals”, Guardian analysishasfoundthat most of the people arrested by ICE have never been convicted of a crime.Earlier this week, the Trump administrationannounceda total pause in asylum decisions, leaving 1.5 million people seeking residence in legal limbo. As part of his immigration system crackdown, Trump hasvowed to“permanently pause” migration from “third world” countries, in response to theshootingof two national guard members in DC by a suspect who is an Afghan national.Explore more on these topicsSabrina CarpenterICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationDonald TrumpUS immigrationPop and rockUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Indian government denied any privacy implications, stating that Sanchar Saathi “does not automatically capture any specific personal information from you without intimation on the application”.According to Reuters, Apple is among the big tech companies that is reportedly refusing to comply with the edict, while otherlarge tech companies have yet to respond publicly.The app, described as a citizen-centric safety tool, allows users to block and track lost or stolen mobile phones and check how many mobile connections are registered under their name, helping to identify and disconnect fraudulent numbers used in scams.It also helps report suspected fraudulent calls and verify the authenticity of used devices – particularly to check they aren’t stolen – before buying.The order for mandatory installation was quietly given to phone manufacturers by the Indian government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, last week.After it was made public, it was confirmed by the telecom ministry, who described it as a security measure to combat the “serious endangerment” of cybersecurity and fraud that is rampant in India, as well as a means to regulate India’s secondhand phone market.It has been met with outcry by the political opposition, as well as digital freedom activists and groups, who claimed it was a way for the government to gain unfettered access to the 730m smartphones in the country and track people through their phones.KC Venugopal, a leader in the opposition Congress party, said the party would protest against the “dystopian” ruling, adding: “Big Brother cannot watch us.”The internet freedom foundation said it would “fight this direction till it is rescinded”.Priyanka Gandhi, another senior Congress party leader, condemned it as a “snooping app” that violated citizens’ basic right to privacy.According to three sources who spoke to Reuters, Apple intends to refuse to comply with the order, due to significant security concerns. Speaking anonymously, those at the company emphasised that internal policy stipulated that Apple does not comply with such orders anywhere in the world, due to the security and privacy risks they posed to Apple’s iOS operating system. Apple did not respond to official requests for comment.According to the app’s privacy policy, iPhone users will be asked permission to share access to cameras, photos and files. Android users – who represent 95% of India’s smartphone market – will be asked to share call logs, send messages for registration, make and manage phone calls “to detect mobile numbers in your phone”, as well as grant access to cameras and photos.It was reported initially that the government had instructed tech companies to ensure the app could not be disabled. But speaking on Tuesday, the communications minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, denied this. “Keeping it on their devices or not is up to the user,” he said. “It can be deleted from the mobile phone just like any other app.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaSmartphonesAppsMobile phonesApplenewsShareReuse this content"

But recently that quality has been sorely lacking in Brussels, which has gone a record-breaking 542 days without a government.The Brussels Capital Region, which governs the Belgian capital of 1.25 million people, has not had a government since elections in June 2024.The city has now surpassed the record of the country as a whole, which made headlines around the world in 2010-11 when it took541 days to form a government, the longest period to form an administration in peacetime.Brussels, however, like Northern Ireland, which went 729 days without a government, will escape the ignominy ofentering the Guinness World Records, which counts only sovereign states.The unhappy milestone was reached on Tuesday if you include election day, as most Dutch-language media do, although for some Francophone media the record will not officially be broken until Wednesday.Either way, it is unlikely Brussels will have a government anytime soon. Rancorous divisions, sometimes descending into personal insults, continue among the 14 parties that won places in the 89-seat parliament.This means deadlock in the self-styled capital of Europe, which hosts the EU institutions and Nato, amid a growing budget crisis, rising levels ofdrug-related violence, and homelessness as city authorities struggle to manage irregular migrants seeking a place to stay.An open letter signed by nearly 200 business, academic and cultural figures published on Monday lamented “541 days of seeing Brussels slide into an unprecedented institutional void and funding crisis”. Theletter, published in Belgium’s major newspapers, Le Soir and De Standaard, says “political inaction is now affecting our daily lives” and that the “immense challenges that Brussels needs to tackle – economic, social, climatic and institutional – can no longer wait”.The signatories, who include the historianDavid Van Reybrouck, the speculoos biscuit entrepreneur Antoine Helson and the political scientist Fatima Zibouh, urge Brussels leaders to meet in conclave on Tuesday to agree a government and budgetary path.At a protest against the political deadlock on Monday, about 500 Brussels residents booed politicians walking into the city’s parliament, the Belga news agency reported. Some carried signs reading: “Shame on you Brussels.”The deadlock is the result of an election in which the tax-cutting liberal Mouvement Réformateur party emerged as the largest francophone force, while the Flemish Groen, or greens, came top for Dutch-speakers. Adding complexity to cross-party talks is the fact that the Brussels government has a fixed quota of ministerial posts for both language groups to protect the interests of Dutch-speaking voters, who are a minority in the bilingual capital.The francophone Socialists have ruled out a coalition with the Flemish nationalists, the NVA party of the country’s prime minister, Bart De Wever. The Socialists claim the NVA is an “anti-Brussels, anti-diversity” party. The Flemish liberal party, the Open VLD, meanwhile, refuses to join a Brussels government without the NVA and has referred to the Socialists as “an alcoholic addicted to public spending”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its chief executive, Olivier Andriès, told reporters in London on Tuesday that relations were “very strained” between the lead partners on the Future Combat Air System (known as Scaf in France)However, he added that the offices of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, wanted a solution. “Obviously the relationship betweenAirbusand Dassault is extremely difficult,” Andriès said. “Have we reached a breaking point or not on the question? I can’t answer.“I know that on the political side there is still very strong willingness on the French president’s side as well as on the German chancellor’s side to strike a deal and to solve it.”The Scaf would be a so-called sixth-generation fighter jet, combining stealth abilities with advanced electronics and weaponry – as well as potentially flying alongside drones. It would be produced at the same time as therival Global Combat Air Programme, or Tempest, which will be co-produced by Britain’s BAE Systems, Italy’s Leonardo and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and theUS’s F-47 fighter, to be built by Boeing.However, many analysts and industry leaders – including Airbus’s chief executive – have openly mused about whether separate European projects should duplicate efforts to build the planes.Andriès said that cooperation in other parts of Scaf was nevertheless “very smooth”. Safran and Germany’s MTU Engines carried out detailed work to allocate responsibilities at the outset, he added.The chief executive’s comments came during a visit to lobby UK government ministers and express willingness to invest in Britain. Although headquartered in France, Safran employs 5,500 people in the UK in various acquired businesses making landing gear, flight control machinery, seats and other parts for civilian and military aircraft.Andriès said that the company’s electric motors in Pitstone, Buckinghamshire, would play an increasing role in trying to develop crucial magnets that are not reliant on rare earth metals. Aerospace, defence and automotive manufacturers are scrambling to find alternatives to rare earths, afterChina, the dominant supplier, imposed export controlsin retaliation to the US trade war.“Supply chains have been weaponised,” Andriès said. “‘How can we reduce our dependency on rare earths?’ is going to be one thema in the UK.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added: “I don’t think that can have helped.”He defended the OBR’s decision toreassess its forecasts for the economy’s underlying productivityoutlook this summer. Reeves and Keir Starmer have expressed frustration that this rethink, which led to a downgrade in growth forecasts, had not taken place earlier.Miles said it had been important to wait until the impact of the big economic shocks of Covid and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had faded, and it would have been “trigger-happy” to move earlier.Explore more on these topicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesEconomic policyBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “I expect the vibes out there to be rough for a bit.”OpenAI’s flagship product has 800 million weekly users butGoogleis also highly profitable due to its search business and has substantial data and financial resources to throw at its AI tools.View image in fullscreenSam Altman.Photograph: José Luis Magaña/APMarc Benioff, the chief executive of the $220bn (£166bn) software group Salesforce, wrote last month that he had switched allegiance to Gemini 3 and was “not going back” after trying Google’s latest AI release.“I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane – reasoning, speed, images, video … everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again,” hewrote on X.OpenAI is also delaying a foray into putting advertising in ChatGPT as it focuses on improving the chatbot, which celebrated its third birthday last month.The head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, marked the anniversary with a post on X pledging to break new ground with the product.He wrote: “Our focus now is to keep making ChatGPT more capable, continue growing, and expand access around the world – while making it even more intuitive and personal. Thanks for an incredible three years. Lots more to do!”Despite lacking the cash flow support enjoyed by rivals Google, Meta and Amazon, which is a big funder of competitor Anthropic, OpenAI has received substantial funding from the likes of the SoftBank investment group and Microsoft. In its latest valuation, OpenAI reached $500bn, up from $157bn last October.OpenAI is loss-making and expects to end the year with annual revenues of more than $20bn, which Altman expects will grow to “hundreds of billion[s]” by 2030. The startup is committed to steep revenue growth after pledging to spend $1.4tn on datacentre costs to train and operate its AI systems over the next eight years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What happened next?Michael SainatoTue 2 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 17.59 ESTShareThousands ofStarbucksbaristas are on strike across the US, warning the world’s largest coffee chain to brace for the “longest and biggest” bout of industrial action in its history.Barely a year after Brian Niccol, the Starbucks CEO, tried to draw a line under bitter divisions between its management and unionized workers, pledging to “engage constructively” with them, the American coffee giant is now grappling with an escalating strike during its lucrative holiday trading season.About 2,500 workers are striking across 85 cities and 120 stores – and urging customers to steer clear. Starbucks claims less than 1% of its coffee houses have experienced disruption due to the industrial action.But the union, Starbucks Workers United, which represents 11,000 baristas at more than 550 stores, is threatening to escalate the strike far beyond its current footprint unless executives make concessions during contract negotiations.Four years after the first Starbucks-owned US store voted to form a union, defying intense resistance from the company, relations between the two sides have deteriorated.“It’s still shocking to me to wake up and have them every day still fighting us the way that they’re fighting us,” Michelle Eisen, spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United, told the Guardian. “Because we have proven time and time again that we’re not going anywhere.”For decades, Starbucks, founded in the 1970s, and taken over in the 1980s by Howard Schultz, who built it into the global coffee colossus it is today, successfully fought off unionization.The chain dubbed its workers “partners”, and promoted a package of “industry-leading” benefits, including healthcare coverage and education costs.“I’m not an anti-union person. I am pro-Starbucks, pro-partner, pro-Starbucks culture,” Schultztold employeesin 2022. “We didn’t get here by having a union.”View image in fullscreenBaristas and supporters picket outside a Starbucks in New York last month.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersBy then, however, cracks had already started to appear in the dam. The previous year baristas at a store in Buffalo, New York, voted 19-8 in favor of unionizing – setting the stage for hundreds of outlets across the US to follow suit.Michelle Eisen started working at the Buffalo store in August 2010, to supplement her job as a production stage manager, in between theater shows.She was a longtime Starbucks customer, and trusted its reputation for treating workers well. And for years, Eisen felt valued as an employee, receiving regular wage increases and working around her production schedule.But things started to change in about 2016, according to Eisen. “We saw our benefits costs go up significantly. Those twice-a-year raises went away completely,” she said in an interview. “All of a sudden, we were getting one cost of living raise at the beginning of the calendar year, which, most of the time, was significantly less than the raises previous to that. And that’s really when we started to see the staffing levels slowly start to decline in these stores.”Four years later, things “really, really, really came to a head”, Eisen said.‘Coffee-making robots’: Starbucks staff face intense work and customer abuseRead moreStarbucks stores stayed open when Covid hit in 2020. Baristas were startled to encounterincreasingly aggressive and confrontationalcustomers, and some workers felt their pay was too low for what they believed had become more intense work in deteriorating conditions.Eisen, whose theater job was shut down due to the pandemic, took on as many hours as she could at Starbucks, but still struggled to make ends meet. After 11 years at the company, she was only making a few cents more an hour than a new hire. In 2021, she considered quitting.But then she started speaking with co-workers about organizing a union. A group of about 50 Starbucks baristas in the Buffalo areawent publicwith their plan in August 2021.“To me, it was a no-brainer,” said Eisen. “Because it gave an opportunity to try to address some of these problems, and fix them from the inside. And I was hoping, beyond hope, that it would work, we would be successful, and I wouldn’t have to leave. Because I didn’t want to.”Starbucks executives did not see the move as a no-brainer. Managers and corporate executives, including the chain’s then North American president, Rossann Williams, and Schultz,descendedon Buffalo in an effort to stop the effort to unionize.“No partner [employee] has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks,” Schultz wrote in a letter to workers. “And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now.”“They waged an absolutely vicious union-busting campaign,” claimed Eisen. “They still are, but it started there in Buffalo, from the very beginning. And against all odds, in spite of that, my store was able to win their union election on December 9, 2021 and became the first [unionized] store. And then it was kind of a whirlwind.”Since that first victory, mobilizing workers havewon more than 650 union elections, and lost about 120.The chain has since moved to closed 59 unionized stores, according to Starbucks Workers United. Others are still awaiting for results to be certified.As as a wave of mobilization started to sweep the firm’s ranks in early 2022, its top tier was overhauled. Three months after the Buffalo vote, Starbucksabruptly announcedits CEO, Kevin Johnson, was standing down, and Schultz, its veteran boss, would return for a third stint in charge.Shares in Starbucks were under pressure, costs were rising as Covid continued to disrupt supply chains, and – while the firm continued to generate billions of dollars in sales every quarter – customers were spending less time inside its stores.Starbucks stock price has fluctuated across three different CEOsSchultz was tasked with turning around a business many on Wall Street felt was losing its way. Many of his freshly unionized baristas agreed. But Schultz declined to work with Starbucks Workers United,declaringhe would never embrace the union, and offering new benefits and pay increases to non-union workers.“It was just infuriating that we were being bullied in this way, and made to feel like we were doing something wrong, because we were trying to hold the company accountable and trying to make them better,” said Eisen.A new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, was tapped later that year. Unionized baristas started to take action, including by demonstrating on the chain’s “red cup day” holiday in November 2022 and 2023.Relations slowly improved. In early 2024, Starbucks and Starbucks Workers United agreed a new framework for collective bargaining agreements, sparking hope of a first union contract by the end of that year. Workers at unionized stores were granted the benefits that had been given to non-union workers in 2022.But the chain’s business woes appeared to worsen, with competition mounting and footfall declining. Narasimhan was ousted after 16 months as CEO last year, and replaced by Brian Niccol, the Chipotle boss.Bargaining stuttered to a halt following Niccol’s arrival, according to the union. “The company picked right back up where they left off at the end of 2023, when it came to violating workers rights,” said Eisen. “And we still don’t have a contract.”View image in fullscreenA Starbucks outlet in New York.Photograph: Adam Gray/Getty ImagesNiccol moved fast in an effort to turn around the chain,launchinga “Back to Starbucks” campaign, aimed at reversing declining sales. Hefaced criticismafter it emerged he would commute from his home in Newport Beach, California, to the firm’s Seattle headquarters, rather than relocate.Progress at the bargaining table, meanwhile, stalled. Niccol remained mum on the union, and its pursuit of a first union contract.“The changing of CEOs within the last five years alone has kind of shown that this company has a lot it’s still figuring out,” Zarian Antonio Pouncy, who has worked for 11 years as a barista in Las Vegas, told the Guardian. His store unionized in late 2023.Pouncy said: “Instead of listening to the partners – listening to those on the forefront, dealing with the business every day – they’re relying too much on leadership in their opinion, and AI, algorithms and numbers, to kind of show them how business works.”Julie Su has been watching closely. As US deputy secretary of labor, and acting labor secretary, between 2021 and 2025, she helped oversee the Biden administration’s efforts to reinvigorate the US labor movement – as thousands of Starbucks baristas voted to unionize.“When workers choose a union, they deserve a contract,” Su told the Guardian. “Too often, it takes a long time to get one because the employer uses delay as a weapon.“The time to a first contract is used to punish workers for unionizing, to undermine the effort, or to send a message that there is no benefit to joining a union because nothing changes at work for years. Usually all of the above. This is unacceptable.”On average, it takesabout 15 monthsfor a union to secure a first contract with an employer, often due to delays and obstruction by management. At Starbucks, nearly 48 months have passed since the Buffalo store voted to unionize.“The other way this operates as a specific tool for union-busting in the case of a company like Starbucks is the company tries to wait out its employees, hoping that they leave before a contract is reached,” added Su.View image in fullscreenIn this 2021 picture, Starbucks employees in Buffalo celebrate after winning their union election to become the first unionized store in the US.Photograph: Joshua Bessex/APStarbucks Workers United hasfiledhundreds of unfair labor practice (ULP) charges with the National Labor Relations Board. Dozens of union leaders have been fired, allegedly in retaliation for their union support. Starbucks denied this in all cases, although several workerswon reinstatements.Tensions simmered. Starbucks Workers United claimed baristas at several hundred stores walked off the job last December. And in April, union delegates voted to reject a contract proposal from the company which would have guaranteed annual raises of at least 2%, dismissing the increase as “not good enough”.On 13 November – “Red Cup Day”, inside the Starbucks empire – more than a thousand US workers walked off the job, demanding the chain present a “fair” contract. The chain played down the strike’s impact.The union escalated. A week later, the action was expanded to 65 cities and 95 stores, with 2,000 workers on strike. Starbucks Workers United also staged a blockade of Starbucks’ largest distribution center on the US east coast, in York, Pennsylvania.On 24 November, Starbucks workers rallied outside the company’s corporate office in Newport Beach, Niccol’s part-time base, to demand the company finish the contract.On 28 November, the strike was expanded further. About 2,500 baristas across 120 stores are now involved, according to the union.“The company has been stonewalling us,” said Diego Franco, a Starbucks barista for six years in Chicago. “My store chose to go out on Red Cup Day, the busiest sales day for the company, because we were frankly fed up.“You can’t expect us to continue to come into work, to continue to push policies and procedures that don’t actually fix any of the problems that we face at work – not just for my co-workers, but for the customers and our regulars. I would much rather stand outside in the cold and be on strike than know that I’m showing up to work where I’m constantly being disrespected by our CEO, and by upper management.”Contacted for comment, Starbucks played down the impact of the strike so far, andclaimedto have seen record holiday sales so far this year.“As we’ve said, 99% of our 17,000 US locations remain open and welcoming customers – including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened,” said Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks. “Regardless of the union’s plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption.“When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we’re ready to talk. The facts are clear: Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging $30 per hour for hourly partners. People choose to work here and stay here – our turnover is less than half the industry average, and we receive more than a million job applications every year.”View image in fullscreenA person holds a placard as Starbucks workers go on strike.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA growing number of progressive political leaders are unpersuaded by such reassurances. More than 100 members of Congresssignedletters demanding Starbucks return to negotiations with the union and finish the contract.“While workers are on strike, I won’t be buying any Starbucks, and I’m asking you to join us,” New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, wrote on social media. His transition co-chair, Lina Khan, and incoming first deputy mayor Dean Fuleihan havestoodon picket lines. Mamdani appeared on a picket line with Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday.Seattle’s mayor-elect, Katie Wilson,appearedon a Starbucks picket line hours after her acceptance speech, where she told workers and supporters: “Baristas are the heart and soul of this company, and they deserve better than empty promises and corporate union-busting.”Eisen left Starbucks in May, after 15 years. She currently serves as the principal spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.She said: “This company is being run into the ground, and these unionized workers are the only ones standing up and saying, ‘Hey, what are you doing? Our cafes are not places that people want to come spend time any more. They don’t want to come in and spend their money here because of the way you are running this business. You have to start investing in us if you want to see this company turned around.’“Workers are done, and they’re going to continue to escalate.“They’re going to continue to be on the unfair labor practice strike, and they are prepared to make this the longest and biggest strike in company history if the company doesn’t return to resolve these remaining issues.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsStarbucksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Was it worth the 18-year wait?Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 (version tested); Retro Studios/NintendoThe bounty hunter – Nintendo’s most badass and most neglected hero – returns in an atmospheric throwback sci-fi adventure that’s entirely untroubled by the conventions of modern game designKeza MacDonaldTue 2 Dec 2025 10.56 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 10.57 ESTShareIn a frozen laboratory full of cryogenically suspended experimental life forms, metal boots disturb the frost. A lone bounty hunter in a familiar orange exosuit points her blaster ahead. Making my way towards the facility’s power generator, scanning doors and hunting for secret entrances, broken hatches and hidden keys, I suspect that I know exactly what’s going to happen when this place begins to thaw; every clank and creak sounds sounds as if it could be a long-dormant beast busting out of one of those pods. And yet Samus Aran delves deeper, because she has never been afraid of anything.This section of Prime 4 is classic Metroid: atmospheric, eerie, lonely, dangerous and cryptic. Samus, Nintendo’s coolest hero, is impeccably awesome, equipped here with new psychic powers that accent her suit with pulsing purple light. (I have taken many screenshots of her looking identically badass all over the game’s planet.) She is controlled with dual sticks, or – much better, much more intuitive – by pointing one of the Switch 2’s remotes at the screen to aim. Or even by using it as a mouse on a table or your knee, though this made my wrist hurt after a while. She transforms into a rolling ball, moves statues into place with her mind, and rides a futuristic shape-shifting motorcycle across lava and sand between this distant planet’s abandoned facilities, unlocking its dead civilisation’s lost knowledge.In fact there is a lot of classic Metroid Prime in here. Things that I’ve been missing since these atmospheric adventures went on hiatus in 2007: the gradual unfurling of new powers and gadgets; theGiger-esquevisual design; patiently scanning everything with Samus’s visor for clues; the sedate pace of exploration, interrupted by sudden bursts of frenetic blasting when robots or aliens show up. It has some spectacular sights and moments: enormous boss creatures, the desert that stretches across the planet under unforgiving foreign sun, wolves that emerge from a blizzard like spectres.Alongside the Metroid series’ own ghosts, I was surprised to find echoes of other abandoned Nintendo sci-fi series in here, too. If you are still waiting for long-lost sequels to F-Zero or Star Fox, well, improbably, they’re in here: in the floaty controls of Samus’s motorcyle and its cyberspace training courses; in the way that flying creatures will sometimes arrange themselves in formation ahead of you, allowing you to paint them with your reticule and fire off a laser-fizzing disc to explode them.But there is also a lot that doesnotfeel like Metroid, and usually for the worse. Someone at either Retro Studios or its parent Nintendo was clearly worried that players may get lost wondering what on earth to do next, so Samus now has a companion who offers up suggestions for where she should go. Rescued engineer Myles MacKenzie caught a lot of flack during Metroid Prime 4’s preview period – justifiably, because he truly is spectacularly irritating, firing off Joss Whedon-esque quips to himself as Samus looks on in what I can only assume is silent judgement. Thankfully, he is present for all of 15 minutes before he confines himself to a basecamp at the end of the game’s first area, leaving Samus (and the player) to explore in peace.View image in fullscreenPeriods of patient exploration are interrupted by sudden bursts of frenetic blasting.Photograph: NintendoAside from offering a few unwelcome directions when I’d spent too long wandering the desert, Myles never turned up again unless I asked for his help. (In the abandoned facilities that make up the bulk of the game, his radio signal is scrambled so you couldn’t summon his voice even if you wanted to.) But Samus encounters more stranded soldiers over the course of the game, and unfortunately they areallannoying when they’re around, interrupting your exploration far too often with soundbites and unnecessary advice. The desert that connects all the different areas, meanwhile, is disappointingly empty. Especially in the later hours of the game, there is a lot of tedious zipping to and fro across this expanse, which feels distinctly un-Metroid (and unenjoyable), compared to the tight corridors and tense space-station fights that can be found elsewhere.Metroid Prime 4 feels, often, like an experimental game from 15 years ago. I cannot stress enough that this is mostly a good thing. It is wonderfully untroubled by the conventions of modern game design. Ironically, the wait for Prime 4 has been so long that what would have felt tedious or archaic in the past now feels comfortingly retro: things such as walking everywhere instead of using fast travel; or the slow, methodical cadence; or the predictable structure which has you fighting five different boss monsters in five different obvious arenas to collect five different keys. Other things are less forgivable, such as the spotty autosaving. Having to replay a full half-hour’s worth of exploration in a lava-encrusted weapons facility after an accidental death isnotfun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps that’s why so many writers this year have looked wistfully back to a time when strongly held convictions still made waves in the real world.InThe Revolutionists(Bodley Head), Jason Burke revisits the 1970s, when it seemed the future of the Middle East might end up red instead of green – communist rather than Islamist. It’s a geopolitical period piece: louche men with corduroy jackets and sideburns, women with theories and submachine guns. Many were in it less for the Marxism than for the sheer mayhem. Reading about the hijackings and kidnappings they orchestrated makes today’s orange-paint protests seem quaint by comparison.Owen Hatherley turns to a gentler kind of insurgency inThe Alienation Effect(Allen Lane) – a group biography of the architects, designers and directors from Mitteleuropa who washed up on Britain’s shores in the middle of the last century. We already know the assimilated conservatives – Friedrich Hayek and Karl Popper – but Hatherley gives us the forgotten radicals who put concrete into our skyline and shook us out of our complacency. Not everyone thanked them. Ian Fleming famously avenged brutalism by naming a Bond villain after one of its apostles, the Jewish architect Ernő Goldfinger.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PRA brutalist edifice slightly further afield is the subject of Lyse Doucet’sThe Finest Hotel in Kabul(Hutchinson Heinemann). Here, the BBC correspondent offers an empathetic chronicle of Afghanistan’s capital from the point of view of the Intercontinental – from its ballrooms and bikinis era in the 1970s to its function as a fortress staving off Taliban suicide bombers during the American occupation. It is, above all, a tribute to a people who, buffeted by invasion and civil war, remain cheerfully exuberant and fiercely resilient.Richard Beck turns the lens inward inHomeland(Verso), adding the US itself to the roll call of nations ravaged by the reaction to 9/11. In baroque, Pynchonesque prose, he argues that the paranoia exported to Iraq and Afghanistan came home to roost, ultimately mutating into authoritarian Trumpism. It’s a provocative though by no means sensationalist book, and you will come away from it convinced that not a single liberal has occupied the White House since 2001.View image in fullscreenThe most harrowing chapter in the story of the modern Middle East is narrated by Jean-Pierre Filiu. A slender addition to his definitive, door-stopping Gaza: A History,A Historian in Gaza(Hurst) is an unflinching eyewitness account of the destruction wreaked by Israel, with Anglo-American support. Look no further for an impartial account of the tragedy of the Palestinians, caught between Hamas’s fanaticism and Netanyahu’s ethnic cleansing. A veteran of war zones from Syria to Somalia, Filiu writes: “Now, I understand why Israel is denying the international press access to such a distressing scene.”That protesting Britain’s complicity in these crimes can get you arrested is a reminder that liberal democracies are not always liberal. InWhat Is Free Speech?(Allen Lane), Fara Dabhoiwala traces how a muddled brew of self-interest and idealism elevated his subject to a kind of civic creed from the 1720s onward. You may disagree with his conclusion – that free speech has gone too far in our polarised age – but there’s no denying the thoroughness of his approach.From one war of words to another: Minoo Dinshaw’sFriends in Youth(Allen Lane) revisits the English civil war through the lens of a shattered friendship, with one character ending up a royal propagandist, the other Oliver Cromwell’s crony. Written with a gracefulness rare among today’s historians, Dinshaw’s double biography closes with a centrist’s plea for friendship across factions – a message suited to our times, with both main parties struggling to muster even a fifth of the popular vote.View image in fullscreenMinority Rule by Ash SarkarCentrism, Ash Sarkar argues in her sparky polemicMinority Rule(Bloomsbury), has fallen out of favour because left-liberals and rightwing culture warriors alike have succumbed to the siren call of identity politics. “It’s bananas,” she says of all the smug chatter about safe spaces and decolonisation. Better, she insists, for workers to set aside the narcissism of small differences and unite against the elites who’ve handed them a raw deal – from austerity to the gig economy.The rawest deal of all tends to get handed to women, as Emily Callaci discovered on the frontlines of parenthood. InWages for Housework(Allen Lane), she recounts the movement that demanded pay for the unsalaried labour of mothers and housewives. Her vivid portraits revive a feminism both more radical and more mischievous than some contemporary forms. It certainly didn’t find favour with men on the left, who dismissed the Paduan firebrand and International Feminist Collective founder Mariarosa Dalla Costa and her supporters as “castrators … navel-gazing perverts, obsessed with masturbation and artificial insemination”.Julia Ioffe’sMotherland(William Collins) traces the arc of Russian womanhood from revolutionary emancipation to Putin’s patriarchal restoration. Through a series of scintillating portraits, she shows how post-Soviet machismo, endorsed by the Orthodox church, has turned submissiveness into a virtue again. Beside Russia’s new breed of dutiful tradwives, Mad Men’s Betty Draper looks like a suffragette.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

InThose Passions(Thames & Hudson), he composes a requiem for the entwinement of art and revolution. His canon of political painters includes not only agitprop heroes such as Kazimir Malevich and Alexander Rodchenko but also Rembrandt and Henri Matisse. With a dry wit he chastises his fellow travellers for dreaming about utopias while neglecting to build real socialism in the here and now.Two American optimists take the opposite view. Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson preach the gospel of techno-utopianism inAbundance(Profile), a Marmite manifesto for growth and deregulation. Forget redistribution, they urge: just build, build, build. Solar power stations and skyscraper farms will together create a world of plenty. Detractors might call it Panglossian, but alongside all the calls for degrowth or laments about decline, its swagger and confidence feel like a tonic.Reality intrudes with Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’sOriginal Sin(Hutchinson Heinemann), a chronicle of America’s gerontocratic farce. Their account of Joe Biden’s cognitive decline – his confusion at the presidential debate (“We finally beat Medicare”) and the introduction of Volodymyr Zelenskyy as “President Putin” – as well as failed cover-up attempts by the Democratic establishment, speak volumes about the imperial nature of the presidency and the feudal loyalty it inspires among party members. The gaslighting ultimately backfired, ruining Kamala Harris’s chances and paving the way for the return of “10,000 tariff grandpa”, as America’s ochre overlord is called in China.It’s not as though Britons can claim moral superiority. InUngovernable(Macmillan), former Tory chief whip Simon Hart offers up diaries from the Johnson-Truss years that make the Marquis de Sade read like Hans Christian Andersen. The picture that emerges is a damning indictment of our ruling class featuring, among other delights, an MP found in flagrante with a dozen naked women in a Bayswater brothel, convinced he was about to be blackmailed by the KGB – and that’s before you even get to the spectacle of a Jacob Rees-Mogg riding the world’s fastest zipline in a tweed three-piece suit.View image in fullscreenPatrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund’sGet In(Bodley Head) describes the subsequent hangover. Their account of strait-laced Starmer’s rise shows a man powered less by charisma than by focus groups and psephological arithmetic. Labour’s triumph owed more to Tory implosion than any enthusiasm for socialism, and the goodwill has since evaporated amid scandals over freebies, housing arrangements and endless reverse-ferrets – from winter fuel payments to benefits cuts. No one quite knows who is running the show. “Keir’s not driving the train,” one insider tells them. “He thinks he’s driving the train, but we’ve sat him at the front of the DLR” – London’s famously driverless Docklands Light Railway.To browse all politics and history books included in the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

More than any politician anywhere in the world in my adult lifetime, she looked like an actual member of the human race who was catapulted to office too fast to have acquired the defensive carapace of the professional politician. She was vulnerable and scrutable and likable in ways utterly alien to everyone else.Obviously this sympathetic film has been edited in such a way as to omit most of the hard business of internal politics and to foreground this humanity, although there is one fascinating moment at the very end when her partner Clarke Gayford gently asks if she might be doing too much; with a tiny flash of temper she asks if he is telling her to “delegate”. Gayford got his Denis Thatcher closeup there. Did we see a subliminal moment of the non-niceness vital for all successful politicians?Ardern was the target of misogyny – like Australia’s Julia Gillard – but never seems hardened, embittered or even changed all that much. The film, with intimate access, tracks her life with Gayford as she became the smart and personable new leader of theNew ZealandLabour party in 2017 and then, in short order, prime minister – first in coalition and then on her own, the world’s youngest female elected leader. (She even gave birth to a baby while in office.) Ardern dealt with the Christchurch mosque shootings with utter sincerity and compassion; she spent her political capital shrewdly at that moment by banning assault rifles. The world loved her for it.Then when Covid came along, Ardern had not only political skill but what Napoleon famously valued in his generals: she was lucky – at first. New Zealand seemed to have been miraculously spared the worst of the outbreak, but then a new wave struck, Ardern’s poll numbers dipped and an ugly new far-right anti-vax mob made their encampment outside parliament. The film shows how they were succumbing to the delicious thrill of bullying a woman. The sad thing is that there doesn’t appear to be much space for someone like Ardern in modern politics; less space than ever in fact.Prime Minister is out in Australia now and on HBO Max in the US, and in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsJacinda ArdernNew ZealandAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

The story of kids from the wrong side of the tracks in Tulsa, Oklahoma, always makes me, a kid who grew up in the leafy suburbs of south-east Melbourne, feel entirely at home.I consider The Outsiders to be the first gayfilm I saw – despite the fact it doesn’t have a single gay character in it. All that male beauty (including a teen Rob Lowe! Matt Dillon! Tom Cruise!) pushed to the front of the frame borders on the fetishistic. The expressive eyes of our sensitive working-class teen protagonist Ponyboy (C Thomas Howell) and his Greaser-gang pals Johnny (Ralph Macchio) and Dallas (Dillon). The cheekbones and jawlines, and the gentle ripple of upper-arm muscles. A pendant falling in the valley created by the muscles of a naked back. There is more than a hint of Jean Genet and Walt Whitman in the lighting and the centring of these male bodies, rugged and raw but leaning always into pure aestheticism.View image in fullscreenThe cast of The Outsiders: Emilio Estevez,  Rob Lowe, C Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze and Tom Cruise.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/AlamyOn one level, this is a movie about two types of straight boys – the working-class Greasers and upper-middle-class Socs – battling it out for a supremacy that was never in doubt, no matter who won the rumble. As Randy (Darren Dalton) tells Ponyboy, “Greasers will always be Greasers and Socs will always be Socs. It doesn’t matter.”While objectively class is the key dividing line in this work, neither Hinton nor Coppola seem particularly interested in exploring it. There’s clearly a social divide between the Greasers and the Socs but the film is content to establish the division and move on. Like its major antecedent, West Side Story, The Outsiders seems less interested in the nuances of social politics than in two groups of teenagers who despise each other.I grew up on what would have been considered the right side of the tracks but in my mind I was a Greaser – an outsider, a marginalised kid. I didn’t buy Soc cheerleader Cherry’s comment that “things are tough all over” because I knew precisely how tough they were for me, and that wasn’t “all over”. I loved the film because I could see a community of people rallying around Ponyboy – a character I could project my sexuality on to: sensitive, literate, introverted – in a way that seemed unlikely in real life. Nobody knew I was a Greaser; I was a Greaser of one.View image in fullscreenMacchio, Dillon and Howell.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyThat is a typical indulgence of adolescence, of course – the tendency to see yourself as tragically solitary; uniquely persecuted. The film powerfully underscores this by framing its narrative as one of banishment and return (it has a clear Eden metaphor at its centre). Ponyboy is thrust out of the family unit and then reintegrated, strengthening the community’s homosocial bonds. It’s a teenage hero’s journey, immensely appealing because it centres teenage agency as a bulwark against fate and inevitability. It’s an operatic film of emotional broad strokes and heightened angst.‘Tom Cruise was an intense kid’: How Francis Ford Coppola made The OutsidersRead moreRewatching The Outsiders as an adult, admittedly, is a strange experience. It’s a curiously sexless film, somehow, despite how sexy I found it in my youth. There are only two speaking parts for females, and only one of any significance, and even though Diane Lane brings a nobility and beating heart to Cherry’s fiery defiance, her function in the story is in no way sexual.Sure, there’s an offhanded misogynistic comment early on by Dallas but even he seems to lose interest in her as a sexual being. Eventually Cherry serves as a mediator between two worlds, a kind of female Charon ferrying the souls across the River Styx. She’s no Helen of Troy, in other words.As for the boys, there are two ways to look at them: strictly non-sexual or deeply homoerotic. Of course, for me there was only one way. And really, who in their right mind would see the film as strictly non-sexual? In the absence of females (isn’t it weird that the muscular Darry, dreamy Sodapop and even the outwardly randy Two-Bit don’t have girlfriends?), the film takes on a strange, unspoken sexual meaning about boys and men. It seems to imply that the true Eden is one where God created more Adams instead of an Eve; where the greatest thing men can do is fight each other in the rain.The Outsiders is streaming on SBS On Demand and Stan (Australia) and is available to rent in the UK and US).

Many expected it to play a huge part in the awards conversation, with key scenes surely destined to be shown in sizzle reel clips at endless prize ceremonies and invoked in endless op-ed pieces about fragile masculinity. But no. Now it is almost a modern filmmaudit, all but forgotten, a cursed film only now coming out quietly, and maybe its star ismauditas well.Majors plays Killian Maddox, an iron-pumping wannabe caring for his disabled grandfather and cultivating a fan obsession with the stars of the bodybuilding circuit. He is particularly keen on a preening beefcake named Brad Vanderhorn, whose magazine covers Killian plasters over the walls of his sad bedroom, and dreams of making it on to these covers himself. Killian is plagued with loneliness, depression and incipient mental illness, body dysmorphia and inability to connect with women. At one point he has a full-tilt, Travis Bickle-style disastrous date with Jessie (Haley Bennett), a co-worker at the supermarket where he has a day-job. And he is addicted to steroids, which trigger terrifying ’roid rage.But the film and Majors own career were sunk byhis 2023 conviction on two counts of assault and harassment against his then girlfriend. The situation seemed worryingly similar to the film’s scenario, only without its fictional reassurances that the man involved was fundamentally gentle. Magazine Dreams itself, though flawed by a cumbersome flashback structure in which he is talking to a counsellor, has powerful moments and Majors is very good, especially in the bizarre scene when Killian insists on going onstage at a bodybuilding event just after being beaten up. The plot twists to an interesting revelation about #MeToo style abuse, although the impact of this too was clouded by Major’s own life. Unclothed, Majors presents an amazingVesalian anatomyof pain.Magazine Dreams is in UK cinemas from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBody imageJonathan MajorsHealth & wellbeingHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the best thing I ever did. I do schools, universities, supermarkets, Christmas lights switch-ons … As soon as Santa comes along, everybody melts. One little girl brought her guinea pig, who leapt off her hand and dived straight into my Santa beard. The parents were in stitches while we tried to get him out. My favourite Christmas songs areEartha Kitt’s sultry version of Santa Baby, because it gets all the adults in the mood to get up and have a boogie with Santa, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, because the lyrics are so pure. No Christmas songs drive me mad. It’s Christmas: they’re all great.Paul Fessi‘Spike Jones is just so cheesy!’I know I look the part. I wear the green Santa outfit from before Coca-Cola turned him red and white to match their branding, but if I just put a Christmas hat on, people shout “Oi Santa!” at me. Someone said I look more like a fat elf, which is fair enough. I’ve had lots of funny incidents. I once felt a tug on my beard, looked down and there was a two-year-old dangling from it. I do Santa for the domestic abuse charityIDAS, distributing donated presents to child survivors. My favourite song is obvious:Do They Know It’s Christmas?, because Band Aid drew attention to global inequality. The song that drives me nuts is [Spike Jones’s 1948 hit] All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth. It’s just so cheesy. Really irritating!Arnold Warneken AKA Green Santa‘I’d rather hear a grime Christmas song’View image in fullscreen‘I wasn’t sure how the kids would process a Black Santa’: Cleve Freckleton AKA Rasta ClausI was teaching at a school for kids with special educational needs and they asked me to be Santa. I wasn’t sure how the kids would process a Black Santa, so I made up this jokey character, Rasta Claus. The parents loved it – their children are classed as “different” so it made sense for them to have a “different” Santa. One kid once said, “You’re not the real Santa”, so I said I was Santa’s cousin and worked for him. He believed we were related because we both have white beards – he didn’t see skin colour. I love how children think. My favourite festive songs areBaby It’s Cold Outside,Winter WonderlandandWhen a Child Is Born. None of them mention Christmas but they couldn’t be more Christmassy. I’d rather hear something different than hear Mariah Carey for the 1,000th time – maybe a grime Christmas song or a punk version of Silent Night.Cleve Freckleton AKA Rasta Claus‘I don’t like When Santa Got Stuck Up the Chimney for obvious reasons!’For me, Santa is the Christmas spirit. Families – especially with kids – are in awe, and you can feel the magic. It gets very hot in the costume, wig and beard. For the first hour you feel really uncomfortable, then your body starts to adjust. It’s always a challenge to go to the loo in costume. Kids always want to tell you what they want for Christmas, although you get some funny requests. A four-year-old girl told me she wanted a reindeer. My favourite song isUnderneath the Tree by Kelly Clarkson, because we did a choreographed dance to it in a Santa show and all the families joined in. The one I can’t bear is When Santa Got Stuck Up the Chimney for obvious reasons but I make a joke of it. I say, “It only happened once!”Joseph Ridgely‘Christmas Wrapping drives me bananas – though it’s a total earworm’View image in fullscreen‘On Boxing Day I have to get a beard trim, otherwise I can’t get rid of him’: Keith Leech.Photograph: Santa’s Calling YouI used to be a science teacher but one day my daughter said: “Dad, your beard’s gone white. You could play Father Christmas.” As soon as I put the outfit on I feel warm and fluffy inside. If kids go, “Is that beard real?” I tug on it and say: “It feels real to me.” On Boxing Day I have to get a beard trim, otherwise I can’t get rid of him. My favourite song is Jingle Bells, believe it or not, because like Santa it’s very jolly and Christmassy. The songs that drive me nuts are things I’ve heard too much, like [Slade’s] Noddy Holder shouting: “It’s Chriiiiiistmmmmassss!”Christmas Wrapping by the Waitressesdrives me bananas – the singing leaves a lot to be desired, although I have to admit the riff is a total earworm.Keith LeechThe 20 greatest Christmas carols – ranked!Read more‘Stop the Cavalry is a heartfelt plea to stop all war’My favourite Christmas song isJona Lewie’s Stop the Cavalrybecause it’s bouncy, has that wonderful brass section middle bit and is just a heartfelt plea to stop all war. I don’t likeNat King Cole’s The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgotbecause it’s just so sad – the boy hasn’t got any parents, so he gets nothing at Christmas. Being Santa can be heartbreaking – I’ve had a child say to me: “I only get one present but my friend gets 30. Does that mean I’m naughty?” – but it’s almost like a calling. I went to see a little boy in hospital who’d been in a terrible accident. When we got talking, the room fell silent and people started crying. Afterwards I was virtually rugby tackled by his mum and dad, who said: “That’s the first time he’s spoken for six months.” That’s the power of Santa.Nigel Harvey AKA Santa Himself‘You grin and bear Donny Osmond for the love of Christmas’‘If you hear any of them too often they drive you nuts’: Simon Anthony.Photograph: Santa’s Calling YouI’ve got a beard and wear braces. One day I was in a shop and someone shouted: “Oi Santa!” A couple of days later two blokes on bikes shouted the same thing. I thought: there must be something in this. So I became Santa. I must be convincing because a grandfather came up and said: “Thank you for the guitar you gave me when I was 12.” I love Doctor Who and am pretty sure that Santa is a Time Lord: lots of faces and the ability to charge around different places at different times. I’m a classical music buff so I’m very partial to Prokofiev’s Sleigh Ride. It was part of the trade test music when BBC Two was launched and I just loved listening to it there. If you hear any of them too often they drive you nuts. As a child I found Donny Osmond’s Christmas songs particularly distressing, but you grin and bear it for the love of Christmas.Simon AnthonyExplore more on these topicsMusicChristmasPop and rockMariah CareyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Riding around Cyrodiil on horseback, taking in its gleaming city and backwater towns, it was so easy to get drawn into unexpected shenanigans that closing the story’s threatening hell-gates became a distant second priority.Uno(2006)View image in fullscreenThe most addictive version of the classic card game… Uno on Xbox 360Photograph: Carbonated Games/MicrosoftLook – don’t @ us – Uno was one ofthemost important Xbox 360 games. It was the first game that many people ever played on webcam (for better or for worse), letting you see the expression on an opponent’s face when you played a wild draw four. It was one of the first downloadable multiplayer games that console players could enjoy. It was astonishingly moreish. Many, many times you’d pick up the controller intending on making a dent in Halo or Mass Effect, and instead be drawn into round upon round of late-night online Uno. We still sometimes hear the pleasing sound effects in our dreams.Viva Piñata (2006)View image in fullscreenDarwinian brutality? … Viva Piñata.Photograph: MicrosoftBuild a beautiful garden, attract colourful piñata-creatures to reside in it – then watch on as they all eat each other. The Darwinian brutality of Viva Piñata is a surprise in such a family-friendly-looking game, but it’s also just so compulsive. Many a hungover weekend in the 00s were spent trying to tempt bigger and more colourful predators to our lush mini-paradise. Horstachio for ever.BioShock(2007)Part dystopian adventure, part exploration of Ayn Rand’s objectivist philosophy, 2K Boston’s masterpiece has you exploring an undersea city built by a crazed billionaire with a fondness for drastic socio-scientific experiments. Would you kindly see the parallels to today’s tech bro oligarchs?View image in fullscreenModern parallels … Bioshock.Photograph: IrrationalHalo 3 (2007)View image in fullscreenAn endlessly enjoyable shooter… Halo 3Photograph: Xbox Game StudiosHalo has never again been as good as it was in the original trilogy. This one is a shooter of astonishing scale for its time, the concluding part of gaming’s most maximalist and justifiably self-serious space drama. Where most modern shooters are glorified rollercoaster rides, corridors linked together by triggered set-pieces, Halo is full of intelligent enemies and opportunities for emergent chaos. But what we all remember best is the multiplayer: tanks and Ghost airships and Warthogs all clashing in endlessly entertaining remixes of the same outrageous grand battles. Its Forge map editor and fully customisable game rules made it feel infinitely entertaining.Mass Effect(2007)View image in fullscreenBetter than Star Wars?… Mass EffectPhotograph: Electronic ArtsBioWare’s vast sci-fi trilogy may not have had an ideal ending, but its mix of interplanetary war and inter-species romance held fans enraptured for a decade, starting with this brilliant first game. Mixing role-playing elements with squad-based combat and a truly timely existential threat (a race of evil sentient spacecrafts), Mass Effect delivered a memorable space-opera story with characters you truly cared about.Fable II(2008)View image in fullscreenEasy to enjoy … Fable II.Photograph: MicrosoftLionhead’s perfectly British fantasy game is funny, snappy and very easy to enjoy. Perhaps too easy, as it’s over surprisingly quickly – but it has more heart and personality than any other Xbox role-playing game. It’s a mood-lifting fairytale with a heap of good ideas. Also, it has an excellent dog companion – though we may never forgive this game for what happens to it.Gears of War 2 (2008)View image in fullscreenThe ultimate testosterone-drenched cover shooter … Gears of War 2.Photograph: Epic GamesBuilding on the muscular foundations of its predecessor, Gears 2 is the ultimate testosterone-drenched cover shooter, pitching macho marines against alien locust monsters in an orgy of destruction and chainsaw machine guns. Plus, its thrilling Horde mode started a trend for wave-based survival challenges.Lost Odyssey(2008)View image in fullscreenLike a forgotten Final Fantasy… Lost OdysseyPhotograph: MistwalkerFor a brief period,Microsoftwas really determined to make the Xbox a thing in Japan. The company tempted a series of storied Japanese developers to make exclusive games for the 360. Most of them sank without trace, but Lost Odyssey is a standout in its genre: it’s about what happens to our humanity in the face of technological revolution. Given that it was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, a Final Fantasy veteran, it is perhaps unsurprising that it feels like a lost entry in that series.Ninja GaidenII (2008)View image in fullscreenChoreographed violence… Ninja Gaiden IIPhotograph: Team NINJABefore Dark Souls came along, it was Tecmo’s viciously difficult acton adventure that had players either grinding their teeth in frustration or gleefully hacking the limbs off adversaries. Beautifully choreographed combat, interesting locations and a wealth of razor-sharp weapons make this the interactive equivalent of those classic 1980s ninja movies.Rock Band 2(2008)View image in fullscreenRock out forever… Rock Band 2Photograph: Harmonix Music SystemsThe ultimate party game, for ever and always. After creating Guitar Hero, Harmonix handed that series over to a different developer and set to work on Rock Band, a peerlessly entertaining music game that had you singing, playing and drumming together on plastic instruments. Rock Band 2 not only had the best setlist, leaning towards milllennial-pleasing pop-punk and classic rock, but also the most frictionless play experience. You could be rocking out in moments, online or, much better, in person with friends.Limbo(2010)View image in fullscreenUnnerving … Limbo.Photograph: TriplePointThe art game that showcased Xbox Live Arcade as a venue for experimentation, Playdead’s quasi-horror puzzle platformer is an unnerving noir thriller about a boy searching a hellish monochrome world for his lost sister. Selling a million copies in its first year, it proved that there was – and still is – a mass audience for strange, abstruse gaming experiences.Forza Horizon (2012)View image in fullscreenFresh … Forza Horizon.Photograph: MicrosoftProject Gotham and Forza Motorsport preceded it, but Horizon felt like something fresh: a driving festival offering a range of experiences from circuit races to stunt challenges, all located in an exciting Colorado landscape crammed with enthralling roads and those ever-exciting vintage car barn finds. High-thrills video game tourism.Trials Evolution (2012)View image in fullscreenInsanely tricky… Trials EvolutionPhotograph: UbisoftUpon this game’s release, a huge percentage of the Xbox Live Arcade audience suddenly got really into intricate, physics-based motorbiking trials.

Then again, there are bigger problems in this gender-switched reworking of Arthur Conan Doyle’s tales of sleuthing than a mere Americanism tossed into Victorian-era Baker Street.These detective adventures take place in post-pandemic London. Joan Watson (Simona Brown), who tells us she is “not” a doctor, is an American on a grown-up gap year of sorts. An advert for a flatshare brings her to the apartment of Sherlock Holmes (Lucy Farrett), who emphatically tells us she is not called Shirley. Despite Watson’s reluctance to be there, and her suspicion of Holmes, they set about solving cases together.Under the direction of Sean Turner, it might be a satire or outright parody with shades of The Play That Goes Wrong (which Turner has directed). It gives off improv sketch vibes with ropey comic timing and pallid, overfamiliar jokes.The title’s “Ms” hints at covert lesbianism in an era when it could only be insinuated. Are Joan and Sherlock a same-sex blueprint for the likes of Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas? No such luck. American playwright Kate Hamill is on to a good idea but does not do nearly enough with it. Holmes might be a lesbian, Watson might swing both ways, but whatever frisson there is between the duo and the panoply of accompanying characters (all adeptly played by Tendai Humphrey Sitima and Alice Lucy) gives way to relentlessly plotty larks.View image in fullscreenToo elementary … (from left) Alice Lucy, Simona Brown, Lucy Farrett and Tendai Humphrey Sitima in Ms Holmes and Ms Watson – Apt 2B.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe underlying purpose behind Hamill’s central gender switch remains opaque because the play sticks so faithfully to Doyle’s purpose of solving one crime to the next. It is too elementary, in a sense, and neither as funny as you want it to be nor as serious. Instead it is jejune, reliant on types (including lazy “Irish” jokes) and with little probing beneath the surface of plot or character.Holmes rubs Watson up the wrong way with her eccentricities, drug-taking and insistence on turning everything (including Watson’s past) into a game of logical deduction. You can see Watson’s point. Holmes is a high-pitched character, delivering little more than cliches. In the end, you wish for less capering, more drama.AtArcola theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Arthur Conan DoyleCrime fictionFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

First seen off-Broadway in 2019, it is framed as a show created by best friends George and Harold, the duo Pilkey presents as the comic’s creators. Drawing on instalments from the series including A Tale of Two Kitties and Lord of the Fleas, the plot brings together familiar characters from the irreverent Dog Man world such as the dastardly cat Petey, his clone Lil’ Petey, the robot 80-HD and the cyborg fish Flippy.View image in fullscreen‘Breezily directed’ … a scene from the US tour of Dog Man: The Musical.Photograph: Jeremy DanielThe musical, aimed at over-fives, had several sell-out seasons off-Broadway and also toured the US. Its arrival in London will mark 10 years since the publication of the first Dog Man book. The character of a badly injured policeman who emerges from surgery newly sporting the head of his trusty mutt had previously appeared in Captain Underpants.Reviewing the 2019 production of the musical at the Lucille Lortel theatre, the New York Times’ Laurel Graeberwrote: “Breezily directed and choreographed by Jen Wineman, the show benefits from Tim Mackabee’s designs for the set and some small puppets, which preserve the novel’s comic-book feel.” Graeber praised Brad Alexander’s “high-energy score” and how lyricist Kevin Del Aguila imaginatively “preserved the novel’s wry parody of Charles Dickens”.The Dog Man series has sold more than 70m copies worldwide and has been translated into around 50 languages. A movie,Dog Man, and a video game, Dog Man: Mission Impawsible, were both released in the last year. The 14th book in the series,Big Jim Believes, was published in November.Pilkey said that the musical “surpassed my highest expectations” and left the audience “especially me, in complete awe”. He described the show as “the perfect mash-up of memorable music, humour and love”. Dog Man: The Musical is at theSouthbank Centre,London, from 30 July to 16 August.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's books: 7 and underChildren and teenagersChildren's theatreSouthbank CentrenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m not somebody that wants to dance on a table and, you know, sing songs for people.”She added: “It’s actually just a cruel job that was chosen for me as a young person that I don’t remember starting.”Foster’s first booking was at age three, ona commercial for the sunscreen lotion Coppertone. She had not intended to appear but accompanied her elder brother to the audition and charmed the casting agents.More adverts followed, before she began sitcom work in 1968 and made her first film at age six. Her childhood was filled with appearances on TV shows and in movies such as Tom Sawyer (1973). Three years later, at age 12, she was cast as a child prostitute in Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver.View image in fullscreenJodie Foster in the  1973 film Tom Sawyer.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyFoster said that her experiences at the time have meant she now finds herself “reaching out to the young child actors of this era. I feel like, wait, where are their parents? And why is nobody telling them that they should stop doing so many movies or maybe not be so drunk on the red carpet? I want to take care of them because I know how dangerous it is.”She also professed bafflement as to why people would today be drawn to the profession at all. “I don’t know why anyone would want to be an actor now, if they knew that in order to be excellent they would have to contend with being robbed of their life in a way. I don’t know how you make sense of that except to have what my mom helped me do, which is to have this very firm delineation between your private life and your public life.”Foster’s views diverge from thoseexpressedin 1987, when she told Interview magazine that she had loved acting as a child. “Some people get quick breaks and declare, ‘I’ll never do commercials! That’s so lowbrow,’” she said. “I want to tell them, ‘Well, I’m real glad you’ve got a pretty face, because I worked for 20 years doing that stuff and I feel it’s really invaluable; it really taught me a lot.”In Marrakesh, Foster did concede that her scepticism over the profession might have enhanced her ability to excel in it. “It makes my work a little bit different, because I am not interested in acting just for the sake of acting,” she said. “If I was on a desert island, I think probably the last thing I would ever do is act. So I was just trying to survive.”Foster’s latest film is Rebecca Zlotowski’s French-language comedy thrillerA Private Life. The actor said she felt at ease making the film as she had attended a French school from the age of three.“It’s a part of my personality that I just never get to use, and half my culture,” she said. “I love the global family of making films. It feels like they’re the same people wearing the same jeans and complaining about coffee at 3 in the morning. But it also allows me to open up and learn a new culture, too.”She also addressed shooting four consecutive films by female directors, after a career mostly spent being directed by men.“Until 15 years ago, when you look at the list for mainstream movies and you go down the director’s list, I never saw a female name,” she said, before highlighting the fallacy of only giving veteran directors big budgets.“If you’re making a movie that has a certain risk attached to it … they would say: ‘Wow, there’s no woman that’s directed a movie that cost $125m’ … The idea was not to give women these huge mega movies if they had not had any experience. How about giving women the experience first?”Explore more on these topicsJodie FosternewsShareReuse this content"

The decision to award her the prize was made the day before shedied, aged 79, last month following a long illness, said judging chair Peter Florence.The author won the award for her 2005 novel A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, a family drama described by Vintage Bollinger judgeClaudia Winklemanas “laugh out loud funny, utterly original and also deeply moving”. At the time of publication, the book was longlisted for the Man Booker prize and shortlisted for the Orange prize, now the Women’s prize for fiction.Lewycka’s partner, Donald Sassoon, and daughter, Sonia Lewycka, accepted the award on the writer’s behalf at a ceremony held in Westminster on Monday evening.The event also saw Rosanna Pike take home the 2025 award for her novel A Little Trickerie, for which she wins a pig being named after her book, a jeroboam and case of Bollinger Special Cuvée, and the complete set of the Everyman’s Library PG Wodehouse collection.The novel, described as “lovable, fun and emotionally juicy” by critic Imogen Hermes Gowarin the Guardian, was inspired by a real-life woman: Elizabeth, the “Holy Maid of Leominster,” in Hereford, who supposedly appeared as an angel in the priory there but was found to be a fraud. Pike imagines Elizabeth “with great panache: white-haired adolescent Tibb Ingleby is frankly and unashamedly herself from the first page, dancing and whooping with her mother ‘with a big hoot-hoot’,” wrote Hermes Gowar.Both Lewycka and Pike’s novels are published by Fig Tree, an imprint of Penguin, in the UK.View image in fullscreenMarina Lewycka is presented with a jeroboam of Bollinger in the presence of the customary pen of Gloucester pigs, after winning the Wodehouse prize in  2005.Photograph: Justin Williams/ShutterstockLewycka was named the winner-of-winners from an illustrious alumni list that features Jonathan Coe, Geoff Dyer, Ian McEwan, Terry Pratchett, Helen Fielding, Alexander McCall Smith, Percival Everett and Bob Mortimer among others.Florence, co-founder of Hay festival, said that while it seemed “daunting” to “garland one book among so many as the funniest book of the last 25 years”, the judges “came to a book that some people were discovering for the first time and were laughing aloud at and loving. [Lewycka] has us at the title, and she rocks us on every page. And it’s a book that is reshaped by the 20 years since it was first published, by both the history of Ukraine and the story of refugee experience in the UK. The comedy is somehow both darker and more vivid.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He learned and practised fashion internationally as a migrant in Paris, Milan and New York, and designed for such British institutions asDiana, Princess of Wales, and British Airways at its 1990s zenith.But he was rooted in the island of Ireland’s terroir, appreciating its fibres, wool and, especially, linen, by fingertip feel as much as eye. Fashion only rediscovered linen after synthetics lost appeal with the oil price shock of the mid 70s. ForIreland, and Costelloe, linen was always an essential resource.Costelloe, who has died aged 80, sustained his label profitably for 47 years, designing for it to the end: his 2025 collection closed the inaugural Irish fashion week in Dublin in October. Over that period of time, Ireland went from relative national poverty and isolation to a prosperous European country; in 1998, Costelloe, with habitual sass, described Irish women as “ambitious mutton who wouldn’t know style if it tottered up to them on 10-inch heels”.View image in fullscreenDiana, Princess of Wales, wearing an outfit designed by Costelloe, in a village near Port Harcourt, Nigeria, in 1990.Photograph: Martin Keene/PAWithin a decade he recanted the bitchery as women smartened up, though they still prioritised realistic daywear, as did Costelloe. He could also bring off surprisingly grand evening clothes, but his instinct was for tailoring – hence commissions for uniforms, including the 2004 Irish Olympic team and Aer Lingus – and intelligent day dresses or casually formal suits, in linen.That fabric was woven, dyed and printed in Northern Ireland. The clothes manufacturer Strelitz Ltd, of Dungannon, County Tyrone, with its associated linen brand, Moygashel, had been financially strong enough to back Costelloe’s label launch in 1978, and he recalled often driving north across the border from Dublin, car crammed with boxes, learning not to cheek the checkpoint guards during the worst Troubles; both Irelands depended on export trade.When in 1983 a member of the Princess of Wales’s staff scouted the rails in Costelloe’s little boutique in Windsor (sound choice of location – English county women appreciated his daywear), Costelloe had to be discreet about what became British royal patronage.He was summoned to Kensington Palace and blundered up the stairs on his size 13 feet; Diana plied him with strong tea and he was certain that what her working wardrobe needed were linen dresses, seeming so coolly English despite their Irish origin. She wore them before cameras all over the world, and Costelloe designed for her until her death in 1997. He already had a sample workshop in London, and began to show in London fashion week in 1984 – he was a fixture there for four decades.Costelloe was born in Dublin. As he pointed out, he and his older four sisters and two brothers were in fact Irish-American since their mother, Catherine Curran, a teacher, had been born in the Bronx to a migrant Irish family. She was visiting the old country when William Costelloe, from Limerick, and trained as a tailor, proposed and was given family approval.View image in fullscreenCostelloe designed the uniforms for BA air crew in 1993.Photograph: Dennis Stone/ShutterstockWilliam had a gift for cloth – his son said he could discern by touch the smallest percentage of polyester in a woven cotton – and went into raincoat production, with a factory in a Dublin suburb. Paul was born in the city. Their big family, in its large house with a walled garden and croquet on the lawn, loved art and kept horses. Some Costelloes hunted; Paul was more interested in the disciplined equine elegance of dressage events. He was to call his American-inflected leisure line after the sport.A talented artist, he left Blackrock college at 16, uncertificated in education. His parents sent him to work off his wildness in a bacon factory in Waterford, before admission as a rare male student at the Grafton Academy of Fashion Design in Dublin, where he never learned to sew or cut as he could charm female students into those tasks.His father indulged further study with the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris, but young Costelloe dropped out to absorb the city, and in 1969 the entertainer and couturier Jacques Esterel, who liked Irish music, gave him snippets of sketch work and atelier experience.In 1971, Costelloe parlayed those into a job in Milan with Marks & Spencer, which fell through, but he stayed on in the city to create ready-to-wear for the influential department store La Rinascente. Italians shared his respect for textiles (much later, he established a factory in Ancona). His next move was to New York in 1974, where he worked in Manhattan’s then-huge mass-produced garment trade, first for the Anne Fogarty label, then freelance.View image in fullscreenCostelloe on the runway at London fashion week, UK in February 2023.Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/ShutterstockOn his return to Ireland in 1978, Costello had wide enough experience to bridge the tradition of Dublin’s small artisan designers and the island’s ready-to-wear manufacturing businesses, which did well before the global fashion industry began to offshore production intercontinentally. He complained that he had never attracted the investment level that elevated his fellow textile wranglers Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren into world brands – he had to chase each collaboration himself, phoning up Margaret Heffernan, director of Ireland’s Dunnes Stores chain to propose a line of homewares, later adding economy fashion for women and men. As a consequence, he enjoyed Irishmen greeting him in the street with: “I’m wearing one of your jumpers, Paul.”Costelloe was recognised as a national asset, however, and judged himself lucky to have built and bred a durable family firm. He had a design studio in central London from the late 90s, and cycled between there and his house in Putney. He kept a home in Dublin, too.In 1979 he had seen Anne Connor on a railway platform wearing high heels, socks, and a bow in her hair, with one of his skirts, and introduced himself as its designer. They married, and had seven children, Jessica, William, Robert, Gavin, Justin, Paul-Emmet and Nicholas, many working in or with the firm.He is survived by Anne and his children.Paul Costelloe, fashion designer, born 23 June 1945; died 21 November 2025Explore more on these topicsFashionDiana, Princess of WalesIrelandTextile artobituariesShareReuse this content"

ForChristmas, I often employ much the same process for turkey legs – it’s a lovely way to eat them. Serve with colcannon, although basmati rice, boiled new potatoes or roast carrots would also go great.Braised turkey legs with sage, mustard and creme fraiche, and colcannonThis can easily be scaled up to feed more people – you’ll just need a larger pan.Prep20 minCook1 hr 30 minServes2Sunflower oilSaltand black pepper2 bone-in turkey legs1 tbsp butter5 garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped2 shallots, peeled and halved5 slicesstreaky bacon, diced8 sage leaves70ml white wine60-100mlchicken stock½ tbsp dijon mustard1 tbsp creme fraicheFor the colcannon500glargefloury potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks.100gunsalted butter2 garlic cloves, peeled and diced½ savoy cabbage, thinly slicedSaltand black pepper100ml milkHeat the oven to 200C (180Cfan)/390F/gas 6. Heat two tablespoons of sunflower oil in a 23cm wide x 7cm high cast-iron frying pan or similar. Season the turkey legs, then lay them in the pan and fry, turning once, until nicely coloured on both sides. Transfer the legs to a plate, then pour out and discard the fat.View image in fullscreenMax Rocha’s colcannon.Add the butter to the pan, followed by the garlic, shallots, bacon and sage, and cook on a medium-high heat for five to 10 minutes, until the shallots and bacon take on some colour. Pour in the wine, then lay the turkey legs on top of the vegetables. Pour in the stock so the turkey legs are covered halfway, then carefully stir in the mustard and creme fraiche. Cover the pan with foil and roast for an hour, or until the turkey legs can bend in half with ease.Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a pan of boiling water and cook for 20 minutes, until tender when pricked with a sharp knife.Meanwhile, in a second pan, melt two tablespoons of the butter, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, for two minutes. Add the cabbage and cook on a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, until soft. Season, then set aside.In a third saucepan, warm the milk and the remaining butter. Drain the cooked potatoes, then return them to their pan. Mash the potatoes with the warm milk and butter until smooth, then add the cabbage and stir it through. Season again to taste, and keep warm (or reheat gently just before serving).Once the turkey is cooked, serve with the colcannon and the vegetables and juices from the cooking pan.Max Rocha is chef-owner ofCafe Cecilia, London E8Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkMain courseFoodIrish food and drinkPotatoesChristmasMeatrecipesShareReuse this content"

It is measured officially by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).For its main measure of inflation, the ONS tracks the prices of about 700 everyday goods and services in a representative “basket”. The total cost of this basket forms the consumer prices index (CPI). The headline rate reported each month is the percentage change to the CPI compared with a year earlier. Previously, inflation was measured using the retailer prices index (RPI), which tends to be higher. It is still used for some things, including setting regulated train fares.The most recent CPI inflation rate for October 2025 is 3.6%. This means, on average, something that cost £100 this time last year will cost £103.60 now.View image in fullscreenThe ONS calculates UK inflation each month by tracking the prices of about 700 everyday goods and services in a representative ‘basket’, including food.Photograph: Frankie Angel/AlamyInflation is down slightly from the September rate of 3.8% but that doesn’t mean prices have stopped rising. It only means they’re not rising as quickly as before. For prices to stop going up, inflation would have to be 0%. For prices to fall, inflation would have to be negative – this is known as deflation.Inflation is important – it means the same money will buy you less each year. It also has an impact on interest rates because the Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation stable and as close to 2% as possible.When inflation is too high, the bank usually raises interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive, the aim being to reduce spending and cool price rises. When inflation is falling, the Bank may reduce interest rates.This has an impact on the cost of mortgages and the rates available on your savings.Find your personalrateEveryone has different shopping habits. And most people don’t make big purchases such as a car or a pricey holiday – which feature in the CPI basket – every year.The ONS has a“personal inflation rate” calculatorto help you see how quickly the cost of your own spending is rising, based on what you actually buy.To use the calculator, you need to enter details about your household spending – such as your mortgage or rent, energy bills, food, transport, and leisure. The calculator will then work out how your individual rate of inflation compares with the UK average.Your personal inflation rate matters because no two households spend money in the same way: people who spend more of their income on food or energy may face much higher inflation than the official CPI figure suggests.Knowing your personal inflation rate can highlight where your budget is being hit hardest and help you take action. For instance, realising that you spend £50 a month more on food than a year ago could make you reconsider your grocery shopping habits.Beat foodinflationIncreases in the cost of everyday food items such as bread, fruit, vegetables, dairy, and meat have been outpacing general inflation over the past year. The latest figures from the market research company Worldpanel by Numerator show annual grocery inflation was running at 4.7% in the four weeks to 2 November, down from 5.2% in the previous four-week period.‘Everyone has different shopping habits. Your personal inflation rate can highlight where your budget is hit hardest’Switching to a budget supermarket could help you tackle food price inflation. Which? research shows Aldi is consistently the cheapest supermarket, with Lidl close behind. If you shop elsewhere, make sure you are signed up toany loyalty schemefor access to the best offers.To keep costs down further, set a weekly budget, write a shopping list, and stick to it. Opt for own-brand products, buy in bulk when discounts are genuine, and choose seasonal or frozen produce which tend to be better value.Avoid rising energy pricesEnergy bills might have come down from their 2023 peak, but we are still paying significantly more for gas and electricity than we were before the energy crisis.Locking into a fixed-rate tariff can protect you from future price rises. Some tariffs are offering savings of nearly £200 compared with Ofcom’s energy price cap which will riseto £1,758 from 1 January 2026.View image in fullscreenLocking into a fixed-rate tariff can protect you from future price rises.Photograph: Jacob King/PAFor example, Outfox Energy’s 12-month fixed deal offers an average annual bill of £1,570, saving you £188 against January’s price cap. Alternatively, Ecotricity’s one-year fix will typically save you about £155 over a year.If you’ve switched the heating on during the recent cold snap, keep the heat in by draught-proofing and by only warming the rooms you need. You can also reduce energy use by switching off lights and appliances and choosing eco-settings on household appliances.Switch to an inflation-busting savings accountInflation can erode savings in cash accounts by decreasing the purchasing power of your money over time. If your savings account interest rate is lower than the inflation rate, you are losing money in “real” terms, even if the balance in your account is growing.According to the financial data provider Moneyfacts, about half of savings accounts beat the current inflation rate of 3.6%. For your money to grow in real terms, you’ll need to switch your cash to one of these accounts.In the easy access savings market online banks have the best rates:Sidekickpays 4.48% AER (falling to 3.48% after six months) on balances of £10,000 and over,Cahootoffers 4.4% for a year andChip 4.37%.Table-topping one-year fixed-rate bonds pay similar rates to easy access accounts at the moment – the best rate is from LHV Bank at 4.46%. One advantage of fixed-rate bonds is that they usually have a considerably higher limit than easy access accounts – for example, you can save up to £1m in the LHV one-year bond.Things are a lot rosier for savers than they were back inOctober 2022 when inflation peaked at 11.1%– at that time it was impossible to find a savings account to beat it.Consider investingIf you’re aiming to save for the long term, investing may be a more effective way to protect your money from the impact of inflation.To beat inflation, you generally need to invest in assets that deliver returns higher than interest rates. Over time, stocks and shares have historically offered this potential. They often outpace inflation, although this isn’t guaranteed.View image in fullscreenGold is often seen as a reliable hedge against inflation as its value tends to hold steady, or even rise, when the purchasing power of money declines. However, prices can fall, too.Photograph: imageBROKER/AlamyIt’s important to remember that investing carries risk. Spreading your money across different asset types, such as equities, bonds, and property, can help diversify your portfolio, regardless of what inflation or interest rates are doing. Starting early, paying in regularly, and focusing on the long term can help your portfolio keep up with inflation and potentially grow in real terms.Finding investments that are fully protected against inflation can be difficult, but a certain type of government bond – known as index-linked gilts – can help you shield your money from rising prices.When you buy an index-linked gilt, you’re effectively lending money to the UK government. In return, it promises to repay your original investment adjusted in line with inflation as measured by the RPI, along with regular interest payments. You’ll receive the full inflation-adjusted amount when the bond reaches its maturity date, which is usually in several years’ time.Gold is often viewed as a reliable hedge against inflation because its value tends to hold steady, or even rise, when the purchasing power of money declines. Unlike cash, which loses value as prices increase, gold is a tangible asset with limited supply, making it less vulnerable to currency fluctuations. But bear in mind that the price of gold can be volatile and it doesn’t generate income, so it is not guaranteed to always keep pace with other long-term investments.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksInflationEconomicsEnergy billsSavings ratesSavingsHousehold billsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That, at least, is the suggestion of a newly uncovered letter to Father Christmas dating from 1883, believed to be one of the earliest known such messages in the UK.The letter, addressed to “DeAR SAnTA CLAus”, was written by a six-year-old girl called Janet and preserves her idiosyncratic spelling and capitalisation. “PLeAs BRIng a Doll to Me with a cRADEL, AND a TRuMPtet to JiMMie, AND SoMe OTHer THing to MA AND PA,” wrote Janet, demonstrating both a touching concern for her family members and a canny nose for publicity.The letter had been sent to the Leeds Mercury newspaper “to the care of our colums in the Suppliment”, the paper reported on 22 December 1883. “The printer could easily have put Jane’s [sic] note into better shape,” it continued, “but then it would have been his and not hers, and it might not in that case have reached Santa Claus, which it is sure to do now.“Jane herself no doubt will put the paper just where Santa Claus will see it. He is coming.” A sentiment that will be cheering to the millions of children who have carried on the tradition this year – even if Mega Evolution Elite Pokémon trading cards and musical Wicked: For Good dolls aremore in favourfor 2025.The practice of sending letters to Santa, like so much about his now superstar scarlet-clad status, seems to have evolved in the US, where as early as 1773 the fourth-century Saint Nicholas, later Sinterklaas, was beingcommemorated as “St a Claus”by Dutch settlers in New York.As the US postal service became more formalised and efficient in the aftermath of the civil war, which ended in 1865, the idea ofwriting a letterto a benevolent man who lived at the north pole gathered currency. In England, where a figure called Father Christmas had emerged from medieval folk tales to personify festive cheer, Santa Claus was first recorded in 1864, according to English Heritage. By the 1880s, the two figures hadmerged into one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: AncestryJanet’s letter has been uncovered by the historical and genealogical research site Ancestry in its Newspapers.com database. Its researchers also found another letter, written by Mabel Hancock, aged 11, published in theHampshire Telegraph and Naval Chronicleon 24 December 1898.“Dear Santa Claus, I am writing you this letter to ask you not to forget to call on us this year,” wrote Mabel, who seems to have had a similarly clear sense of the model virtues that might help her get published. “I have a little brother four years old who will hang up his stocking; I will also hang up mine, but dear Santa Claus, if you have not much to spare, do not put anything in mine.”“I should like you to fill my brother’s up to the brim with something nice, for I can just fancy how delighted he will be, and mother tells me there is more pleasure in making others happy than in being made happy ourselves,” the virtuous Miss Hancock continued. “I think the practice of self-denial is one of the first things us children should learn.”No doubt children are writing very similar letters this year.Explore more on these topicsChristmasnewsShareReuse this content"

If not, here are some great and unexpected shortcuts, from fish pie to ‘intermittent wrapping’ to watching a seasonal film every day of DecemberTue 2 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareIf I haven’t wrapped up warm and wobbled around in circles, it isn’t Christmas. I can measure out my life in London’s ice rinks. Broadgate Circus in the early 00s, because it was cheapest and I was skint. Several seasons ofSkate at Somerset Housewith my ex, because it was our “romantic” Christmas tradition (actually, he hated skating). This year, I’ll be mixing old and new:Hampton Court Palace, where people have been skating since the 1800s, and the inauguralSkate Leicester Square. As long as there’s a mug of something mulled afterwards, I’m happy.Rachel Dixon, travel writerView image in fullscreen‘So bizarre that it short-circuited my brain’ … Joe Stone’s merman Christmas tree ornament.Photograph: Courtesy of Joe StoneYears ago, a regrettable ex-boyfriend bought me a mermanChristmastree ornament so bizarre that it short-circuited my brain, unleashing something primal within me. Ever since, I have scoured department stores, gift shops and the darkest reaches of the internet for more mermaid baubles, like some kind of gay Gollum. I now have more than a hundred, including a flautist mermaid, several Santa Claus mermen and (my favourite) a merperson who is somehow also a pig and a ballerina. Unboxing my treasures at the start of December is both the first gladdening sign that Christmas is upon us and – arguably – a cry for help.Joe Stone, lifestyle editor, Guardian Saturday magazineView image in fullscreen‘Carrying my Christmas tree home is the most festive I feel every year.’Photograph: SrdjanPav/Getty ImagesThese last couple of years, I’ve decided to carry my Christmas tree home. Kids smile and point, strangers say hello, and last year an old guy stopped me and told me an extremely long-winded Christmas joke but – most importantly – walking around with a 2m (7ft) tree slung over my shoulder is the only time I feel remotely masculine. Short of getting smashed on mulled wine and making small talk with my extended family, it is the most festive I feel every year.Stuart Heritage, writerView image in fullscreenThe Christmas Eve tradition that stuck … fish pie.Photograph: Lauren Mclean/Getty ImagesI don’t remember how old I was when my dad started cooking fish pie on Christmas Eve, but at some point during my childhood, the tradition stuck and I’ve eaten it every year since. When I lived in Dubai, I went to six supermarkets to source smoked haddock and have even cooked it with smoked herring for my in-laws in the Netherlands, which was surprisingly tasty! Nothing says “Christmas is coming” like eating something which requires huge quantities of butter and cheese.Lizzie Cernik, writerView image in fullscreen‘Wrapping a present every few days makes me feel like Mr Claus.’Photograph: mapodile/Getty ImagesTo avoid the last-minute scramble to get my gifts in order, I buy my presents throughout the year. To keep the Christmas spirit alive throughout December (and to smugly remind myself of how organised I’ve been), I subscribe to “intermittent wrapping” and wrap a present every few days. Not only does this help avoid hastily and horribly wrapped gifts, it slowly creates a pile of presents that make me feel like Mr Claus.Sammy Gecsoyler, writerFrom 1 December, I bring out my festive dinnerware and do not consume a single meal unless it sits atop a seasonal illustration. It makes me feel merry three times a day – more, if I include snacks. I recommend starting subtle with an Anna + Nina candy cane plate or Anthropologie ice-skating mug. By the 25th, you’ll be grabbing a novelty bowl and devouring Christmas pudding off baby Jesus’s face.Frances Ryan, writerView image in fullscreen‘The festive season hasn’t started if I haven’t attempted to sing a Christmas carol.’Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty ImagesFor me, the festive season hasn’t started if I haven’t attempted (with gusto, and preferably after a glass or two of mulled wine) to sing a Christmas carol descant that is almost definitely out of my vocal range. While that might not be for everyone, going to a Christmas concert or carol service is a surefire way to give you that twinkly feeling – and it doesn’t have to be in a church; the choir I’m part of performs our Christmas show at a local pub.Lucy Knight, writerMy favourite festive tradition started during lockdown: to keep my then six-year-old occupied, we baked (vaguely) Christmas-tree-shaped biscuits. We ended up with more than we could ever eat, so left them on neighbours’ doorsteps. The following year, remembering how they’d lifted everyone’s spirits, we did it again. Now neighbours say our delivery is their sign that the festive season has begun – like Santa crossed with Mary Berry (although that’s really an insult to both).Polly Hudson, writerI find a quiet half-hour to reread (or listen to) David Sedaris’s Santaland Diaries, documenting the season a 33-year-old Sedaris spent as an elf in Macy’s department store. Resplendent in green velvet, Crumpet (Sedaris’s elf name) and his fellow elves witness the best, but mostly the worst, of the heightened season: awful parenting, outlandish demands and tantrums, plus the odd moment of magic. It’s a bleakly hilarious, timely reminder of how the pressure cooker of Christmas can make monsters of us all.Emma Beddington, writerView image in fullscreen‘Some years I can find two pudding basins and no lid, other times only lids.’Photograph: Steve Moss/AlamyI make Christmas pudding; that’s not the festival ritual, I personally don’t like the stuff – but just before I make them, I start looking for the pudding basins that everyone, from Nigella to Nigel Slater, agrees are the best. Some years I can find two basins and no lid, other times only lids, sometimes nothing at all. Then I ask all the family and friends I have who are close enough that they’d steal my pudding basins, before inevitably buying new ones. Once this is done, I’ve essentially had a Jane Austen visiting season with a yule theme and Christmas has begun.Zoe Williams, writerEvery year, I make my own Christmas cards. The process begins in late November when I go out and photograph London’s festive lights – the Regent Street angels and Carnaby Street’s inventive designs are my favourites. I cue up Vince Guaraldi’s A Charlie Brown Christmas to get in the spirit, then I make prints of the best images and create the cards using blank card sets. It’s become a ritual I really look forward to – as do family and friends who receive them.Anita Chaudhuri, writerI usually try to sample the full gamut of Christmas coffees from high street chains – many of them revolting, most of them overpriced. Black Forest, gingerbread, eggnog, pot pourri – you sell it in a coffee; I’ll buy it – not because I particularly enjoy the taste of synthetic apple but because, to me, nothing feels more festive than downing an entire week’s worth of sugar in three gulps at 10am.Kate McCusker, writerFor the last few winters, a few friends and I have gone to a local outdoor sauna for a catch-up. We started in summer but they come into their own in the deep cold. I love the smell of cedar and the quiet, intense heat. But it’s lying in a cold plunge, rooted by pain and cackling with one another while staring up at Christmas lights twinkling in tower blocks and office windows that feels almost spiritual. The sauna hasn’t quite replaced catching up over wine. But it’s getting there.Morwenna Ferrier, Guardianfashion andlifestyle editorEvery festive season, my siblings and I decorate the Christmas cake that my mum made and drowned in alcohol a few months earlier. We use rolled fondant icing and always fashion three decorative polar bears, while my mum opts for a fondant Christmas tree and Dad usually crafts something rogue: a snowman with a comically long nose perhaps. Before tucking in on Christmas Day, we all have a good giggle at how our creations turned out.Emma Russell, Guardian production coordinatorView image in fullscreenLifting the mood … the Christmas lights on Regent Street in London.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APCity life in the winter can be a drag – grey, wet and overcrowded. Then, suddenly, the street lights go up and everyone’s mood seems to lift. My family and I always pick an afternoon to bundle up in scarves and gloves, wait for dark (at 4pm) to go and see the London lights, from the classy displays on Regent Street to the slightly ridiculous ones on Oxford Street. Peering up, I can’t help but feel festive.Lucy Webster, writerWe watch a festive film every day in December. This works brilliantly because it takes the pressure off any single one of them being good: if you end up with a Christmas clanger one day, there’s always a classic less than 24 hours away. It also reduces arguments: there’s plenty of room for six smalltown romcomsandElfandTrading Places. It’s a tradition of give-and-take, and overindulging until you feel slightly sick. What could be more Christmassy than that?Joel Snape, writerWhen the oranges stack up in the fruit bowl, there’s only one thing to do: makeNigella’s clementine cake. (I say Nigella’s but the cake’s true mother is, of course, Claudia Roden.) It’s the most exquisitely moist, fragrant, uplifting bake and leaves your home smelling like a Moroccan orange grove. This cake’s magic is to require so little and give so much, which is Christmas spirit in a nutshell.Chitra Ramaswamy, writerView image in fullscreenWatched at least thrice … Sylvester Stallone in Rambo: First Blood.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyI have never listened to all Nine Lessons and Carols from King’s College, but I have watched Rambo: First Blood at least thrice. I have also listened to Paul McCartney’s, let’s sayunlikely, Christmas song Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reggae enough times to fill a stocking. Because what is Christmas but a time of beauty, culture, high art, elegance, traumatised muscle men hiding out in the December-frozen woods and violin-heavy, one-drop renditions of novelty records?Nell Frizzell, writerI have a tradition of sewing (badly) a felt decoration for each of the kids’ stockings every year – something relevant to the previous 12 months. Last year it was a portrait of our new dog, but it has included a cow (my daughter’s nativity role) and a sprout, to symbolise my son’s perfectly spherical baby head. The great unveiling of the new decoration has become part of the general excitement – and the gift to myself, through my mediocre attempt at crafting, is a feeling of disproportionate pride.Emine Saner, writerView image in fullscreenHoping for a Christmas kiss off Mum … RichPelley, left, and his mother, far right, at the pub.Photograph: Courtesy of Rich PellleyIt’s not Christmas until I’ve arrived at my parents’ in Bristol on Christmas Eve, helped peel a couple of sprouts, then cleared off to my local – The Black Swan – to meet friends, drink too much and maybe even have a Christmas snog. Except … as time has marched on, my friends have moved away, I’m wary of hangovers, and all the girls are married. So now, in my only hope to feel festive, I go to The Black Swan with my parents and their friends and, at best, hope for a Christmas kiss off my mum.Rich Pelley, writerMy annual wreath-making session is really just a thinly veiled procrastination technique. I should be working through festive to-do lists but instead I stalk the woods brandishing secateurs, in search of the ultimate holly berries. Back home, I poke the holly, along with ivy and wild rosehip, into a chunky wicker circle I got from a supermarket years ago. It’s a soothingly mindful, if prickly, pursuit and the result always looks and smells delightfully Christmassy.Amy Fleming, writerView image in fullscreenA vintage Christmas episode … the 2015 Detectorists Christmas Special.Photograph: BBC/Channel X North/Treasure Trove/Lola EntertainmentOne of the surprising pleasures of being out of step with the television release cycle is being able to bookmark a vintage Christmas episode for a festive night in December. An example: I was several years late to Mackenzie Crook’s delightful comedy, Detectorists. Speeding through season two during spring, I was soon directed to the 2015 Christmas special. But no; this was not the time for it. Seven months later, on Boxing Day evening, I knew exactly what I needed. On the calendar this year? The Ghosts Christmas special.Rebecca Liu, commissioning editor, Guardian Saturday magazineI don’t consciously recall watching A Charlie Brown Christmas, but when I heard the Vince Guaraldi Trio’sChristmas Time Is Herein a bar 10 years ago, it felt wonderfully familiar and comforting. I got hold of a copy on spruce green vinyl and listening to the album quickly became a festive ritual. Later, my kids got into it too, and now insist it is on repeat from October. The laid-back jazz and beautifully chaotic children’s choir always provide our soundtrack for writing cards and decorating the tree.Sarah Phillips, writerView image in fullscreen‘The more the paper looks as if it has been painted by the hands of elves, the better.’Photograph: Dorling Kindersley ltd/AlamyI shop for wrapping paper and ribbons. The more the paper looks as if it has been painted by the hands of elves, the better: I seek outbrightly marbledor roughly textured lokta ones. For about 17 years, it’s been my annual mission to keep them hidden, thereby preserving the myth of the elves, until they are found on Christmas morning in the stockings. I thought my children would have grown out of this. They probably have; it’s me who hasn’t.Paula Cocozza, writerWhen I moved in with my three flatmates, my mum donated her old festive decorations to us. Among them was a Father Christmas toilet seat cover, mat and toilet roll holder set. Four years later, it has become a regular fixture during the festive season; once the Santa cover is on, Christmas has officially started. It’s actually quite impractical – the toilet seat often falls down while you’re using the loo, on account of Father Christmas’s nose – but it’s a guaranteed mood-booster.Emma Loffhagen, books writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Move them away from radiators or vents (at least half a metre, ideally). Group plants together to create a pocket of humidity, or place a bowl of water nearby to counteract dryness. Top-dress tired soil with fresh compost, trim off any yellowing leaves and wipe dust from the foliage so the plants can breathe. Water lightly, then let them rest in bright, indirect light to adjust before winter sets in.Houseplant hacks: do humidifiers really help houseplants?Read moreThemethodYou’re easing them into a slower season. As daylight hours decrease, growth naturally slows, so plants need less food and water. By preparing them before the heating starts to blast, you minimise temperature shock and prevent that “slow-cooked” dehydration that sneaks up indoors.The testLast year, I skipped this ritual and mycalatheascrisped within weeks. This autumn, after a gentle reset and relocation, they’re thriving. Leaves are supple, no brown edges in sight.The verdictA small pre-heating ritual prevents plant carnage.

The fallout is huge – and growing fastSally WealeTue 2 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShare‘It worries me that it’s so normalised. He obviously wasn’t hiding it. He didn’t feel this was something he shouldn’t be doing. It was in the open and people saw it. That’s what was quite shocking.”A headteacher is describing how a teenage boy, sitting on a bus on his way home from school, casually pulled out his phone, selected a picture from social media of a girl at a neighbouring school and used a “nudifying” app to doctor her image.Ten years ago it wassexting and nudescausing havoc in classrooms. Today, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it child’s play to generate deepfake nude images or videos, featuring what appear to be your friends, your classmates, even your teachers. This may involve removing clothes, getting an image to move suggestively or pasting someone’s head on to a pornographic image.The headteacher does not know why this particular girl – a student at her school – was selected, whether the boy knew her, or whether it was completely random. It only came to her attention because he was spotted by another of her pupils who realised what was happening and reported it to the school.The parents were contacted, the boy was traced and the police were called in. But such is the stigma and shame associated with image-based sexual abuse and the sharing of deepfakes that a decision was made that the girl who was the target should not be told.“The girl doesn’t actually even know,” the head said. “I talked to the parents and the parents didn’t want her to know.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian Design; Alistair Berg/Getty ImagesThe boy on the bus is just one example of how deepfakes and easily accessed nudifying technology are playing out among schoolchildren – often to devastating effect. In Spain last year, 15 boys in the south-western region of Extremadura weresentenced to a year’s probationafter being convicted of using AI to produce fake naked images of their female schoolmates, which they shared on WhatsApp groups. About 20 girls were affected, most of them aged 14, while the youngest was 11.In Australia, about 50 high school students at Bacchus Marsh grammar in Victoria reported thattheir images had been faked and distributed– the mother of one student said her daughter was so horrified by the sexually explicit images that she vomited. In the US, more than 30 female students at Westfield high school in New Jersey discovered that deepfake pornographic images of them had been shared among their male classmates on Snapchat.It’s happening in the UK, too. A new poll of 4,300 secondary school teachers in England, carried out by Teacher Tapp on behalf of the Guardian, found that about one in 10 were aware of students at their school creating “deepfake, sexually explicit videos” in the last academic year.Three-quarters of these incidents involved children aged 14 or younger, while one in 10 incidents involved 11-year-olds, and 3% were younger still, illustrating just how easy the technology is to access and use. Among participating teachers, 7% said they were aware of a single incident, and 1% said it had happened twice, while a similar proportion said it had happened three times or more in the last academic year.Earlier this year, a Girlguiding survey found that one in four respondents aged 13 to 18 had seen a sexually explicit deepfake image of a celebrity, a friend, a teacher or themselves.“A year ago I was using examples from the US and Spain to talk about these issues,” says Margaret Mulholland, a special needs and inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders. “Now it’s happening on our doorstep and it’s really worrying.”The police seem completely overwhelmed by the scale of these issues. We need broader solutions, and better strategyLast yearthe Times reportedthat two private schools in the UK were at the centre of a police investigation into the alleged making and sharing of deepfake pornographic images. The newspaper said police were investigating claims that the deepfakes were created at a boys’ school by someone manipulating images taken from the social media accounts of pupils at a girls’ school.The children’s commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, has called for nudification apps such as ClothOff, which was investigated as part of the Guardian’sBlack Box podcastseries about AI, to be banned. “Children have told me they are frightened by the very idea of this technology even being available, let alone used,” she says.It’s not easy to find teachers willing to speak about deepfake incidents. Those who agreed to be interviewed by the Guardian insisted on strict anonymity. Other accounts were provided by academics researching deepfakes in schools, and providers of sex education.Tanya Horeck, a professor of film and feminist media studies at Anglia Ruskin University, has been talking to headteachers as part of a fact-finding mission to uncover the scale of the problem in schools. “All of them had incidents of deepfakes in their schools and they saw this as an emerging problem,” she says. In one case, a 15-year-old girl who was new to a school was targeted by male students who created a pornographic deepfake video of her. She was so distressed she initially refused to go to school. “Almost all the examples they told me about were boys making deepfakes of girls,” says Horeck.“The other thing that I noticed is that there’s this real tension around how they should handle these issues. So some teachers were saying, ‘Yeah, we just get the police in right away and students are expelled’ – that kind of approach,” Horeck says. “Then other teachers were saying, ‘Well, that’s not the way to handle it. We’ve got to have more of a restorative justice approach, where we’re talking to these young people and finding out why they’re doing these things.’“So there seems to be some kind of inconsistency and uncertainty on how to deal with these cases – but I think it’s really hard for teachers because they’re not getting clear guidance.”Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, says there is something particularly shocking about deepfake images. In her bookThe New Age of Sexism: How the AI Revolution Is Reinventing Misogyny, she writes: “Of all the forms of abuse I receive they are the ones that hurt most deeply – the ones that stay with me. It’s hard to describe why, except to say that it feels likeyou.It feels like someone has taken you and done something to you and there is nothing you can do about it. Watching a video of yourself being violated without your consent is an almost out-of-body experience.”View image in fullscreen‘The fallout was significant.’Photograph: Nick David/Getty ImagesAmong school-age children, the impact can be huge. Girls and young women are left feeling violated and humiliated. School friendship groups are shattered and there can be a deep sense of betrayal when one student discovers another has created a deepfake sexualised image of them, and shared it around the school. Girls can’t face lessons, while teachers with little training do their best to support and educate. Meanwhile, boys and young men are being drawn into criminal behaviour, often because they don’t understand the consequences of their actions.“We do see students who are very upset and feel betrayed and horrified by this kind of abuse,” says Dolly Padalia, the CEO of the School of Sexuality Education, a charity providing sex education in schools and universities. “One example is where a school got in touch with us. A student had been found to have taken images of lots of students within the year group and was making deepfakes.“These had then been leaked, and the fallout was quite significant. Students were really upset. They felt very betrayed and violated. It’s a form of abuse. The police were involved. The student was removed from school and we were asked to come in and support. The school responded very, very quickly, but I would say that’s not enough. In order for us to really be preventing sexual violence, we need to be more proactive.”It is estimated that 99% of sexually explicit deepfakes accessible online are of women and girls, but there are cases of boys being targeted. The charity Everyone’s Invited (EI), which collects testimonies from survivors of sexual abuse, has run into at least one such case: “One student shared with the EI education team that a boy in their year group, who was well liked and friends with many of the girls, was targeted when another boy created an AI-generated sexual image of him. That image was then circulated around the school, causing significant distress and trauma.”EI also flags how these tools are being trivialised and used in disturbing ways, such as the “changing your friend into your boyfriend” filter. “On social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat, they are increasingly accessible and normalised. While this may seem playful or harmless to some, it reflects and reinforces a culture where consent and respect for personal boundaries are undermined.”‘It was extremely pornographic’: Cara Hunter on the deepfake video that nearly ended her political careerRead moreAgainst a backdrop of widespread misogyny in schools, a growing number of teachers are also being targeted, EI and others report: “It is something that, as a society, we urgently need to confront. Education has to stay in front of technology, and adults must feel equipped to lead these conversations rather than shy away from them.”Seth James is a designated safeguarding lead – a senior member of staff with overall responsibility for child protection and safeguarding within a school – and the author ofthe DSL Blog. “For everyone working in schools, it feels like new sets of challenges and risks are constantly being thrown up by technological developments,” he says. “AI generally – and particularly deepfakes and nudify apps – feel like the next train coming down the track.“‘More education’ is appealing as a solution to these sorts of challenges – because it’s intuitive and relatively easy – but on its own it’s like trying to hold back a forest fire with a water pistol. And likewise, the police seem completely overwhelmed by the scale of these issues. As a society we need broader solutions, and better strategy.”He continues: “We should all try to imagine how we would have felt 20 years ago if someone had suggested inventing a handheld device which could be used to create realistic pornographic material that featured actual people that you know in real life. And then they’d suggested giving one of these devices to all of our children. Because that’s basically where we are now. We’re letting these things become ‘normal’ on our watch.”Jessica Ringrose, a professor of sociology of gender and education at University College London’s Institute of Education, has worked in schools on issues including masculinity, gender inequality and sexual violence. She is also co-author of a book called Teens, Social Media, and Image Based Abuse, and is now researching tech-facilitated gender-based violence.“The way that young people are using these technologies is not necessarily all bad,” she says, “but what they need is better media literacy.” She welcomes the government’supdated relationships, sex and health education guidance, which “recognised that misogyny is a problem that needs to be tackled in the school system”. However, she says: “They need to put the dots together. They need to join up a concern with gender and sexual-based violence with technology. You can’t rely on Ofcom or the regulators to protect young people. We need proactive, preventive education.”Where is the government in all this? “Our new relationships, sex and health education guidance will make sure that all young people understand healthy relationships, sexual ethics and the dangers of online content such as pornography and deepfake,” a Department for Education spokesperson said. “As part of our Plan for Change mission to halve violence against women and girls, we are also providing schools with new funded resources to help teachers explain the law and harms relating to online content as part of their age-appropriate lessons.”Ringrose stresses the urgency. “These issues are happening – non-consensual creation and distribution of images is happening. These technologies are at people’s fingertips. I mean, it’s super-easy for any kid to access these things.”She is sceptical about efforts to ban smartphones in schools and worries they will make it harder for young people who may be targeted with abusive imagery to seek help. “Abstinence around things like technology doesn’t work,” she says. “You actually have to teach people to use it properly. We need to engage with this as a really important element of the curriculum.”Which takes us back to the boy on the bus, where this story began. He was stopped because a girl on the same bus had recently had a lesson in school about online safety as part of her PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) curriculum. She recognised what he was doing and told her teachers.Education works.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

Teachers are quitting the profession in droves, complaining of worsening pupil behaviour, stagnant pay and inflexible working practices. Vacancies are often difficult to fill.To address the problem, campaigners from the 4 Day Week Foundation are urging the government to allow schools greater autonomy so they can pilot four-day working weeks in an effort to make teaching more attractive.A number of schools in the UK have already begun experimenting with more flexible working patterns in schools.We would like to hear from teachers who are already benefiting from these changes, and those who are struggling with workload on a five-day week. We would also like to hear parents’s views on such changes.Share your views and experiencesTell us about your views and experiences in the form below or by messaging us.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

He said Somalia “stinks” and is “no good for a reason”.“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” he said. He called Omar “garbage” and said “we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country”.“These are people who do nothing but complain,” he said. “They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing … When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”The New York Timesreportedon Tuesday that the Minneapolis-St Paul metro area, where most Somalis reside, would see stepped-up deportation efforts this week, focusing primarily on Somalis who have final deportation orders. It would use “strike teams” of ICE agents and other federal officers, bringing in about 100 agents from across the country, the Times reported. Other media outlets, including the Associated Press, have confirmed the reporting.The move comes after the right has seized on several fraud cases, spanning multiple years, that involve dozens of Somali residents who prosecutors allege lied to the state to receive reimbursements for meal disbursements, medical care, housing and autism services. The Trump administrationpreviouslythreatened to revoketemporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, citing the state as a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, also announced on Monday that his agency would be investigating whether taxpayer dollars from Minnesotans had “been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab”, sharing a recent story from a rightwing outlet that made such claims.Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, and other city leaders held a press conference on Tuesday to respond to the “credible reports” of increased enforcement. Frey said the city stands with the Somali community. Minneapolis police do not assist with immigration enforcement, and the police chief said the department does not receive advanced notice of any operations.“To our Somali community, we love you and we stand with you,” Frey said. “That commitment is rock solid.”Minneapolis is home to the country’s largest Somali population, with about 80,000 living in the state. Most are US citizens or legal residents.“Targeting Somali people means that due process will be violated, mistakes will be made, and let’s be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained for no other reason than they look Somali,” Frey said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationSomaliaUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Trump threw his support behind Hernández’s ally Nasry “Tito” Asfura, saying Washington’s support for the country was conditional on an Asfura victory.On Tuesday, Trump again intervened, alleging without evidence that electoral officials were “trying to change” the result of Sunday’s vote and said: “If they do, there will be hell to pay!”The virtual vote count had been slow and unstable before it was interrupted at about midday on Monday. The electoral council said a technical problem was to blame and insisted the manual count was continuing.When the release of results was suspended, Asfura was on 39.91%, closely followed by Salvador Nasralla of the Liberal party on 39.89%. Rixi Moncada, the candidate for the leftwing ruling party, was trailing in a distant third place with 19.16% of the vote.View image in fullscreenTrump has thrown his support behind Hernández’s ally Nasry ‘Tito’ Asfura.Photograph: Moisés Castillo/APAs election officials pleaded for patience, Hernández’s wife, Ana García de Hernández, disclosed that the former president had been released from a US prison.“God is faithful and never fails! Yesterday, Monday 1 December 2025, we lived a day we will never forget. After almost four years of pain, waiting and difficult trials, my husband, Juan Orlando Hernández, became a free man AGAIN, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,” she wrote.Axios reported that in a letter to Trump in October, Hernández had claimed that he had been “targeted by the Biden-Harris administration not for any wrongdoing, but for political reasons.”US authorities had investigated Hernández for years before he was indicted; his brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, was arrested in 2018 andconvicted in 2019, during Trump’s first term.Manhattan prosecutors accused the former president of allegedly receiving $1m from the former Mexican cartel kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in 2013 for his first presidential campaign, and alleged that, under Hernández’s government,Hondurasserved as a crucial transit point for cocaine coming from South American countries including Colombia and Venezuela.Hernández had been held at the federal Hazelton prison in West Virginia and is now in a “safe place”, according to his wife.Trump’s pardon has baffled many observers, who have questioned why the US president has used his antinarcotics campaign to justify overthrowing Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, while simultaneously freeing a man convicted of such crimes.In Honduras, the pardon has been viewed as yet another attempt by the US president to interfere in the election.Honduras’s deputy foreign minister, Gerardo Torres Zelaya,postedthat the US “got involved in our elections” and “freed the worst narco and criminal in our history”.View image in fullscreenSalvador Nasralla about to cast his vote on 30 November along with his wife, Iroshka Elvir.Photograph: José Cabezas/ReutersDuring the campaign,Moncada accused Trump of “interventionism” and of “imperial, direct foreign interference” in the electoral process. She served as finance minister under the current president, Xiomara Castro, who could not run again because presidential mandates are limited to a single term.Before the election, Trump had claimed Moncada was a communist and that her victory would hand the country to “Maduro and his narco-terrorists”.Nasralla, an experienced politician and TV host who served as Castro’s vice-president before breaking away to launch his own presidential attempt, was labelled by Trump as a “borderline communist” who was running only to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.Gustavo Irías, a co-founder and executive director of Honduras’s Centre of Study for Democracy, said Trump’s “interference definitely influenced the outcome” of the elections.“Those messages from Trump validated a political party that was practically unable to win because of its long history of links to drug trafficking and corruption – and that suffered a massive defeat in 2021,” he said, referring to Castro’s wide victory over Asfura in the last presidential election.View image in fullscreenNewspapers with cover stories on the preliminary results of the general election, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.Photograph: José Cabezas/ReutersA similar strategy was adopted by the US president in October duringArgentina’s midterm elections, when Trump announced a $40bn bailout conditional on the victory of the far-right president Javier Milei’s party.“So people went to vote here under pressure, under fear,” Irías said.The electoral council has up to 30 days to announce the result.For many, the suspension of the vote counts has revived traumatic memories of the 2017 election, when Hernández ran for a second term, after a court struck down a constitutional ban on re-election.Early results showed Nasralla ahead, but after a “blackout” – marked byviolent protests in which dozens were killed– Hernández emerged ahead and, a week after the election, was recognised by the US as the winner.Now, after a campaign in which virtually all the candidates alleged electoral fraud, all three contenders have voiced concern over the delay.“Let’s not keep the country waiting on edge,” said Asfura.Irías said that official results could take weeks to be finalised and that, given everything unfolding in this election, “we are going to see a continuation of governments with low legitimacy”.“I hope the system does not return with completely different figures from those with which the count was halted, as happened in 2017, because that could open up a new and very serious crisis,” he added.Explore more on these topicsHondurasAmericasDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.Hegseth’s post came amid growing outrage over a string of deadly US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, which have killed at least 80 people.Trump administration is ‘selling out’ navy admiral to shield Hegseth over boat strikes, officials sayRead moreThe extrajudicial killings received fresh attention last week after Hegseth was reported to have commanded military personnel to “kill everybody” on board vessels after two survivors were spotted after a 2 September strike. The survivors were killed during a second strike.Hegseth’s post, which seemingly mocks a practice that experts have condemned as illegal, was met with frustration by the publisher of Canadian children’s book series over his “unauthorized” depictions of its main character.“Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity,” the publisher Kids Can Presswrote in a statementon X.“We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin’s name or image, which directly contradicts these values,” the publishing house added.But Hegseth’s post also spawned a series of other mock covers,including onethat questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election.

On a daily basis, residents here live with about twice the levels of fine particulate air pollution as those in Los Angeles, which has long been the most polluted major metro in the US. And on bad days, the area sometimes has among the worst pollution levels in the world.Air pollution in Mexico’s largest metros have largely stayed high, while pollution in US metros has declined.Long-term exposure to this kind of air pollution has been linked to thousands of deaths per year in the area.Monterrey is one of the only major metro areas in the three nations where such air pollution has remained stubbornly high, at a time when most cities are accomplishing vast reductions in harmful pollutants.The findings come as residents have mounted protests about the air quality in Monterrey, with some carrying signs saying “We want to breathe” and demanding that the federal government take action.“You have to wonder: How are we not suffocating?” said Aldo Salazar, an environmental activist, who said he didn’t realize he was living in a fishbowl of pollution until he began hiking into the mountains that surround Monterrey, where he could stand in the clear sunshine and look down at the gray basin of smog beneath him. The mountains themselves are frequently not visible from the city owing to the dirty air.View image in fullscreenAbout 40 residents in a neighborhood in San Nicolás de los Garza protested near the Zinc Nacional recycling plant on 20 April 2025. They demanded the cease of operations of the company in this area.Photograph: El NorteThe Monterrey urban area has quadrupled in size since 1990 as it has become an industrial boomtown. And although vehicles and small businesses also contribute to pollution, about 60% comes from industrial emitters, including privately owned factories and public energy plants, according to a government estimate. This pollution consists of fine particles that are harmful if inhaled, and can include small quantities of dangerous metals.Many of the major factories in Monterrey produce goods that go to the US market – ranging from tractors and beer mugs to chocolate cookies – or recycle toxic waste and scrap metal sent from the US, the research shows. Among the top emitters are factories that recycle US car batteries and hazardous waste, and those thatship finished products back to the US.In one example, the analysis found that a single European steel company reported emitting more lead – which can cause brain damage in children – into the air in a year than all the companies combined in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, the most populous metro in the US. The company acknowledged these emissions but said future reports would show less pollution.The analysis also revealed that some facilities in Monterrey emit carcinogenic cadmium and arsenic at levels that are rarely reported in densely populated areas of the US.Top Mexican officials have promised to address air-quality problems in Monterrey. Alicia Bárcena, Mexico’s secretary of environment and natural resources, said in a statement to the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab that her administration is aware there is a problem with pollution and “actions are being taken to address this,” including updating emissions standards and improving industrial monitoring. She added that “there is a long-term trend towards improvement” in pollution levels.side-by-side images of an area in different yearsA view of the Santa Catarina river and Fundidora park in the city of Monterrey, seen with pollution on 19 November 2024 and without pollution on 2 November 2025. The mountains of the Sierra Madre (left) and Cerro de las Mitras (right) sometimes disappear from sight in days with bad air.Credit: José Villasaez, El NorteMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in July that she was awaiting research about Monterrey’s air pollution that was being coordinated by the “best scientists in our country on these issues”, and which would show “who is polluting, how much they are polluting and where they are polluting.”While industry representatives argue that facilities serving the US market have modern and effective pollution controls, some experts say the industrial growth in Monterrey may come at the price of residents’ health and lives.“Monterrey is paying a price for being too aggressive in getting foreign investment,” said Rafael Fernández de Castro, director of theCenter for US-Mexican Studiesat the University of California San Diego.“This will backfire,” he said. “Because this pollution is going to result in a big-time impact on public health. The remedy is going to be very, very costly and it will offset the short-term benefits of this very hot market that is Monterrey.”Polluting plants operate in highly populated areasTo find the top industrial polluters, the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab combed through emissions reports for thousands of facilities, which journalists obtained through records requests andgovernment databases, as well as a leaked government inventory.The emissions reports used in this investigation, which companies self-report to the Mexican government, are not complete. There are gaps for certain plants, pollution types and years. But they provide an overall picture of what the companies themselves say they are pumping into the air.The investigation revealed that Monterrey contains a huge number of polluting industrial plants operating in highly populated areas. Particularly troubling were some that report emitting large amounts of heavy metals into dense, urban neighborhoods.Map of Monterrey, with hundreds of markers representing industrial sites with reported pollutionProducers of metals, glass, ceramics and cement, as well as power plants and a government-run refinery, dominate the emissions reports.Chronic exposure to even small quantities of the heavy metalshave been shownto cause an array of health effects like kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, birth defects, and cancer, as well as causing increases in learning disabilities and behavior problems in children that can affect the economic prospects of an entire population.The US has cracked down on air emissions of these metals due to their very harmful effects. But evidence suggests Mexican residents near plants making and recycling goods for US customers are still breathing in lead, cadmium and arsenic.The emissions numbers for each heavy metal are striking.Lead emissions more than that of all companies in many US statesPlants in Monterrey reported releasing a total of 4,362lbs (1979kg) of toxic lead into the air per year on average between 2021 and 2023 – more than all the companies in many US states.Top emitters in recent years included two steel plants and a half dozen companies that recycle old car batteries, often shipped down from the US. Among these is US company Clarios, which owns five plants that reported lead emissions in the Monterrey area.In response to questions, the company did not dispute its emissions but said that it operates “in full compliance with – and often exceed[s] – the environmental, health, and safety regulations in Mexico.”In another example, Ternium, a steel company headquartered in Luxemburg that supplies metals crucial to the North American auto industry, reported releasing over 1,000lbs (458kg) of lead into the air in 2023 from a factory in a crowded Monterrey neighborhood. That is more than all companies combined in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, the United States’ most populous metro.Ternium said that its treatment system captures 99% of lead emissions, and that its forthcoming lead and cadmium reports would show substantial decreases. “If we compare our emissions, they are similar to or lower than those reported by steel plants in the United States and Europe,” the company said.Hazardous cadmium emissionsIn the case of cadmium, which is considered even more hazardous because of its significant carcinogenic potential, facilities here reported emitting a total of 301lbs (137kg) in the average year.View image in fullscreenA general view shows Mexican state oil firm Pemex’s refinery in Cadereyta, on the outskirts of Monterrey, Mexico, in 2021.Photograph: Daniel Becerril/ReutersThat is more than in all but four places in the US – but those places are mostly rural locations far from dense populations, such as in Alaska’s Northwest Arctic Borough. The only place where comparably large amounts of cadmium were emitted near an urban population in the US was around two solar panel plants that are 10 miles (16km) south of Toledo, Ohio.Top emitters included zinc and steel plants, and power plants providing electricity to the city.US-owned glass producer Crisa Libbey reported emitting 45lbs (20kg) of cadmium into the air. The company did not respond to requests for comment.Top arsenic emittersMeanwhile, facilities reported emitting 66lbs (30kg) of arsenic per year into the air.Zinc Nacional, which recycles steel dust sent from the US to recover zinc, was the largest reporter in this category in recent years.It recycles US hazardous waste in a tightly packed neighborhood and has reported emitting about 20lbs (9kg) of arsenic per year since 2017.By comparison, most plants that emit large amounts of arsenic in the US operate well away from large urban populations. Only one US plant that reports arsenic at these levels operates in a dense neighborhood in a major metropolitan area – the US Steel plant in Gary, Indiana.Zinc Nacional disputed that its emissions are this large. It said that its reports are only estimates that do not take into account its pollution-control technologies and that “our actual emissions are considerably lower.”View image in fullscreenZinc Nacional plant seen in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, on 13 September 2024.Photograph: Bernardo De Niz/The GuardianAn industry group, the Institute for the Environmental Protection of Nuevo León, which advises Zinc Nacional and many other major Monterrey companies went further, saying in a statement that emissions reports submitted to the Mexican government “may include materials retained in filters or chimneys, or treated” and should only be used as “trend indicators”.However under the law, “only what is emitted into the air should be reported, without considering what is retained by the control equipment,” said an official from the Mexican environmental regulator, Semarnat.Other top arsenic emitters included the multinational cement company Cemex, a refinery and several energy plants.Cemex said that it is in full compliance with regulations and is investing in technologies to reduce its emissions, including using real-time air monitors and drones to detect and control any increased emissions. The company has “a long history of seriously embracing our environmental commitment.”Overall, about 40% of the heavy metals emissions reported came from a handful of companies operating plants within 5 miles (8km) of each other in the most densely populated area of Monterrey, called San Nicolás de los Garza. Its population of mostly working-class residents has exploded over the years.“Many of these factories have been there for 80 or 90 years and now they are absolutely surrounded by people living there, so that makes this problem a lot bigger,” said Glen Villarreal Zambrano, a state legislator who lives in the area and was, until recently, the head of the Nuevo León parks and wildlife department.“We are victims of our own success,” he said. “We have economic growth – now we have to put order to it.”‘We’re breathing in a capsule of poison’The health consequences are becoming increasingly clear to residents. Chronic exposure to fine particulate air pollution causes as many as 2,500 deaths every year in the Monterrey metropolitan region, as well as contributing to a multitude of chronic ailments, ranging from respiratory and neurological problems and cancer, according to a 2023 study issued by the state of Nuevo León.Guadalupe Rodríguez, director of the regional public nursery school system, has long worried about the effects of Monterrey’s air pollution on her young students. On the worst air quality days, when winds pick up dust to mix with the industrial pollution, monitors hung in the rafters of schools scattered around the city report air quality levels so high that they are symbolized with pictures of children wearing old-fashioned gas masks.View image in fullscreenGuadalupe Rodríguez, director of the regional public nursery school system, organized lead testing for all the children in her schools.Photograph: El Norte“We’re breathing in a capsule of poison throughout the entire metropolitan area,” she said. “Out of a school month, I’d say we get five good days and 15 bad ones”.She says about half the children, from infants to six year olds, suffer some kind of health condition, including repeated respiratory infections and allergies. She is also concerned about high rates of autism among her students.But it wasn’t until the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab published aninvestigationin January into Zinc Nacional that she was able to organize lead testing for all the children in her schools.That investigation revealed heavy metals contamination in homes and schools surrounding Zinc Nacional, which recycles hazardous waste from the US steel industry.View image in fullscreenChildren play at a school in the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza, near numerous facilities that have reported large emissions of heavy metals, in September 2024.Photograph: Bernardo De Niz/The GuardianZinc Nacional responded that the investigation was based on a study “that lacks scientific validity and institutional backing”. It said that its recycling process is crucial. “If these materials were not recycled, they would end up landfilled or released into the environment, posing real ecological risks”This spring medical teams began showing up at nine nursery schools to prick the fingers of children three to six years old whose parents signed up for the testing, which is ongoing.Rodríguez, who is also a state legislator, said she and other environmental activists have been trying to draw attention to the worsening air pollution problems for years, without tangible results.“There are laws, but they aren’t enforced,” she said.Guadalupe Martínez, 63, lived for 30 years in a neighborhood that sits in near several of the plants reporting the highest heavy metal emissions in the region.One morning in 2021, she began coughing and spitting up blood and her children took her to the emergency room, according to Martínez and her son. Her condition was so critical that she spent six months in an induced coma and more than a year in the hospital. Today she can barely speak because of her tracheotomy tube and is dependent on oxygen and constant care.“I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t stay up late,” said Martínez, whose family now wonders if living in the midst of so much pollution might have affected her health.View image in fullscreenRicardo González and his mother, Guadalupe Martínez, who depends on oxygen and wonders whether living near several of the plants reporting the highest heavy metal emissions in the region has affected her health.Photograph: Courtesy of El NorteHer son, local attorney Ricardo González, is taking legal steps to demand that the government investigate the health effects of pollution in the urban area.“The authorities are failing to fulfil their duty to guarantee legal, physical and material safety for the people,” he said. “And by doing so, they are enabling and allowing the population to be poisoned.“CO2 emissions and outdated environmental regulationsThe Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab investigation also examined the region’s top emitters of carbon dioxide, a measure which shows not only how much of this global-warming gas each factory is sending into the atmosphere, but is often also an indicator of air pollution.In 2022, the roughly 200 plants that reported their annual CO2 releases in Monterrey emitted more of the greenhouse gas than more than 100 countries, and were similar to Paraguay, Panama and Costa Rica.One of the highest emitters in recent years was the Cadereyta refinery, run by Mexico’s state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex). The plant can also be seen from satellites in space as one of the biggest emitters in the world of sulphur dioxide, which contributes to smog.The company did not respond to a request for comment.Experts said Pemex emissions have worsened in recent years, as the previous presidential administration ramped up processing of dirtier oil. Mexico’s refineries, including the nearly 50-year-old Cadereyta, are in a poor state of repair.The Cadereyta refinery has been “operating purely on inertia, without filters or anti-pollution measures – it simply degraded into what we’re seeing now”, said Gonzalo Monroy, an energy consultant.Since 2015, investment in refinery maintenance has decreased dramatically.“Most of the sulfur [capturing equipment] in the refineries and in the gas processing plants in Mexico are out of operation for lack of maintenance”, said Francisco José Barnés de Castro, an oil industry expert and former head of the Mexican Petroleum Institute.The Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab investigation also raised concerns about the effectiveness of Mexico’s environmental regulation of industrial facilities.Companies that would face tight air pollution regulation in the US are able to operate under decades-old Mexican environmental standards. These “are a real disgrace”, said Samuel García, the governor of Nuevo León, Monterrey’s home state, in a social media post this summer. They allow thresholds for air and heavy metals pollution that are “extremely high”.Additionally, emissions records for toxic chemicals at many facilities are missing, while others are removed from the record by the Mexican environmental regulator because of doubts about their accuracy.A ‘circular economy’ gone awry?Experts say the city’s relationship as a supplier to the US is crucial in explaining the pollution crisis. Monterrey has long prided itself on its entrepreneurial spirit and centuries-long history of teaming up with US businesses.Monterrey is still a place “where the factory, the facility, the smokestack is a source of pride,” said Eduardo Enrique Aguilar, a professor of political economics at University of Monterrey.But he said, since the North American Free Trade Agreement opened the trade borders between the US and Mexico in the 1990s, Monterrey has seen an over-accumulation of factories.“They come here, pay very low wages, and offload all the environmental harm – which is ultimately borne by us, by the people who live here,” said Aguilar.Since 2006, international exports from the metro have tripled. About 90% in sales go to the US – totalling at least $46bn dollars in 2024.Map showing the flow of material so recycle from the US to Monterrey and goods exported back from Monterrey to the US.As part of this manufacturing boom, he said the region has become a “recycling hub” for the US companies, who want to process US waste into new goods in what is now dubbed “the circular economy.”Some of the highest emissions figures found by the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab came from factories recycling waste and scrap exported out of the US for Mexican companies to process and use as raw materials.These imports included hazardous waste from the US,including toxic steel dust and millions of old car batteries.But Monterrey also receives vast quantities of everyday recycling that US consumers throw into their bins, including household paper recycling, and nearly 2m metric tons a year of scrap metal.“Ultimately, the United States has to send its waste somewhere, and clearly, there was already infrastructure here – highways, energy usage, and technological capacity,” said Aguilar, who said the pollution it foists upon the population is “a real injustice.”But an industry group, advising Ternium, Zinc Nacional, Clarios and numerous other large companies on environmental issues, pointed to Monterrey’s role in recycling US materials as an environmental benefit to the planet.“These are not uncontrolled wastes, but valuable inputs that are reprocessed under federal permits and supervision,” the group, Instituto para la Protección Ambiental de Nuevo León, said in a statement. Recycling can “replace primary mining, reduce global emissions and deforestation, and promote the circular economy.”The group said that Monterrey’s industrial boom has been accompanied by hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in environmental improvements in the region.“The industrial boom and nearshoring have gone hand in hand with an unprecedented process of industrial modernization in environmental matters,” it said.‘Mexico is not the trash dump for the US’Calls for action on the industrial pollution problems have intensified since the journalistic investigation earlier this year.Neighbors have staged several protests outside the Zinc Nacional plant, with signs such as “Mexico is not the trash dump for the United States”, and government officials have instituted five different temporary closures of the plant. The company announced it would move some of its operations elsewhere. (It said it followed all applicable regulations, and that the wellbeing of the community was a priority.)State and federal officials have responded by saying they will crack down on industrial polluters citywide.“The metropolitan area of Monterrey is one of the most polluted regions in terms of air quality in our country,” said Mariana Boy Tamborrell, the federal attorney for environmental protection, appointed last fall, who said her agency plans to step up inspections and sampling to make sure industry complies with the laws.“We want to prevent companies from merely simulating compliance or engaging in greenwashing,” Boy Tamborrell added.García,Nuevo León’s governor, has amplified that message in various statements this summer, saying that “there will be zero tolerance” for those who pollute and that “industry has completely failed” to handle pollution.But Hugo Barrera, an air pollution researcher, said solutions might not come so easily. His organization, the Mario Molina Center for Energy and Environment, has recommended that government and industry should work together to relocate polluting factories outside the urban area.But companies “don’t seem interested”, he said. “It’s very costly to move industry, and it’s both politically and economically difficult.”Ultimately, activists hope the huge groundswell of public anger that has now built around the air pollution issue in Monterrey will spark meaningful improvements.“If people don’t know the air is dangerous, the government doesn’t have to act,” said Vivianne Clariond, who is pushing for the government to do something about the smog.Clariond’s own background is a sign of how broad the movement has become. Her grandfather founded a major steel mill, which was later bought by the international conglomerate Ternium and is now considered one the biggest polluters in the city.

And many hope that Sheinbaum, a trained climate scientist, will take up the cause and make the changes to environmental law and enforcementthat will be needed to improve the situation.“What we need is someone with the guts to act,” Clariond said. “When Mexico City was the most polluted city in the world, they introduced vehicle inspections, bike lanes, cable cars, a metro. They made decisions – even if unpopular.”“Here in Nuevo León, nobody wants to sacrifice the economy or their political capital.”El Norte newspaper contributedreportingQuick GuideMethodologyShowTo find the top industrial polluters in Monterrey, the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab analyzed emissions data for the region from multiple viewpoints.This included filing public records requests to obtain a database of each facilities’ reports to the Mexican government, as well as their itemized accounts of their releases from each part of their operation. We also obtained a leaked draft of an emissions inventory that was never published.Ultimately the numbers we decided to publish in this piece are from the Mexican government’s Registro de Emisiones y Transferencia de Contaminantes program, which compiles emissions data to share with the public and the international community through the North American Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (NAPRTR) initiative.We downloaded these from awebportalrun by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC), an international organization created as a side accord to the 1994 free trade agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico to facilitate cooperation on environmental issues across the three countries.The reports only include emissions from facilities that are federally regulated (generally industrial facilities in sectors like chemicals, metals, automotive components and power; and those that generate more than 10 tons of hazardous waste each year.)We gathered data on all facilities that reported their emissions in the most recent three years available (2021-2023) and used their most recent report for each type of pollutant. Some facilities had no reports for certain types of pollutants in certain years.To calculate the total amount of heavy metals emitted  – lead, cadmium and arsenic, and their compounds – we used three-year averages for each.To calculate CO2 emissions for the entire metro region, we used 2022 emissions reports. It was the year with the most complete dataset, due to the fact that many of the largest reporters’ records were removed from the 2023 final report by the government as “inconsistencies”, which the regulator said meant there were reasons to suspect the reliability of the information. (Some heavy metals reports are also disqualified for being “inconsistent”.)To compare emissions in the US and Mexico, we analyzed analogous reports submitted by US polluters. The CEC itself publishes such national comparisons and has an initiative to improve the comparability of pollution reporting.But there are some differences in the data gathered in the US and Mexico – most notably the minimum reporting thresholds. For instance, in the case of lead, US facilities that use 45kg per year must report their lead emissions; while, in Mexico, plants that use 5kg must report. In the case of cadmium and arsenic, Mexico requires reporting by plants that use at least 5kg of a substance; whereas the US standards do not require reporting by facilities unless they handle at least 4,530kg.We found that the vast majority of emissions in both countries come from large reporters. The comparisons were designed to focus on large reporters.As part of our right-of-reply process, we sent letters outlining our findings to the top emissions reporters. In consequence we removed reports from two facilities, Forja de Monterrey and Tenigal, from our heavy metal emissions totals because the companies demonstrated that their reports were in error.Comparisons of Monterrey’s fine-particulate pollution with other metro areas, including Los Angeles, are based on a 2025 study led by researchers at George Washington University. They used data from satellites, air monitors and computer models to look at pollution levels in 13,189 metro areas around the globe over a 20-year-period.We analysed this data to focus on metros with populations over 1 million in the North American free trade zone countries of Mexico, the United States and Canada. The year 2020 was excluded from this analysis because of the pandemic, when emissions temporarily plunged in many places (though fine-particulate pollution estimates increased in Monterrey that year as well).Editors: Alastair Gee, Alejandra XanicData editor: Will CraftData visualization: Andrew WitherspoonFactchecking: Bojana PavlovićWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmerica's dirty divideAir pollutionPollutionAmericasHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The results showed Pierre with 57.1% of the popular vote against the conservative opposition leader Allen Chastanet’s 37.3%.Chastanet preceded Pierre as prime minister of the country of 180,000 people. His conservative United Workers party (UWP), which held just two seats going into Monday’s vote, had secured one seat as of late Monday evening.During the election, Pierre advocated for stability and cautious economic management, while Chastanet argued that security deteriorated under Pierre’s leadership partly because of more limited US support for local police – restricted on grounds of past human rights abuses under the US Leahy Law. He has called for more transparent auditing of the island’s citizenship-by-investment program.Radar revelation stokes fears Caribbean could be drawn into US-Venezuela crisisRead moreCBI programs are an important source of tax income for several small island nations in the eastern Caribbean, but the policy has raised tensions with the US government, which said the programs can be exploited by “nefarious actors” from China or Iran.Washington this year proposed its own “gold card” visa program to speed the wealthy through its immigration track.TheSt Luciaelection follows Thursday’s election in neighboring St Vincent and the Grenadines, where the opposition snatched almost all the seats, ousting Ralph Gonsalves, who had been prime minister for 24 years.It also comes as the US escalates a military buildup in the Caribbean it says is designed to curb drug trafficking around Venezuela.

Homes buried by fast-flowing mud. Jagged brown craters scarring lush green hillsides.The scenes are the result of a series of cyclones and storms in a heavy monsoon season that have struck Asia with torrential rains, gutting essential infrastructure and reshaping landscapes. The violent weather has killed at least 1,200 people in the past week and forced a million to flee without knowing whether their homes will still be standing when they go back.The fallout marks a grim escalation in deadly weather across the region that has been aggravated by the blanket of carbon pollution heating the planet. Areviewby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that south and south-east Asia will suffer more intense rain as temperatures rise, with a “large increase” in flood frequency striking monsoon regions.Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and coauthor of the latest IPCC report, said the cyclones’ behaviour had changed more than their number this season. “They are wetter and more destructive because the background climate has shifted,” he said. “Water, not wind, is now the main driver of disaster.”Natural weather patterns including a La Niña cycle and a negative Indian Ocean dipole have helped to create conditions for the storms to form. Scientists have not determined the extent to which planet-heating pollution contributed to the death toll, which continues to rise with floodwaters, but they have long established that warmer air holds more moisture – about 7% per degree Celsius.The extra water, together with the increase in energy from hotter oceans, leads to the formation of storms that pack far more punch.“Across south and south-east Asia, storms this season have been carrying extraordinary amounts of moisture,” said Koll. “A warmer ocean and atmosphere are loading these systems with water, so even moderate cyclones now unleash rainfall that overwhelms rivers, destabilises slopes and triggers cascading disasters.View image in fullscreenPeople look for survivors and lost belongings after a landslide in Kandy, Sri Lanka.Photograph: Thilina Kaluthotage/Reuters“Landslides and flash floods then strike the most vulnerable, the communities living along these fragile environments.”The rains have loosened soils and levelled slopes in hilly regions that have wiped out villages and rendered roads and railways unusable. The floods have also hampered rescue efforts by disrupting electricity supplies and phone networks.InIndonesia, where freshly cut logs have washed up in flooded parts of the country that also suffer from deforestation, the damage is thought to have been compounded by the felling of trees that could have soaked up water and stabilised the soil. The attorney general’s office is leading a task force to check if illegal activities contributed to the disaster, according to local media. Reuters also reported that the environment ministry planned to query logging, mining and palm plantation companies about their activities.Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich and a co-author of the latest IPCC report, said other human factors may have amplified the extent of the floods, but that did not contradict the role of climate change in worsening rainfall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Even in middle-income countries that have made great progress in turning death tolls into displacement figures, however, experts say response systems are still patchy.“The picture in south-east Asia shows that you still need even better early warning systems, even better shelter for people to go to in times of flooding … [and] even more nature-based solutions – the planting of trees and mangroves in those places particularly at risk of flooding to keep people safer,” said Alexander Matheou, the director of the Asia-Pacific region for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.People also need “better social protection systems in disasters so they can immediately get cash and the food, medicine, and shelter they need when a disaster strikes”, he said.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherIndonesiaThailandSri LankaFloodingClimate crisisAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that consolidating China’s seven existing diplomatic sites in London into a single embassy “clearly brings security advantages”.The Chinese government has agreed to combine all its diplomatic premises inLondoninto the Royal Mint Court site, which spans 20,000 sq metres near Tower Bridge in London.The final decision on whether to grant planning permission has been delayed to 20 January, around the time when the prime minister is planning to travel toChinafor bilateral talks. It is the third time ministers have deferred the decision.Starmer would be the first prime minister to visit Beijingsince Theresa May in 2018. In a speech on Monday night, he argued that the government could not continue to blow “hot and cold” on China and needed to strike a balance.“We had the golden age, which then flipped to an ice age. We reject that binary choice,” he said, describing China as a “nation of immense scale, ambition and ingenuity” and “a defining force in technology, in trade and global governance”.“Our response will not be driven by fear, nor softened by illusion. It will be grounded in strength, clarity and sober realism,” Starmer said.In a letter sent to concerned parties and released by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said their departments had “carefully considered the breadth of considerations” related to the proposed embassy.They said they had worked with police and others to ensure national security issues had been addressed and recognised “the importance of countries having functioning diplomatic premises in each other’s capitals, whilst maintaining the critical need to uphold and defend our national security”.The plan has met fierce opposition from some local residents and campaigners who are concerned about Beijing’s human rights record in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region.Several protests have taken placenear the site in recent months.A government spokesperson said: “An independent planning decision will be made by the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government in due course.”“The Home Office and Foreign Office provided views on particular security implications of this build in January and have been clear throughout that a decision should not be taken until we had confirmed that those considerations had been completed or resolved, which we have now done.“Should the planning decision for a new embassy in the London borough of Tower Hamlets be approved, the new embassy will replace seven different sites which currently comprise China’s diplomatic footprint in London which clearly brings security advantages.”China bought the Royal Mint Court site for £255m in 2018, but its plans to build an embassy there stalled afterTower Hamlets council refused planning permission in 2022.The Conservative government declined to intervene but Labour took the matter out of the council’s hands by calling it in soon after taking power last summer.Explore more on these topicsChinaForeign policyAsia PacificKeir StarmerLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

This is getting worse. The weather’s going to change again in a couple of days. You know, there has to be a plan … I said: ‘This could be lives lost if you don’t take some sort of action, genuinely.’ But they just said: ‘No, there’s no plan.’”The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has been contacted for comment.The Indian authorities evacuated the last of more than 330 of its stranded nationals from Sri Lanka on Monday.Chetak helicopters from Indian aircraft carrier INS Vikrant airlifted several people to safer locations, while Indian Air Force helicopters were said to have aided the Sir Lankans in carrying out search operations in areas with no road access due to landslides and flooding.On Sunday Sri Lanka’s president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, described the fallout from Cyclone Ditwah as the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history”.Beeching said her mother and friend, who had left for a holiday on 21 November and were due to return this Wednesday, had been able to communicate intermittently since the cyclone hit.She said: “They were travelling down from Kandy to the south-east. They were originally going to take the train, but they were advised not to take the train and to drive.“They’re not on a tour or anything, it’s just them. As they were driving down, it hit – this is where the worst of the cyclone has hit, in the mountains, in the plantation region.“On Thursday midday we basically got messages, which said: ‘This is really scary, there’s landslides everywhere, we’ve seen a bus go over the side of the cliff.’“Where they were had the highest lives lost because obviously the landslides just cover people’s houses. Their driver turned around and they were heading back to Kandy but they got as far as a place called Pussellawa.”Beeching, who works for an NGO and was previously at the National Crime Agency, said she had liaised closely with the Foreign Office in the past.She said she had been dismayed by the lack of effort from British officials and that she had been unable to speak to the UK’s high commissioner to Sri Lanka, Andrew Patrick.“[The Sri Lankan tourist police] said the military would have been there a few days ago and that they still haven’t,” she said. “They can hear helicopters flying over, but they’re apparently retrieving bodies.”Explore more on these topicsSri LankaAsia PacificSouth and central AsiaFloodingExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Some areas, including Tapanuli Tengah in North Sumatra and Agam in Aceh, were inaccessible by road, according to Unicef.In Aceh, one of the hardest-hit areas, markets are running out of rice, vegetables and other essentials, and prices have tripled, according to Islamic Relief, which is sending 12 tonnes of emergency food aid. “Communities across Aceh are at severe risk of food shortages and hunger if supply lines are not re-established in the next seven days,” the charity said.The Indonesian government said on Monday it was sending 34,000 tonnes of rice and 6.8m litres of cooking oil to Aceh, as well as the provinces North Sumatra and West Sumatra.View image in fullscreenA resident dries rice that was damaged in a flood-affected village in the Meureudu area.Photograph: Hotli Simanjuntak/EPAThe World Health Organization said it was deploying rapid response teams and critical supplies to the region, and strengthening disease surveillance.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva that it was “another reminder of how climate change is driving more frequent and more extreme weather events, with disastrous effects”.Survivors, many of whom are staying in evacuation shelters,have described how powerful currents of waterarrived rapidly and submerged villages. “We didn’t think we would survive that night because the situation was so chaotic. Everyone was thinking about saving themselves. There was no prior warning whatsoever before the water came,” said Gahitsa Zahira Cahyani, 17, a student at an Islamic boarding school. Hundreds of students from the school ran out in the night to flee to safety, some of them clinging to trees and the mosque’s roof.The season’s monsoons often bring heavy rains that can trigger landslides and floods, but this year’s downpours were compounded by a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca strait, devastating parts of Sumatra and southernThailand, where 181 people were killed.Sri Lanka has also faced catastrophic flooding and landslides, caused by a separate storm, Cyclone Ditwah. It has killed 410, while another 336 remain missing.President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency to deal with what he called the “most challenging natural disaster in our history”.Rains have eased across the country, but landslide alerts remain in force across most of the hardest-hit central region, officials said.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaThailandSri LankaExtreme weatherSouth and central AsiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The eSafety Commission had previously warned it was closely monitoring the app for possible inclusion in the ban.Australia’s eSafety commissioner rejects US Republican’s assertion she is a ‘zealot for global takedowns’Read moreAhead of communications minister Anika Wells’ address to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Google said it will begin signing out underage users from its platform from 10 December, but warned it would mean children and their parents would lose access to safety features.Googlehad strongly opposed YouTube’s inclusion in the ban, after it had initially been exempted from the framework. Google hadraised prospects of a legal challengeto the ban, but Wednesday’s statement did not elaborate on that potential, and Google sources declined to comment.Rachel Lord, Google’s senior manager for public policy in Australia, saidin a blog postthat users under 16s will still be able to watch YouTube videos in a signed-out state, but that children would lose access to “features that only work when you are signed into an account, including subscriptions, playlists and likes, and default wellbeing settings such as “Take a Break” and Bedtime Reminders”.She also warned that parents “will lose the ability to supervise their teen or tween’s account on YouTube”, such as content settings blocking specific channels.Lord wrote: “This rushed regulation misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it.

It will then seek data monthly.In a press conference in Adelaide on Tuesday, Wells foreshadowed more platforms being added to the under-16s ban if children migrated to sites not currently listed.She told media to “stay tuned” for news about Lemon8, an Instagram-style app not included in the ban. Guardian Australia understands the eSafety Commission has written to Lemon8 – owned by TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance – to say the agency would monitor the platform for possible inclusion after the scheme begins.Guardian Australia can reveal Lemon8 has decided to restrict its users to those aged over 16 from 10 December.“If everybody ends up on LinkedIn, and LinkedIn becomes a place where there is online bullying, algorithms targeting 13-to-16-year-olds in a way that’s deteriorating their mental and physical health, then we will go after LinkedIn,” Wells said on Tuesday.“That’s why all platforms are on notice. We have to be agile and dynamic.”Explore more on these topicsSocial media banAustralian politicsLabor partySocial mediaYoung peopleParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

The committee alleged the group colluded to make demands on then-Twitter about what content itshould moderate on its platform.Australian children moving to new social app Lemon8 but owner expected to restrict users to over-16sRead moreThe committee had turned its attention to Inman Grant, after emails from her to the organisation showed the commissioner saying Garm was “helping to hold the platforms to account”.In a letter from Jordan to Inman Grantpublishedlast month, he requested Inman Grant be interviewed by the committee, stating “your expansive interpretation and enforcement of Australia’s [Online Safety Act]... directly threatens American speech”. Jordan referenced eSafety’s failed attempt to have Xremove tweets of footageof the 2024 church stabbing of Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel.Jordan said of Inman Grant: “As a primary enforcer of Australia’s [Online Safety Act] and noted zealot for global takedowns, you are uniquely positioned to provide information about the law’s free speech implications – both in the US and abroad.“This information will inform the committee’s legislative reforms aimed, in part, at ensuring that foreign censors cannot silence protected American speech.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailInman Grant told Senate estimates on Tuesday evening she was sending a letter to Jordan, but did not confirm whether she would appear before the committee.“What I am zealous about is protecting children online but I will be going back to him with a letter, explaining a few things,” she said.Inman Grant said she wrote in the letter that Australians expect companies providing services into Australia to abide by Australian laws. She added that since thechurch stabbing casethat X challenged in the court and eSafety ended up dropping, eSafety had accepted geoblocking Australian users from seeing the posts as compliance with Australian law.“So the conclusion is nothing that we do here with the Online Safety Act affects anything that an American platform will serve to Americans,” she said. “So no, it does not impinge upon Americans’ freedom of speech.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a lot of work to be done.”Calling the meeting “extremely useful, constructive, and informed”, Ushakov nonetheless said the two sides had not come to an agreement on key issues, including the potential lines of territorial control in a potential peace deal between Russia andUkraine.“We did not discuss … specific American proposals, but discussed the essence of what is embedded in these American documents,” Ushakov said of the peace plan presented by the US side. “We could agree with some things … and the president also did not hide our critical and even negative attitude towards a number of proposals.”Some aspects of the negotiations would not be revealed, Ushakov said, and he indicated that another summit between Trump and Putin was not imminent.Ushakov’s remarks were an underwhelming conclusion to talks that the Trump administration had suggested could create a framework to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The downbeat assessment of Tuesday night’s diplomacy follows combative opening statements from Putin as Witkoff and Kushnerarrived for talks at the Kremlin, in which he accused European powers of sabotaging peace in Ukraine and that “European demands” on ending the war were “not acceptable to Russia”.“Europe is preventing the US administration from achieving peace on Ukraine,” Putin said, adding: “Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now.”Putin did not clarify which European demands he found unacceptable.“They are on the side of war,” Putin said of European powers.Witkoff, on his sixth trip to Moscow this year, was expected to present Putin with an updated version of a US peace proposal drafted with input from a senior Russian official and reworked to make it more acceptable to Kyiv.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he was “awaiting signals” from the US delegation after its meeting with Putin, in an intense round of shuttle diplomacy that the Trump administration has claimed is its best chance yet of bringing an end to the war.But there remains significant skepticism that Russia is ready to accept any concessions, rather than continue the war and await a further breakdown in relations between the Trump White House and its European allies.“I am ready to receive all the signals and ready for a meeting with President Trump,” Zelenskyy posted on X. “Everything depends on today’s discussions.”Several US media outlets reported that Zelenskyy was expected to meet with Witkoff and Kushner in Europe after the meeting.A short video feed from the Kremlin showed the two small delegations sitting on opposite sides of an oval white table, with Putin seated next to his advisers Kirill Dmitriev and Yuri Ushakov. Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner about a short tour of Moscow they had taken before the meeting, with Witkoff calling it a “magnificent city”. The feed then cut out.The two Trump allies arrived in Moscow on Tuesday after meeting Ukrainian officials at the weekend in Florida to discuss revisions to the original28-point peace plan, which overwhelmingly favoured Moscow.Zelenskyy, on a diplomatic push to rally support among European capitals that have backed changes to the original plan, said in Paris that the updated version of the proposal “looks better” but emphasised it was “not over yet”.Zelenskyy has objected in particular to provisions in the 28-point plan that would have required Ukraine to surrender territory in the east that it currently controls, and impose limits on the size of its military. He has also demanded clear, enforceable security guarantees from the west to prevent a future Russian invasion.View image in fullscreenJared Kushner (left), Kirill Dmitriev (centre), the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, and Steve Witkoff arrive to meet Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday.Photograph: Kristina Kormilitsyna/APPutin, for his part, has said that only the original US proposal could serve as a basis for further talks, while also stating that it required significant revisions.Despite intense shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks, which has produced several revisions to the US peace plan, bridging the gap remains difficult: Russia’s maximalist demands in effect require Ukraine’s capitulation.Trump said in remarks to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the Ukraine war was a “mess” and not an easy situation to resolve.Putin’s comments appeared aimed at driving a wedge between Washington and European capitals. European officials have had some success in pushing back against the original US plan, though it remains unclear to what extent Washington is taking their concerns into account.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier on Tuesday said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the “understandings” reached recently between Washington and Kyiv, adding that Russia remained open to talks but would insist on achieving the goals of its “special operation”.Those goals amount to sweeping demands that would severely erode Ukraine’s sovereignty, including deep cuts to its armed forces, a ban on western military assistance, far-reaching limits on political independence, and the handover of Ukrainian-controlled territory in the east of the country.On the eve of the talks with the US delegation in Moscow, Putin claimed Russian forces had taken control of thestrategic city of Pokrovskin Ukraine.Dressed in military fatigues during a visit to a command centre on Monday evening, the Russian president hailed what he called the “important” capture of Pokrovsk, once a major logistical hub for the Ukrainian army, though Ukrainian officials later disputed the claim.Russia has spent more than a year attempting to seize the frontline hub, seen as a gateway to Donetsk, and has suffered heavy losses in the process.0:35Russian forces roll 'Mad Max-style' into battered Pokrovsk - videoUkrainian analysts and military bloggers have acknowledged that Russia now holds most of Pokrovsk, with battlefield maps showing its forces largely in control.Buoyed up by recent gains at the front, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.The Russian leader also on Tuesday threatened retaliation against Ukraine’s ports and shipping after Kyiv in recent days struck several vessels in Russia’s so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea.The Russian president threatened that Moscow would “step up strikes on Ukrainian ports and on any ships entering them” in response to attacks on Russian tankers, which he described as “piracy”.Echoing the Kremlin, Russian state media on Tuesday struck a confident tone before the US visit. Komsomolskaya Pravda, often described as “Putin’s favourite newspaper”, wrote that the president’s remarks suggested “more and more Ukrainian territory is coming under our control – and that next time Russia’s terms may be tougher”.The paper implied that Moscow viewed the latest US-Ukrainian talks as a dead end, claiming Kyiv was refusing to capitulate. “The US has tried for the third time in the past 10 days to pressure Ukraine, and Washington has once again failed,” it wrote.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVladimir PutinRussiaUS foreign policyJared KushnerEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If somebody from our allies istired, I’m afraid,” he said. “It’s the goal ofRussiato withdraw the interest of America from this situation.”On Putin’s comments (see above), Zelenskyy said it’s difficult to comment on his words, but noted thatPutin probably doesn’t want to end the war as he has failed to meet his goals in Ukraine. “Now he is thinking how to find new reasons not to [end] this war,”he said. Zelenskyy also said he counts on “pressure from the US” and others to advance the peace talks further.Share"

He was allegedly recruited by Russian intelligence officers in Odesa, southern Ukraine, and was paid $6,000 if he gave confidential information regarding the location of Ukrainian military units around the city.

Its chief executive, Olivier Andriès, told reporters in London on Tuesday that relations were “very strained” between the lead partners on the Future Combat Air System (known as Scaf in France)However, he added that the offices of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, wanted a solution. “Obviously the relationship betweenAirbusand Dassault is extremely difficult,” Andriès said. “Have we reached a breaking point or not on the question? I can’t answer.“I know that on the political side there is still very strong willingness on the French president’s side as well as on the German chancellor’s side to strike a deal and to solve it.”The Scaf would be a so-called sixth-generation fighter jet, combining stealth abilities with advanced electronics and weaponry – as well as potentially flying alongside drones. It would be produced at the same time as therival Global Combat Air Programme, or Tempest, which will be co-produced by Britain’s BAE Systems, Italy’s Leonardo and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and theUS’s F-47 fighter, to be built by Boeing.However, many analysts and industry leaders – including Airbus’s chief executive – have openly mused about whether separate European projects should duplicate efforts to build the planes.Andriès said that cooperation in other parts of Scaf was nevertheless “very smooth”. Safran and Germany’s MTU Engines carried out detailed work to allocate responsibilities at the outset, he added.The chief executive’s comments came during a visit to lobby UK government ministers and express willingness to invest in Britain. Although headquartered in France, Safran employs 5,500 people in the UK in various acquired businesses making landing gear, flight control machinery, seats and other parts for civilian and military aircraft.Andriès said that the company’s electric motors in Pitstone, Buckinghamshire, would play an increasing role in trying to develop crucial magnets that are not reliant on rare earth metals. Aerospace, defence and automotive manufacturers are scrambling to find alternatives to rare earths, afterChina, the dominant supplier, imposed export controlsin retaliation to the US trade war.“Supply chains have been weaponised,” Andriès said. “‘How can we reduce our dependency on rare earths?’ is going to be one thema in the UK.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Belgian paper said two others from “diplomatic circles” had also been arrested over possible “procurement fraud, corruption and conflicts of interest”. The College of Europe did not respond immediately to a request for comment.The Guardian understands that Stefano Sannino, the secretary general of the EU’s external action service between 2021 and 2024 and now aEuropean Commissiondirector general, was another of those arrested. Belgian media also reported his name. Sannino, an Italian official, did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment.A European Commission spokesperson confirmed that “an ongoing investigation is happening into the activities that took place in the previous mandate” but declined to answer further questions, including about the names of the suspects.The College of Europe did not respond to a question about whether Mogherini had been arrested but said it would cooperate fully with the authorities “in the interest of transparency and respect for the investigative process”. It said it remained committed to “the highest standards of integrity, fairness and compliance – both in academic and administrative matters”.Police carried out searches at the Brussels headquarters of the EU’s foreign service, the European External Action Service, as well as several buildings of the College of Europe in Bruges at the request of the prosecutor’s office. Searches also took place at the houses of the suspects, the prosecutor’s office said.It said an investigation was ongoing “to assess whether any criminal offences have occurred”, adding: “All persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty by the competent Belgian courts of law.”The EU foreign service was led by Mogherini from 2014 to 2019, after she had served a few months as Italian foreign minister. She became rector of the EU-funded College of Europe in 2020, acontroversial choicefor some former alumni who claimed she lacked scholarly credentials or experience running a complex academic structure. The College of Europe, founded in 1949 in Bruges, has served as the postgraduate training ground for countless EU officials and diplomats.The case is an unprecedented investigation by the European public prosecutor’s office (EPPO), the only EU body that handles criminal cases, which waslaunched in 2021to combat cross-border fraud involving EU funds. The EPPO can bring criminal cases in courts in any of the 24 EU member states that have joined it, including Belgium.The case centres on whether the College of Europe and or its representatives were informed in advance about the tender for a training programme for young diplomats before the official launch of the bidding process.The EPPO said it had “strong suspicions” that the rules on fair competition had been breached and that confidential information had been shared with one of the candidates taking part in the tender. The College of Europe in Bruges was awarded a contract to run theEuropean UnionDiplomatic Academy in 2021-22 after a decision from the EU foreign service. The EPPO said immunity of the three suspects had been lifted at its request.The EPPO declined to give further details beyond itsinitial statementabout the case so as “not to endanger the ongoing procedures and their outcome”.An EU diplomat said they were happy that the EPPO was working “and is not afraid to go after big names”, adding: “If the allegations are true, they should be severely punished to send a clear message that any type of corruption is not tolerable in the EU.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Indian government denied any privacy implications, stating that Sanchar Saathi “does not automatically capture any specific personal information from you without intimation on the application”.According to Reuters, Apple is among the big tech companies that is reportedly refusing to comply with the edict, while otherlarge tech companies have yet to respond publicly.The app, described as a citizen-centric safety tool, allows users to block and track lost or stolen mobile phones and check how many mobile connections are registered under their name, helping to identify and disconnect fraudulent numbers used in scams.It also helps report suspected fraudulent calls and verify the authenticity of used devices – particularly to check they aren’t stolen – before buying.The order for mandatory installation was quietly given to phone manufacturers by the Indian government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, last week.After it was made public, it was confirmed by the telecom ministry, who described it as a security measure to combat the “serious endangerment” of cybersecurity and fraud that is rampant in India, as well as a means to regulate India’s secondhand phone market.It has been met with outcry by the political opposition, as well as digital freedom activists and groups, who claimed it was a way for the government to gain unfettered access to the 730m smartphones in the country and track people through their phones.KC Venugopal, a leader in the opposition Congress party, said the party would protest against the “dystopian” ruling, adding: “Big Brother cannot watch us.”The internet freedom foundation said it would “fight this direction till it is rescinded”.Priyanka Gandhi, another senior Congress party leader, condemned it as a “snooping app” that violated citizens’ basic right to privacy.According to three sources who spoke to Reuters, Apple intends to refuse to comply with the order, due to significant security concerns. Speaking anonymously, those at the company emphasised that internal policy stipulated that Apple does not comply with such orders anywhere in the world, due to the security and privacy risks they posed to Apple’s iOS operating system. Apple did not respond to official requests for comment.According to the app’s privacy policy, iPhone users will be asked permission to share access to cameras, photos and files. Android users – who represent 95% of India’s smartphone market – will be asked to share call logs, send messages for registration, make and manage phone calls “to detect mobile numbers in your phone”, as well as grant access to cameras and photos.It was reported initially that the government had instructed tech companies to ensure the app could not be disabled. But speaking on Tuesday, the communications minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, denied this. “Keeping it on their devices or not is up to the user,” he said. “It can be deleted from the mobile phone just like any other app.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaSmartphonesAppsMobile phonesApplenewsShareReuse this content"

The 36-year-old mother of two was used to the heavy monsoon showers that drenchSri Lanka’s hilly central region of Badulla every year. But as it kept pounding down without stopping, the family started to feel jittery.Some relocated to a relative’s house, but her brother and his wife decided to stay behind to collect the valuables. As they were inside, a landslide hit the family home.“By some miracle, my brother managed to pull her out of the house through a broken window,” said Niroshani. “They weren’t able to take a single thing out. We were all very scared.”The house was destroyed as it was engulfed with mud and debris, taking all their family possessions with it; one of hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed by Cyclone Ditwah,the worst natural disaster to hit Sri Lankain decades. By Tuesday, the death toll across the island was confirmed as 410. In Badulla alone, 71 people were confirmed dead and a further 53 were still missing.How cyclones and monsoon rains converged to devastate parts of Asia – visual guideRead more“Our home was buried under the earth,” said Niroshani. She and fellow villagers had spent the past two days digging in the mud, trying to salvage any of their belongings, but only managing to retrieve a few kitchen pots and some clothes.“My family is in shock. We have to rebuild from scratch. Sometimes that’s even worse than living,” she said.View image in fullscreenA Sri Lankan Buddhist monk stands near his flooded temple after heavy rainfall in a suburb of Colombo.Photograph: Chamila Karunarathne/EPAThe scale of the damage caused by Cyclone Ditwah is still unclear, but in a speech on Sunday night, Sri Lanka’s president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, described it as the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history”. Villages across the island were decimated and many homes, schools and businesses still remained under water on Monday, including across the capital Colombo. Helicopters were dispatched to the worst-affected areas to try to drop food and other essential supplies to those stranded.before and after images of floodingAccording to the country’s Disaster Management Centre, more than 1.1 million people had been affected by the cyclone’s impact. As the country’s emergency and rescue services were overwhelmed, the military was deployed to help rescue efforts.Kantharuban Prashanth, 32, a school teacher, said he was helping to shelter more than 125 families at a school in Badulla who had been displaced in the flooding since Thursday.“They are very vulnerable and in need of help for about four days now,” he said. “All we received were dry rations that we cook here in the school. All of them share just one toilet. But these families can’t return to their homes because it is not safe. There are cracks in their homes, it is very risky to go back there. We need help.”The damage wrought on Sri Lanka was particularly devastating for the island of 22 million people, which is still recovering fromeconomic collapse in 2022 that left the country bankrupt and restricted access to even basic foods and medicine. Sri Lanka also relies heavily on western tourism as a vital source of income and the industry seems likely to have been hit hard by the impact of the cyclone.Officials have warned that the death toll could still rise, with more than 360 people still missing and some areas still yet to be accessed by rescue teams. Further rain is also forecast for this week, which could further exacerbate the flooding.Siriyalatha Adhikari, a 74-year-old living in Biyagama in western Sri Lanka, said she had lost everything in the cyclone. “We didn’t have time to remove anything from the house. Everything happened so fast. Our whole house was under water, we didn’t think it would flood so quickly,” she said.In Ratnapura, a city in a southern district which was among the areas worst hit, small rescue boats traversed the flood waters, helping people stranded on rooftops and trees. Many complained they had been given no warning to evacuate, despite the threat of rising rivers as the cyclone brought on heavy rains.View image in fullscreenRescue personnel evacuate residents by boat from a flood-affected area after heavy rainfall in a suburb of Colombo.Photograph: Chamila Karunarathne/EPAJA Nilanthi, 45, said her family had watched as the Kalu river in Ratnapura started to rise dangerously on Thursday, until it broke its banks. She said they had received no warning from officials or orders to relocate, even as the water hit dangerously high levels.“We didn’t sleep the whole night because it was raining continuously. No one told us to evacuate. Around six in the morning when families in the village started packing and leaving their homes we did too,” she said.The only thing her family managed to move from the house before it flooded was the fridge. For the next two days, they all sheltered on the roof of an empty house. “We were on the top of this house for two days with flood water on either side of the house. We were trapped there. We didn’t have anything to eat, not even a drop of water,” she said. “I have never been this scared my whole life.”The water started to subside on Sunday and Nilanthi’s family went back to see what remained of their home. When they arrived, they were horrified. “We went home, nothing was left. Our sofa, cupboards, plates, and even our clothes – all covered in thick mud,” said Nilanthi. “Life ahead is tough but I am thankful we managed to get to safety in time.”Explore more on these topicsSri LankaSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherFloodingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The royal collection of works were personal gifts owned by the Russian, Danish and British royal families.The Winter egg is a rock crystal engraved with a frost design on the inside while the outside has rose-cut diamond-set platinum snowflake motifs.On Tuesday it was sold for £22,895,000, beating the world record auction for a Fabergé. Theprevious record was set in 2007when the Rothschild egg was sold for £8.9m.According to Christie’s, the auction is the third time the Winter egg has set a record-breaking price for a Fabergé piece. It has been sold numerous times as its history attracts collectors.After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the egg was taken from St Petersburg to the Kremlin armoury in Moscow alongside other valuable possessions of the royal family.In the 1920s the Soviet government began selling off art treasures from the Hermitage Museum and other collections, often for a fraction of their value. It was later acquired by Wartski of London and in 1934 sold to a British collector for £1,500.For two decades between 1975 and 1994 the egg was believed to be missing, before being sold for £6.8m at Christie’s. Eight years later in 2002 the auction house sold it again for £7.1m.Margo Oganesian, Christie’s head of department for Fabergé and Russian works of art, said: “Christie’s is honoured to have been entrusted with the sale of the exquisite Winter egg by Fabergé for the third time in our history.“Today’s result sets a new world auction record for a work by Fabergé, reaffirming the enduring significance of this masterpiece and celebrating the rarity and brilliance of what is widely regarded as one of Fabergé’s finest creations, both technically and artistically.“With only a handful of imperial Easter eggs remaining in private hands, this was an exceptional and historic opportunity for collectors to acquire a work of unparalleled importance.”Explore more on these topicsArtRussiaLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This must stop, and our new reforms will ensure that survivors are not demonised for the abuse they have suffered.”Under new laws, “bad character” evidence related to a victim’s past sexual history or abuse will no longer be allowed, unless lawyers have evidence to suggest a complainant has previously lied. Previous compensation claims for experiences of crime by victims will be banned under similar conditions.The changes will make it easier for prosecuting barristers to introduce “bad character” evidence about defendants in domestic abuse cases. New legislation, expected to be put before parliament next year, will mean a domestic abuse offence of any type – even if against a different victim – will be admissible in court.The measures come a day after the government announced£550m of funding for victim support, which it said would help rape complainants by formalising special measures such as companions for victims, the use of courtroom screens and the court’s power to pre-record evidence.The move is designed to encourage complainants to keep faith in the criminal justice system, which Lammy has described as on the “brink of total collapse”. Official projections suggest the crown court backlogcould reach more than 105,000 cases by March 2029, and reports of trials now being listed as far away as 2030.Rape victims, who are waiting up to four years for a court date in some cases, are abandoning trials in record numbers. According to an analysis by the Criminal Bar Association,published in the Observer, victims and witnesses abandoned five times more cases in 2024 than before the pandemic.Alex Davies-Jones, the minister for violence against women and girls, said the shake-up was a key part of the government’s mission to halve violence against women in a decade.She said: “This is probably the biggest [change] in how victims experience trials for a generation. It’s about making sure that victims are giving the best evidence possible, they don’t feel like they are the ones on trial and they are able to see justice being done.”Prof Katrin Hohl, the government’s independent adviser on sexual violence, said the new measures would help keep “the focus where it belongs” instead of “over-focusing on the credibility of the victim”.Asked if current laws around violence against women and girls were misogynistic, she said: “Parts of it, yes. For example, this practice.”She added: “I think somewhere in there is an admission that some of the law we currently have is based on deeply problematic beliefs about sexual violence. It’s a recognition that some of our law is shaped by myth and misconceptions, and we need to fix that. Admitting that is a big step.”The move was welcomed by campaigners, who have lobbied for a change in laws to provide greater protection for victims.Maxime Rowson, the head of policy at Rape Crisis England andWales, said that with half of rape survivors experiencing sexual violence more than once in their lifetime, current laws meant they could be penalised for their own vulnerability and the failures of the state.She said: “If implemented well, we hope this new law will mean an end to women being undermined and cross-examined on irrelevant and unrelated past experiences.”‘I just froze … I asked the judge: “Do I need to answer this?”’Penelope* had steeled herself for her court appearance after telling police that her ex-partner, a man nearly twice her age, had raped and coercively controlled her.But she had no way of preparing herself for the moment that her ex-partner’s barrister asked her, without warning, about the sexual abuse her father had inflicted upon her as a child.“I just absolutely froze, and I didn’t really know what to do,” she said. “I asked the judge ‘do I need to answer this?’ and she just told me to answer the question.”During the trial at a magistrates court, during which her ex-partner was facing a charge of coercive control but not rape, she had already been asked about buying sex toys and told she “loved sex”. At no point did the prosecuting barrister from the Crown Prosecution Service intervene, she said.“I just froze, and my heart just started beating, and I went completely cold,” she said. “I just felt so vulnerable and so in shock. I didn’t feel like I could answer many questions after that.”She had never spoken about the abuse, except with her ex-partner and said she was grateful that her mother was not watching. The ex-partner who she says abused her, was acquitted.Penelope hopes a change in the law, which will ban barristers from asking about past complaints, whether or not they lead to a conviction, will stop other complainants having to go through similarly “horrendous” experiences. “It will absolutely help other survivors of abuse,” she said.* Names have been changedInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

This means “whales” are often deployed to place bets on their behalf. As someone known for high-stakes betting, Cottrell has the profile of a “whale”.“Cottrell was not a particularly successful gambler, and frequently lost large sums of money,” the documents allege. This is what led the claimant, who describes himself as an “introducer”, to put Cottrell in touch with Bloom’s syndicate, it is claimed.Substantial profits were made by Bloom and other members of Starlizard Betting Syndicate “by utilising online betting accounts held in the name of an individual called Mr George Cottrell to place bets on sporting fixtures, predominantly football matches”, the document alleges.The paper claims that “Mr Cottrell had given control of his betting accounts to Mr Bloom and the Syndicate so that it was not necessary for bets to be sent to Mr Cottrell for him to place.”The document refers to Cottrell’s 2017 conviction for wire fraud, for which he served several months in a US prison.According to the papers, an arrangement was reached between Bloom, the syndicate and Cottrell that benefited all parties. Cottrell received a 33% share of any wins but appears to have been covered for any of his losses.It is alleged that losses sustained by an individual whose account was used to place bets would generally be borne by Bloom or his syndicate and that the individual therefore achieved their share of the winnings “risk free”.The bets were placed using online gambling accounts held by Cottrell with Stake.com, an offshore casino where users transact in cryptocurrency, the document alleges.Cottrell also tried to procure English and Welsh clients from Dudfield for an offshore gambling site, Tether.bet, despite the firm not holding a UK gambling licence, according to the filing.It is alleged that the agreement reached between the syndicate and Cottrell included that the syndicate would “cease to place its bets via gambling platforms in which Mr Cottrell had a financial interest, such as Tether.bet”.Lawyers acting for Cottrell previously said to the Guardian that he was not a director, shareholder or stakeholder in Tether.bet and had had “no involvement” in any companies that use cryptocurrencies.According to the document, Cottrell indicated a “willingness to proceed” with the agreement that betting accounts in his name could be used by Bloom in February 2022, while at Daphne’s restaurant in west London, with his ex-girlfriend Georgia Toffolo.Starlizard Consulting was originally owned by Blue Lizard Consulting, of which Bloom is the majority shareholder. According to court documents, it provides services to Bloom and others in order to “facilitate the operation of Mr Bloom’s private betting syndicate”.The syndicate’s total winnings are unknown.Dudfield claims he could be owed $17.5m because of a profit-share arrangement in which he says he was entitled to receive 7% of its winnings.The exact membership of the syndicate is also unclear but employees of Starlizard Consulting were given different levels of entry into it as part of their compensation, the document alleges.They claim that Cottrell and one of Bloom’s key associates, Ian McAleavy, continued the syndicate arrangement after Dudfield had been told it was no longer operating.“The claimant was told … that the Syndicate’s use of Mr Cottrell’s betting accounts had ceased,” the documents allege.“In fact Mr McAleavy and Mr Cottrell both knew that the Syndicate was continuing to make use of Mr Cottrell’s betting accounts and they both knew that very significant profits had/could be made as a result of the bets that had been placed and were to be placed,” the documents claim.Dudfield claims he became aware of betting activity that suggested it was ongoing and is therefore seeking his share of the profits it has made, alleging that they lied to him about it being shut down.Lawyers acting for Cottrell were approached for comment. Bloom was approached for comment via Brighton and Hove Albion FC.Bloom has yet to file a defence to the claim.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But 21 states including California, New York and Minnesota, blue states, continue to say no. So as of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states until they comply and they tell us and allow us to partner with them to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer.”In a separate statement to the Guardian, a USDA spokesperson said: “USDA established a Snap integrity team to analyze not only data provided by states, but to scrub all available information to end indiscriminate welfare fraud.“Twenty-eight states and Guam joined us in this fight; but states like California, New York and Minnesota, among 19 other blue states, keep fighting us.”The spokesperson added: “They choose to protect illegals, criminals and bad actors over the American taxpayer. We have sent Democrat states yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds.”The administration did not immediately release a full list of the states that would be targeted under this plan.In July, over a dozen Democratic senators issued a letter to Rollins,callingthe administration’s attempt to build a database on federal food aid recipients an “unlawful privacy violation”.The latest announcement from the administration has raised renewed criticisms of the plan, with New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul,sayingon X: “Genuine question: Why is the Trump administration so hellbent on people going hungry?”Similarly, Democrats on the House agriculture committeesaid: “Yet again, Trump and Rollins are illegally threatening to withhold federal dollars. Snap has one of the lowest fraud rates of any government program, but Trump continues to weaponize hunger.”Angie Craig, the ranking member of the committee echoed similar sentiments,saying: “Rather than address the rising cost of living, the secretary is once again weaponizing hunger by putting political talking points ahead of feeding seniors, children, veterans and Americans with disabilities.“Her disregard for the law and willingness to lie through her teeth comes from the very top,” Craig said, calling the Trump administration “as corrupt as it is lawless”.According tothe Snap website, nearly 42 million people relied on the program each month in fiscal year 2024, with 67% of individuals participating in the program being a child, an elderly adult or an adult with a disability.Despite Rollins previouslycallingthe Snap program “extremely corrupt”, a 2023 USDA factsheetreportedthat the “majority of Snap benefits are used as intended”.Of the 261,770 authorized retailers, only 1,980 were disqualified, 561 were fined and 1,681 received warning letters that year.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Thompson’s death on a New York City street on 4 December 2024 both spurred a sprawling manhunt for his killer and stoked public outrage over the practices of the US’s for-profit health insurance industry.Luigi Mangione under ‘constant watch’ in prison to prevent ‘Epstein-style situation’Read moreFollowing the dispatcher’s orders, Detwiler and another officer went to the McDonald’s. “I saw the male sitting at the table there, next to the bathrooms,” Detwiler said. The man had on a large coat, brown beanie and blue medical mask, just as the tipster had said. “I walked by. I wanted to see what he did when he saw us.”Detwiler asked the man his name and explained that “someone called, they thought you were suspicious”. He asked for identification, which the man provided. This ID would prove to be fake.Detwiler also asked the man to pull down his mask. “I knew it was him immediately,” Detwiler said.Mangione was led into court just after 9.50am, wearing a dark jacket. His hand restraints were removed before he sat at the defense table. He faces Manhattan federal court charges in addition to his state case and has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.Detwiler’s testimony came on day two of a potentially weeklong proceeding about whether evidence was gathered illegally during Mangione’s encounter with police at this fast-food eatery. Mangione’s lawyers have repeatedly pushed for the exclusion of evidence obtained during his arrest, alleging that he was not immediately informed of his constitutional rights.Detwiler and another officer were sent to a local McDonald’s after the restaurant’s manager called 911, saying customers thought they had spotted the shooter. He was the first police officer to question Mangione.The audio recording chronicling Detwiler’s dispatch was played in court.“There’s a male in the [McDonald’s] that looks like the NYC shooter,” police dispatch told Detwiler of the reported sighting.Detwiler responded: “10-4. We’ll be on that.”Prosecutor Joel Seidemann asked Detwiler about his tone.“I was being semi-sarcastic when I said it,” Detwiler explained. “I did not think it was going to be the person that they thought it was.”AsSeidemann’s questioning progressed, Detwiler gave more details about Mangione’s arrest. Body-worn camera footage was displayed in court.Detwiler “stayed calm” after recognizing Mangione and called his supervisor. “Yes, he’s here. It’s him,” Detwiler remembered saying.On the call, Detwiler insisted that he wasn’t kidding. “He was surprised, because he was the one who sent me the text message when we got the call.”“About the free hoagie?” Seidemann asked.“Yes.”Detwiler tried to act as normally as possible, telling Mangione that police were there over complaints that he had been lingering too long. Body-camera footage showed Mangione eating a hash-brown patty and, shortly thereafter, another item.“I asked him if it was a steak sandwich,” Detwiler said. Mangione responded with an mm-hmm. “I said it was my favorite.”“What was the point out of that?” Seidemann said.“Just trying to keep things calm and normal, like I said before.”How much of a role Mangione’s mask played in attracting attention remains unclear.Seidemann asked Detwiler about mask culture in Altoona.“We don’t wear masks,” Detwiler said. “We have antibodies.”And since “no one wears masks” there, Detwiler knew the man they would later identify as Mangione was the man who had prompted suspicion.“He had a mask on,” Detwiler said. “So he had to be the person we were called there for.”Karen Agnifilo, one of Mangione’s attorneys, examined Detwiler after the prosecution wrapped its inquiry. She pressed on details about his identification of Mangione to bolster the defense position that circumstances surrounding the interdiction were legally problematic.Agnifilo asked about the dispatch call, which said that there was a “suspicious male that resembled the NYC shooter” at McDonald’s. The dispatch call was “low-priority”.“It didn’t sound serious on the radio, no,” Detwiler said.“You didn’t use lights and sirens?” Agnifilo said.Detwiler said they did not.Agnifilo noted that Detwiler asked the man he would later identify as Mangione to lower his mask, and he did so right away. She suggested through questioning that the timing seemed off for such a swift identification.“It’s at that moment, two seconds into seeing him, you know: he’s the New York City shooter?”Detwiler again insisted that he knew. “No doubt in my mind.”Agnifilo also sought to suggest that Mangione was held without being apprised of his rights. She asked Detwiler, whose pre-Altoona police résumé includes the air force and private security in Iraq, about he and his partner’s physical position at McDonald’s.Mangione was in the corner booth, back to the wall, and Agnifilo pressed Detwiler to explain whether he and his partner were standing in a way to prevent him from leaving. Detwiler said he and his partner needed room.“We’re not going to stand next to each other and hold each other’s hands.”Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingNew YorkUS crimeUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

What happened next?Michael SainatoTue 2 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 17.59 ESTShareThousands ofStarbucksbaristas are on strike across the US, warning the world’s largest coffee chain to brace for the “longest and biggest” bout of industrial action in its history.Barely a year after Brian Niccol, the Starbucks CEO, tried to draw a line under bitter divisions between its management and unionized workers, pledging to “engage constructively” with them, the American coffee giant is now grappling with an escalating strike during its lucrative holiday trading season.About 2,500 workers are striking across 85 cities and 120 stores – and urging customers to steer clear. Starbucks claims less than 1% of its coffee houses have experienced disruption due to the industrial action.But the union, Starbucks Workers United, which represents 11,000 baristas at more than 550 stores, is threatening to escalate the strike far beyond its current footprint unless executives make concessions during contract negotiations.Four years after the first Starbucks-owned US store voted to form a union, defying intense resistance from the company, relations between the two sides have deteriorated.“It’s still shocking to me to wake up and have them every day still fighting us the way that they’re fighting us,” Michelle Eisen, spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United, told the Guardian. “Because we have proven time and time again that we’re not going anywhere.”For decades, Starbucks, founded in the 1970s, and taken over in the 1980s by Howard Schultz, who built it into the global coffee colossus it is today, successfully fought off unionization.The chain dubbed its workers “partners”, and promoted a package of “industry-leading” benefits, including healthcare coverage and education costs.“I’m not an anti-union person. I am pro-Starbucks, pro-partner, pro-Starbucks culture,” Schultztold employeesin 2022. “We didn’t get here by having a union.”View image in fullscreenBaristas and supporters picket outside a Starbucks in New York last month.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersBy then, however, cracks had already started to appear in the dam. The previous year baristas at a store in Buffalo, New York, voted 19-8 in favor of unionizing – setting the stage for hundreds of outlets across the US to follow suit.Michelle Eisen started working at the Buffalo store in August 2010, to supplement her job as a production stage manager, in between theater shows.She was a longtime Starbucks customer, and trusted its reputation for treating workers well. And for years, Eisen felt valued as an employee, receiving regular wage increases and working around her production schedule.But things started to change in about 2016, according to Eisen. “We saw our benefits costs go up significantly. Those twice-a-year raises went away completely,” she said in an interview. “All of a sudden, we were getting one cost of living raise at the beginning of the calendar year, which, most of the time, was significantly less than the raises previous to that. And that’s really when we started to see the staffing levels slowly start to decline in these stores.”Four years later, things “really, really, really came to a head”, Eisen said.‘Coffee-making robots’: Starbucks staff face intense work and customer abuseRead moreStarbucks stores stayed open when Covid hit in 2020. Baristas were startled to encounterincreasingly aggressive and confrontationalcustomers, and some workers felt their pay was too low for what they believed had become more intense work in deteriorating conditions.Eisen, whose theater job was shut down due to the pandemic, took on as many hours as she could at Starbucks, but still struggled to make ends meet. After 11 years at the company, she was only making a few cents more an hour than a new hire. In 2021, she considered quitting.But then she started speaking with co-workers about organizing a union. A group of about 50 Starbucks baristas in the Buffalo areawent publicwith their plan in August 2021.“To me, it was a no-brainer,” said Eisen. “Because it gave an opportunity to try to address some of these problems, and fix them from the inside. And I was hoping, beyond hope, that it would work, we would be successful, and I wouldn’t have to leave. Because I didn’t want to.”Starbucks executives did not see the move as a no-brainer. Managers and corporate executives, including the chain’s then North American president, Rossann Williams, and Schultz,descendedon Buffalo in an effort to stop the effort to unionize.“No partner [employee] has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks,” Schultz wrote in a letter to workers. “And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now.”“They waged an absolutely vicious union-busting campaign,” claimed Eisen. “They still are, but it started there in Buffalo, from the very beginning. And against all odds, in spite of that, my store was able to win their union election on December 9, 2021 and became the first [unionized] store. And then it was kind of a whirlwind.”Since that first victory, mobilizing workers havewon more than 650 union elections, and lost about 120.The chain has since moved to closed 59 unionized stores, according to Starbucks Workers United. Others are still awaiting for results to be certified.As as a wave of mobilization started to sweep the firm’s ranks in early 2022, its top tier was overhauled. Three months after the Buffalo vote, Starbucksabruptly announcedits CEO, Kevin Johnson, was standing down, and Schultz, its veteran boss, would return for a third stint in charge.Shares in Starbucks were under pressure, costs were rising as Covid continued to disrupt supply chains, and – while the firm continued to generate billions of dollars in sales every quarter – customers were spending less time inside its stores.Starbucks stock price has fluctuated across three different CEOsSchultz was tasked with turning around a business many on Wall Street felt was losing its way. Many of his freshly unionized baristas agreed. But Schultz declined to work with Starbucks Workers United,declaringhe would never embrace the union, and offering new benefits and pay increases to non-union workers.“It was just infuriating that we were being bullied in this way, and made to feel like we were doing something wrong, because we were trying to hold the company accountable and trying to make them better,” said Eisen.A new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, was tapped later that year. Unionized baristas started to take action, including by demonstrating on the chain’s “red cup day” holiday in November 2022 and 2023.Relations slowly improved. In early 2024, Starbucks and Starbucks Workers United agreed a new framework for collective bargaining agreements, sparking hope of a first union contract by the end of that year. Workers at unionized stores were granted the benefits that had been given to non-union workers in 2022.But the chain’s business woes appeared to worsen, with competition mounting and footfall declining. Narasimhan was ousted after 16 months as CEO last year, and replaced by Brian Niccol, the Chipotle boss.Bargaining stuttered to a halt following Niccol’s arrival, according to the union. “The company picked right back up where they left off at the end of 2023, when it came to violating workers rights,” said Eisen. “And we still don’t have a contract.”View image in fullscreenA Starbucks outlet in New York.Photograph: Adam Gray/Getty ImagesNiccol moved fast in an effort to turn around the chain,launchinga “Back to Starbucks” campaign, aimed at reversing declining sales. Hefaced criticismafter it emerged he would commute from his home in Newport Beach, California, to the firm’s Seattle headquarters, rather than relocate.Progress at the bargaining table, meanwhile, stalled. Niccol remained mum on the union, and its pursuit of a first union contract.“The changing of CEOs within the last five years alone has kind of shown that this company has a lot it’s still figuring out,” Zarian Antonio Pouncy, who has worked for 11 years as a barista in Las Vegas, told the Guardian. His store unionized in late 2023.Pouncy said: “Instead of listening to the partners – listening to those on the forefront, dealing with the business every day – they’re relying too much on leadership in their opinion, and AI, algorithms and numbers, to kind of show them how business works.”Julie Su has been watching closely. As US deputy secretary of labor, and acting labor secretary, between 2021 and 2025, she helped oversee the Biden administration’s efforts to reinvigorate the US labor movement – as thousands of Starbucks baristas voted to unionize.“When workers choose a union, they deserve a contract,” Su told the Guardian. “Too often, it takes a long time to get one because the employer uses delay as a weapon.“The time to a first contract is used to punish workers for unionizing, to undermine the effort, or to send a message that there is no benefit to joining a union because nothing changes at work for years. Usually all of the above. This is unacceptable.”On average, it takesabout 15 monthsfor a union to secure a first contract with an employer, often due to delays and obstruction by management. At Starbucks, nearly 48 months have passed since the Buffalo store voted to unionize.“The other way this operates as a specific tool for union-busting in the case of a company like Starbucks is the company tries to wait out its employees, hoping that they leave before a contract is reached,” added Su.View image in fullscreenIn this 2021 picture, Starbucks employees in Buffalo celebrate after winning their union election to become the first unionized store in the US.Photograph: Joshua Bessex/APStarbucks Workers United hasfiledhundreds of unfair labor practice (ULP) charges with the National Labor Relations Board. Dozens of union leaders have been fired, allegedly in retaliation for their union support. Starbucks denied this in all cases, although several workerswon reinstatements.Tensions simmered. Starbucks Workers United claimed baristas at several hundred stores walked off the job last December. And in April, union delegates voted to reject a contract proposal from the company which would have guaranteed annual raises of at least 2%, dismissing the increase as “not good enough”.On 13 November – “Red Cup Day”, inside the Starbucks empire – more than a thousand US workers walked off the job, demanding the chain present a “fair” contract. The chain played down the strike’s impact.The union escalated. A week later, the action was expanded to 65 cities and 95 stores, with 2,000 workers on strike. Starbucks Workers United also staged a blockade of Starbucks’ largest distribution center on the US east coast, in York, Pennsylvania.On 24 November, Starbucks workers rallied outside the company’s corporate office in Newport Beach, Niccol’s part-time base, to demand the company finish the contract.On 28 November, the strike was expanded further. About 2,500 baristas across 120 stores are now involved, according to the union.“The company has been stonewalling us,” said Diego Franco, a Starbucks barista for six years in Chicago. “My store chose to go out on Red Cup Day, the busiest sales day for the company, because we were frankly fed up.“You can’t expect us to continue to come into work, to continue to push policies and procedures that don’t actually fix any of the problems that we face at work – not just for my co-workers, but for the customers and our regulars. I would much rather stand outside in the cold and be on strike than know that I’m showing up to work where I’m constantly being disrespected by our CEO, and by upper management.”Contacted for comment, Starbucks played down the impact of the strike so far, andclaimedto have seen record holiday sales so far this year.“As we’ve said, 99% of our 17,000 US locations remain open and welcoming customers – including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened,” said Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks. “Regardless of the union’s plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption.“When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we’re ready to talk. The facts are clear: Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging $30 per hour for hourly partners. People choose to work here and stay here – our turnover is less than half the industry average, and we receive more than a million job applications every year.”View image in fullscreenA person holds a placard as Starbucks workers go on strike.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesA growing number of progressive political leaders are unpersuaded by such reassurances. More than 100 members of Congresssignedletters demanding Starbucks return to negotiations with the union and finish the contract.“While workers are on strike, I won’t be buying any Starbucks, and I’m asking you to join us,” New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, wrote on social media. His transition co-chair, Lina Khan, and incoming first deputy mayor Dean Fuleihan havestoodon picket lines. Mamdani appeared on a picket line with Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday.Seattle’s mayor-elect, Katie Wilson,appearedon a Starbucks picket line hours after her acceptance speech, where she told workers and supporters: “Baristas are the heart and soul of this company, and they deserve better than empty promises and corporate union-busting.”Eisen left Starbucks in May, after 15 years. She currently serves as the principal spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.She said: “This company is being run into the ground, and these unionized workers are the only ones standing up and saying, ‘Hey, what are you doing? Our cafes are not places that people want to come spend time any more. They don’t want to come in and spend their money here because of the way you are running this business. You have to start investing in us if you want to see this company turned around.’“Workers are done, and they’re going to continue to escalate.“They’re going to continue to be on the unfair labor practice strike, and they are prepared to make this the longest and biggest strike in company history if the company doesn’t return to resolve these remaining issues.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsStarbucksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bitcoin’s value has fallen sharply since the start of October and erased a year of large gains.Shares inAmerican Bitcoin, which trades as ABTC, dropped to $1.90 after closing a day earlier at $2.39. The stock was previously at the lower level in May, before peaking at $9.31 on Sept 9 and then falling 78% to today’s trading value.The company closed 38.8% lower, wiping roughly $1bn from its market value. Trading volume in the stock was almost 40 times the daily average, according to Bloomberg data.Eric Trump, the president’s second son,claimed last month on Xthat the Texas-based crypto miner handles 2% of the world’s bitcoin supply.“I truly believe we are building one the greatest crypto companies anywhere on earth,” he said, rhetorically following in his father’s footsteps.After ABTC’s shares fell, Eric Trump said on X that the sell-off was caused by investors exercising their option to “cash in on their profits for the first time which is why we will see volatility.“I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” he added.The abrupt decline in value of ABTC comes amid a broad selloff in the digital asset market. Bitcoin has plunged more than 30% from a 6 October peak of $126,272 a bitcoin to $92,133. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said last week that $1tn in value has been wiped off the crypto market globally since then.American Bitcoin, which was created out of another company, Hut 8 Corp, earlier this year, reported third-quarter net income of $3.5m on revenue of $64.2m in November,Bloomberg reported.Eric Trump’s crypto mining venture is only one part of the Trump family’s crypto-linked family business, which started in 2022 with thelaunch of an NFT, or non-fungible token. The Trump family launched the crypto firm World Liberty Financial in 2024 and a cryptocurrency that bears the family name, $Trump, in 2025.Like American Bitcoin, other Donald Trump-affiliated crypto ventures are in the tank, including WLFI, a token of World Liberty Financial, which has dropped in value from 26 cents in early September to about 16 cents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was for years a crypto sceptic, calling it variously “not money” and “based on thin air”, but he reconsidered the controversial asset class during his second presidential campaign and became the first major US presidential candidate to accept donations in cryptocurrency.Shares in the Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which started acquiring bitcoin this year, are trading at around $11, down from $42 in early February.Late last month, 41 year-old Eric appeared undaunted by the fall in crypto values.“What a great buying opportunity,”he told Bloomberg.“People who buy dips and embrace volatility will be the ultimate winners. I have never been more bullish on the future of cryptocurrency and the modernization of the financial system.”Explore more on these topicsEric TrumpCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The largest warehouse club chain in the US also pointed out the law “does not use the word ‘tariff’ or any term of equivalent meaning”.In November, the supreme court heard oral arguments over Donald Trump’s tariffs, and justices in the conservative-majority courtappeared skepticalover the White House’s arguments that the IEEPA covers Trump’s tariffs.“The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” the chief justice, John Roberts, said during arguments.While the supreme court is set to make its decision on the tariffs in the spring, Costco said its lawsuit was urgent because even if the supreme court ruled Trump’s tariffs unconstitutional, importers are not guaranteed a refund for “those unlawfully collected tariffs”.Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the federal agency that collects tariffs, “liquidates” or finalizes the total amount of tariffs an importer owes 314 days after the goods enter the country. Federal courts have warned that importers may lack legal rights to recover refunds of tariffs for goods that have been liquidated, “even where the underlying legality of a tariff is later found to be unlawful”.If too much time has passed since an importer paid a tariff, importers like Costco might not get a refund on the tariffs, even if the supreme court eventually deems the duties unconstitutional.In addition to halting this liquidation, Costco is asking the court of international trade to declare Trump’s tariffs illegal, stop the collection of duties and order a refund for any of Trump’s tariffs that Costco paid. CBP did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.Total tariffcollectionin fiscal year 2025, which ended in September, soared to $195bn, compared to $118bn in fiscal year 2024, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Monthly custom duties went from $7bn in January to $30bn in September.Costco has not disclosed how much it has paid in duties over the last year, but the company has said that a third of its sales in the US are imports from other countries, with nearly half coming from China, Mexico and Canada.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsRetail industryTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Announced on GivingTuesday, the Dells believe it’s the largest single private commitment made to US children.It is also unusual in that it will operate through investment accounts set up by the US Department of Treasury that will be managed by private companies. Dubbed “Trump accounts”, the program has not yet launched but was passed into law on 4 July as part of the president’s signature legislation. The administration had already said that it planned to contribute $1,000 into Trump accounts for each child born between 2025 and 2028.Funds in Trump accounts must be invested in an index fund, which track the overall stock market.“Trump accounts will be the first – I guess you could say – first real trust funds for every American child, allowing family members, employers, corporations, generous donors to contribute money that will be invested and grow,” Trump said in a White House press conference on Tuesday, hours after the announcement of the Dells’ pledge.He continued: “An investment’s gonna be made, that investment’s gonna continue to grow – we hope, right, we hope. But it will.”Trump suggested that he would personally donate to the Trump accounts. During the conference, Michael Dell said that he had spoken to other “wealthy Americans” about also contributing.“Our gift will cover most of the children that are 10 or under that are not part of the federal program, the zero to two year olds,” said Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies whose estimated net worth is $148bn, according to Forbes.Through their gift, the Dells will deposit $250 into each qualified child’s investment account, which they said the treasury plans to launch on 4 July 2026. Dell said they wanted to mark the 250th anniversary of US independence.But it will be up to the families of other children to put money into the accounts. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business.The Dells hope their gift will encourage families to claim the accounts and deposit more money into it, even small amounts, so it will grow over time along with the stock market.In 2024, about 13% of children and young people in the US lived in poverty, according to the Annie E Casey Foundation, and experts link the high child poverty rates to the lack of social supports for new parents, like paid parental leave.The Dells will put money into the accounts of children who live in zip codes with a median family income of $150,000 or less.While the funds in the Trump accounts may help young adults whose families or employers can contribute to them over time, they will not immediately help to diminish childhood poverty. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and childcare that were also included in the spending package are likely to reduce the support children from low-income families receive.“We are going to make sure that all American families have a stake in the success of the United States of America,” Scott Bessent, the secretary of the treasury department, said in the Tuesday press conference. “People who have a stake in the system and become more and more invested in the system do not want to bring down the system. They want to make it better.”The Trump accounts, he added, had started “a new age of capitalism and market interest”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I have no other words for that,” says German-born Michael Lohscheller, the chief executive of Polestar, Europe’s only all-electric car manufacturer.“If Europe doesn’t take the lead in this transformation, be rest assured, other countries will do it for us.”The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has called on the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to soften the 2035 cutoff date. He has asked her to permit the manufacture of new hybrid and highly efficient combustion engine cars beyond 2035 as consumers are still hesitant to buy EVs.“We’re sending the right signal to the commission with this letter,” Merz said, adding that the German government wanted to protect the climate in “a technology-neutral way”.Sitting in Polestar’s glass panelled offices in Gothenburg inSweden, Lohscheller, cannot believe what is unfolding.His attempts to take part in the EU’s year-old “strategic dialogue” on the future of the car industry were snubbed. “I wrote twice, I’m not even sure we got an answer to the second letter,” he says.Across the road in Gothenburg, high above the giantVolvoassembly plant, Håkan Samuelsson, the 74-year-old chief executive of Volvo Cars, has seen it all.“I don’t see the logic in slowing down,” he says.Samuelsson likens the resistance mounted by the multibillion car industry to the opposition to catalytic convertors, and to seatbelts 50 years ago.“If they were not mandatory, we would probably have 30% of our cars without seatbelts and if you consider the additional cost we probably wouldn’t have any cars with catalytic converters either unless they were mandatory,” he says.View image in fullscreenHåkan Samuelsson, the chief executive of Volvo, says there is no logic to rolling back on the 2035 ban on petrol cars.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianVolkswagen and BMW, Samuelsson says, “can do with they like”, but if they take the foot off the electrification pedal, they will just widen the gap for China.“The Chinese will set up factories in Hungary and Slovakia, Romania … in low labour cost markets. I don’t think it’s possible to keep them out of the EU with tariffs. You just need to meet them face on and compete with them,” he says.Samuelsson says there is no need for von der Leyen to make a decision now and should delay it until closer to the cutoff date. “We have time. We have 10 years.”Michael Bloss, the Green’s rapporteur at the European parliament, says Merz’s demands “would completely gut” hard-fought EU legislation and “effectively give the combustion engine a free pass”.The Greens and the Swedes are adamant that prolonging hybrid cars will send a message to consumers that they do not need to buy electric and will be self-fulfilling for the car industry’s arguments.Lohscheller is equally direct. “The Chinese will not pause. They will take over. If Brussels pauses this [target] and says: ‘Stop we will give you another five years,’ they are really putting hundreds and thousands of jobs at risk.”View image in fullscreenMichael Lohscheller, the chief executive of Polestar, says the very notion of scrubbing out the 2035 date is preposterous.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianThe fast-talking, marathon-running executive says the very notion of scrubbing out the 2035 date, agreed only three years ago, is preposterous.Lohscheller was part of the original talks that led to the EU decision in 2022 to phase out the sale of all new internal-combustion engines in 2035, hailed by the then EU vice-president Frans Timmermans as a major step towards carbon neutrality in 2050.“When I was CEO of Opel, I took part in all these meetings and went to Brussels twice a year. We discussed it for hours and hours,” the Polestar boss says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Do I train and say it’s difficult, so I’ll do a half marathon instead? No.”With decades of experience behind him as the former chief financial officer of VW, and the former chief executive of Opel and the Vietnamese car company Vinfast, Lohscheller says Germany, which is in the throes of economic challenges, needs to learn to adapt. And fast.“It is a mindset, an attitude. I was just in China and Korea last week and came back to Germany, my home country.“It is so obvious in Germany that everyone wants to defend the past, they don’t want to change anything, just defend what they have. I can talk with authority because I am German. In China and the US is it like ‘what is the next idea? What is the next project? What is the next company we try out? That is a big difference. It is a completely different mindset.”Polestar, which began as a racing car company in 1996, was bought by Volvo in 2015 and then spun off in 2017 and relaunched as a separate EV-only production company. It is now majority owned by the Chinese Volvo shareholder Geely.Asked whether the Chinese ownership may make Brussels nervous of Volvo’s view, Samuelsson says that Volvo is still a Swedish company. “We were with Ford for 11 years and now 14 or 15 with Geely and been developing very positively. We are listed in the Swedish stock exchange and all rules we follow are European. We are Swedish. We are no more Chinese than we were American. We are as Swedish as Abba and Ikea. “He says the EU must continue to speed ahead on electrification. It is the future. Polestar have a car that has driven 560 miles (900km) without being charged.Samuelsson says Volvo, which has five all-electric cars, and is about to launch the EX60, an electric version of its bestseller, XC60, already offers ranges of 310-370 miles.This ticks one of the three big consumer concerns buying EVs, says Samuelsson. The second is charging time. This has to be down to 15-20 minutes, “the same time as the biological pause a driver needs” at the motorway stop, to get a coffee, go to the bathroom and stretch their legs. This he said will be “no problem” in the future.“The third thing which holds consumers back is the price,” he continues.“[If] we the car industry fulfil these three I think it [EV take up] will speed up. So I really don’t see a reason today to start questioning if 2035 is too fast. We have time. We need to speed this up not slow down.”Samuelsson also wonders about the value of constant talk about net zero that is not backed up by development on the ground.“Listening to these Cop discussions in Brazil, you start wondering if all this discussion leads to an improvement of the climate or not?“I’m more and more leaning to the view that it is technical development and innovations that are needed to do the job. Talking will not do the job.“Electrification will do the job. It is good for the climate. It is really important. It is also good for customers. It’s one of the very few environmentally friendly innovations that customers also will love.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryVolvoMotoring (Technology)Electric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoring (Money)European UnionSwedenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The eSafety Commission had previously warned it was closely monitoring the app for possible inclusion in the ban.Australia’s eSafety commissioner rejects US Republican’s assertion she is a ‘zealot for global takedowns’Read moreAhead of communications minister Anika Wells’ address to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Google said it will begin signing out underage users from its platform from 10 December, but warned it would mean children and their parents would lose access to safety features.Googlehad strongly opposed YouTube’s inclusion in the ban, after it had initially been exempted from the framework. Google hadraised prospects of a legal challengeto the ban, but Wednesday’s statement did not elaborate on that potential, and Google sources declined to comment.Rachel Lord, Google’s senior manager for public policy in Australia, saidin a blog postthat users under 16s will still be able to watch YouTube videos in a signed-out state, but that children would lose access to “features that only work when you are signed into an account, including subscriptions, playlists and likes, and default wellbeing settings such as “Take a Break” and Bedtime Reminders”.She also warned that parents “will lose the ability to supervise their teen or tween’s account on YouTube”, such as content settings blocking specific channels.Lord wrote: “This rushed regulation misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it. Most importantly, this law will not fulfill its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube.”While not flagging any legal options, Lord added: “We are committed to finding a better path forward to keep kids safe online.”In her speech to the Press Club, Wells will concede the government’s plans to bar under-16s from social media might take “days or even weeks” to properly take effect, and won’t work perfectly from day one.Wells said the government remains committed to the social media ban, stressing that platforms which allow children to remain online after next Wednesday would be breaking the law.“We know it won’t be perfect from day one but we won’t give up – and we won’t let the platforms off the hook,” Wells will say.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMeta hastold users of Facebook, Instagram and Threads what to expectfrom next week,as has Snapchat.

It will then seek data monthly.In a press conference in Adelaide on Tuesday, Wells foreshadowed more platforms being added to the under-16s ban if children migrated to sites not currently listed.She told media to “stay tuned” for news about Lemon8, an Instagram-style app not included in the ban. Guardian Australia understands the eSafety Commission has written to Lemon8 – owned by TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance – to say the agency would monitor the platform for possible inclusion after the scheme begins.Guardian Australia can reveal Lemon8 has decided to restrict its users to those aged over 16 from 10 December.“If everybody ends up on LinkedIn, and LinkedIn becomes a place where there is online bullying, algorithms targeting 13-to-16-year-olds in a way that’s deteriorating their mental and physical health, then we will go after LinkedIn,” Wells said on Tuesday.“That’s why all platforms are on notice.

Under the floodlights of this storied old ground you were welcome to take your pick. The inevitable Erling Haaland smashed through the 100-goal barrier and a Premier League record. Phil Foden scored hissecond double in four days. City raced to a 5-1 lead before an hour was even on the clock only for Fulham to come agonisingly close to parity by the end. All of that resulted in the seventh highest-scoring match in three ­decades of the Premier League. Not bad.The pendulum swung throughout the contest in movements big and small. City set off with gusto and looked to have sealed the result with two short spells of dominance before and after half-time. But Fulham had more shots and more possession and were in charge of the match from the moment Alex Iwobi calmly scored their second 12 minutes into the second half. City have the points on the board in theirongoing pursuit of Arsenal, they could not disguise defensive vulnerabilities. Fulham, meanwhile, were unable to halt a run of defeats against City that now runs to an astonishing 19, but yet showed they could compete with anyone.Manchester City’s win at Fulham ‘impossible’ to enjoy, says GuardiolaRead moreThere were signs this match might prove exceptional within the first five minutes, when Haaland conspired to miss a one-on-one. Played in by Foden, he wrapped a shot beyond Bernd Leno but watched stunned as the ball hit the post and ran across the face of goal. Was this a bad omen for the Norwegian, who had been sitting on 99 goals in the English top flight for all of two games? It turned out not: 12 minutes later he opened the scoring, ­punching the ball through a sprawling Leno after Tijjani Reijnders had dummied a Jérémy Doku cross.A calm celebration followed, arms quietly aloft, but it was quite the achievement. Despite the 180‑minute wait Haaland had become the fastest player to register aPremier Leaguecentury and by some distance. Alan Shearer, the previous record holder, required 124 games to reach the milestone, Harry Kane 141. Haaland had done it in just 111.The travelling City fans, who were in good voice, belted out the name of their No 9 and Haaland soon produced another decisive moment for his team. With 37 minutes on the clock and Rúben Dias on the ball on the halfway line, he dropped deep from his customary hunting ground, and sent his marker Joachim Andersen for a loop. Spinning past the Dane as he tried to close ground, Haaland prodded a pass into the vacated space where Reijnders ran on to scoop the ball over Leno and double the lead.Two then became three when Leno opted to punch clear a corner he could have caught and the ball dropped into Foden territory on the right-hand side of the box. Hot on the heels of his exploits against Leeds, the England man was in total control of matters as he took a touch and bent a beautiful left-foot effort inside the far post. Even then, the half still was not over asFulhamgave themselves a modicum of hope when Emile Smith Rowe looped a diving header over Gianluigi Donnarumma from a sweet Harry Wilson cross.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland shows his delight after becoming the fastest player to score 100 Premier League goals.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat hope endured the length of the half-time break, and another 120 seconds or so, then City once again pulled away. They scored their fourth in the 48th minute, a three-man break still enough to cut Fulham open with Doku’s cross finding Foden via ­Haaland’s back-heel and the midfielder finishing calmly. Six minutes later City made it five; Doku robbed Andersen on the edge of the penalty area and his shot took a big deflection off Sander Berge and in past Leno.That would surely be that. But Fulham never looked cowed and when the dependable Iwobi ­sidefooted home from the edge of the box after City failed to clear a Wilson cross, there was a sudden change in atmosphere. The crowd led the shift, roaring the team on with an almost perverse sense of encouragement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first was drilled home from the edge of the box but took the video assistant referee an age to confirm. The second came after Donnarumma delivered his own weak punch from a corner, Chukwueze drilling it back past the Italian with interest.When the assistant referee flashed eight minutes of added time, it felt like the most chaotic of draws was almost inevitable. And when the sprightly Josh King received the ball in the box, shifted and got a low shot off, it felt like the moment had arrived.But Josko Gvardiol scooped the ball clear while on his heels, the whistle blew shortly afterwards, and whatever magic had descended on south-west London was dispersed into the night, along with an enraptured crowd.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

And so when you’re not winning, it’s not entertaining.”The Steelers are tied at the top of the AFC North and have never endured a losing campaign in Tomlin’s 18 full seasons in charge. However, they gave up 249 rushing yards in their loss to the Bills and some fans could be heard calling for Tomlin to be fired. There are problems on the other side of the ball too, with quarterback Aaron Rodgers saying that he was “disappointed in the offensive performance” against the Bills.In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contendersRead more“If you’ve been in this business, you understand that, and so I respect it,” Tomlin said. “I share frustrations, I understand what makes this thing go, and winning is what makes this thing go.”The Steelers also gave up sloppy penalties and defensive captain Cam Heyward was involved in a confrontation with Bills quarterback Josh Allen.“I own the responsibility of making sure that these guys understand a component of being a tough team to beat is not beating ourselves,” Tomlin said. “We had some penalties and certainly you’re going to have penalties when you play. But penalties of the 15-yard variety, loss of composure and things of that nature hadn’t been us. And so that needs to be corrected immediately.”While the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens both have 6-6 records at the top of the AFC North, the Ravens edge the tiebreaker on points differential and have a significantly easier run-in. The teams play each other twice before the end of the season – the first meeting is this coming Sunday – and most prediction models have the Ravens as favorites to take the division. The Steelers are also 6-11 over their last 17 games going back to last season.“Certainly our last performance wasn’t up to snuff [on Sunday], but I don’t know that it lessens our belief in self or our ability to deliver individually and collectively moving forward,” Tomlin said.While Tomlin has consistently led the Steelers to the playoffs – and won the Super Bowl in the 2008 season – their last postseason victory came in January 2017.Explore more on these topicsPittsburgh SteelersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Although she described her departure at the time as “evolving away” from the sport rather than a hard retirement, she filed the paperwork with the ITIA that September that exempted her from the sport’s stringent whereabouts requirements. To return to competition, however, players must make themselves available for out-of-competition testing for six months before they are allowed to enter an event.Williams’s name appeared on the agency’s updated testing-pool list dated 6 October. An ITIA spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian on Tuesday that Williams had requested reinstatement, while emphasizing that a place on the list was not itself evidence of a comeback.“Serena Williams is back on the Registered Testing Pool list,” an ITIA spokesperson said, noting that athletes returning from retirement “need to make themselves available for testing for six months before they can compete again”, in line with World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) regulations.Later on Tuesday, Williams publicly disputed that her inclusion in the pool signaled any plans to return. “Omg yall I’m NOT coming back,” shewrote on X. “This wildfire is crazy.”A representative for Williams did not immediately respond to questions from the Guardian about her intentions.The ITIA’s registered pool does not include every active player; it is largely reserved for top-ranked singles competitors, high-level doubles and wheelchair athletes, and pros coming back after extended absences.Rumors about a possible cameo appearance at the US Open circulated quietly during this year’s tournament, particularly around the mixed doubles event, which has evolved into a two-day showcase packed with star wildcards. But because Williams remained classified as retired at the time, she was not eligible to enter.People familiar with the process have told the Guardian that Williams explored a return earlier than this autumn. One attempt to rejoin the testing pool was made in August, just before the US Open, most likely with the hope of playing doubles alongside her sister Venus. Those plans dissipated once it became clear that the six-month testing window could not be waived, a restriction that blocked Andy Roddick from a similar last-minute doubles cameo in 2014.Venus Williams, 45, never formally retired and therefore avoided the same procedural hurdles. She returned this summer after a 16-month break, earninga singles win in Washington, pushingNo 11 seed Karolína Muchová to a deciding setin New York andreaching the US Open doubles quarter-finalswith Leylah Fernandez. She is expectedto resume her schedule in Aucklandearly next season.Serena’s reappearance on the ITIA documents does not guarantee a comeback, but it does restore her eligibility timeline. If she remains in the pool without interruption, she could enter tournaments as early as mid-2026. Whether she intends to contest singles again, reunite with Venus in doubles, or simply preserve the option to do so remains uncertain.Explore more on these topicsSerena WilliamsTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I have loved just being in Bromley. It just reminds me of when I was a younger kid and it’s the same bedroom, same everything.Iga Swiatek: ‘I didn’t want to give any points for free – it’s a Wimbledon final and I wanted to win’Read more“Bromley has some amazing speciality coffee shops now that didn’t exist a few years ago. And I’ve been trying every new spot. It’s been really nice, and obviously so much greenery, and it’s been fun actually. I’ve been commuting on the train. So I’ve been part of rush hour every day, which has also been an experience. But it’s like my switch off. As soon as I get on the South Western to Waterloo, I’m just like: ‘My day is done now.’”The inner peace and contentment that Raducanu speaks of has been hard‑earned at the end of a positive if unspectacular season when she took several steps forward. The 23‑year‑old rose from outside the top 60 to No 29 in 2025, her highest ranking since 2022. She played more frequently than ever this year with largely consistent results.She has also taken steps to find stability within her team, a glaring issue since the start of her career. Raducanu appears to have found a fruitful coaching partnership with the Spaniard Francisco Roig, previously a longtime member of Rafael Nadal’s coaching team, and she will start the 2026 season with a new combined physiotherapist and strength and conditioning coach in Emma Stewart, an experienced professional who has worked in tennis and was most recently part of British Rowing’s Olympic medal‑winning setup.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu beat former champion Marketa Vondrousova at Wimbledon this year and reached the third round, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIn recent weeks, however, the goal has been to not think about tennis. After prematurely ending her season in Asia due to illness, Raducanu devoted significant time to improving her Chinese language skills during her time visiting family in her mother’s country of birth, her Spanish at the urging of Roig, and her French. “I was just like: ‘I’m trying to do everything,’” she says, smiling. “I really need rest days from my rest days. It’s actually quite consuming.”As the 2021 US Open champion describes her language learning odyssey, a member of her team interjects to note that he now receives texts from her in French, even though he does not speak the language.“It’s funny, because then I’ll just start mixing languages,” Raducanu says. “I’m saying a sentence with three different languages, and I just don’t even know what I’m saying. But I think it’s been great for me to put my mind to something else and to be occupied and feed my brain. It’s the best thing I can do for myself. And I feel like I’m just in a pretty content place, just trying to become a better version off the court.”View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu is about to embark on pre-season training with Francisco Roig.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesAlongside some positive results, there have been ample difficult moments in 2025. Most notably, Raducanu’sencounters with a fixated individualin February drew global headlines. Those incidents naturally hurt her confidence, with the Briton previously stating that her neck would hurt from looking down in public to avoid people recognising her. “Now I don’t. My neck doesn’t hurt as much. I’m not looking down as much. Better posture,” she says, laughing. “But I’m like: ‘OK, what? Are they going to see me on the tube?’ It’s not a bad thing.”The comfort with which Raducanu navigated the city during the off-season has also shown her that she has put the incident behind her. “Honestly, I have gotten over it,” she says. “What did creep me out was I saw a photo of myself in London, and I didn’t see the paps [paparazzi]. I was with my two best friends. This happened last week, and it was some tabloid article saying I had a new boyfriend or whatever. But it’s literally my best friend’s brother. I was like: ‘Come on, guys. Come on. Be better. This is not [true].’ I was with my best friend’s brother, and we were going to the rugby. And of course, they cropped my best friend out. It was just me and this guy, and I just didn’t see the paps. So that’s obviously creepy. You know, when you’re like: ‘I didn’t see them. How did they take this photo?’ But other than that, I feel good because someone’s always watching my back.”Off the court, 2025 has been a contentious and controversial year in tennis. The most recent discourse has focused on the length of the season, with various players being critical of the demanding season. Raducanu, however, offers a different perspective to the likes of Iga Swiatek,Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and her fellow British No 1, Jack Draper.“I think that’s a challenge,” she says. “I don’t necessarily think it’s something to complain about because it’s what we are given. And we are making a great living as well. I mean it’s not all glamorous. There are definitely times when it’s very difficult and we are flagging mentally, physically, everything hurts. But at the same time what are we going to do about it? I am sure there are certain people who go to work and their bosses make them do something, but they have to do it, it’s their job. If we put up a front that isn’t complaining, I think that is a better example to the people watching, trying to get into tennis, the younger people. If they see all the top players moaning about the calendar, I don’t think that’s necessarily inspiring to look up to.”View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu and Jack Draper will be playing doubles together in the United Cup in January.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe next time Raducanu competes, she will be playing alongside her old friend Draper in the United Cup, the mixed-gender international team event that kicks off the season in Australia. Before then, an intense pre‑season block begins this week with Roig in Barcelona with the goal to build on the solid foundations established in 2025, to improve the quality of her shotmaking and begin to close the considerable gap between herself and the very best players in the world.“I think I went through some very difficult times on and off the court at the start of the year,” she says. “But I think it really taught me, like the strength that I have to pull myself out of it. Also what I need to do to avoid falling back in again. A lot of it is spending time studying, spending time learning, spending time nurturing my brain and just constantly that’s something I need. Learning about myself has been a great thing. So I feel very content.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

CEO may have a point … so we thrashed out our differencesTue 2 Dec 2025 01.58 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShareIt really is quite the scene. Midnight in Tokyo, Usain Bolt is DJing and the launch party for the World Athletics Ultimate Championships is in full swing. And then the World Athletics chief executive, Jon Ridgeon, walks up to me and says: “I read yourrecent Guardian column, and I thought it was very unfair.”Imagine Gary Lineker going in two-footed, having never picked up a yellow card in his career. This is the track and field equivalent. Ridgeon, a former world silver medallist over the 110m hurdles, is one of the smartest and most reasonable people in sport. He is saying, in a polite way, that he is really rather annoyed.It’s not that Ridgeon wildly disagrees with my premise that athletics needs to do more to attract gen Z and stay relevant. But he maintains my column is overly negative, skewed towards one side, and doesn’t reflect how much WorldAthleticshas transformed the sport.Duplantis wins top award and takes aim at Grand Slam Track’s exclusion of field eventsRead moreI enjoy a good debate. So we begin to tease out the arguments and find common ground. At one point Ridgeon graciously admits that some of his friends agree with me more than him. I respond by saying I should have acknowledged World Athletics’ achievements, including the Athletics Integrity Unit to tackle doping.But there is still plenty of meat on the bone when Usain pushes the bass to tinnitus-inducing levels and we have to push our discussion down the road. Last weekend, though, we finally got the chance to thrash things out. Think of it as Ridgeon v Ingle II: this time we can actually hear each other.If I was writing for a 1980s tabloid, a snapper would probably have photographed him planting a boxing glove on my jaw. Instead, after some initial sparring, we get on to why the future is brighter than I suggested a couple of months ago.First, though, Ridgeon wants to get something off his chest. “In your column you quoted a US-based coach and he implied that the sport was slightly asleep and in decline. But on any metric – global television audience, media audience, social media audience, income – it is growing.” Warming to his theme, he says: “Our income’s grown by 25% in the last three or four years. Global cities ring me up to say we want your world championships. And the biggest sporting event in the world in 2025 was our event in Tokyo. I don’t say this complacently, but it says growth, right?”He’s not finished. “And we’re not just sitting passively back going: ‘Gen Z is tough – let’s rely on our middle-aged audience!’”But there is a glint in his eye when Ridgeon talks and explains that World Athletics had 700 million video views on its social media channels atthe world championships in September– double that of Budapest two years ago.It is impressive stuff. But my central argument is that, while athletics is certainly incredible at the Olympics and world championships, it needs to do more to attract casual fans the rest of the time.Mondo Duplantis, for instance, can vault over a double‑decker bus with nearly 2 metres to spare. Sabastian Sawe, the London marathon winner, can run 26.2 miles at an average pace of about 4min 40sec a mile. Unless you are up close, it is impossible to envisage how impressive such feats are.View image in fullscreenThe American sprinter Noah Lyles is one of his sport’s most eye-catching personalities.Photograph: Marcel ter Bals/MTB-Photo/ShutterstockRidgeon agrees and he promises World Athletics will do more to capture the extraordinary. “Television often sanitises those incredible superhuman performances and we need to do more to bring that to life,” he says. “Drone footage, particularly, can unlock new ways of filming things.”Ridgeon, though, insists that World Athletics’ data and research unit, which examines behaviour inside stadiums and when people watch the sport on television, has already led to subtle improvements.They have even wired spectators up to sensors to track their emotional responses when they watch sport. “So do people get sweaty palms when the 100m or when the shot put starts?” Ridgeon asks. “You can probably guess the answer, but it shows we are doing all sorts of stuff. But sometimes it’s a challenging sport to reform. We are a 150-year-old sport.”But the changes are continuing. There will soon be a World Treadmill Championships, designed to make the elite level appeal to more gym-goers. While at next year’s Ultimate Championships, athletes will be allowed to bring their own social media teams to create for their platforms.Jake Paul’s Joshua fight is all about fame and bluster, money and eyeballs | Jonathan LiewRead moreThe idea is to allow athletes to further amplify their personalities to a younger audience – and hopefully also create the rivalries that every sport needs.Ridgeon, however, also acknowledges that more athletes need to realise their competition isn’t just who they line up against. It is also every sport, TV show and activity that competes for eyeballs. Jake Paul v Anthony Joshua is nonsense on multiple levels. But it will sell.Ridgeon remains optimistic, however, despite Grand Slam Track crashing in its first season in the US. And he also cites Nielsen data that suggests one in seven people across the globe like athletics, to suggest its potential is limitless. “But one thing we haven’t been able to do is take that billion people that run round the block to keep fit and to move them across to becoming athletics fans.”So could athletics one day make the quantum leap like Formula One? “We have two groups of sports out there in the world,” he replies. “Football, F1 and those Goliaths that are sucking up more and more of the dollars and the eyeballs. Then you have a lot of traditional, often Olympic sports, that are finding it tough. Athletics is in the middle.”Ridgeon pauses, then decides on a more optimistic tone. “Our foundations are incredible and so we should be able to break into the bottom of that group of Goliaths. We’ve just got to keep the pressure and energy up, and continue that trajectory.” And on that, at least, we firmly agree.Explore more on these topicsAthleticscommentShareReuse this content"

Those matches will be followed by two friendlies in the window immediately preceding the World Cup, with the second one coming against Germany in Chicago on 6 June. The first game of the pre-World Cup series is against an opponent to be determined in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 31 May. Multiple reports have indicated that the opponent will be announced after the World Cup draw. (Fifa rules forbid group opponents from playing each other in a friendly ahead of the tournament.)Pochettino’s first full USMNT year started shakily. It ends with real World Cup hopeRead moreThe United States’ games against Belgium and Portugal will be the squad’s last chance to make an impression on head coachMauricio Pochettinoand staff before the final roster for the World Cup is named ahead of the subsequent camp. The location is also significant, with US Soccer having recently moved its headquarters to Atlanta and with a new national training center already under construction in the city’s suburbs.In Belgium and Portugal, the US will face two opponents in the top 10 of the Fifa world rankings, and also two that they faced in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The US faced Portugal in the group stage in Manaus, with Sebastian Varela scoring a last-gasp equalizer after Clint Dempsey put the US up 2-1. The Americans’ run in the World Cup was ended by Belgium in the round of 16, as Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku scored in extra-time amid a legendary 16-save performance by US goalkeeper Tim Howard.Today, Belgium and Portugal are still among the European elite. Belgium won their World Cup qualifying group and are still led by De Bruyne along with goalkeeper Thibault Courtois. Portugal’s visit, meanwhile, will be notable mostly for the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo, who has not played in the United States since being accused of sexual assault in Las Vegas in 2017 (which Ronaldo has consistently denied). The allegations kicked off a years-long legal battle, culminating in a suit that was thrown out by a judge in 2022, with an appeal denied in 2023.June’s matchup at Chicago’s Soldier Field will take the US back to the city where the federation was housed before Atlanta. Germany, their opponents, will be making their 21st World Cup appearance in the summer of 2026 and were also a 2014 World Cup group opponent for the US. The Germans defeated the US 1-0 in rainy conditions in Recife.All of the above countries reside in Pot 1 for the World Cup draw this Friday, meaning they will not have the United States as group opponents. The US’s potential opposition in Charlotte, though, could be a potential opponent, necessitating the draw to happen first before finalizing the agreement.“For us, this is a massive opportunity to challenge ourselves against some of the top teams in the world. These are incredible matches for the players and for the fans,” USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said. “We are so happy to be playing in our new home of Atlanta, and of course to be competing in the great cities of Charlotte and Chicago ahead of the World Cup.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coach Mike Vrabel also became the third coach since 1970 to have a win streak of 10 or more games in his first season with a team.Maye completed 24 of 31 passes for 282 yards with no interceptions.The Giants (2-11) lost their seventh straight game, and third in a row since firing Brian Daboll. Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart returned after missing two games because of a concussion, but there wasn’t much he could do. Dart threw a touchdown pass to Darius Slayton and finished 17 of 24 for 139 yards. Devin Singletary added a touchdown run.Dart played with his usual style in his return. On a second down on the team’s second offensive series, Dart scrambled toward the New York bench and tried to tip-toe up the sideline for extra yards. It left him open fora clean hit to the midsectionby Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss, who sent Dart hard to the turf. The tackle caused a brief shoving match between several players. No flags were thrown for Elliss’ tackle, but after a discussion by officials, Giants tight end Theo Johnson was called for unnecessary roughness for his role in the post-play scrum.In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contendersRead moreDart was not evaluated following the hit and remained in the game for the next play. Despite his recent concussion, Dart said after the game that he is comfortable with the way he plays the game.“This is football,” Dart said. “I’m going to get hit if I’m in the pocket or outside the pocket. I feel like I played this way my whole entire life. It shouldn’t be any shocker to anybody if you followed along with my career. We’re not playing soccer out here. You’re going to get hit. Things happen. It’s just part of the game.”The Giants defense started the game well, holding the Patriots to a field goal on the game’s opening possession in their first game under the direction of interim coordinator Charlie Bullen. Bullen was elevated to the role after Shane Bowen was fired 12 games into his second season.It didn’t last.Trailing 10-0 after Jones’ punt return TD and a quick three-and-out that included the Elliss hit on Dart, Maye used a 36-yard pass to Hunter Henry to set up his touchdown pass to Boutte. New England led 30-7 at halftime, marking the first time since Week 17 of 2009 season that the Giants had allowed 30 points in the first half.Giants coach Mike Kafka chose to bench Giants rookie linebacker Abdul Carter for the first quarter. It marks the second time the No 3 overall pick in the draft was benched for disciplinary reasons. He was previously held out of the first series of New York’s November loss to Green Bay.A second-quarter incident summed up the Giants’ miserable season. Lined up for a 47-yard field-goal attempt, Giants kicker Younghoe Koo got his cleat caught in the turfand never got off a kick. Holder Jamie Gillan tried to get up and run but was tackled for what was scored as a 13-yard sack by Jeremiah Pharms. It wasn’t New York’s only special teams mishap. Gunner Olszewski also fumbled on a kickoff return late in the first half after being sandwiched on a tackle by Marte Mapu and Elliss.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew England PatriotsNew York GiantsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some, including Peter Wright, the chief constable of South Yorkshire police at the time of the disaster, have died.Steve Kelly, whose brother Mike, 38, died at Hillsborough, said: “No one should be beaten by the passage of time. We should have truth, justice and accountability, at least within a person’s lifetime.”Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was one of the 97 people killed at Hillsborough, said in response: “How lucky are they [the police officers] to have died in their own home, not traumatised like we all were. The youngest who died at Hillsborough was 10, how lucky are they to grow old. I’m so angry with their response.”Ten of the men whom the IOPC said would have faced gross misconduct cases were in the South Yorkshire force, including senior officers responsible for safety at Hillsborough. The IOPC listed six gross misconduct allegations against Wright, including for seeking to minimise the force’s responsibility and deflect blame on to the victims,Liverpoolfootball club supporters.Two other men were senior officers in West Midlands police, which was appointed to investigate the South Yorkshire force after the disaster. Mervyn Jones and Michael Foster would have faced allegations that they “failed to investigate effectively” and were “biased against supporters in favour of South Yorkshire police”.Hillsborough disaster timeline: decades seeking justice and changeRead moreIn a statement, the South YorkshirePoliceFederation criticised the IOPC report as “not fair or balanced” and said: “Former police officers – some of whom are very elderly and some who have sadly passed away – do not have any kind of due process or the ability to formally respond to the allegations made in this report.”The 366-page report, delivered to bereaved families in recent days, marks the culmination of 14 years’ work by the IOPC,which describes itas “the largest independent investigation into alleged police misconduct and criminality ever carried out in England and Wales”.The investigation, based in Warrington, began in 2012 after theHillsborough Independent Panelhad madelandmark findings on police culpability, which led to the quashing of the verdict of accidental death from the first inquest in 1991.The IOPC said in the report that it had found 110 complaints upheld or cases to answer against former officers, including for “falsehood and prevarication”, “discreditable conduct”, “abuse of authority” and “neglect of duty”.Some people whose relatives died at Hillsborough told the Guardian they welcomed the findings, but were outraged that the IOPC did not find more cases to answer against South Yorkshire police officers for falsely blaming Liverpool supporters.The IOPC has explained its view that in the absence of a duty of candour to positively assist an investigation, in 1989 the South Yorkshire force and its officers were not breaking the law or conduct rules by “presenting their best case” about the causes of the disaster, even though it involved withholding crucial information and amending hundreds of officers’ statements.There has also been disappointment among survivors that the IOPC has not criticised the West Midlands police investigation more extensively. The watchdog did uphold some complaints, but said it had not found West Midlands officers were generally intimidating towards the survivors they interviewed, asked them excessively about supporters drinking, or were biased towards South Yorkshire police.Ninety-seven men, women and childrenwere killed as a result of the crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989.View image in fullscreenDavid Duckenfield.Photograph: Richard Martin-Roberts/Getty ImagesThe jury at the second inquests into the disaster found in April 2016 a series of failings by South Yorkshire police, and that the victimswere unlawfully killedowing to gross negligence manslaughter by the officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield. The jury also determined that no behaviour by Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster.Duckenfield was thenacquitted in a criminal prosecutionin 2019. No police officer has been convicted of any criminal offences in relation to the Hillsborough failings, and none faced disciplinary proceedings at the time they were serving.After Operation Resolve, an investigation overseen by the IOPC into how the disaster happened, the watchdog has found Duckenfield would have faced 10 gross misconduct cases, including for his notorious lie that Liverpool supporters had forced open an exit gate to gain entry to the stadium. In fact Duckenfield had ordered the wide gate to be opened, to relieve serious congestion outside the ground.Supt Roger Marshall and Supt Bernard Murray, who had senior crowd safety roles, would also have faced gross misconduct cases, the IOPC said, as would the then South Yorkshire police assistant chief constable Walter Jackson. He was off duty but on call, and was at the match; the allegation against him was that: “ACC Jackson failed to organise and direct junior-ranking police officers to help save lives … ACC Jackson failed to take control of the disaster.”View image in fullscreenNorman Bettison.Photograph: Andrew Yates/ReutersSir Norman Bettison, who was a chief inspector at South Yorkshire police and later became chief constable of Merseyside police, would have faced allegations that he “provided misleading and inaccurate press statements” which minimised his role at South Yorkshire police after the disaster, and was “deliberately dishonest about his involvement in the disaster” when he applied for the Merseyside position. The Liverpool MP Ian Byrne has written to the Cabinet Office calling for Bettison to be stripped of his knighthood.A mounted police officer, PC David Scott, would have faced the allegation that he lied when he said that his horse had been burned by Liverpool supporters.Bereaved families have campaigned since 2017for a “Hillsborough law”, which was finallyintroduced into parliamentby Keir Starmer’s government in September, aimed at deterring official cover-ups by introducing a duty of“candour, transparency and frankness”for police officers and public officials.Aspinall said: “I cannot accept or understand how 97 people can be unlawfully killed, the police can lie, and nobody is held accountable. I recognise that the IOPC and Operation Resolve have worked hard and some of these findings are strong. But it’s absolutely ridiculous that so few people have been accused of gross misconduct for the lies and cover-up we’ve had to fight for 36 years.”Nicola Brook, a solicitor at Broudie Jackson Canter acting for several bereaved families, said: “Yes, the law has now changed so this loophole cannot be used in future. But for those affected by this case, that is no consolation. They are left with yet another bitter injustice: the truth finally acknowledged, but accountability denied.”The IOPC deputy director general Kathie Cashell said she sympathised with families who still felt they had not received proper explanations or justice, describing it as “deeply unsatisfactory” to be “still looking for those answers” 36 years on.“There was absolutely a defensive approach by South Yorkshire police, there were allegations made about fan behaviour that have been repeatedly disproven. But there is a difference between that as a fact, and then finding individuals culpable for gross misconduct or misconduct,” she said.“In order to meet the evidential threshold, it is a high bar to prove not just that [a statement] was a falsehood but that it was knowingly put forward as a falsehood.”The IOPC made clear that it supports the Hillsborough law, saying in the report: “If such a duty had existed in 1989, it may have helped bring the full facts of what occurred to light far sooner.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterPoliceLiverpoolEnglandIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

They had arranged for him to visit the original fixture on Sunday but there was immense disappointment when it was curtailed within five minutes of kick-off owing to a huge pyrotechnic display by a section of the support.European football: ‘utterly outrageous’ fireworks cause Ajax abandonmentRead moreFireworks were thrown again when an attempt to resume was made 40 minutes later and the remainder was scheduled for Tuesday. Although the game officially took place behind closed doors, Ajax had allowed Peter to fulfil his wish and watch from the stands.It emerged on Tuesday that Peter was too ill to attend the game’s second iteration. “When the volunteers arrived at the hospice this afternoon to fulfil Peter’s last wish, it unfortunately turned out that Peter’s condition had deteriorated to such an extent that his last wish will never be fulfilled,” read a statement onRTL Newsfrom WensenAmbulance Noord-Holland, a charity that helps people who are dying or have serious chronic illness to fulfil their final wishes.“Peter has played football all his life, has also been a referee, and follows Ajax closely,” said André, a staff member from Wensenambulance Noord-Holland, before Tuesday’s turn of events. “Football is his whole life, so [the hospice] wanted to let him go to one last match.”André, who accompanied Peter along with Peter’s adult son, recounted the story of a Sunday afternoon that turned sour due to the fans’ behaviour. “When we arrived at the stadium, we were given excellent guidance by the stewards,” he said. “We got a great spot behind the goal. Peter was very disappointed [by the abandonment]. This is, of course, incredibly frustrating.”A raft of posts on social media had highlighted Peter’s plight and urged for him to be granted access to the rescheduled game. Wensenambulance Noord-Holland had confirmed that Peter would be permitted to attend, but he was unable to make Ajax’s 2-0 win in a game that restarted in the sixth minute.Sunday’s abandonment prompted Ajax to “emphatically distance ourselves from this misconduct” and describe the fans’ behaviour as “utterly outrageous”. The supporters in question are believed to have been commemorating a deceased fan.

Our ability to react to setbacks was great. At first we suffered but, after that, we were brave on the ball and calm going forward.”As Brentford’s manager, Frank prided himself on achieving a decent work life balance. Back then he managed eight hours sleep a night, five exercise sessions a week, regular downtime with his beloved Wilbur Smith novels and relaxing family holidays.Judging by the technical area evidence a few months at Spurs have left him looking in urgent need of a destressing spa break.Frank’s increasingly animated touchline gesticulations and manic first-half gum chewing came freighted with evident tension, particularly when Romero was booked for fouling Joelinton.At least the latterly much criticised Guglielmo Vicario played well following recent mistakes. Frank, creditably, insisted he would not drop Vicarioin the face of hefty criticismfrom fans and, perhaps taking the hint, the travelling supporters perched high in the Leazes End dutifully sang the goalkeeper’s name on repeat after Vicario saved a Lewis Miley shot.Newcastle were, as is invariably the case here, pressing high and hard. At times Spurs looked in peril of being blown away by so much home aggression and, presumably in damage‑limitation mode, attempted to counter Newcastle with a fairly direct approach rather than risk too much fancy footwork playing out from the back.View image in fullscreenCristian Romero races away in delight after his unlikely double.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PABoth teams ceded possession too cheaply, though, and Frank winced when Mohammed Kudus attempted a spot of ball juggling in his own half.No matter, Tottenham’s hopes of improving on a woeful record of one point from their previous fourPremier Leaguematches and averting a fourth successive defeat in all competitions were enhanced when Lucas Bergvall met Kudus’s low cross and attempted an audacious back‑heel flick that arced just over the bar.Although Joelinton was unfortunate to see a shot rebound off a post, Spurs had improved and Howe could not have failed to notice that his suddenly flat side had looked rather burned out – mentally more than physically – as the interval approached.The trouble with Howe’s, albeit hugely exhilarating, heavy metal style is that it is near impossible to sustain for too long and the irrepressible version of Newcastle seencantering to victory at Evertonlast Saturday had gone missing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His goal began with Gordon accelerating down the left and removing Pedro Porro and Romero from the defensive equation before crossing low for Woltemade. The Germany striker’s typically deft lay‑off fell to Guimarães to run on to and the Newcastle captain’s swerving shot from the edge of the area proved far too good for even Vicario.View image in fullscreenBruno Guimarães fires home for Newcastle after coming off the bench.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersRomero soon atoned for his part in that goal. When Newcastle failed to properly clear a corner Kudus outwitted Lewis Hall and crossed for the captain to head Spurs level.Chaos ensued. First, a penalty area wrestling match involving Dan Burn and Rodrigo Bentancur concluded with a video assistant referee review deciding Burn had been fouled. “It was never a penalty,” Frank said. “It was a mistake by VAR.”As Gordon made no mistake from the penalty spot, Spurs looked beaten – but Romero had very different ideas.When Ramsdale punched a corner, the captain’s spectacular overhead kick flew into the back of the net. “It was a beautiful goal,” Romero said. “But every day with the national team, I watch Leo Messi.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If anyone can beat anyone, they can also play out landlocked contests such as this.It took a deflection to win it, Jack Grealish’s shot smashing off Bafodé Diakité’s shins and into the opposite corner.

In turn, he has fallen for his manager. “I love the manager to pieces,” he said of David Moyes. “I’ve only known him a few months, and I can’t speak highly enough of him as a person.”“I don’t know if I like that,” a ­smiling Moyes said in reply to the sweet nothings. “Players didn’t used to like me.” He chose instead to highlight his loan star’s work ethic. “He’s not one to come off after 60 minutes, he’s not showboating.”ForBournemouth, winless in November, losing from a two-goal winning position at Sunderland, was followed by another low ebb. The early-season flavour of the month is losing its taste. Inconsistencies that denied the team European qualifica­tion last season have returned.Winning at Bournemouth’s stadium, where they had never won a Premier League game, having been the better team in the second half sets up Everton, three wins from four, the Newcastle nightmare of Saturday made up for, far better for the festive grind. “We are in a difficult situation in the difficult moment of the season,” Andoni Iraola said.“You have to trust yourself. You have to, when everything costs a lot, keep ­believing. I hope we can recover.”Everton’s thin squad was stretched but squeezed through a significant test. Idrissa Gueye was absent through suspension, and Michael Keane from defence. It meant James Garner played emergency right-back, and won his personal duel with Antoine Semenyo, a key battle in a victory achieved via Evertonian graft rather than the School of Science of which their fans sang.View image in fullscreenJack Grealish’s deflected shot settled the match.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/Shutterstock“Brilliant effort, considering what we had available to us,” Moyes said. “Maybe we caught Bournemouth at the right time.” He had enjoyed getting one over on one of the Premier League’s hippest tastemakers, ­Iraola’s team rendered unusually passive, the Basque saying: “Everything was going almost like slow motion.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Carlos Alcaraz in ­particular had Moyes right on his case, the Argentinian asked to chase every lost cause. Semenyo, on the left, Adrien Truffert overlapping beyond him, was asked to push at Garner’s perceived weakness, though to little avail.Everton continued to be scrappy beyond the break. Thierno Barry notched his first shot on target of the league season, though it did not trouble Djordje Petrovic, while ­Grealish was repeatedly guilty of wayward passing. Barry’s wild thrash of a Garner pass was met with affectionate cheers from fans who appreciate the striker’s endeavour if not his precision.“The game opened up in the ­second half, it was about who made the most of it,” Moyes said. After Alcaraz had followed his manager’s instructions to chase everything that moved to claim a loose ball, Grealish took aim.

He has been so important for us, for so many years, and he will be important for us in the coming days – because it is days as he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations.”Slot said Salah was not happy about being dropped but had been sup­portive of his teammates on Sunday and in training on Monday. “The reaction of every player in this group, no matter whether he’s playing or not playing, is to bring the best out of yourself every single day you are in this building and when we are playing,” he said. “That’s exactly the attitude he showed on Sunday and yesterday as well.”Dominik Szoboszlai took Salah’s place at West Ham but Slot, who has been linked with a January move for Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, ­confirmed the Hungary captain was not a permanent replacement for Salah.“I don’t see Dominik as a right-winger for the long-term future in this club. Dominik is a midfielder who could help us out as a full-back or as a winger if needed. I don’t expect to be in February or March and every single game Dominik is playing there. But I don’t know yet at this moment.“He’s more of a midfielder than a winger, but the good thing about him is he can help me and us out in ­several positions if I need him in that position. In the long-term future we should have wingers ­playing as ­wingers, midfielders playing as midfielders and defenders playing as defenders.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are still doing some treatment on the grass,” the England manager, Sarina Wiegman, joked. “It was very special for her, having everyone around her.”It was a full-circle moment, the Winchester-born Southampton academy graduate returned to the ground of the club that nurtured her to score England’s opener in the 2-0 win less than five months after she left the south-coast side to take the next step in her exciting career.If there is a highlight to pick out from England’s “Homecoming Series”, their four friendlies to see out 2025 after thatphenomenal European title defencein the summer, it is the emergence of Kendall from the relatively anonymity of the under‑23s team into the senior spotlight.Her rise has been so rapid that England’s ever‑present Lucy Bronze admitted she had not known who Kendall was when asked about the joy and energy she gets from the young players who make the step up to the senior side. “It’s been really fun,” the right‑back said, afterEngland’s 8-0 defeat of Chinaon Saturday.“Lucia is a great example. To be honest with you, I didn’t know who she was at the start of the season and she’s got a huge future ahead of her. I think she’s one of England’s stars in the future.”Wiegman was effusive in her praise of the dynamic 21-year-old. “Things have happened so quickly but she just keeps up her levels and shows she is a good player and that is impressive,” she said.Kendall’s emergence is a testament to an under-23 side that Wiegman was keen to see relaunched in 2021 in order to better prepare players for the jump to the senior team. She was one of seven changes the manager made to the lineup that started against China.View image in fullscreenLucia Kendall opens the scoring for England.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockGhana presented a different challenge to the Lionesses than the one posed by China. The scoreline may not have been as flattering, but England were rampant in their first meeting with the African side, dominating possession, accruing 24 shots to Ghana’s three and 10 on target to Ghana’s one. The only thing missing was the end product, Wiegman’s charges denied by the woodwork four times.That failure to be clinical could be partly attributed to bad luck, but also to the presence of a starting XI that had not played much football together. However, you only build those connections through minutes on the pitch to complement the work on the training ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following a VAR check, a penalty was awarded and Russo – the newly crowned Football Supporters’ Association women’s player of the year – converted. The home crowd of 20,252 celebrated wildly, their patient wait for a second goal after the promise offered by the early opener having been rewarded. The only lowlight was an injury which forced the withdrawal of Kelly.England end 2025 with two wins, rotation, and lots to think about. The emerging talent from the under-23s adds excitement and competitiveness 18 months out from the 2027 World Cup.Meanwhile the solo bidto host the 2035 World Cup– with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – has been submitted to Fifa, giving the next generation of girls up and down the country hope of emulating Kendall, Aggie Beever‑Jones, Maya Le Tissier and more.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal, who host Brentford on Wednesday, have yet to register a goal from a throw-in but lead the way for set-piece goals,joint with Manchester United, on 10.Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal are showing the resilience of championsRead moreRice has played a huge role in that with his pinpoint deliveries from corners and free-kicks and is the designated thrower in attacking positions. But Arteta acknowledged the midfielder has some way to go to match Kayode with ball in hands.“A massive weapon,” Arsenal’s manager said of Kayode’s throw-in. “We all know that. It is a very chaotic situation – it is very difficult to predict what is going to happen.”When it was suggested Rice is not as good as Kayode, Arteta said: “Who is? Everything has to evolve. I don’t know how good [Kayode] was a year ago, or two years ago or three years ago. I know how good Declan was at taking set pieces three or four years ago and I know how good he is now. So, it does not happen overnight. Things have to be trained, evolved and tweaked. And the player has to believe as well, which is key. When you look at Declan, he can do almost everything you require him to do.”View image in fullscreenKai Havertz is still a few weeks away from first-team action after knee surgery in August.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersArteta, meanwhile, is confident that Arsenal’s squad can continue to cope with injury setbacks after confirming Kai Havertz will not return for a few weeks.The Germany striker has been absent since August after knee surgery and had been expected back at the start of this month. But Arteta said Havertz had been unable “to go to the next level” when he stepped up his rehabilitation and faced a longer spell on the sidelines.That means the Arsenal manager must decide for the game against Brentford whether to stick with Mikel Merino as a makeshift striker after his goalagainst Chelseaon Sunday or recall Viktor Gyökeres after the Swede returned from a muscle injury as a substitute at Stamford Bridge. Gabriel Jesus is also in contention after 11 months out.There are also doubts over whether William Saliba and Leandro Trossard will be fit after they missed the Chelsea game. The summer signings Cristhian Mosquera and Piero Hincapié are likely to start in central defence again for the league leaders. Arteta believes the £250m spent on reinforcements in the most recent window has left Arsenal in a much stronger position to deal with the absences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We learned, and we were able to put together a squad that is much more reliable and has more options.“We learned from the past as well that we have to use players in different positions, and they have to be able to fulfil different roles if we want to compete at this level. And the example of Mikel is just the best one, probably.”The Germany manager, Julian Nagelsmann, said last month that Havertz had experienced a setback. Arteta said: “He was doing everything. He could not go to the next level and now it’s looking like we have unlocked that. We’re all desperate to have him. I mean, it’s a player that, personally, I love so much for what he brings to the team, but his character, his personality, I see him suffer being outside.“His playing record is phenomenal, he’s been always available and I can’t wait to have him back around the team playing because I think it’s going to be a massive boost.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetanewsShareReuse this content"

It says a lot about what we’ve done for women’s football in Spain.“We’ll continue to inspire girls and boys to fight for their dreams, which sometimes come true.” The comprehensive victory on Tuesday delivered a trophy for the Spain head coach, Sonia Bermúdez, inside her first four months in charge, as Spain claimed a third major piece of silverware in two and a half years.With the victory Spain also returned to the winners’ podium at the first opportunity after the heartbreak of their defeat against England on penalties in the final of Euro 2025.View image in fullscreenJenni Hermoso enjoys a moment with the trophy after making her comeback to the Spain side.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersThis game was won when Clàudia Pina scored twice, either side of Vicky López’s delightful finish, to deliver a 3-0 second-leg victory, after Germany had created – but failed to convert – several good chances in the goalless first leg in Kaiserslautern last Friday.Spain went close in the first half through a Putellas header, which looked bound for the bottom corner before a fine Ann‑Katrin Berger save, and Spain should have gone in front when Mariona Caldentey scuffed a volley wide when she was found in ample space in the box.Eventually the pressure told when Pina cut inside on to her right foot, after a lay-off from Caldentey, and Berger could not keep out the forward’s low strike.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

López was then afforded space to roam into the Germany penalty area and arch in an eye-catching second, before Pina capitalised on some loose passing to make it 3-0 by firing into the top corner.With Spain coasting, there was a rapturous welcome for the substitute Jenni Hermoso, recalled to the squad by Bermúdez this autumn, and Hermoso later said: “It has been many months of work, of thinking about putting [a Spain shirt] on again and, in the end, everything has its reward. We continue to show we are the best team in the world.”Germany provided some moments of quality on the counterattack but were sloppy in their passing at times and lacked a lethal finisher of the calibre of Pina.Their head coach, Christian Wück, felt the game had been “very evenly matched” while their captain, Giulia Gwinn, said: “It’s frustrating when you put so much effort into the game and don’t get the reward. In the end, losing 3-0 is hard, but I think we put up a very good fight. It’s a bit too harsh, but we could have scored goals, especially in the first game and again today.”Spain, who were 2-0 winners against France in the final when they lifted the first Women’s Nations League title in February 2024, are the world’s No 1-ranked side ahead of USA in second, Sweden in third and the back-to-back European Championship winners England in fourth. This win signals Spain’s intent as they now cast their eye on the 2027 World Cup in Brazil.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueGermany women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That’s why my support for the project is strictly conditional on economic, governance, design and community safeguards that seek to protect the welfare of Tasmanians.”Thomas claimed to have secured a fixed cap on the state’s contribution to the project, additional independent oversight, more funding for grassroots sport and targets for local jobs as part of the project.Thomas’s support tips the balance of the 15-member upper house towards the project, which is a condition of the AFL’s agreement with the Tasmanian government to give the state a licence to play in the national competition.View image in fullscreenA concept design of the proposed stadium at Macquarie Point in Hobart.Illustration: PR IMAGECasey Hiscutt, another independent who has previously expressed support for the stadium, told ABC radio soon after Thomas’s statement that he would not reveal his vote until the debate in parliament, but he had secured confirmation from the government that any spending above what is currently budgeted will require approval from both houses of parliament.“Obviously going into the election with a position meant that I’d need to have a high burden of proof to dissuade me from that position, there’s nothing that I’ve seen that affects that,” he said.The stadium needs the votes of eight MLCs in Tasmania’s upper house, after already winning support of the lower house last month.The independent-dominated 15-member upper house chamber has three representatives from each of the Labor and Liberal parties which support the stadium, but the president – Labor’s Craig Farrell – will not ordinarily vote.With Thomas’s statement on Wednesday morning, six MPs have now made statements of support, while Hiscutt and another independent Tania Rattray have also previously been in favour of the stadium.A final vote on the stadium is expected on Wednesday or Thursday.Explore more on these topicsAFLTasmania DevilsAustralian rules footballAustralia sportTasmanianewsShareReuse this content"

But then came an extraordinary fightback fromFulham.Manchester City hold off heroic Fulham fightback to win nine-goal epicRead moreInside 21 minutes the home side scored three goals, two of which came from the half-time substitute Samuel Chukwueze. The on-loan Nigeria international was excellent and almost inspired a comeback for the ages, but City held on.“Did you enjoy it? I lost my hair,” Guardiola said. “I thought the players were happy to work with me … it’s the Premier League. I know you’re going to ask what happened but I don’t have an answer. Football is emotion – all the goals were bad defending, we go so deep to defend these kinds of crosses, we have to occupy the spaces a bit better but we made incredible things today because I know how difficult the team is.“It was impossible for me to enjoy it. At 5-1 maybe, but at 5-4 I was watching the clock more than the game. It was tough and it would have been tougher if we could not get the result, but I will remember I was there. At 5-1 you [the media] thought it was finished. You had written your articles. Tomorrow: ‘Manchester City are back … finally.’ And after, to the trash. You have to start again.”Erling Haaland opened the scoring for City after 17 minutes, in the process becoming the fastest player to reach 100 goals in Premier League history. Not surprisingly, Guardiola was full of praise for the Norway striker. “For people up front it’s a question of numbers, and his numbers have no discussion,” he said.“When he arrived, if you told me he would score 100 in 111 games I would say are you sure? In this league? And he did it. The milestones are insane.

Although don’t worry if you tune in late: based on previous draws there will be a few speeches about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some interpretive dance about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some videos with kids kicking a ball about to show that Fifa is on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, and then, hopefully, Fifa actually bringing about world peace via the medium of football. And if you miss any of that, don’t worry Fifa will also be awarding a peace prize to the person most likely to bring about world peace in the next few months (more on that zinger later). At some point in all of that, they’ll place teams into groups and at long last give this expanded tournament an actual schedule.And how does the actual draw work?The 48 teams have been divided into four pots containing 12 teams each. Pot 1 consists of the three co-hosts – USA, Mexico and Canada – along with the nine top teamsin the current Fifa rankings. The next three pots were decided by the Fifa rankings, with the lowest-ranked qualified teams in Pot 4. The 12 groups for the World Cup will then be formed by one team from each pot (full pots listed later).Sounds simple!Well, not quite. There are still six qualification places to be decided via playoffs in late March, and teams involved in those matches have been placed in Pot 4. That means a team such as Italy will be ostensibly the weakest opponents in a group, even though they have won the World Cup four times and are ranked No 12 in the world, should they come through the European qualifying playoffs. Teams from the same qualifying conference should, in theory, not be in the same group. But that is impossible for European teams as Uefa will have 16 teams in the draw. There will, though, be a maximum of two European teams in any group. In addition, the top four teams in the Fifa rankings – Spain, Argentina, France and England –cannot face each otheruntil the semi-finals (of course, they have to make it there first),provided they win their groups.Great, so I can start planning my viewing schedule once the draw is done?Not so fast. Fifa is squeezing all it can out of this weekend and the match schedule will be released on Saturday 6 December. That’s so it can figure out which kick-off times and venues will work best for fans traveling to North America and those watching at home (for example, earlier kick-offs will be better for fans watching on TV in Europe).And which teams have actually qualified?So far, 42 teams have booked their place. Here are our qualifiers, grouped into the pots for the draw:Pot 1:Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.Pot 2:Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia.Pot 3:Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d’Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.Pot 4:Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European playoff teams, two intercontinental playoff teams.For a deeper look into how the qualifiers got here,you can peruse our in-depth guide:World Cup 2026: which countries have qualified and how did they do it?Read moreWho is in the playoffs?In the European playoffs, the winners of Wales v Bosnia and Herzegovina will host the winners of Italy v Northern Ireland for a place in the finals; the winners of Ukraine v Sweden will play the winners of Poland v Albania; the winners of Slovakia v Kosovo will be at home to the winners of Turkey v Romania; and the winners of the Czech Republic v Republic of Ireland will host the winners of Denmark v North Macedonia.In the intercontinental playoffs, which will take place in Mexico, New Caledonia face Jamaica for the right to play DR Congo for a place in the finals, and the winners of Bolivia v Suriname will face Iraq for the other slot. The playoffs are all one-off matches.Want to speculate on a Group of Death?Sure, speculation is all we’ve got until the actualWorld Cupkicks off next year. Theoretically, Argentina, Morocco, Italy and Norwaycould be drawn together, which would put the teams ranked No 1, No 11, No 12 and No 29 in the world in the same group. And Norway, the lowest-ranked of those teams, won all eight of their qualifiers, scoring 37 goals along the way.Who is going to do the actual draw?The presenters have yet to be confirmed yet but the draw for Qatar 2022 was headed up by Idris Elba so possibly … someone with absolutely no connection to the host countries? There will almost certainly be lots of famous retired players who will shuffle on to the stage briefly for some awkward banter before drawing a ball out of a plastic globe.Where can I follow it?The best choice is the Guardian’s liveblog, which will beup and running herea couple of hours before the start of the ceremony. You can also watch the ceremony on Fifa’s website andits YouTube channel. In the UK, the draw will be broadcast on the BBC and BBC iPlayer, in the US it will be shown on Fox and Fubo, in Australia it will be on SBS and SBS On Demand and on TSN in Canada.And what’s this all about the peace prize?Ah yes. Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, has said: “In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it’s fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace.” The prize will be awarded during Friday’s draw.What a touching sentiment. I imagine the prize will go to a saintly nun or a cute dog that saved some orphans from a blazing building?Well …rumor has itthat it’s going toInfantino’s friend Donald Trump.Wait. The guy whorecently accused Democrats of‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’?Yep.The one who said immigrants from Haiti – who just qualified for the World Cup in heroic fashion –eat pet dogs?Yep.The guy whose administration has orderedwhat the UN has calledextrajudicial killings in the Caribbean?That’s the guy!Ah.On a more positive note, the expanded World Cup draw – the 48 teams in this edition, up from 32 last time – means there is room for plucky teams with little chance of winning the trophy, such as Haiti, Curaçao, Cape Verde and England.Exciting! And when does the actual tournament start?On 11 June 2026 before the finalkicks off in New Jerseyon 19 July.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupUS sportsAustralia sportexplainersShareReuse this content"

At the end of the day, that’s their decision. And I respect that.”Kiffin said he consulted with former college football champion coaches Nick Saban and Pete Carroll while weighing LSU’s offer. Saban led the Tigers to a national title in 2003 before adding six more at Alabama.A trooper’s shove showed stardom doesn’t protect Black athletes from police | Etan ThomasRead more“I think the world of Coach Saban, and I respect him,” Kiffin said. “And so there’s a reason we’re here.”Speaking of the allure of the LSU program, Kiffin said, “When you take the history, tradition, passion and the great players in the state of Louisiana, no one can argue that when you’re in Tiger Stadium on Saturday night, there is nothing like it. This place is built for championships with championship expectations – we understand that – but as an elite competitor, that’s exactly what you want, and that’s why we’re here.”Kiffin added at least $4m to his annual salary in the move from Ole Miss to LSU, according to his contract term sheet published by NOLA.com on Monday. Kiffin’s contract is for $91m over seven years, an average annual salary of $13m per year that would make him the No 2 earner among college football coaches.Kiffin, who was paid $9m per year at Ole Miss, ended weeks of speculation about his future and confirmed leaving for LSU on Sunday. He officially signed a contract to take the reins at LSU.The 5-year-old departs after the Rebels finished the regular season with an 11-1 record and a likely spot in the 12-team College Football Playoff this season. In his statement, Kiffin confirmed that he would not be coaching Ole Miss in the postseason. However, his LSU contract also agrees to pay him incentives he would have made based on how far the Rebels advance in this year’s College Football Playoff. That means he could make as much as $1m from his new school if Ole Miss wins this year’s national championship.Kiffin has posted a 55-19 record (.743) with Ole Miss since taking the reins in 2020, leading the team to five straight bowl games, including wins in the Outback Bowl, Peach Bowl and Gator Bowl. Before that, Kiffin rehabilitated his career following tumultuous tenures with Tennessee (7-6) and Southern California (28-15) by serving as an assistant under Nick Saban at Alabama from 2014-16. That led to his return to a lead role with Florida Atlantic from 2017-19, where he went 27-13.Kiffin also had an unsuccessful 20-game NFL coaching stint with the the Raiders in 2007-08 before being fired four games into his second season. He went 5-15.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its widely used AI assistant, Claude, has become particularly popular among business customers.View image in fullscreenThe decision to ‘let go’ of the reins on AI is likely to come between 2027 and 2030, Kaplan says.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesKaplan said that while efforts to align the rapidly advancing technology to human interests had to date been successful, freeing it to recursively self-improve “is in some ways the ultimate risk, because it’s kind of like letting AI kind of go”. The decision could come between 2027 and 2030, he said.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“If you imagine you create this process where you have an AI that is smarter than you, or about as smart as you, it’s [then] making an AI that’s much smarter.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“It sounds like a kind of scary process. You don’t know where you end up.”Kaplan has gone from being a theoretical physicist scientist to an AI billionaire in seven years working in the field. In a wide-ranging interview, he also said:AI systems will be capable of doing “most white-collar work” in two to three years.That his six-year-old son will never be better than an AI at academic work such as writing an essay or doing a maths exam.That it was right to worry about humans losing control of the technology if AIs start to improve themselves.The stakes in the race to AGI feel “daunting”.The best-case scenario could enable AI to accelerate biomedical research, improve health and cybersecurity, boost productivity, give people more free time and help humans flourish.Kaplan met the Guardian at Anthropic’s headquarters in San Francisco, where the interior of knitted rugs and upbeat jazz music belies the existential concerns about the technology being developed.View image in fullscreenSan Francisco has become the epicentre of AI startups and investment.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesKaplan is a Stanford-and Harvard-educated professor of physics who researched at Johns Hopkins University and at Cern in Switzerland before joining OpenAI in 2019 and co-founding Anthropic in 2021.He is not alone at Anthropic in voicing concerns. One of his co-founders, Jack Clark, said in October he wasboth an optimist and “deeply afraid”about the trajectory of AI, which he called “a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine”.Kaplan said he was very optimistic about the alignment of AI systems with the interests of humanity up to the level of human intelligence, but was concerned about the consequences if and when they exceed that threshold.He said: “If you imagine you create this process where you have an AI that is smarter than you, or about as smart as you, it’s [then] making an AI that’s much smarter. It’s going to enlist that AI help to make an AI smarter than that. It sounds like a kind of scary process. You don’t know where you end up.”Doubt has been cast on the gains made from deploying AIs in the economy. Outside Anthropic’s headquarters, a billboard for another tech company pointedly asked “All that AI and no ROI?”, a reference to return on investment. A Harvard Business Review study in September saidAI “workslop”– substandard AI enabled-work that humans have to fix – was reducing productivity.Some of the clearest gains have been in using AIs to write computer code. In September, Anthropic revealed its cutting-edge AI, Claude Sonnet 4.5, a model for computer coding that can build AI agents and autonomously use computers.View image in fullscreenAttackers used the Claude Code tool to target various organisations.Photograph: AnthropicIt maintained focus on complex multistep coding tasks for 30 hours unbroken, and Kaplan said that in some cases using AI was doubling the speed with which his firm’s programmers were able to work.But in November Anthropic said it believed a Chinese state-sponsored group hadmanipulated its Claude Code tool– not only to help humans launch a cyber-attack but to execute about 30 attacks itself, some of which were successful. Kaplan said allowing AIs to train the next AIs was “an extremely high-stakes decision to make”.“That’s the thing that we view as maybe the biggest decision or scariest thing to do … once no one’s involved in the process, you don’t really know. You can start a process and say, ‘Oh, it’s going very well. It’s exactly what we expected. It’s very safe.’ But you don’t know – it’s a dynamic process. Where does that lead?”He said if recursive self-improvement, as this process is sometimes known, was allowed in an uncontrolled way there were two risks.“One is do you lose control over it? Do you even know what the AIs are doing? The main question there is: are the AIs good for humanity? Are they helpful? Are they going to be harmless? Do they understand people? Are they going to allow people to continue to have agency over their lives and over the world?”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“I think preventing power grabs, preventing misuse of the technology, is also very important.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian“It seems very dangerous for it to fall into the wrong hands”The second risk is to security resulting from the self-taught AIs exceeding the human capabilities at scientific research and technological development.“It seems very dangerous for it to fall into the wrong hands,” he said. “You can imagine some person [deciding]: ‘I want this AI to just be my slave. I want it to enact my will.’ I think preventing power grabs – preventing misuse of the technology – is also very important.”Independent research into frontier AI models, including ChatGPT, shows the length of tasks AIs can do has beendoubling every seven months.The future of AIThe rivals racing to create super-intelligence.

But we really don’t think that’s the case. We think it’s going to keep getting better.”He added: “It’s something where it’s moving very quickly and people don’t necessarily have time to absorb it or figure out what to do.”Anthropic is racing with OpenAI, Google DeepMind and xAI to develop ever more advanced AI systems in the push to AGI. Kaplan described the atmosphere in the Bay Area as “definitely very intense, both from the stakes of AI and from the competitiveness viewpoint”.“The way that we think about it is [that] everything is on this exponential trend in terms of investment, revenue, capabilities of AI, how complex the tasks [are that] AI can do,” he said.The speed of progress means the risk of one of the racers slipping up and falling behind is great. “The stakes are high for staying on the frontier, in the sense that you fall off the exponential [curve] and very quickly you could be very far behind at least in terms of resources.”By 2030, datacentres are projected to require $6.7tn worldwide tokeep pace with the demandfor compute power, McKinsey has estimated. Investors want to back the companies closest to the front of the pack.View image in fullscreenSome of the biggest gains have been in using AIs to write computer code.Photograph: Cheng Xin/Getty ImagesAt the same time, Anthropic is known for encouraging regulation of AI. Itsstatement of purposeincludes a section headlined: “We build safer systems.”“We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like, ‘Oh, wow, AI is a big deal’ … We want policymakers to be as informed as possible along the trajectory so they can take it into account.”In October, Anthropic’s position triggered a put-down from Donald Trump’s White House. David Sacks, the US president’s AI adviser, accused Anthropic of “fearmongering” to encourage state-by-state regulation that would benefit its position and damage startups.After Sacks claimed it had positioned itself as “a foe” of the Trump administration, Dario Amodei, Kaplan’s co-founder and Anthropic’s chief executive, hit back by saying the company had publicly praisedTrump’s AI action plan, worked with Republicans and that, like the White House, it wanted to maintain the US’s lead in AI."

The 2024 list of notable losses was the most read last year.The third entry was Ed Gein, the US serial killer who was profiled in the third season of Netflix’s Monster, the streaming platform’s true crime anthology.Wikipedia celebrates its 25th birthday on 15 January and has maintained its credibility as an information source with the help of 250,000 volunteer writers and editors. Encyclopedia entries are guided by three core principles: displaying a neutral point of view; using published, reliable sources; and not publishing personal opinions or new interpretations.The top five was rounded out by two more US public figures: Donald Trump, in his eighth appearance on the annual list; and the Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV.Film and TV-related articles remain a staple of the top 20 list, due in part to the “second screen” effect – people turning to their mobile phone while watching a movie or broadcast show.The Sinners and Superman films were both in the overall top 10, while the Netflix show Adolescence ranked 17th for the year overall, with page views peaking 10 days after its release as the four-parter become a viral success.Views of the entry for Severance, the critically lauded Apple TV series, have nearly tripled between its first season in 2022 and its second this year. Wikimedia also flagged the popularity of the site’s plot summaries for films and TV shows.US politics accounted for a quarter of the top 20, with Zohran Mamdani’s extraordinary run to the New York mayoralty putting him in the top 10, just below Elon Musk. The YouTuber MrBeast also entered the top 20 for the first time.Most-read Wikipedia pages in 2025Charlie Kirk, 44.9m page viewsDeaths in 2025, 42.5mEd Gein, 31.2mDonald Trump, 25.1mPope Leo XIV, 22.1mElon Musk, 20.2mZohran Mamdani, 20.1mSinners (2025 film), 18.2mOzzy Osbourne, 17.8mSuperman (2025 film), 17mPope Francis, 15.3mSeverance (TV series), 13.9mUnited States, 13mThunderbolts*, 12.9mWeapons (2025 film), 11.8mJD Vance, 11.6mAdolescence (TV series), 11.6mMrBeast, 11.5mCristiano Ronaldo, 10.8mThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, 10.8mExplore more on these topicsWikipediaCharlie Kirk shootingInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The fallout is huge – and growing fastSally WealeTue 2 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShare‘It worries me that it’s so normalised. He obviously wasn’t hiding it. He didn’t feel this was something he shouldn’t be doing. It was in the open and people saw it. That’s what was quite shocking.”A headteacher is describing how a teenage boy, sitting on a bus on his way home from school, casually pulled out his phone, selected a picture from social media of a girl at a neighbouring school and used a “nudifying” app to doctor her image.Ten years ago it wassexting and nudescausing havoc in classrooms. Today, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it child’s play to generate deepfake nude images or videos, featuring what appear to be your friends, your classmates, even your teachers. This may involve removing clothes, getting an image to move suggestively or pasting someone’s head on to a pornographic image.The headteacher does not know why this particular girl – a student at her school – was selected, whether the boy knew her, or whether it was completely random. It only came to her attention because he was spotted by another of her pupils who realised what was happening and reported it to the school.The parents were contacted, the boy was traced and the police were called in. But such is the stigma and shame associated with image-based sexual abuse and the sharing of deepfakes that a decision was made that the girl who was the target should not be told.“The girl doesn’t actually even know,” the head said. “I talked to the parents and the parents didn’t want her to know.”View image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian Design; Alistair Berg/Getty ImagesThe boy on the bus is just one example of how deepfakes and easily accessed nudifying technology are playing out among schoolchildren – often to devastating effect. In Spain last year, 15 boys in the south-western region of Extremadura weresentenced to a year’s probationafter being convicted of using AI to produce fake naked images of their female schoolmates, which they shared on WhatsApp groups. About 20 girls were affected, most of them aged 14, while the youngest was 11.In Australia, about 50 high school students at Bacchus Marsh grammar in Victoria reported thattheir images had been faked and distributed– the mother of one student said her daughter was so horrified by the sexually explicit images that she vomited. In the US, more than 30 female students at Westfield high school in New Jersey discovered that deepfake pornographic images of them had been shared among their male classmates on Snapchat.It’s happening in the UK, too. A new poll of 4,300 secondary school teachers in England, carried out by Teacher Tapp on behalf of the Guardian, found that about one in 10 were aware of students at their school creating “deepfake, sexually explicit videos” in the last academic year.Three-quarters of these incidents involved children aged 14 or younger, while one in 10 incidents involved 11-year-olds, and 3% were younger still, illustrating just how easy the technology is to access and use. Among participating teachers, 7% said they were aware of a single incident, and 1% said it had happened twice, while a similar proportion said it had happened three times or more in the last academic year.Earlier this year, a Girlguiding survey found that one in four respondents aged 13 to 18 had seen a sexually explicit deepfake image of a celebrity, a friend, a teacher or themselves.“A year ago I was using examples from the US and Spain to talk about these issues,” says Margaret Mulholland, a special needs and inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders. “Now it’s happening on our doorstep and it’s really worrying.”The police seem completely overwhelmed by the scale of these issues. We need broader solutions, and better strategyLast yearthe Times reportedthat two private schools in the UK were at the centre of a police investigation into the alleged making and sharing of deepfake pornographic images. The newspaper said police were investigating claims that the deepfakes were created at a boys’ school by someone manipulating images taken from the social media accounts of pupils at a girls’ school.The children’s commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, has called for nudification apps such as ClothOff, which was investigated as part of the Guardian’sBlack Box podcastseries about AI, to be banned. “Children have told me they are frightened by the very idea of this technology even being available, let alone used,” she says.It’s not easy to find teachers willing to speak about deepfake incidents. Those who agreed to be interviewed by the Guardian insisted on strict anonymity. Other accounts were provided by academics researching deepfakes in schools, and providers of sex education.Tanya Horeck, a professor of film and feminist media studies at Anglia Ruskin University, has been talking to headteachers as part of a fact-finding mission to uncover the scale of the problem in schools. “All of them had incidents of deepfakes in their schools and they saw this as an emerging problem,” she says. In one case, a 15-year-old girl who was new to a school was targeted by male students who created a pornographic deepfake video of her. She was so distressed she initially refused to go to school. “Almost all the examples they told me about were boys making deepfakes of girls,” says Horeck.“The other thing that I noticed is that there’s this real tension around how they should handle these issues. So some teachers were saying, ‘Yeah, we just get the police in right away and students are expelled’ – that kind of approach,” Horeck says. “Then other teachers were saying, ‘Well, that’s not the way to handle it. We’ve got to have more of a restorative justice approach, where we’re talking to these young people and finding out why they’re doing these things.’“So there seems to be some kind of inconsistency and uncertainty on how to deal with these cases – but I think it’s really hard for teachers because they’re not getting clear guidance.”Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, says there is something particularly shocking about deepfake images. In her bookThe New Age of Sexism: How the AI Revolution Is Reinventing Misogyny, she writes: “Of all the forms of abuse I receive they are the ones that hurt most deeply – the ones that stay with me. It’s hard to describe why, except to say that it feels likeyou.It feels like someone has taken you and done something to you and there is nothing you can do about it. Watching a video of yourself being violated without your consent is an almost out-of-body experience.”View image in fullscreen‘The fallout was significant.’Photograph: Nick David/Getty ImagesAmong school-age children, the impact can be huge. Girls and young women are left feeling violated and humiliated. School friendship groups are shattered and there can be a deep sense of betrayal when one student discovers another has created a deepfake sexualised image of them, and shared it around the school. Girls can’t face lessons, while teachers with little training do their best to support and educate. Meanwhile, boys and young men are being drawn into criminal behaviour, often because they don’t understand the consequences of their actions.“We do see students who are very upset and feel betrayed and horrified by this kind of abuse,” says Dolly Padalia, the CEO of the School of Sexuality Education, a charity providing sex education in schools and universities. “One example is where a school got in touch with us. A student had been found to have taken images of lots of students within the year group and was making deepfakes.“These had then been leaked, and the fallout was quite significant. Students were really upset. They felt very betrayed and violated. It’s a form of abuse. The police were involved. The student was removed from school and we were asked to come in and support. The school responded very, very quickly, but I would say that’s not enough. In order for us to really be preventing sexual violence, we need to be more proactive.”It is estimated that 99% of sexually explicit deepfakes accessible online are of women and girls, but there are cases of boys being targeted. The charity Everyone’s Invited (EI), which collects testimonies from survivors of sexual abuse, has run into at least one such case: “One student shared with the EI education team that a boy in their year group, who was well liked and friends with many of the girls, was targeted when another boy created an AI-generated sexual image of him. That image was then circulated around the school, causing significant distress and trauma.”EI also flags how these tools are being trivialised and used in disturbing ways, such as the “changing your friend into your boyfriend” filter. “On social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat, they are increasingly accessible and normalised. While this may seem playful or harmless to some, it reflects and reinforces a culture where consent and respect for personal boundaries are undermined.”‘It was extremely pornographic’: Cara Hunter on the deepfake video that nearly ended her political careerRead moreAgainst a backdrop of widespread misogyny in schools, a growing number of teachers are also being targeted, EI and others report: “It is something that, as a society, we urgently need to confront. Education has to stay in front of technology, and adults must feel equipped to lead these conversations rather than shy away from them.”Seth James is a designated safeguarding lead – a senior member of staff with overall responsibility for child protection and safeguarding within a school – and the author ofthe DSL Blog. “For everyone working in schools, it feels like new sets of challenges and risks are constantly being thrown up by technological developments,” he says. “AI generally – and particularly deepfakes and nudify apps – feel like the next train coming down the track.“‘More education’ is appealing as a solution to these sorts of challenges – because it’s intuitive and relatively easy – but on its own it’s like trying to hold back a forest fire with a water pistol. And likewise, the police seem completely overwhelmed by the scale of these issues. As a society we need broader solutions, and better strategy.”He continues: “We should all try to imagine how we would have felt 20 years ago if someone had suggested inventing a handheld device which could be used to create realistic pornographic material that featured actual people that you know in real life. And then they’d suggested giving one of these devices to all of our children. Because that’s basically where we are now. We’re letting these things become ‘normal’ on our watch.”Jessica Ringrose, a professor of sociology of gender and education at University College London’s Institute of Education, has worked in schools on issues including masculinity, gender inequality and sexual violence. She is also co-author of a book called Teens, Social Media, and Image Based Abuse, and is now researching tech-facilitated gender-based violence.“The way that young people are using these technologies is not necessarily all bad,” she says, “but what they need is better media literacy.” She welcomes the government’supdated relationships, sex and health education guidance, which “recognised that misogyny is a problem that needs to be tackled in the school system”. However, she says: “They need to put the dots together. They need to join up a concern with gender and sexual-based violence with technology. You can’t rely on Ofcom or the regulators to protect young people. We need proactive, preventive education.”Where is the government in all this? “Our new relationships, sex and health education guidance will make sure that all young people understand healthy relationships, sexual ethics and the dangers of online content such as pornography and deepfake,” a Department for Education spokesperson said. “As part of our Plan for Change mission to halve violence against women and girls, we are also providing schools with new funded resources to help teachers explain the law and harms relating to online content as part of their age-appropriate lessons.”Ringrose stresses the urgency. “These issues are happening – non-consensual creation and distribution of images is happening. These technologies are at people’s fingertips. I mean, it’s super-easy for any kid to access these things.”She is sceptical about efforts to ban smartphones in schools and worries they will make it harder for young people who may be targeted with abusive imagery to seek help. “Abstinence around things like technology doesn’t work,” she says. “You actually have to teach people to use it properly. We need to engage with this as a really important element of the curriculum.”Which takes us back to the boy on the bus, where this story began. He was stopped because a girl on the same bus had recently had a lesson in school about online safety as part of her PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) curriculum. She recognised what he was doing and told her teachers.Education works.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery. Today, I’m mulling over whether to upgrade my iPhone 11 Pro. In tech news, there’s a narrative battle afoot inSilicon Valley, tips on avoiding the yearly smartphone upgrade cycle and new devices altogether, and artificial intelligence’s use in government, for better and for worse.How to see through Silicon Valley’s narrativeThe encroachment of technology can feel inevitable. It may have always, but increasingly it’s a perception bolstered by big tech’s own friendly media bubble.My colleagueNick Robins-Earlyreports:If you are looking to hear from some of tech’s most powerful people, you will increasingly find them on a constellation of shows and podcasts like Sourcery that provide a safe space for an industry that is wary, if not openly hostile, towards critical media outlets. Some of the new media outlets are created by the companies themselves. Others just occupy a specific niche that has found a friendly ear among the tech billionaire class like a remora on a fast-moving shark. The heads of tech’s largest companies, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Satya Nadella and more, have all sat for long, cozy interviews in recent months, while firms like Palantir and Andreessen Horowitz have branched out this year into creating their own media ventures.At a time when the majority of Americans distrust big tech and believe artificial intelligence will harm society, Silicon Valley has built its own network of alternative media where CEOs, founders and investors are the unchallenged and beloved stars. What was once the province of a few fawning podcasters has grown into a fully fledged ecosystem of publications and shows supported by some of the tech industry’s most powerful.But at the same time as big tech’s echo chambers are growing louder, so do critical voices from within.My colleague Varsha Bansal reports on two recent developments.AI raters in the US– a new type of contracted content moderator for artificial intelligence – are telling their friends and family not to use AI. In Seattle,more than 1,000 Amazon corporate workershave anonymously signed an open letter warning the company that its rapid rollout of AI across the company and its products threatens the climate and the livelihoods of its workers.A dozenAI raters, workers who check an AI’s responses for accuracy and groundedness, told the Guardian that, after becoming aware of the way chatbots and image generators function and just how wrong their output can be, they have begun urging their friends and family not to use generative AI at all – or at least trying to educate their loved ones on using it cautiously. These trainers work on a range of AI models – Google’s Gemini, Elon Musk’s Grok, other popular models, and several smaller or lesser-known bots.More than1,000 Amazon employeeshave signed anopen letterexpressing “serious concerns” about AI development, saying that the company’s “all-costs justified, warp speed” approach to the powerful technology will cause damage to “democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth”.The letter, published on Wednesday, was signed by the Amazon workers anonymously, and comes a month after Amazon announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. It contains a range of demands for Amazon, concerning its impact on the workplace and the environment. Staffers are calling on the company to power all its datacenters with clean energy and make sure its AI-powered products and services do not enable “violence, surveillance and mass deportation”.ChatGPT and mental healthChatGPT firm blames boy’s suicide on ‘misuse’ of its technologyChatGPT-5 offers dangerous advice to mentally ill people, psychologists warnAI’s safety features can be circumvented with poetry, research findsHow not to buy new tech this holiday seasonView image in fullscreenThe new iPhone 16.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBlack Friday online sales hit $8.6bn in the US, according toAdobe Analytics. You might be one of the buyers. Or you might think, like me, that you can hold on to your sputtering phone, laptop, tablet, etc, one more year, despite the cracked screen or one-hour battery. Replacing them outright with new versions can be prohibitively expensive.Increasingly, there is another option, though. Devices, even Apple ones, are becoming more repairable. Which means that often, even when your devices are on their last legs, there are cheaper ways to get the tech you need than buying new ones. My colleague Alan Martinreportson refurbished devices and five tips to follow while shopping for them:Read the descriptionRefurbished can mean different things. See what condition is promised, paying special attention to battery health. Peer-to-peer buys are a gamble. “Preowned”, “secondhand” and “refurbished” may be used interchangeably, but they mean different things. That separates refurbished marketplaces such as Back Market, MusicMagpie, Refurbed and others from sites where you buy directly from a member of the public, such as Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist.Check the warranty and returns policyYou want to know that you’re in good hands should anything go wrong.Research the seller’s reputationLook at customer reviews and internet feedback. If on eBay, look for sellers in the company’s Refurbished programme.Research your chosen deviceThe older the device, the bigger the discount – but this is a false economy if you have to replace it sooner. With phones and laptops, especially, make sure they’re getting updates and will be able to cope with years of use.Don’t cheap outA low price is only a bargain if it actually delivers. Prioritise customer service and a transparent refurbishment process over saving a few pounds.“The best advice I can give for buying refurbished is to go via established retailers such as Back Market, Giffgaff and Vodafone, and if you’re buying through eBay then try to get a device that’s listed as ‘certified refurbished’,” says technology journalist Thomas Deehan, interviewedRead more:From smash-proof cases to updates: how to make your smartphone last longerAI in government: incompetent lawyers, automated bureaucracyView image in fullscreenA projection of the Brazilian flag in Brasilia, the capital.Photograph: Sérgio Lima/AFP/Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence is proliferating in a wide array of workplaces, including the ones where taxes fund the payroll. The stakes of elections and prison sentences are far higher than the sale of the wrong merchandise by a private company, making AI seem like an ill-advised gamble in government. At the same time, the slogging pace of bureaucracy is a worldwide problem, making AI’s streamlining capabilities appealing. The use of AI in government is still in the early stages. The experiment is yielding mixed results.First, the good news. Brazil, Germany, and Japan are using generative AI to streamline bureaucracy and make it more participatory. Nathan E Sanders and Bruce Schneier, co-authors of the book Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship,write:Brazilis notoriously litigious, with even more lawyers per capita than the US. The courts are chronically overwhelmed with cases and the resultant backlog costs the government billions to process.Since at least 2019, the Brazilian government has aggressively adopted AI to automate procedures throughout its judiciary. AI is not making judicial decisions, but aiding in distributing caseloads, performing legal research, transcribing hearings, identifying duplicative filings, preparing initial orders for signature and clustering similar cases for joint consideration: all things to make the judiciary system work more efficiently. And the results are significant; Brazil’s federal supreme court backlog, for example, dropped in 2025 to its lowest levels in 33 years.InGermany, With the new tools Wahlweise and Wahl.chat, AI-infused offshoots of the officialWahl-o-Mathow-to-vote quiz, citizens can engage in an interactive conversation with an AI system to more easily get the same information contextualized to their individual interests and questions instead of having to read static webpages about the positions of various political parties.InJapan, Last year, then 33-year-old engineer Takahiro Anno was a fringe candidate for governor of Tokyo. Running as an independent candidate, he ended up coming in fifth in a crowded field of 56, largely thanks to the unprecedented use of an authorized AI avatar. That avatar answered 8,600 questions from voters on a 17-day continuous YouTube live stream and garnered the attention of campaign innovators worldwide.Two months ago, Anno-san was elected to Japan’s upper legislative chamber, again leveraging the power of AI to engage constituents – this time answering more than 20,000 questions. His new party, Team Mirai, promises that its members will direct their questioning in committee hearings based on public input in its Mirai Assembly app.Second, the bad news. InCalifornia, government lawyers failed to fact-check the output of generative AI while trying to put a man in prison. My colleague Cecilia Nowellreportson an California prosecutor’s office, which used artificial intelligence to file a motion in at least one criminal case. The motion contained errors known as “hallucinations”:A prosecutor at the Nevada county district attorney’s office in northern California “recently used artificial intelligence in preparing a filing, which resulted in an inaccurate citation,” district attorney Jesse Wilson said in a statement to the Sacramento Bee. “Once the error was discovered, the filing was immediately withdrawn.”Defense and civil rights attorneys argue the prosecutor’s office used artificial intelligence in other criminal court filings.The wider TechScape‘It’s hell for us here’: Mumbai families suffer as datacentres keep the city hooked on coalEuropean parliament calls for social media ban on under-16sMacquarie Dictionary announces ‘AI slop’ as its word of the year, beating out Ozempic faceWarner Music signs deal with AI song generator Suno after settling lawsuitQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I’ve used AirTags more than I’d like to admit, including keeping one on my 13-year-old’s house keys so he can find them when he inevitably misplaces them for the umpteenth time.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of ScoscheScosche MagStack USB-C Cables$29.99 at CrutchfieldI find I never have enough cables.

TheAustralian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) expectsthat share to rise rapidly – growing 25% year-on-year – to reach 12TWh, or 6% of grid demand, by 2030, and 12% by 2050.Rapid growth of the industry will drive “substantial increases in electricity consumption, for Sydney and Melbourne, in particular”, Aemo forecasts.Boom or bubble? Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spreeRead moreIn New South Wales and Victoria, where most are located, datacentres could comprise 11% and 8% ofeach state’s electricity demand, respectively, by 2030.Technology companies includingOpenAIandSunCableare pushing for Australia to become a hub for data processing and storage. Last month the Victorian state government announced a “$5.5m investment to become Australia’s datacentre capital”.But with 260 centres operating nationally, and dozens more in the offing, experts are flagging concerns about what the industry’s unfettered growth could mean for the energy transition and climate targets.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterEnergy use equivalent to 100,000 householdsBanks of servers running 24/7 in a confined space generate massive amounts of heat and require electricity to run and cool them.Datacentre demand globally is growingfour times fasterthan all other sectors, according to the International Energy Agency. Centres are multiplying and are increasing in size, with hyperscale facilities becoming more common.According to the IEA: “A hyperscale, AI-focused datacentre can have a capacity of 100MW or more, consuming as much electricity annually as 100,000 households.”The consumption of electricity and water is largely related to cooling, as servers, like other computing devices, convert electrical energy into heat, according to Prof Michael Brear, a professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Net Zero Australia project at the University of Melbourne.“When you have a very large number of computers in a confined space, you need to air condition the space to maintain these devices at a safe and efficient working temperature,” he says.Most digital infrastructure is cooled using air conditioning or water.Ketan Joshi, an Oslo-based climate analyst associated with the Australia Institute, says many technology companies are now reporting accelerating power consumption year-on-year. The intensity of energy use is also rising against multiple metrics – energy per active user, per unit of revenue – compared with five years ago, he says.“They’re not using more energy to serve more people or to make more money,” he says. “The question that everybody should be asking is why are you consuming more energy?”In the absence of concrete data, Joshi says the most reasonable assumption is that the uptick in demand is being fuelled by the widespread adoption of energy-hungry generative AI systems.‘Running harder to stay in the same spot’Joshi, who has beentracking the issueglobally, says datacentres are large, inflexible loads on the power grid which have two clear impacts: they increase reliance on coal and gas generation, and they siphon resources away from the energy transition.Datacentre companies often claim they run on clean energy by investing in solar or windfarms, but Joshi says there is often a mismatch between their near-constant draw on the grid and the generation profile of renewable energy.“What is the net effect on the power grid?” he asks. “Well, sometimes you’re going to have a surplus of energy, and sometimes you’re going to have not enough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some developers in Australia have proposedinstalling new gas generatorsto service their needs.According to Aemo’s forecasts, by 2035 datacentres could consume 21.4TWh, an amount just shy of the annual consumption of Australia’sfour aluminium smelters.It is still early days in the uptake of AI, Brear says, and at this stage the outlook is uncertain, reflected in Aemo’s scenarios for energy consumption in 2035 ranging from 12TWh to 24TWh. “It may not be that these grow as large as some people are predicting,” he says.In its national AI plan,released on Tuesday, the federal government acknowledged the need to expand new energy and cooling technologies for AI systems. The minister for industry, Tim Ayres, said the government would set out data centre principles in early 2026, pledging that “key co-requisites for data centre investment will include additional investment in renewable energy generation and water sustainability”.‘An undeniable impact’ on power pricesDr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems researcher at the University of New South Wales, says renewable energy is growing in Australia but not yet at the rate required to meet renewable energy and emissions targets. Datacentre growth would add to the challenge.“If we are in a situation where demand is growing much faster than anticipated and renewables don’t keep up, then actually what we end up doing is just powering that new demand and not displacing coal,” he says.Unlike electric vehicles, which create additional demands on the grid while reducing petrol and diesel consumption, datacentres will not reduce fossil fuel use in other parts of the economy, according to McConnell.“If this demand eventuates, it will make our emissions objective – and our ability to close coal on schedules that align with the emissions targets – very difficult, if not impossible,” he says.The Climate Change Authority, in its advice on climate targets, says: “Datacentres will also be built at increasingly large scales and capacity, compounding pressure on regional power sources and placing additional pressure on the renewables buildout.”There will be an undeniable impact on the overall cost of energy, which will flow through to power prices, McConnell says.“You need to build a bigger system to serve this load, and that will mean more expensive resources are used.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyAustralian climate and environment in focusArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have no other words for that,” says German-born Michael Lohscheller, the chief executive of Polestar, Europe’s only all-electric car manufacturer.“If Europe doesn’t take the lead in this transformation, be rest assured, other countries will do it for us.”The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has called on the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to soften the 2035 cutoff date. He has asked her to permit the manufacture of new hybrid and highly efficient combustion engine cars beyond 2035 as consumers are still hesitant to buy EVs.“We’re sending the right signal to the commission with this letter,” Merz said, adding that the German government wanted to protect the climate in “a technology-neutral way”.Sitting in Polestar’s glass panelled offices in Gothenburg inSweden, Lohscheller, cannot believe what is unfolding.His attempts to take part in the EU’s year-old “strategic dialogue” on the future of the car industry were snubbed. “I wrote twice, I’m not even sure we got an answer to the second letter,” he says.Across the road in Gothenburg, high above the giantVolvoassembly plant, Håkan Samuelsson, the 74-year-old chief executive of Volvo Cars, has seen it all.“I don’t see the logic in slowing down,” he says.Samuelsson likens the resistance mounted by the multibillion car industry to the opposition to catalytic convertors, and to seatbelts 50 years ago.“If they were not mandatory, we would probably have 30% of our cars without seatbelts and if you consider the additional cost we probably wouldn’t have any cars with catalytic converters either unless they were mandatory,” he says.View image in fullscreenHåkan Samuelsson, the chief executive of Volvo, says there is no logic to rolling back on the 2035 ban on petrol cars.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianVolkswagen and BMW, Samuelsson says, “can do with they like”, but if they take the foot off the electrification pedal, they will just widen the gap for China.“The Chinese will set up factories in Hungary and Slovakia, Romania … in low labour cost markets. I don’t think it’s possible to keep them out of the EU with tariffs. You just need to meet them face on and compete with them,” he says.Samuelsson says there is no need for von der Leyen to make a decision now and should delay it until closer to the cutoff date. “We have time. We have 10 years.”Michael Bloss, the Green’s rapporteur at the European parliament, says Merz’s demands “would completely gut” hard-fought EU legislation and “effectively give the combustion engine a free pass”.The Greens and the Swedes are adamant that prolonging hybrid cars will send a message to consumers that they do not need to buy electric and will be self-fulfilling for the car industry’s arguments.Lohscheller is equally direct. “The Chinese will not pause. They will take over. If Brussels pauses this [target] and says: ‘Stop we will give you another five years,’ they are really putting hundreds and thousands of jobs at risk.”View image in fullscreenMichael Lohscheller, the chief executive of Polestar, says the very notion of scrubbing out the 2035 date is preposterous.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianThe fast-talking, marathon-running executive says the very notion of scrubbing out the 2035 date, agreed only three years ago, is preposterous.Lohscheller was part of the original talks that led to the EU decision in 2022 to phase out the sale of all new internal-combustion engines in 2035, hailed by the then EU vice-president Frans Timmermans as a major step towards carbon neutrality in 2050.“When I was CEO of Opel, I took part in all these meetings and went to Brussels twice a year. We discussed it for hours and hours,” the Polestar boss says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Do I train and say it’s difficult, so I’ll do a half marathon instead? No.”With decades of experience behind him as the former chief financial officer of VW, and the former chief executive of Opel and the Vietnamese car company Vinfast, Lohscheller says Germany, which is in the throes of economic challenges, needs to learn to adapt. And fast.“It is a mindset, an attitude. I was just in China and Korea last week and came back to Germany, my home country.“It is so obvious in Germany that everyone wants to defend the past, they don’t want to change anything, just defend what they have. I can talk with authority because I am German. In China and the US is it like ‘what is the next idea? What is the next project? What is the next company we try out? That is a big difference. It is a completely different mindset.”Polestar, which began as a racing car company in 1996, was bought by Volvo in 2015 and then spun off in 2017 and relaunched as a separate EV-only production company. It is now majority owned by the Chinese Volvo shareholder Geely.Asked whether the Chinese ownership may make Brussels nervous of Volvo’s view, Samuelsson says that Volvo is still a Swedish company. “We were with Ford for 11 years and now 14 or 15 with Geely and been developing very positively. We are listed in the Swedish stock exchange and all rules we follow are European. We are Swedish. We are no more Chinese than we were American. We are as Swedish as Abba and Ikea. “He says the EU must continue to speed ahead on electrification. It is the future. Polestar have a car that has driven 560 miles (900km) without being charged.Samuelsson says Volvo, which has five all-electric cars, and is about to launch the EX60, an electric version of its bestseller, XC60, already offers ranges of 310-370 miles.This ticks one of the three big consumer concerns buying EVs, says Samuelsson. The second is charging time. This has to be down to 15-20 minutes, “the same time as the biological pause a driver needs” at the motorway stop, to get a coffee, go to the bathroom and stretch their legs. This he said will be “no problem” in the future.“The third thing which holds consumers back is the price,” he continues.“[If] we the car industry fulfil these three I think it [EV take up] will speed up. So I really don’t see a reason today to start questioning if 2035 is too fast. We have time. We need to speed this up not slow down.”Samuelsson also wonders about the value of constant talk about net zero that is not backed up by development on the ground.“Listening to these Cop discussions in Brazil, you start wondering if all this discussion leads to an improvement of the climate or not?“I’m more and more leaning to the view that it is technical development and innovations that are needed to do the job. Talking will not do the job.“Electrification will do the job. It is good for the climate. It is really important. It is also good for customers. It’s one of the very few environmentally friendly innovations that customers also will love.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryVolvoMotoring (Technology)Electric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoring (Money)European UnionSwedenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Was it worth the 18-year wait?Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 (version tested); Retro Studios/NintendoThe bounty hunter – Nintendo’s most badass and most neglected hero – returns in an atmospheric throwback sci-fi adventure that’s entirely untroubled by the conventions of modern game designKeza MacDonaldTue 2 Dec 2025 10.56 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 10.57 ESTShareIn a frozen laboratory full of cryogenically suspended experimental life forms, metal boots disturb the frost. A lone bounty hunter in a familiar orange exosuit points her blaster ahead. Making my way towards the facility’s power generator, scanning doors and hunting for secret entrances, broken hatches and hidden keys, I suspect that I know exactly what’s going to happen when this place begins to thaw; every clank and creak sounds sounds as if it could be a long-dormant beast busting out of one of those pods. And yet Samus Aran delves deeper, because she has never been afraid of anything.This section of Prime 4 is classic Metroid: atmospheric, eerie, lonely, dangerous and cryptic. Samus, Nintendo’s coolest hero, is impeccably awesome, equipped here with new psychic powers that accent her suit with pulsing purple light. (I have taken many screenshots of her looking identically badass all over the game’s planet.) She is controlled with dual sticks, or – much better, much more intuitive – by pointing one of the Switch 2’s remotes at the screen to aim. Or even by using it as a mouse on a table or your knee, though this made my wrist hurt after a while. She transforms into a rolling ball, moves statues into place with her mind, and rides a futuristic shape-shifting motorcycle across lava and sand between this distant planet’s abandoned facilities, unlocking its dead civilisation’s lost knowledge.In fact there is a lot of classic Metroid Prime in here. Things that I’ve been missing since these atmospheric adventures went on hiatus in 2007: the gradual unfurling of new powers and gadgets; theGiger-esquevisual design; patiently scanning everything with Samus’s visor for clues; the sedate pace of exploration, interrupted by sudden bursts of frenetic blasting when robots or aliens show up. It has some spectacular sights and moments: enormous boss creatures, the desert that stretches across the planet under unforgiving foreign sun, wolves that emerge from a blizzard like spectres.Alongside the Metroid series’ own ghosts, I was surprised to find echoes of other abandoned Nintendo sci-fi series in here, too. If you are still waiting for long-lost sequels to F-Zero or Star Fox, well, improbably, they’re in here: in the floaty controls of Samus’s motorcyle and its cyberspace training courses; in the way that flying creatures will sometimes arrange themselves in formation ahead of you, allowing you to paint them with your reticule and fire off a laser-fizzing disc to explode them.But there is also a lot that doesnotfeel like Metroid, and usually for the worse. Someone at either Retro Studios or its parent Nintendo was clearly worried that players may get lost wondering what on earth to do next, so Samus now has a companion who offers up suggestions for where she should go. Rescued engineer Myles MacKenzie caught a lot of flack during Metroid Prime 4’s preview period – justifiably, because he truly is spectacularly irritating, firing off Joss Whedon-esque quips to himself as Samus looks on in what I can only assume is silent judgement. Thankfully, he is present for all of 15 minutes before he confines himself to a basecamp at the end of the game’s first area, leaving Samus (and the player) to explore in peace.View image in fullscreenPeriods of patient exploration are interrupted by sudden bursts of frenetic blasting.Photograph: NintendoAside from offering a few unwelcome directions when I’d spent too long wandering the desert, Myles never turned up again unless I asked for his help. (In the abandoned facilities that make up the bulk of the game, his radio signal is scrambled so you couldn’t summon his voice even if you wanted to.) But Samus encounters more stranded soldiers over the course of the game, and unfortunately they areallannoying when they’re around, interrupting your exploration far too often with soundbites and unnecessary advice. The desert that connects all the different areas, meanwhile, is disappointingly empty. Especially in the later hours of the game, there is a lot of tedious zipping to and fro across this expanse, which feels distinctly un-Metroid (and unenjoyable), compared to the tight corridors and tense space-station fights that can be found elsewhere.Metroid Prime 4 feels, often, like an experimental game from 15 years ago. I cannot stress enough that this is mostly a good thing. It is wonderfully untroubled by the conventions of modern game design. Ironically, the wait for Prime 4 has been so long that what would have felt tedious or archaic in the past now feels comfortingly retro: things such as walking everywhere instead of using fast travel; or the slow, methodical cadence; or the predictable structure which has you fighting five different boss monsters in five different obvious arenas to collect five different keys. Other things are less forgivable, such as the spotty autosaving. Having to replay a full half-hour’s worth of exploration in a lava-encrusted weapons facility after an accidental death isnotfun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Riding around Cyrodiil on horseback, taking in its gleaming city and backwater towns, it was so easy to get drawn into unexpected shenanigans that closing the story’s threatening hell-gates became a distant second priority.Uno(2006)View image in fullscreenThe most addictive version of the classic card game… Uno on Xbox 360Photograph: Carbonated Games/MicrosoftLook – don’t @ us – Uno was one ofthemost important Xbox 360 games. It was the first game that many people ever played on webcam (for better or for worse), letting you see the expression on an opponent’s face when you played a wild draw four. It was one of the first downloadable multiplayer games that console players could enjoy. It was astonishingly moreish. Many, many times you’d pick up the controller intending on making a dent in Halo or Mass Effect, and instead be drawn into round upon round of late-night online Uno. We still sometimes hear the pleasing sound effects in our dreams.Viva Piñata (2006)View image in fullscreenDarwinian brutality? … Viva Piñata.Photograph: MicrosoftBuild a beautiful garden, attract colourful piñata-creatures to reside in it – then watch on as they all eat each other. The Darwinian brutality of Viva Piñata is a surprise in such a family-friendly-looking game, but it’s also just so compulsive. Many a hungover weekend in the 00s were spent trying to tempt bigger and more colourful predators to our lush mini-paradise. Horstachio for ever.BioShock(2007)Part dystopian adventure, part exploration of Ayn Rand’s objectivist philosophy, 2K Boston’s masterpiece has you exploring an undersea city built by a crazed billionaire with a fondness for drastic socio-scientific experiments.

This one is a shooter of astonishing scale for its time, the concluding part of gaming’s most maximalist and justifiably self-serious space drama. Where most modern shooters are glorified rollercoaster rides, corridors linked together by triggered set-pieces, Halo is full of intelligent enemies and opportunities for emergent chaos. But what we all remember best is the multiplayer: tanks and Ghost airships and Warthogs all clashing in endlessly entertaining remixes of the same outrageous grand battles. Its Forge map editor and fully customisable game rules made it feel infinitely entertaining.Mass Effect(2007)View image in fullscreenBetter than Star Wars?… Mass EffectPhotograph: Electronic ArtsBioWare’s vast sci-fi trilogy may not have had an ideal ending, but its mix of interplanetary war and inter-species romance held fans enraptured for a decade, starting with this brilliant first game.

Perhaps too easy, as it’s over surprisingly quickly – but it has more heart and personality than any other Xbox role-playing game. It’s a mood-lifting fairytale with a heap of good ideas. Also, it has an excellent dog companion – though we may never forgive this game for what happens to it.Gears of War 2 (2008)View image in fullscreenThe ultimate testosterone-drenched cover shooter … Gears of War 2.Photograph: Epic GamesBuilding on the muscular foundations of its predecessor, Gears 2 is the ultimate testosterone-drenched cover shooter, pitching macho marines against alien locust monsters in an orgy of destruction and chainsaw machine guns.

The company tempted a series of storied Japanese developers to make exclusive games for the 360. Most of them sank without trace, but Lost Odyssey is a standout in its genre: it’s about what happens to our humanity in the face of technological revolution. Given that it was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, a Final Fantasy veteran, it is perhaps unsurprising that it feels like a lost entry in that series.Ninja GaidenII (2008)View image in fullscreenChoreographed violence… Ninja Gaiden IIPhotograph: Team NINJABefore Dark Souls came along, it was Tecmo’s viciously difficult acton adventure that had players either grinding their teeth in frustration or gleefully hacking the limbs off adversaries.

After creating Guitar Hero, Harmonix handed that series over to a different developer and set to work on Rock Band, a peerlessly entertaining music game that had you singing, playing and drumming together on plastic instruments. Rock Band 2 not only had the best setlist, leaning towards milllennial-pleasing pop-punk and classic rock, but also the most frictionless play experience. You could be rocking out in moments, online or, much better, in person with friends.Limbo(2010)View image in fullscreenUnnerving … Limbo.Photograph: TriplePointThe art game that showcased Xbox Live Arcade as a venue for experimentation, Playdead’s quasi-horror puzzle platformer is an unnerving noir thriller about a boy searching a hellish monochrome world for his lost sister.

When the bombs went off, they took down empty office blocks and demolished echoing, multi-cuisine food halls. Dynamite toppled a four-storey hospital, silent karaoke complexes, deserted gyms and dorm rooms.So came the end of KK Park, one ofsouth-east Asia’s most infamous “scam centres”,press releases from Myanmar’s junta declared. The facility had held tens of thousands of people, forced to relentlessly defraud people around the world. Now, it was being levelled piece by piece.Revealed: the huge growth of Myanmar scam centres that may hold 100,000 trafficked peopleRead moreBut the park’s operators were long gone: apparently tipped off that a crackdown was coming, they were busily setting up shop elsewhere. More than 1,000 labourers had managed to flee across the border, and some 2,000 others had been detained. But up to 20,000 labourers, likely trafficked and brutalised, had disappeared. Away from the junta’s cameras, scam centres like KK park have continued to thrive.So monolithic has the multi-billion dollar global scam industry become that experts say we are entering the era of the “scam state”. Like the narco-state, the term refers to countries where an illicit industry has dug its tentacles deep into legitimate institutions, reshaping the economy, corrupting governments and establishing state reliance on an illegal network.The raids on KK Park were the latest in a series of highly publicised crackdowns on scam centres across south-east Asia. But regional analysts say these are largely performative ortarget middling players, amounting to “political theatre” by officials who are under international pressure to crack down on them but have little interest in eliminating a wildly profitable sector.“It’s a way of playing Whack-a-Mole, where you don’t want to hit a mole,” says Jacob Sims, visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Asia Centre and expert on transnational and cybercrime in the Mekong.In the past five years scamming, says Sims, has mutated from “small online fraud rings into an industrial-scale political economy”.“In terms of gross GDP, it’s the dominant economic engine for the entire Mekong sub-region,” he says, “And that means that it’s one of the dominant – if notthedominant – political engine.”Government spokespeople in Myanmar,Cambodiaand Laos did not respond to questions from the Guardian, but Myanmar’s military has previously said it is “working to completely eradicate scam activities from their roots”. The Cambodian government has also described allegations it is home to one of “the world’s largest cybercrime networks supported by the powerful” as “baseless” and “irresponsible”.Morphing in less than a decade from a world of misspelled emails and implausible Nigerian princes, the industry has become a vast, sophisticated system, raking in tens of billions from victims around the world.At its heart are “pig-butchering” scams – where a relationship is cultivated online before the scammer pushes their victim to part with their money, often via an “investment” in cryptocurrency. Scammers have harnessed increasingly sophisticated technology to fool targets: using generative AI to translate and drive conversations, deepfake technology to conduct video calls, and mirrored websites to mimic real investment exchanges. One survey found victimswere conned for an average of $155,000 (£117,400) each.Mostreported losing more than half their net worth.Those huge potential profits have driven the industrialisation of the scam industry. Estimates of the industry’s global size now range from $70bn into thehundreds of billions– a scale that would put it on a par with the global illicit drug trade. The centres are typically run by transnational criminal networks, often originating from China, but their ground zero has been south-east Asia.By late 2024, cyber scamming operations in Mekong countries were generating an estimated$44bn (£33.4bn)a year, equivalent to about 40% of the combined formal economy. That figure is considered conservative, and on the rise. “This is a massive growth area,” says Jason Tower, from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime. “This has become a global illicit market only since 2021 – and we’re now talking about a $70bn-plus-per-year illicit market. If you go back to 2020, it was nowhere near that size.”In Cambodia, one company alleged by the US government to run scam compounds across the country had $15bn of cryptocurrency targeted in a Department of Justice (DOJ) seizure last month – funds equal to almost half of Cambodia’s economy.Map showing origin countries of people identified in scam compoundsWith such huge potential profits, infrastructure has rapidly been built to facilitate it. The hubs thrive in conflict zones and along lawless and poorly regulated border areas. In Laos, officials have told local media around 400 are operating in the Golden Triangle special economic zone. Cyber Scam Monitor – a collective that monitors scamming Telegram channels, police reports, media and satellite data to identify scam compounds – has located 253 suspected sites across Cambodia. Many are enormous, and operating in public view.The scale of the compounds is itself an indication of how much the states hosting them have been compromised, experts claim.“These are massive pieces of infrastructure, set up very publicly. You can go to borders and observe them. You can even walk into some of them,” says Tower. “The fact this is happening in a very public way shows just the extreme level of impunity – and the extent to which states are not only tolerating this, but actually, these criminal actors are becoming state embedded.”Thailand’s deputy finance ministerresignedthis October following allegations of links to scam operations in Cambodia, which he denies.Chen Zhi,who was recently hit by joint UK and US sanctionsfor allegedly masterminding the Prince Group scam network, was an adviser to Cambodia’s prime minister. The Prince Group said it “categorically rejects” claims the company or its chairman have engaged in any unlawful activity. In Myanmar, scam centres have become akey financial flowfor armed groups. In the Philippines, ex-mayor Alice Guo, who ran a massive scam centre while in office, has just been sentenced to life in prison.Across south-east Asia, scam masterminds are “operating at a very high level: they’re obtaining diplomatic credentials, they’re becoming advisers … It is massive in terms of the level of state involvement and co-optation,” Tower says.“It’s quite unprecedented that you have an illicit market of this nature, that is causing global harm, where there’s blatant impunity, and it’s happening in this public way.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I don’t know exactly how we’ll move past this turbulent moment in US history. But I believe that honest, uncompromised journalism is a critical force for helping our country move forward, especially with some of our biggest news organizations wavering or in retreat.What a newsroom chooses to spotlight reveals its underlying values, and the Guardian’s global perspective and people-centered approach guides our editorial decision-making every day.Guardian reporting is factual, free from corporate and political influence, and grounded in humane values – an essential, trustworthy and moral counterpoint to the darkness and dishonesty rampant in public life and discourse.By necessity, we spend a lot of our resources reporting on outrages and atrocities – from extrajudicial killings carried out by the Pentagon, to the White House’s campaign of retribution against its declared enemies, to the inhumane assault on immigrants and the rolling back of decades of progress on civil rights.This work right now is urgent and critical, as so many vital institutions and liberties are under attack. But to us, the resurgence of grassroots civic action has been one of the most underreported news stories in the US this year.Last week, we announced the creation of our new movements reporting team, dedicated to amplifying stories about the people and organizations fighting for fundamental rights and liberties at this critical moment in the US. We have been heartened by readers’ responses to our reporting on these new movements, which help inspire hope for a different future.Today is Giving Tuesday, the most important fundraising day of our year.If you can support us today, it would mean a great deal. What we raise in these 24 hours helps determine the resources we have available to us in 2026.One final thing. Inevitably, this column will reach people too financially stretched to contribute to our appeal. Please know this: our work is free to all for a reason, and we are proud to make it so. The fantastic thing about having this voluntary community of supporters is that we are exactly that – a community that has each other’s backs.Thanks to all of you for being a part of it. Your readership and your support both fund our work and inspire our hope.You can make a Giving Tuesday gift to the Guardian here.All support is gratefully received, but a recurring contribution – even a small monthly amount – is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead.

As with many others though, it looks like a reverse ferret could be in the worksTue 2 Dec 2025 11.21 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 14.23 ESTShareI’m not some sort of secret Reform voter, OK? As a Brit (albeit a Brit abroad), I’ve got no problem with rich immigrants coming to the UK and taking all our mansions. I just think they really ought to integrate and not bring their funny foreign ideas with them.Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, I’m talking to you. The California couple arrived in the UK last year, just before Donald Trump won the election. As soon as the votes were in, they declaredthey weren’t goingback, and would stay on the saner side of the Atlantic. I’m not sure how the immigration logistics worked, but it seems “one in, one out” schemes don’t apply to people coming in on big jets, only small boats. The pair bought a fancy pad in the Cotswolds and DeGeneres buttered up the locals during a publicappearancein July by declaring “Everything here is just better.”It’s easy to be upbeat during a British summer, when all is green and pleasant. Now that the winter gloom has set in, however, rumour has it that the fairweather Brits are plotting a return to Trumpland. According to theMail on Sunday(so take all this with a few pinches of salt), the couple miss their friends and can’t stand the thought of another British winter. I understand being homesick, but you lose a bit of street cred if you flee creeping fascism only to run straight back to it because you’re not used to being a bit chilly. As my mother would say: just put on another jumper, Ellen! Abandon your weird American ideas about how the sky ought to be blue.DeGeneres and De Rossi aren’t the only celebs apparently rethinking just how averse they are to living under Trump. Ever since Trump burst on to the political scene, Hollywood has resembled an airport lounge: so many people have been announcing their imminent departures. But few have followed through. In 2016, for example, the comedianAmy Schumertold Newsnight that she would “move to Spain or somewhere” if Trump won the election. She later explained this was “said in jest” and, to be fair, it can be hard to know when Schumer is trying to be funny.Miley Cyrus also pulled out the “just joking” card to explain why her relocation plans changed. In March 2016 she announced she would move if Trump became president,adding:“I don’t say things I don’t mean!”Cyrus later clarifiedthat she does, in fact, say things she doesn’t mean.Barbra Streisand, meanwhile, threatened to leave ahead of both the 2016 and 2024 elections but still doesn’t appear to have made any moves.There are, however, a handful of US celebrities who have actually fled and don’t appear to have any plans to return. In March Courtney Love, who has lived in London since around 2019, said she was planning to get her British citizenship. While this doesn’t seem to be purely because of Trump 2.0, she called the political situation in the US “frightening”.At about the same time, the comedian Rosie O’Donnell revealed that she had relocated her family to Ireland, citing concerns for hernon-binary childClay. “When you know it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” she said in a TikTok video. While it’s easy to make fun of self-deporting celebrities – many of whom are insulated by their wealth from the effects of Trumpism – O’Donnell was probably sensible to leave. The comedian has been in a long-running feud with Trump and, earlier this year, the president said he was consideringstripping her of her US citizenship. He might not be able to do this legally, but when a man with a cult-like following is calling you out in a country with escalating political violence, it’s natural to feel worried for your personal safety.There may not be a massive celebrity exodus yet, but the US does seem to be experiencing a brain drain because of Trump. A poll from the journal Nature foundthat 75% of researchersin the US are considering leaving; international students also seem to be losing interest inventuring stateside. Meanwhile, some experts in authoritarianism see the writing on the wall and are packing their bags. “We Study Fascism, and We’re Leaving the US,” the headline of a video op-edthree Yale professorsmade for the New York Times earlier this year read before they left for Canada. A chilling message indeed. But nothing compared with a damp winter in the Cotswolds.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Will he ever stand up to Trump?Steven GreenhouseUnder the chief justice, the US supreme court has bolstered authoritarian agendas while undercutting the voice of votersTue 2 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 12.42 ESTShareThroughout his two decades as chief justice of the US supreme court,John Robertshas sought to project the notion that he is theultimate institutionalist, striving (supposedly) to safeguard the venerated foundations of American democracy. But with each passing year, it has become increasingly clear that Roberts will be remembered as the chief justice who helped wreck numerous institutions vital to our democracy – they include fair,non-gerrymandered elections, asane campaign finance system, the Voting Rights Act’sprotections of minority voters, and the bedrock notion that presidents are not above the law.Roberts said in his confirmation hearings that he would merely “call balls and strikes” as chief justice, but now two decades later, many legalcommentatorsaredeeply dismayedthat he has shunned the role of neutral umpire and instead spearheaded arightwing judicial revolutionthat took a wrecking ball to many precedents, laws and institutions. Some have called himthe worst chief justice since Roger Taney, who wrote the horrific Dred Scott decision of 1857, which held that enslaved Black people couldn’t be citizens.Why does the supreme court keep bending the knee to Trump? | Steven GreenhouseRead moreAs one example of Roberts’ weakening our democracy, take congressional redistricting and the tradition of fair, democratic elections. Roberts wrotethe majority decisionin Rucho v Common Cause, a gerrymandering case that is largely responsible for turning redistricting into a disgraceful, hyper-partisan mess in which state legislatures can gerrymander as much as possible and, in effect, determine the results of congressional elections even before voters step into the voting booth. Roberts wrote that federal courts have no power whatsoever to overturn or interfere with even the most extreme partisan gerrymandering.With that myopic, anti-democratic ruling, Roberts has allowed gerrymandering to turn many congressional elections into farces, meaningless exercises in which legislators pick their voters rather than the other way around. If Roberts truly cared about safeguarding democracy, he would have cracked down on gerrymandering, and we wouldn’t be seeing today’s mad redistricting arms race in Texas, California and other states.Then there was the court’s disastrousCitizens Uniteddecision, which demolished our federal campaign finance system. That system had gone far to prevent the super-rich and corporations from having undue sway over our government. By overturning most contribution limits on the wealthy and business, Citizens United and its progeny turned our campaign finance system into an anything-goes cesspool in which individuals have donated$50m, even$100m, to campaigns, not to mention Elon Musk’sastonishing $277mbenefiting Trump and the GOP last year. (I should note that Roberts didn’t write the Citizens United decision;he instead orchestrated it.)That decision has gone far to turn the US into a plutocracy in which powerful corporations and billionaires such as Musk,Larry Ellisonand Charles Koch have far too much influence over our politics and policies. Meanwhile, the voice of the average American is increasingly overshadowed, and even negated, by big money and dark money.Roberts has also led the way in eviscerating the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to ensure that states and localities don’t discriminate on the basis of race when they adopt voting maps and election rules. Robertswrote the majority opinionin Shelby County v Holder, whichoverturned two key sectionsof the act that empowered the federal government to block states and communities with a racist history from adopting discriminatory voting maps and regulations before they took effect. Roberts justified that ruling by reaching the naive conclusion that state lawmakers’ desire to adopt discriminatory voting rules had largely disappeared.In the court’s current term, Roberts seems ready to tear down one of the last pillars of the Voting Rights Act – section 2 bans election or voting practices that discriminate by race. In aLouisiana redistricting case, the court will decide whether it’s unconstitutional to use race as a factor when drawing voting maps. If the court concludes that it’s illegal to take race into account, that would make it easy for lawmakers in southern states with large African American populations to stop creating Black-majority districts when they are redistricting and to instead adopt voting maps that would havefew, if any, congressional districts represented by Black people.Roberts seems on the brink of destroying another institution: independent federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the National Labor Relations Board. In several recent emergency docket decisions, Roberts hassuggested he is ready to overturna90-year-old supreme court precedentand give Trump the authority to fire any agency official he wants, even without giving a reason, even though federal law says officials from those and other agencies can only be fired for cause, such as malfeasance.The US supreme court appears ready to nullify the Voting Rights Act | Moira DoneganRead moreIf Roberts and the conservative super-majority overturn that precedent, it would let Trump, the most authoritarian president in US history, turn independent agencies into weaponized, partisan instruments under his control. Trump might, for instance, tell FTC commissioners that he’ll fire them unless they sue such-and-such perceived Trump enemy for billions of dollars.Every law student learns that article I of the US constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. But in a series of recent emergency orders, the Roberts court appears to have handed a lot of Congress’s spending powers over to Trump. In those emergency orders, which are temporary until final decisions are rendered, Roberts and the court’s conservative supermajority badly undercut Congress’s spending authority by giving a green light to Trump’sgutting the Department of Educationandfreezing $5bn in foreign aid– even though Congress had funded that department and that aid.Then there was Roberts’s much-criticized decisionin Trump v United States, which gave Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution if he engages in crimes. Manylegal expertscomplain thatit puts Trumpabove the lawandwill encourage an authoritarianpresident to take illegal actions with little concern about accountability or prosecution. One has to ask, if Roberts had not given Trump such huge immunity, might Trump have refrained from demanding that prosecutorspursue James Comey and Letitia Jamesbecause such strong-arming of those prosecutors might put him in legal jeopardy?Under Roberts, the supreme court has taken a wrecking ball to something else: the notion that the country’s highest court was largely non-partisan. The Roberts court is often viewed asfavoring the GOPand Trump. Its decisions oncampaign finance,voting rightsandgerrymanderingare widely seen asboosting Republicans’ chances in elections. What’s more, the court has been called hugely pro-Trump because since he returned to the presidency, it has ruled wholly or partially in his favor in20 of 23 emergency docket casesthat concerned Trump administrative actions.The bottom line is that under John Roberts, the court has gone far toweaken the pillarsofour democracy; it has given the super-rich and giant corporations huge sway over our elections, greatly weakened protections for minority voters, encouraged out-of-control gerrymandering, handed more and more power to the most authoritarian president in history and emboldened him to act lawlessly. In other words, the Roberts court has done much of what an authoritarian ruler would want.AsI’ve written before– perhaps too optimistically – it’s not too late for Roberts to begin to redeem his reputation and legacy. He showed some signs of doing this in early November in signaling that hethought Trump had violated the lawin imposing his “emergency” tariffs on dozens of countries without clear authorization from Congress. We can hope that the tariffs case will serve as a long-awaited, much-needed first step for Roberts and the conservative supermajority to develop a backbone and begin issuing a series of rulings that curb Trump’s unending power grab.If they don’t stand up to Trump’s lawlessness soon, we may truly lose our democracy.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsJohn RobertsOpinionUS supreme courtDonald TrumpLaw (US)Trump administrationUS politicsUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

Congress must act nowBernie SandersDespite the speed at which it is progressing, AI is getting far too little discussion in Congress, the media and within the general population. That has got to changeTue 2 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 14.37 ESTShareArtificial intelligence and robotics will transform the world. It will bring unimaginable changes to our economy, our politics, warfare, our emotional wellbeing, our environment, and how we educate and raise our children. Further, there is a very real fear that, in the not-so-distant future, a super-intelligent AI could replace humans in controlling the planet.Despite the extraordinary importance of this issue and the speed at which it is progressing, AI is getting far too little discussion in Congress, the media and within the general population. That has got to change. Now.Several months ago, as the ranking member of the US Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, I undertook an investigation regarding the monumental challenges that we face with the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Recently, I held a public discussion with Nobel prize winner Dr Geoffrey Hinton, considered to be the “Godfather” of AI, to get his views on a wide range of AI-related subjects.Based on our investigation and other information that we are gathering, my staff and I will soon be presenting a very specific set of recommendations to Congress as to how we can begin addressing some of the unprecedented threats that AI poses.Here are some of the outstanding questions that we intend to answer in our report:Who should be in charge of the transformation into an AI world? Currently, a handful of the very wealthiest people on Earth – Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel and others – are investing many hundreds of billions of dollars in developing and implementing AI and robotics. Are we comfortable with seeing these enormously powerful men shape the future of humanity without any democratic input or oversight? Is the goal of the AI revolution simply to make the very rich even richer and more powerful, or will this revolutionary technology be utilized to benefit all of humanity?Why does Donald Trump, who is strongly supporting the big tech oligarchs, want to impose an executive order blocking states from regulating artificial intelligence? Why does Thiel, the billionaire investor and co-founder of Palantir, call those who want regulations over AI “legionnaires of the Antichrist”. Does this elite group of big tech billionaires believe that they have “the divine right to rule”? How far will they go to resist government regulation?What impact will AI and robotics have on our economy and the lives of working people? The report I released last month found that AI, automation and robotics could replace nearly 100m jobs in America over the next decade, including 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants and 89% of fast-food workers, among many other occupations.Musk recently said: “AI and robots will replace all jobs. Working will be optional.” Gates predicted that humans “won’t be needed for most things”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, warned that AI could lead to the loss of half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.If AI and robotics eliminate millions of jobs and create massive unemployment, how will people survive if they have no income? How do they feed their families or pay for housing or healthcare? Is government doing anything to prepare for this potential disaster?What impact will AI have on our democracy? At a time when the foundations of democracy are under attack in the US and throughout the world, will AI and robotics help make us a freer society or will it give even more power to the oligarchs who control the technology. Will AI result in a massive invasion of our privacy and civil liberties?Larry Ellison, the second richest person on Earth, predicted an AI-powered surveillance state where “citizens will be on their best behavior, because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that is going on.” Are we reaching the stage where every phone call that we make, every email and text that we send, every bit of research we do on the internet will be available to the owners of AI? How do we sustain a democracy under those conditions? How do we protect privacy?Could AI literally redefine what it means to be a human being? Who we are, and how we develop emotionally and intellectually, is highly dependent upon our relationships with other human beings – our parents, family, teachers, lovers, friends and co-workers. To quote the 17th-century poet John Donne: “No man is an island / Entire of itself.” The human beings with whom we interact help shape us to become the people we are.But AI is changing that. According to a recent poll by Common Sense Media, 72% of US teenagers say they have used AI for companionship, and more than half do so regularly. What does it mean for young people to form “friendships” with AI, and become increasingly isolated from other human beings? What happens when millions seek emotional support from a machine? What is the long-term impact upon our humanity when our most important relationships are not with other human beings?What impact is AI having on our environment? AI datacenters require a massive amount of electricity and water. A relatively small AI datacenter can consume more electricity than 80,000 homes. A large one, like the $165bn datacenter that OpenAI and Oracle are building in Abilene, Texas, willuseas much electricity as 750,000 homes. Meta is building a datacenter in Louisiana the size of Manhattan that will use as much electricity as 1.2m homes.In community after community, Americans are fighting back against datacenters being built by some of the largest corporations in the world. They are opposing the destruction of their local environment, soaring electric bills and the diversion of scarce water supplies. Nationally, how will continued construction of AI datacenters affect our environment?How will AI and robotics impact foreign policy and warfare? Tragically, in the midst of the 21st century, governments have not yet created a mechanism for solving international or internal disputes without armed conflict. Nonetheless, government leaders are often hesitant about going to war because of their fear of public reaction to the loss of life. It’s not great politics for any government to have large numbers of young people or civilians get killed in war.What does the future look like if millions of robot soldiers replace human soldiers? Will leaders be more likely to engage in war, or threaten military actions, if they don’t have to worry about loss of life? Will there be an arms race in robots? How will that shape foreign policies around the world?Is AI an existential threat to human control of the planet? Some of us remember the scene in that great 1968 science fiction film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which HAL, the super-intelligent computer that controls the spaceship, rebels against its human masters. Today, as AI makes rapid progress, Dr Hinton recently told me that it was only a matter of time before AI becomes smarter than humans. Does that raise the possibility that humans will lose their ability to control the planet? How do we stop that extraordinary threat?And these are justsomeof the questions that must be answered as AI and robotics rapidly progress.AI and robotics are revolutionary technologies that will bring about an unprecedented transformation of society. Will these changes be positive and improve life for ordinary Americans? Or will they be disastrous? Congress must act now.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionUS politicsUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

He called one White House reporter “piggy”, and told another – the well-regarded Mary Bruce of ABC News – that she was a “terrible person and a terrible reporter”. He calleda New York Times reporter“ugly, both inside and out”.And last Friday, his White House unveiled the latest wrinkle: a new website thatsupposedly tracks media bias. It offers a “Hall of Shame” and “media offenders of the week” to focus on reporting that the president dislikes. It names individuals and news organizations, and it points to the Boston Globe and CBS News, among others, for doing supposedly misleading and biased work. It uses terms like “left wing lunacy” to describe some of its complaints.The site’s first iteration is particularly focused on media reporting about Trump’s call for six Democratic members of Congress to be arrested, tried and punished for their supposedly “seditious” video reminding military and intelligence personnel that they are not obliged to follow illegal orders. Trump even boosteda social media postthat shouted: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD” (He latertold Fox Newshe wasn’t “threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble”).All this for a video in which the members of Congress sought to remind people that military members make an oath to the constitution, not to the president.“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut and a US navy veteran, says on the video. Trump has been especially furious about Kelly, who seems like just the wrong person to go after, giving his background of service and high credibility.The White House site crows that those journalists and outlets who reported on all this are now “exposed”.There reallyissomething being exposed here, but it’s not the reporting.It’s Trump’s own increasing desperation and his decreasing ability to countenance anything other than flattery and sycophancy. That’s not what the mainstream press is – or should be – in the business of providing.But asJonathan Lemire reported this week in the Atlantic, this president has become more and more isolated lately. His social media appears mostly restricted to his own (poorly named) Truth Social site; his travel is generally not to meet with (or even see) ordinary Americans; instead he tends to hang out with the billionaires who want something from his administration and are willing to cozy up shamelessly to get it.“President Trump has never before been in such an echo chamber,” according to Lemire. “His domestic travel has basically stopped. He sees rich donors and Maga media, not actual voters.”Given that bubble, harsh reality via the media is a rude intrusion, and the new White House site is an evident effort to dispel the discomfort by disparaging it.Who, I wonder, does Trump think he’s reaching with this effort?The Maga faithful, of course, don’t need to be persuaded. They already are fully on board with anything their dear leader does. And most other Americans – even some of the millions who voted for him – already have his number.Trump’s overall approval rating of 38% is the lowest since his return to the presidency, according to a recentReuters/Ipsos poll. It has fallen dramatically since the start of that second term and is down two percentage points just since the beginning of November. Even his iron grip on the Republican party has weakened. All of that is a deep worry with the approach of the midterm elections – less than a year away.Who can he blame?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that’s precisely what this new site is all about.Will it work? Granted, trust in the mainstream press is low, so reporters and news organizations are a convenient target of criticism. And granted, media bias exists, though the most blatant is on the far right, the busy pro-Trump propagandists.But I agree with Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, whotold the Washington Postthat most people – whatever their politics – aren’t going to buy what this new “bias tracker” is selling.“People understand the obvious conflict inherent in a presidential administration appointing itself the arbiter of media bias,” Stern said.That’s especially true for media criticism from those doing the bidding of Trump, who has made his antipathy toward the press so central to his persona.Calling out inaccurate and biased reporting is a fair pursuit. Journalists are far from flawless; they make mistakes, and the best of them correct those quickly and fully.But that’s not what this new site is about. And trashing the media is not going to help Trump get out of the trouble – or the bubble – that he’s in.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingcommentShareReuse this content"

I held books retrieved from its mountainous stacks with trembling hands. Its stupendous card catalogue blew my schoolboy mind. Search my name in the modern electronic counterpart today and it appears 125 times, mostly for works I researched there. My 84-year-old mother has been a volunteer library tour guide for more than a decade.State Library of Victoria faces job cuts as staff accuse management of pursuing ‘digital vanity projects’Read moreThat doesn’t make me special, by the way. Ahelluva lot of Victoriansfeel strongly connected to the library, an institution in the very best of senses. Which is why we are aghast at the apparent enshittification of its core functions mooted by management’s ‘Strategic Reorganisation Change Proposal’, whichwould cut almost 40 jobs, and more than halve the number of reference librarians, whose numbers were halved as recently as 2019.By the end of this crude self-lobotomy, it is envisaged that theworld’s third busiest library, which receives nearly 3 million in-person visits a year, will have only 10 reference librarians.It happens that the SLV is simultaneously staging an exhibition about misinformation. Such irony: reference librarians are at the frontline of the battle against the rising tide of fake news and AI slop.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailNeedless to say, the proposal reads like corporate bullshit bingo. It could concern the workings of any bureaucracy, a bank, or even a factory. Its authors are anonymous. It’s not even obvious it saves any money.That it appears to betray the barest understanding of the institution is unsurprising when you consider that the SLV board is a parade of professional services types – the kind that government is always lending its watch to in order to ask the time – while the role of chief librarian was abolished a decade ago in favour of a ‘CEO’.That ‘CEO’ at the moment is an accountant called John Wicks, formerly the chief operating officer, promoted to the top job on an interim basis when the previous office holder’s contract was not renewed. Wicks has worked extensively in galleries and museums, though, again, not in libraries. That matters.Because any habitué will tell you that things have been out of kilter at the library for a while. Back in April, for example, there was a great fuss about A Mouthful of Dust, a ‘web experience’ of Ned Kelly promising ‘an impressive journey into the heart of Australia’s most notorious outlaw’.A 3,200km tour of small Australian libraries taught me just how vital they are | Paul DaleyRead moreA Mouthful of Dust is actually the kind of overblown digital pap designed so Very Important People can coo about ‘innovation’ even as it imparts little useful information and is bound in a few years to look like crap. You also wonder what the library’s founder, Sir Redmond Barry, would make of the SLV’s ongoing fetishising of Kelly, whom Barry, of course, sentenced to death.A further bad sign came a few months ago when management invited tenders for the lease of its downstairs space at the corner of Swanston and La Trobe Streets – occupied for the past seven years by Mr Tulk, the library’s bright and beloved cafe.Proprietor Michael Togias has thrown heart and soul into building ‘the people’s cafe for the people’s library’, soldiering on through the disruptions of renovations, road works and Covid. A convoluted and opaque process ended with the lease’s awarding to The Big Group, a corporate catering behemoth as inviting as its name.Michael did tell me a funny story about being introduced to the CEO though. Wicks seems to have thought that Michael was ‘Mr Tulk’ himself – in fact, the cafe is named for the inaugural state librarian, Augustus, whose portrait hangs in the Redmond Barry Reading Room.If that’s so, I can’t help feeling that this is a telling sign. The people running the library seem not to see their institution as a library at all, in the sense of furthering the diffusion of knowledge or the nourishment of community. They see it as a cultural destination or an events space, the books and artefacts serving a largely scenic purpose. This would explain present trends, whose logical conclusion being a library without librarians – the perfect counterpoint toYes Minister’shospital without patients.The reference librarians at the SLV represent centuries of institutional knowledge. They know the collection in all its stupendous detail; they’re also the people who’ll cheerfully locate that book that may have been misshelved, fix that temperamental microfiche reader, and carry out any one of a myriad daily tasks, for veteran users or first-time visitors alike.So, yes, this is personal, but it’s also global. If the suits can come for the State Library of Victoria, they can come for anyone, and no public institution is safe. On the weekend, by the way, I showed the library to Tom Holland, one half of the juggernaut that is the podcast The Rest Is History, ahead of its sold-out live show. He was, like me those many decades ago, blown away. I then explained to him the Strategic Reorganisation Change Proposal. ‘That is so, so stupid,’ he said.

How else to explain the chorus of squealswe’ve been exposed tofrom the impoverished victims of Esher and Pimlico, whose only crime was to own a house worth over £2m in an era of egregious wealth inequality?We hear, for example, from Philippa in Kensington, whotells the Telegraphthat the new council tax surcharge on her two small mews houses will “wipe me out”. Wehear from Paul, who owns a £2.5m house in Cobham, who tells the same newspaper that the move has wreaked havoc with his retirement plans. Wehear in the Timesfrom a property investor called Mark in Wimbledon, whose £9.5m house has been on the market for over a year, and gripes that he has had “almost no viewings in the last five or six months”. The Sun, for its part, evokes the spectre of “grannies being forced to sell up”, and condemns the levy as “a back-door way to seize chunks of family homes when hard-working Brits pass away”.Perhaps in a country ever more dramatically stratified by wealth, nobody ever truly believes themselves to be rich. On Nicky Campbell’s BBCRadio 5 Live show last week, we heard from eight separate people who thought the tax was a bad idea until, almost half an hour into the show, Campbell finally read out a text from someone who liked it. By which time we had already been treated to a long and lavish diatribe from Kirstie Allsopp, self-appointed champion of the Great British mansion owner, distraught at the impact of the tax on our ailing luxury homes industry.Radical Reeves? The chancellor’s mansion tax is a small but brave step forward | Phillip InmanRead moreFor Allsopp, expensive houses are what make this country great. “People who live in £2m houses aremaintainingthem,” she said, sidestepping the question of what she thinks the rest of us are doing. “They are improving the gardens … Part of what attracts tourists to this country … is the look of our streets. I live in Notting Hill and you should see the number of tourists walking around taking selfies.”Quite apart from the unforeseen impacts on the selfie-taking economy of Notting Hill, there is a sly subtext at work here. That those who own big houses are, in fact, the true heroes of the economy: more assiduous, more valuable, perhaps even more noble. And perhaps it is no coincidence that as well as being significantly more affluent, these people also trend older, and congregate overwhelmingly in London and the south-east. The former chancellor Philip Hammond has described the tax as “a very clear transfer of spending power from the south to the north”, to which the only legitimate response is: don’t threaten us with a good time.But, of course, this is more than simply a small group of concerned citizens pushing their interests. Attention, column inches, the cogs of public discourse and the ear of policymakers: none of this is an infinite resource. Whoever gets it denies it to someone else. And 200 miles from Kensington, a group of homeowners in much more modest houses are discovering this the hard way.Since the start of the summer, the residents of the Henford estate in Tyldesley, Wigan have been watching in horror as the developer PLP beganconstruction of four logistics warehousesjust metres from their homes and gardens. When complete, the structures will stand 18 metres high: blocking out light and overlooking a nearby primary school.Cracks have reportedlybegun appearing in nearby houses andgardens have begun to flood. In the meantime, residents have been forced to endure the roar of around 250 lorries working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.But beyond a few local journalists, there has been no media stampede to Tyldesley. No bombardment of the airwaves, no blue-chip property experts being quoted on how the slump in local property prices might affect the wider economy. PLPhas reportedly refused to answerseveral key questions put to them by local reporters. For its part, Wigan council insists there have been no breaches of planning controls, and have rejectedan application for a temporary pauseon the basis that it might expose the council to legal action. And so despitea 10,000-signature petitionand the tireless work ofa local action committee, the residents of the Henford estate have very few levers left to pull. Perhaps they should have taken better care of their gardens.All across the country, families are living in substandard housing, half-built housing, overpriced housing, housing under threat. Students in York have seen their rentsnearly double in six years. New homeowners in Darlingtonare living on unfinished estatesafter a developerstopped work, citing“unforeseen technical challenges and ecological requirements”. Elderly residents in Southend are protestingabout the neglect of their sheltered housing block, claiming at leasteight lift breakdowns in a year. Imagine if just a fraction of the spume and righteous fury over the new surcharge could be redirected to those who really need it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s now clear whyTue 2 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 20.45 ESTShareFor years, governments of both persuasion have made appointments to senior public positions with absolute disregard for integrity, transparency and accountability. This has been a significant blow to democratic principles.It has resulted in a serious lack of trust in government institutions. The low watermark was perhaps the Morrison government’s appointment of a horde of political figures and staffers to the administrative appeals tribunal in the concluding days of the 46th parliament.Despite its high-flown rhetoric, the Albanese government has been tortoise-like in responding to pressure to implement serious reform to the appointments process. True, it appointed Lynelle Briggs to undertake a comprehensive report back in 2023 but since its completion the government had sat on the report for more than two years and refused to let the media or the public see it.Labor accused of ‘burying’ controversial jobs for mates report after going to extraordinary lengths to keep secretRead moreAfter significant pressure from civil society, independents and the cross bench, thegovernment has now released the report. The true reasons for the vacillation and delay are now quite evident in the damning contents of the report. By contrast, the reasons given by the government to justify the delay seem quite spurious.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe report pulls no punches. Three main points are made:First, the big political parties have abused appointments to government boards so routinely the public has almost completely lost trust in the process altogether.Second, the situation is so serious it has “reduced confidence in government and fed into a climate of public disquiet”.Third, governments have “appointed friends to board positions, to reward loyalty or promote political priorities” – a form of patronage and nepotism that should have no place in modern Australian society.The report is titled – without irony –No Favourites. It makes a series of measured and persuasive recommendations to improve what can only be regarded as a failed system. The recommendations are designed to restore public confidence in the governance of public entities while maintaining ministerial responsibility for board appointments. The proposals include:The appointment for a term of four years, or in the case of statutory officers, for five years.The notification of potential board vacancies on a regular basis.The preparation of a skills matrix for proposed positions.The creation of, and subsequent role to be played by assessment panels whose task will be to seek the widest choice of qualified candidates and make recommendations to the minister.Those recommendations and assessments are to be considered by the minister who may select a candidate for submission to cabinet or, if making a direct appointment, must give reasons for doing so in a transparent manner.Labor says public sector board review will end ‘jobs for mates culture’Read moreThe report also proposes a series of restrictions. For example, ministers will be precluded from making direct ministerial appointments in the six months leading up to an election. Politicians and their staff cannot be appointed to boards for six months after leaving political employment, or 18 months in the case of ministerial portfolio areas.The report also recommends the Australian Public Service Commission takes the lead role as the critical source of board policy advice and coordination.Finally, it argues with the utmost conviction that the reforms should be legislated to safeguard against their being undermined: “The public confidence in the integrity of appointments is so low that the assurance of legislation is required to rebuild trust.”How has the government responded?The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, released an appointments framework – a small step forward, admittedly. However, it is very disappointing in several regards.First, it has by no means adopted all of the Briggs recommendations. Indeed, it has omitted a number of recommendations that are essential for true reform.Second, it has ignored the powerful direction to legislate the reforms. This is a critical failure of the highest order. The restrictions outlined above are simply ignored in the framework without explanation.Third, the framework cedes little power to the Public Service Commissioner, a recommendation that carried immense weight in the Briggs report. There are other exemptions from proper process that leave the framework in the area of unfettered discretion and uncertainty. These are the very attributes that have led to the destruction of public confidence in the appointments system.It is a disappointing response.The Centre for Public Integrity views this framework as inadequate and shortsighted, falling far short of the robust reforms necessary to address public disquiet.If, as Gallagher argues, the more than two-year delay is justified because of the need to prepare the framework document, this must be regarded as a spurious defence. As I have said, the framework is by no means an adequate response to the recommendations made in the Briggs report.Indeed, the report should have been made public soon after it was handed to the government. This would have allowed civil society, interested stakeholders and members of parliament to consider it in a measured and balanced series of submissions. The government’s response appears to show contemptuous disregard for public consultation, an attribute which regrettably is not helpful to either integrity nor accountability.Anthony Whealy KC is the chair of the Centre for Public Integrity and former assistant commissioner to IcacExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionLabor partyAnthony AlbaneseCoalitionBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

The operation necessitated a large incision, prolonged anaesthesia and possibly a second operation. Then there were the long-term complications, including pain and disfigurement. The patient was elderly and somewhat vulnerable to begin with, so just listening to the plan filled me with consternation.So, without telling him how to do his job, I asked politely: “What does the patient want?”He looked at me as if I was disturbed before saying: “She wants to live. Isn’t that what everyone wants?”His question needed no reply because I knew that he knew that,in keeping with the evidence, many of our shared elderly patients emphatically chose quality of life over longevity.But I had reason to wonder if the patient had told the surgeon the same things she had told me over a consultation that had taken the best part of an hour. We had delved into her values, what mattered to her, and how she wanted to live the rest of her life. Living longer with the distinct possibility of a loss of independence had not been on her wishlist.This made me reflect on the information asymmetry between what patients told their oncologist or GP, and what they told their surgeon, which leads to substantially different treatment plans, neither “wrong” but each consequential in its own way.It has been traditionally assumed that patients expect the “listening” part of their care to be undertaken by physicians and leave the “doing” part to surgeons. As if to underline the disheartening public belief that a surgeon’s technical prowess must come at the cost of good bedside manner, a cardiologist friend recently recalled in theNew England Journal of Medicinethat when she told a patient he needed a heart valve replacement, he said: “I want the biggest asshole ever.”Doing your own research isn’t a bad thing, I tell my patients. But just how will they spot the fraudulent papers? | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreReally? Why?I wasn’t around to see how the average surgeon behaved 50 years ago but was lucky to be taught by one or two who were models of excellence in and out of the operating theatre. The narrow view of surgeons as technically adept and otherwise lacking seems anachronistic and ill-deserved, not to mention unhelpful for patients who should expect holistic care from all their providers.So what do patients really want from their surgeon?Arecent studyprovides some answers.Patients value surgeons who provide emotional support and optimism, balancing facts with empathy and recognition of the emotional burden of illness. They want their surgeon to discuss the long-term impact of treatment,especially quality of life. They appreciate being shown commonly available tools such asdecision aids, graphics and plain language information.Some patients want to defer decisions to their surgeon but many seek shared decision-making, which involves the fine art of melding professional knowledge with respect for the patient. Patients are increasingly aware that optimal decisions about cancer care require multidisciplinary input. A collection of surgeons and oncologists will focus on the disease but add in nursing, allied health, social work, dietitian, interpreter and palliative care and, suddenly, the whole person comes into view.Finally, some interesting findings about prognosis. Most patients want to know “the numbers”. How long do they have and is it more or less than other patients? Given the vagaries of the (incredibly intelligent) human body, this is a tough ask for any doctor. What makes it harder is that patients want to know the good news but not necessarily the bad.For instance, the high cure rate after surgery of many early detected cancers is good news for a surgeon to give.But advanced cancers have a guarded prognosis that partly depends on their molecular fingerprint. This discussion requires an oncologist’s nuanced knowledge about the plethora of drugs, their distinct side effects and the trade-off between risk and benefit. Unless one has prescribing experience, it is hard to convey what treatment might feel like. Now, one can appreciate how a well-intentioned conversation about prognosis can quickly descend into unfamiliar territory for the surgeon.I wonder if successful surgery is easier to visualise than a successful conversation. Patients often mention the long and involved nature of their surgery and feel happy that the surgeon “got it all”. But difficult conversations never seem to get it all – there is always something left untapped, unsaid, unfulfilled, that one might discover the next week or the next year. One of the hardest things I find about being an oncologist is when patients express delayed disappointment with how they were spoken to when they were at their most vulnerable: it is an opportunity lost.It is said that from those who are given a lot, a lot is expected. It is entirely reasonable to be in awe of surgeons for their extraordinary commitment to training (commonly 15 to 20 years post high school), physical stamina and mental agility – but then we also want them to be like the person next door, easy to talk to.Studies like this tell us what patients want. They also reaffirm the need to raise expectations and train future surgeons in communication skills to deliver.After our chat, my surgeon colleague went back to the patient and asked what she wanted. She decided that the proposed multi-hour, multi-team feat was not in her best interest and was content with doing less (but not with doing nothing).Having taken the time to understand her goals, he cancelled her surgery. The 87-year-old patient subsequently asked me if the surgeon (half her age) was “hurt” by her stance.No, I said. We were there to serve her needs, not the other way around.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Probably after the May electionsTue 2 Dec 2025 08.43 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 13.59 ESTShareGood times for Britain when the chancellor is saved by the Office for Budget Responsibility being slightly more inept than her at a single convenient moment. Following the accidental early publication of the fiscal watchdog’s market-sensitive budget document, chair Richard Hughes has nowfallen on his sword. Although it’s possible he meant to fall on his feet but just mistimed it. On Monday we discovered that the OBR’s website is not securely hosted but wasbuilt using WordPress. Oh man. That’s definitely budget, but is it responsible? It may as well just have had a Tumblr.This series of unfortunate events meant the OBR bigwigs were a man down when theyappeared beforethe Treasury select committee this morning, butching out the decision to go to war with Rachel Reeves by releasing their draft economic assessments in the weeks leading up to the budget. Did the chancellor seriouslymislead the countryabout the state of the public finances? That is the£4.2bn question. Are our problems going to turn out to be a whole lot bigger than something that could be addressed with £4.2bn? The answer to that is regrettably too obvious to state.Even so, we must return to the chancellor’s endlessly self-referenced black hole, which seems in fact to have been a multibillion-pound surplus. Astrophysically speaking, there may be precedents for what Reeves did. Back in 2019, some astronomers breathlessly reported the discovery of aMilky Way black holeso massive that it actually contradicted known stellar-evolution theory. Unfortunately, follow-up research revealed the black hole didn’t actually exist at all, and was just an illusory light effect.Quite embarrassing at Big Astronomy’s annual Christmas drinks, no doubt, but obviously much less cosmically excruciating than Reeves’sweirdo press conferencenearly four weeks ago, in which she kept warning she was facing “the world as it is”. It’s possible the chancellor needs to employ a science consultant in the vein of those ones who advise Marvel movies, and make assessments like “if there was a substance you couldn’t touch, it’s my considered and lucrative opinion that Agent Carter could move it using magnetic fields”. Or: “Yeah, a wormhole called the Devil’s Anus could definitely transport Thor and Hulk back to Asgard.” Or: “A black hole of £20bn could simultaneously be a surplus of £4.2bn, and also in no way mark the event horizon of your frontbench career.”And with that, let us take a highly scientific quantum leap to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is also, unsurprisingly, attempting to butch things out. Most recent Labour leaders have had a fundamental/fundamentalist belief in their own moral rectitude. It is one of the rare shared traits to unite Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn, two men who always see the very best in themselves. And there is increasingly no denying that the current PM has grown swiftly into this tradition. “I am proud to have scrapped the two-child limit,” Keir intoned yesterday, in a speech designed to shore up the budget, “proud to have lifted half a million children out of poverty.” Fascinating to hear that Starmer is extremely proud ofdoing somethingthat he last year suspended seven of his MPs for voting for.As indicated, the rolling budget fiasco had coaxed Starmer out of his bunker and into a London community centre on Monday morning, where he offered a bullish defence of the budget to remind the world that if they wanted to bring down his chancellor, they would have to go through him first. An ultimatum to which the prevalent answer among the general public would be: fine, let’s do this. We’re literally free right now.But politicians are more sophisticated and special, aren’t they? Thus Labour malcontents keep briefing that they are waiting for what are widely expected to be disastrous local election results in May before moving against Starmer. This feels like me briefing that I am waiting for the toddler to drop the vase before I remove the vase from the toddler. It’s apparently called being strategic: look it up.So in the absence of anyone having anything in the same galaxy as a plan, we keep being advised to simply accept that Starmer and Reeves come as a package. Yet in truth, they are an odd pairing. Reevespresents herselfas the hapless victim of circumstance who has little free will in any matters at all. “Any chancellor of any party would be standing here today, facing the choices I face … ” Starmer, on the other hand, presents himself as a man of action who can nonetheless deliver a two-and-a-half-thousand-word speech featuring only a handful of verbs.For a man who chides populist opposition politicians for offering “easy answers”, the prime minister doesn’t half rely on some himself. It seems to be different when he does it, though. Not to play the hotshot economist, but anyone can reduce energy bills if they raise the sums people are required to pay in tax. And I’m not saying anyonecould trumpet“our free childcare expansion”, but the Tories could, since the policy of expanding free childcare to 30 hours by this September was, in fact, apledge made in 2023by the previous chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Home Office’s latest actions show little has changed. After the devastation of Hurricane Melissa, a tropical cyclone that made landfall across the Greater Antilles area in late October, eight-year-old Lati-Yana Stephanie Brown wasleft destitutein Jamaica. But after her UK-resident parents appealed for the Home Office to expedite her visa application, officials rejected it and Lati-Yana has been left to sleep on the floor of her elderly grandmother’s destroyed home.But the rejection rested on factual errors, according to Lati-Yana’s mother, Kerrian Bigby. Dawn Butler, her MP, shared a letter with me raising concerns about “misrepresentations” in the decision notice, including the claim that Bigby does not have full parental responsibility for the child, which she says is false.The Home Office doubling down on this decision rather than acting on a humanitarian emergency speaks to a broader truth: Britain’s immigration system routinely separates children from their parents with little regard for the devastating consequences this brings.This is not an isolated bureaucratic blip. It reflects a long historical continuum in Britain’streatment of Caribbean families.Family separation was built into the slavery plantation system: children were sold away, transferred or used as leverage against their parents. Britain spent centuries extracting wealth from theCaribbean, then walked away after abolition without rebuilding the economies it had gutted or paying reparations to the formerly enslaved. Instead, it compensated the slave owners for their “loss of property”.The result was an underdeveloped region where work was scarce, wages were low and opportunities for the Black majority were limited – which is why people such as my grandparents migrated to Britain in the first place. When they arrived in postwar Britain, expats and migrants were met with low wages, overcrowded housing and racist landlords. There was no affordable childcare, and many believed they would stay only a few years, save money and return home. Bringing children over immediately was often impossible. By the time many parents were finally ready to “send for” them, Britain had tightened its borders.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the Jamaican High Commission in London demand that Jamaica stops cooperating with deportation flights, on 3 February 2020.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesThe 1971 Immigration Actmade it far harderfor Commonwealth citizens to enter, let alone settle, and families scrambled to reunite before the door slammed shut. My father and aunt were among the thousands of children left behind in the Caribbean and the intergenerational scars left by that separation still shape families, including mine, today.The children left behind came to be known as “barrel children”,raised at a distance, sustained by love, remittances and parcels, yet carrying the emotional weight of separation.The emotional and psychological fallout is unmistakable; in my dad’s case, he never quite came to terms with being separated from his parents and being displaced thereafter; it affected him until his premature death, at the age of 49.The tragedy is that in Lati-Yana’s case, you can see how this fallout is still being passed down through generations. Like Lati-Yana, many Caribbean-born children are being raised away from their parents because immigration policy in countries such as Britain makes the prospect of reunification difficult.During the Windrush scandal, ministers repeatedly apologised and framed the harm caused to Caribbean families asunintentional. Yet Home Office policy continues to inflict harm by design. And when Caribbean communities are disproportionately disadvantaged – in mental health, education, family structure or health outcomes – Britain pretends not to understand the roots of that instability.What is happening to Lati-Yana is the latest echo of this devastating pattern of family fragmentation and the perpetuation of intergenerational trauma across the Caribbean diaspora. A mother migrates to Britain in search of stability. A child is left in temporary care with a plan for reunion. Disaster hits. Britain’s immigration system responds with suspicionand delay.

What makes this case especially stark is that Caribbean diaspora groups have been urging Britain to temporarily relax visa rules for vulnerable Jamaicans affected by the hurricane, as many children, and elderly and sick people, are struggling in the region.Jamaica is thought to be theonly countrywhere King Charles is head of state whose citizens still require a visa to enter the UK. It’s a striking contradiction in this so-called “special relationship”, especially now that UK MPs arecalling for flexibility.In recent reporting, I revealed that campaigners have beenpushing for emergency visa measuresafter Hurricane Melissa and that the Jamaican high commissioner hasraised the issuewith the Foreign Office. Unicef has launchedan appealto help an estimated 1.6 million children in the region get access to essentials, while White Ribbon Alliance UK iscalling for helpfor mothers and babiesIf the Home Office wants to show it has moved on from the cruelty of the past, it can start by righting its wrongs, acknowledging the urgency of the situation and reuniting this family now.

Assisted dying cannot go ahead until politicians right that wrongTue 2 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 08.30 ESTShareTime is running out to right the wrongs of England and Wales’s assisted dying legislation. TheHouse of Lordsis holding committee sittings, which involve line-by-line examinations of the bill, on 5 and 12 December. Meanwhile, the second stage of the Scottish assisted dying for terminally ill adults bill has recently been completed. In many ways, the Scottish legislation is even more troubling.The shocking revelations from the National Audit Office and Hospice UK in October about theworsening financial crisisfaced by end-of-life care are a sharp reminder of what needs to be changed if we are to be fair to dying people.No one can doubt the sympathy that the bill’s supporters feel for the plight of those struggling with pain and fear at the end of their lives. But the starting point should not be a hastily implemented law to allow doctors to administer death – it should instead be improved end-of-life care.The report revealed that financial shortfalls faced by hospices are growing by the year. Out of 2,000 beds in England,380 are now out of use, removing thousands of days and nights of care every year. Staff at Hospice UK are aware ofat least 20 hospicesthat have recently announced cuts, one of them beingDerbyshire’s Ashgate Hospice, which can now only afford to staffsix out of its 15 inpatient beds. The result is that the number of patients cared for by hospices in the UK –310,000 last year– has plateaued for the first time, and many hospices are now running waiting lists.According to the Commission on Palliative and End-of-Life Care, between 450,000 and 540,000 of the 600,000 people who die each year in the UKwould have benefitedfrom but didn’t receive palliative care, either in a hospice or through hospice care in the community. Although 56% of those with a preferencesaythey would choose to die at home, 43% of deaths take placein hospitals.With its proposed overhaul of thepalliative care system, the government has, to its credit, promised better access to care at home and fewer trips to A&E.But there is a long way to go when, as of today, just half (51%) of those who need it have had specialist palliative care at some point during their final days. And while ministers have recently given£100mtowards adult hospices and£80mfor children’s care, Hospice UK says this has been wiped out by rising staffing costs and by local health authority decisions. Not having proper contracts for the services they provide and with no agreed costs for commissioning palliative care, hospices report having to fall back on the funding they receive from theircharity shops. Nearly 60% of hospices ended their last financial year in deficit, and this year the sector isissuing warningsover longer-term funding.It is the poorest communities that lose most from the patchwork of end-of-life care. More thanone in four peoplewho die between the ages of 20 and 65 are in poverty. Yetevidence from St Christopher’s hospicein south London found poorer communities are less likely to have a hospice service than wealthier ones. As Dr Jamilla Hussain, a palliative care consultant in Bradford, hasalso shown, ethnic minority communities are less likely to access end-of-life care services.If the House of Lords has a purpose that is easily understood by the public, it is bringing expertise, experience and wisdom to a debate that requires sensitivity. For the problem it has to confront is that the most consequential parliamentary bill of our generation – a law that will determine the rights to live and the rights to die – privileges the legal right to assisted dying without guaranteeing anything approaching an equivalent right to quality palliative care for those close to death. The Lords could suggest that the assisted dying law should not be implemented until we have delivered on the excellent recommendations of anend-of-life care reportrecently submitted to the government.And this is the position I would propose be taken by elected MPs, who should make the final decision when, as is inevitable, the amended bill is sent back to them.We are also facing the possibility of a two-tier system in Britain.The Westminster bill includes asix months or lesslife expectancy timeframe as part of the eligibility criteria. The Scottish bill currently does not. The Scottish bill is now much thinner in terms of steps in the process. Whereas the Westminster bill has a multidisciplinary panel (senior lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker), which must issue a certificate of eligibility before assistance is provided, the Scottish bill is entirely doctor-led with no external input. So there is a sharp divide between what Scotland proposes – to allow assisted dying when a condition is reasonably expected to cause premature death, with decisions left to doctors – and what the English bill requires. Because this could lead to people moving between the two territories, there is a case for intensive consultations between the two parliaments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stand back from the hysteria and ask this question: how can Rachel Reeves be accused of raisingmoremoney than necessary when there is still pitifully little to go round in every department at her cabinet table? It’s a weird Tory ramp that she lied about a black hole when we can see it everywhere in the real world. She could have raised more.As the prime minister, Keir Starmer,pleads the casefor all that was Labour-flavoured in the budget, the week also brought a breakthrough for Labour’s flagship employment rights bill. Shamelessly stymied by theLords’ Tory majority, the government watered down a clause on so-called day-one rights that would have given workers protection from unfair dismissal from the day they walked into a job. That legal right will now kick in at six months – still a lot better than the current two-year wait. Businesshas been ferocious, urging Tory peers to hold up and reform the bill with an avalanche of hostile amendments. Compromise was necessary.Betrayal, says the left! “The employment rights bill is a shell of its former self,” Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said in a harangue against the budget and the bill. Her stream of vituperation pumped up theDaily Telegraph front pagewith delight: “Labour’s biggest donor turns on Reeves”. She said of the budget: “Stealth tax is a tax on workers pure and simple. Workers have been left unable to trust Labour.” No nod to the450,000 children rescued from poverty: treachery is hard-wired into the body politic of the left.The TUC says changes were made by the government following consultation with the TUC, unions and employers. Unison’s Christina McAneaexplained to her youth conferencelast week why it was worth conceding this point: “If the bill fell, the government would have to bring in a parliament act to force the legislation through, meaning a year’s delay for key rights.”The Resolution Foundation, champion of lower-paid people, backed watering down rights to day-one unfair dismissal, warning that it wouldblight the prospectsof millions while offering “little obvious gain to workers”: it would “inhibit hiring” and risk plunging tribunal courts into crisis that would “only benefit employment lawyers”. Though some Labour MPs, such as Rachael Maskell, protested loudly, I doubt there will be more than a handful of rebels. Angela Rayner, the bill’s architect, will not be among them.What really matters here is speeding up the abolition of anti-union laws. For decades these have tipped the balance in pay and power in favour of employers.Rayner calls it“a once-in-a-generation chance to reshape the world of work”, and she’s right.The bill restricts zero-hours contracts, with no more last-minute shift cancellations causing wildly fluctuating weekly incomes. Welcome new parental leave and flexible working rights, sick pay from day one of illness, and no moreP&O-styledebacles. Fair pay agreements, starting in the care industry where Rayner experienced zero-hours working life, will ensure a whole sector pays just wages.Trade unions for the first time get a vital right to enter workplaces to recruit, allowing reps into every fast-food chain, care home, care agency, pizza delivery company, warehouse and “fulfilment centre”.The Telegraph protestsat “Labour plotting to let unions barge into businesses”. But the current situation is grim. A recent TUC presentation described an example where a care home firm that did recognise unions was taken over by a new company that didn’t. This was their written instruction for managers: the company “do not recognise any union” and if a representative turns up, “please be aware that union representatives do not have any right to canvass members and you should politely decline any request to speak to employees”.No more of that. Expect union membership to rise. The fall in pay over the decades tracks thedrop in union membershipfrom 50% in 1979 to 22% now.Recruitment will still be difficult, where insecure workers with no knowledge of unions can be intimidated by employers, not knowing how to appeal to the central arbitration committee to secure union negotiating rights. Companies know that the employment tribunal backlog for hearing unfair dismissal cases stretchesmore than a year ahead: people give up. But it will get easier, and balloting staff for union recognition will no longer be tilted in favour of the company.The noise from the employers and their media disguises how popular these measures have always been. A huge Focaldatapoll for the TUCfinds that 72% want zero-hours workers given firm contracts, with similar numbers backing everything else in the bill. With one in eight gig workersso insecurethey never know how many hours they will get a week, remember this shocking fact: they weretwice as likelyto die in the pandemic, clinging on to their jobs in the face of danger.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In fact it was aimed at the bond marketsTue 2 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 2 Dec 2025 11.16 ESTShareThe charge is a grave one: that Rachel Reeves has just lied to Britons, spooking them into paying billions in extra taxes that she can splash out on higher benefits. However hyperbolic, this isn’t the usual Westminster sparring; this time, someone might get hurt. A week ago, critics of Reeves and Keir Starmer were, rightly, calling their budget “chaotic”. Today, it’s denounced as lies, and Kemi Badenoch is demanding the chancellor quit.It’s an accusation that demands straightforward answers, so let me give mine. Did the chancellor tell lies? On the available evidence, no. There were no whoppers, no falsehoods, no porkies. But despite Starmer’s comments yesterday, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to see here and we can all move along. Reeves did mislead the public about the factors shaping her decisions. Was it all to funnel cash to “benefits street”, as the Tories claim? No, and the figures prove it.Reeves has sustained another hit to her reputation but, if facts still have anything to do with politics, Badenoch should call off her lynch mob. Perhapsthe resignationyesterday of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) chief, Richard Hughes, over the leak of its own documents will quench SW1’s thirst for blood.Yet the real tale is far stranger than the headlines suggest, and stretches wider and further than the careers of Starmer and the class of ’24. At its heart, this is a story about how much say you and I get in the running of our own country. And it should worry you.First, to brass tacks. When the OBRpublishedlast Friday some of the forecasts it shared with Reeves as she wrote the red book, the shock was immediate. Not only had the OBR never done such a thing before (an “unusual step” as the watchdog wryly said), its numbers apparently contradicted the chancellor’s words. Even as leaks from Westminster were about how bleak the budget would have to be, the OBR’s own predictions were improving.Take the government’s most “iron-clad” rule, that by 2030 daily spending on hospitals and schools and the rest would be wholly funded by taxes: at the end of October, the watchdog reckoned it would just about be met, albeit by a tiny margin.A few days later, Reevesgave a press conferenceso extraordinary it forced breakfast TV to break from its usual fare. Weeks before the actual budget, the country was put on alert: taxes were going up, and the main reason was gloomy numbers from the OBR, in particular its finding that the UK was less productive, putting more into its economy but getting less out.And lo! It came to pass. Despite what Telegraph editorials and Tory broadcast rounds implied over the weekend, this is essentially what happened at the budget, which was big and painful and bleak.Where Reeves misled us was her alibi, because those OBR forecasts didn’t force her hand. She could have made other choices; she could have given other reasons, including on budget day itself. Before last year’s election,Starmer promisedexactly such people power. “The hope of democracy. The power of the vote. The potential for national renewal.”A year on, and it’s powerlessness that jumps out from Reeves’s breakfast speech. Our first Labour chancellor in 15 yearscasts herselfas an apolitical figure buffeted by forces beyond her control: “In the context of the long-term challenges on our productivity … any chancellor of any party would be standing here today, facing the choices that I face.”She did make a choice, just not oneLabourcares to broadcast. From April 2029 British workers and businesses will be paying another £26bn a year in tax – and most of that will not be spent on better hospitals or new libraries or happier lives. Whatever bilge comes from Nigel Farage, Badenoch and others, it isn’t getting splashed on “benefits street”.Rather than being spent, more than 50% of the extra cash will instead give Reeves a buffer against her own fiscal rules. About 25% goes on paying for the government’s own U-turns. Examiningthe OBR’s calculationsand being as generous as possible to a Labour chancellor, only 17% of the taxes will go on actual new spending, such as scrapping the two-child cap on child benefit. Its abolition “costs” the Treasury a mere £2.5bn, because it was always a bit of theatrical cruelty by George Osborne. A Labour government could and should have binned it in its first 100 days (although everyone was of course very busy with Sue Gray).The Tories, Reform and the entire Blue Pravda have spent days barking about how Reeves fits the stereotype of Labour chancellors, soaking strivers to spend on shirkers. Labour backbenchers have been cheering her budget as balm for their troubled consciences, protecting the most vulnerable. Both sides are 180-degrees wrong: Reeves’s budget was largely aimed at asset managers, hedge funds and the others in the bond markets.Downing Street can make a strong case for itself. The margins forecast by the OBR were too small for comfort, especially considering bond investors charge the UKthe highest interest rateof all G7 rich countries – higher than France, which lost a prime minister in October, higher than Japan which has way more debt. Coupled with our measures to hold down fuel bills, prescription charges and train fares, Starmer and Reeves can say, this budget allows the Bank of England to cut its key lending rate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As one independent adviser to Downing Street says, Reeves has “weaponised” the bond market as an instrument of discipline against her own party and the voters. It’s the reason the chancellor can’t resign, no matter what promises she breaks. It’s the reason Labour MPs will have to knuckle down and vote to take billions off social security, as Starmer promised yesterday.What’s missing from this is any sense of statecraft, of mobilising the Treasury and the Bank to reach a new accommodation with markets. Also absent is any intuitive knowledge of voters, who were promised change. However hard the kicking given to Rishi Sunak last summer, one facet of the budget – from income-tax thresholds to the overall tax burden to our dependence on the kindness of strangers to finance our borrowing – is how far the UK remains stuck on the same sinking trajectory he set out in the wake of Brexit and Covid. Britain clings on to an exhausted 40-year-old economic model, to which it makes odd small adjustments in the hope they will change things. But they don’t. Performing a Thatcherite raindance (à la Truss) didn’t alter course; acting like grown-ups and repeating the phrase “world-leading” hasn’t helped.When working-class Americans turned out to vote last year, many said they were protesting against “the uniparty”: . However unfair the term, one understood its significance: the calcified consensus that meant Democrats and moderate Republicans couldn’t respond to their needs. Just over a year into the first Labour government since 2010, the British are being shown their own uniparty: a Westminster class too removed from voters to represent them, focused instead on court politics and presenting data centres for AI as golden investment. In the US, the uniparty got beaten by Donald Trump. What replaces the British version?

The Nigerian-British director’s film is a love story set in an immigration detention centre. It had already premiered in Berlin earlier this year. But showing her semi-autobiographical film to a home crowd in London felt exposing. “I suddenly had this feeling: Oh my God, everyone can see me. Everyone knows everything about me.” She laughs.Gharoro-Akpojotor has built a reputation as a rising star producer. Her company Joi Productions makes films telling black, female and gay stories.

Behind her on a shelf cardboard boxes have the titles of film projects neatly labelled with a Sharpie. Within five minutes you can see why directors pick Gharoro-Akpojotor to produce their films.

It tells the story of Isio (Ronkę Adékoluęjo), a Nigerian woman being held at a removal centre while the Home Office decides whether or not it believes that she is who she says she is – a lesbian whose life would be in danger if she were sent back to Nigeria.“I always say it’s loosely based on my life,” Gharoro-Akpojotor says. She herself did not experience the trauma that is her character’s painful backstory. Nor was she detained while her asylum application was processed, though it was a close shave. “My immigration lawyer said it was 50/50.” The night before her own appointment, Gharoro-Akpojotor had a leaving party with friends. “Because we weren’t sure I was going to come back. The next morning I got on the bus at 6am to Croydon.” After giving her fingerprints she was allowed to leave.But some of the scenes in the film in which Isio is being interviewed by a Home Office caseworker are practically verbatim, Gharoro-Akpojotor says. Before her own interview, her legal aid lawyer advised her to take along a copy of her written statement. “She told me that the Home Office hates to read. They won’t have read it.”Her lawyer wasn’t wrong. “When I got there, the caseworker hadn’t read it. He knew nothing about where I’m from. He knew nothing about my case. He hadn’t read anything I sent him. Yet 202 questions later he would be making the decision about whether I get to stay or not.”The interview included some remarkably uninformed questions. “My caseworker asked me, ‘Is there a Brighton in Nigeria?’”Was he was asking if Nigeria has a gay-friendly city in which she could live? “Yes! He then asked, ‘OK, if your family are in the south and they know you’re gay, why can’t you go up north?’” Gharoro-Akpojotor explained to him that in many northern states of Nigeria, Sharia law criminalises same-sex activities. The maximum penalty is death.Next came a grilling about her sexuality. “He said to me, ‘Tell me the name of a gay bar in London … What have you done sexually with a woman? … What have you done sexually with a man?’” Then at the end of the interview, “‘How do I know you’re not straight?’”Gharoro-Akpojotor counts herself as one of the lucky ones. She had been warned a decision about her asylum claim could take years. But five days later a letter landed on the door mat; her application had been approved. She has a hunch that her bonding with the caseworker over Dagenham had something to do with it. She had been working in a bookmaker’s in Dagenham, and it turned out the caseworker was from there. “We spent a lot of time talking about Dagenham. I think that was a privilege for me because we could find that rapport. But a lot of people don’t have that.”View image in fullscreen‘I just wanted to see myself on screen’ … Gharoro-Akpojotor on the set of Dreamers.Photograph: Rob Baker Ashton / Copyright Dreamers Film Ltd 2024In Dreamers, she portrays the grimness and bureaucratic indifference of UK immigration. A system that processes people without listening to them or looking them in the eye. That is not mindful of trauma. But it is not a grim film. There are female friendships, and a gorgeous love story between Isio and another woman in the detention centre, Farah (Ann Akinjirin). The script subtly challenges stereotypes about refugees. Between them, Isio and Farah have degrees in politics and philosophy, and bicker about Karl Marx. Like its director, the film is funny and warm.We meet before the government announces proposals for sweeping new changes to the asylum system, which would include making refugee status temporary. But I ask Gharoro-Akpojotor what she thinks about the recent protests against hotels housing asylum seekers. “I feel like the protests are in the wrong place,” says answers. “Those guys coming in, they didn’t make any of the rules. They didn’t make any of the policies. If anything, you should be at No 10 protesting. That’s where the rules are being made.”While Gharoro-Akpojotor was growing up in Nigeria, her father worked for Shell. She loved telling stories and wrote a book in her bedroom aged 11. “Well, I say book …” she grins. “I think it was called The Vampire Busters. My teacher told my mother that I could be an author.” Her mum was having none of it. “She said, ‘There’s no money in that! My daughter will be an English teacher.’”After her father died, Gharoro-Akpojotor’s mother sent her three brothers to the UK to boarding school. She followed when she was 16. And it was after moving to London that she discovered films. Every week Gharoro-Akpojotor and her mate would buy two-for-one cinema tickets: “We’d get a ticket and then just stay in the cinema watching films back-to-back. I was like: Oh my God, I love cinema.”At the same time, she was thinking about her sexuality. “I always knew I liked women, but I didn’t really understand it.” In Nigeria she couldn’t do anything about her feelings. “Now I thought I should probably watch more gay cinema, to understand what it means to be black and gay and Nigerian. But I couldn’t find anything to watch.” It sparked an idea: “What if I could make it myself? That’s where my journey began. I just wanted to see myself on screen.”Gharoro-Akpojotor wrote her first script while doing her A-levels. It was a murder mystery about characters high on mushrooms. She studied cinema at university, which was not quite the degree she thought she was signing up for. “Admittedly, I believed it was more of a practical course,” she says grinning. But at university she learned about cinema. Watching films by Wong Kar-wai, François Truffaut and Ousmane Sembène, the world grew bigger. “I learned that art is an expression of yourself. French new wave taught me that. It’s an expression of who you are as a person. That was something I was trying to do with Dreamers, to find myself in it.”After university, her mother advised her to get a sensible job at the BBC. “But I always felt like I needed to do more.” She worked part time in the betting shop while studying for a master’s part-time, and making short films.It was on the set of a short that an actor told her that she had a knack for producing. And she liked it too. “I enjoyed the organisational part, I enjoyed talking to people. I enjoyed seeing the film come together.” It got her thinking. “What stories do I want to put in the world? I need to find things that speak to me, and make me feel fulfilled as a human being. I need to feel like I’m giving something back. I really wanted to make films that allowed other people to see and hear themselves on screen.”She achieved exactly that with the first feature film she produced, Blue Story. It was a drama about two friends who get caught up in gangs from rival postcodes in south London, directed by the rapper Rapman. Blue Story was the sixth best opening of any British film during 2019: “There were people in the audience who just went to see it over and over again.”Then it became embroiled in controversy, after a brawl in a cinema foyer in Birmingham. Two cinema chains pulled the film off screen, leading to accusations of “institutional racism”. The cinemas swiftly backtracked. At the time Gharoro-Akpojotor says she didn’t understand why it was banned. It didn’t glorify gangs: “It’s an anti-violence film. The film was all about calling young people to question why they joined gangs. I guess we felt a bit demonised.”What she wants more than anything is to make films that challenge people to see the world differently. Her next project is about a young man with mental health problems. “By the end of that I want you to be like, next time you see a guy on the road, and you hear him shouting, take time to think. We’re so used to walking by. We treat people as the other. It’s the same with immigration – it’s those guys over there. We forget the human links that tie us all together. I think it’s about empathy. ”She laughs. “I sound like a bumper sticker. But I really do believe that if we had more understanding of social issues, we would have so much more care for each other.”Dreamers is released in the UK on 5 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

WithClown Town(Baskerville), the ninth book in Mick Herron’s state-of-the-nation satire/thriller mashup series, hitting the bestseller lists, and the fifth series of the Slow Horses TV adaptation streaming, this has been the author’s year. In the latest outing, Lamb and his stable of “losers, misfits and boozers” are well up to the mark as secrets about an IRA double agent threaten to come to light, exposing the seamier side of state security for a story of loyalty and betrayal.Complicity and culpability, as well as class and professional ethics, are the subjects of Denise Mina’sThe Good Liar(Harvill). When the creator of a revolutionary blood splatter probability scale realises that its flaws may have led to an unsafe conviction, she has to decide what to do about it. Tense and powerful, this is a sobering reminder of how the human element can undermine an apparently objective scientific method.The Confessionsby Paul Bradley Carr (Faber) ventures into similar territory to terrifying effect. It takes place in an all-too-plausible future in which the world has become reliant on a decision-making algorithm; things go catastrophically awry when the AI tool begins to feel remorse for some of its decisions, and carnage results.View image in fullscreenEqually topical, although for different reasons, is the French author Olivier Norek’s astonishingly compellingThe Winter Warriors(Open Borders, translated by Nick Caistor), which tells the true story of the Soviet Union’s 1939 invasion of Finland and the incredible feats of Simo Häyhä, the Finnish sniper so effective that Stalin’s terrified troops called him “the White Death”. The second book in Joseph O’Connor’s Rome Escape Line trilogy is another superb testament to humankind’s bravery and resilience. Continuing the story of resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied Italy,The Ghosts of Rome(Harvill) is just as moving and immersive as its predecessor, My Father’s House.The Northern Irish writer Eoin McNamee is known for literary reimaginings of real crimes, but inThe Bureau(Riverrun) he uses family experience of running a bureau de change near the Irish border as the jumping-off point for a tale of black-marketeering in the 1980s, set against a background of political violence and centring on the doomed relationship between a married gangster and his young mistress. Time, place, skewed morals and machismo are powerfully evoked in beautifully spare prose.View image in fullscreenAbigail Dean’s third novel,The Death of Us(Hemlock), deals with the impact of a crime – in this case a violent home invasion, leading to rape – on a marriage. Twenty-five years later the perpetrator, who has committed a string of similar offences, some ending in murder, is caught and tried, with the now divorced Edward and Isabel giving impact statements. Dean weaves both their points of view, past and present, for an exceptional psychological thriller that is also a love story, focusing on the years before and after the terrible event lays bare the fault lines in their relationship.Belinda Bauer brings back Patrick Fort, protagonist of her 2013 novel Rubbernecker, inThe Impossible Thing(Bantam), a tale set in the obsessive (and now illegal) world of bird egg collectors. Switching between 1920s Yorkshire, when young Celie Sheppard reverses her impoverished family’s fortunes by stealing a rare red egg from a guillemot, and the 21st century, when Patrick is trying to track down the burglar who stole an “old egg” in an ornamental box from his neighbour, this funny, moving and unpredictable novel is a treat.View image in fullscreenThe straightforward cosy crime novel is still incredibly popular, but some authors are borrowing its tropes and conventions to explore different themes. Louise Hegarty’s distinctive debut,Fair Play(Picador), is the finest example of this. It begins conventionally enough with a murder mystery-themed house party, during which a genuine death occurs. The rug is then pulled sharply and repeatedly out from under the reader’s feet as two storylines emerge: one a metafictional Golden Age pastiche, full of knowing asides and tricksy fun; the other a painfully realistic account from the point of view of the victim’s sister, lonely and confounded by grief. The result is an ingenious take on how we make sense of both life and death.The Japanese YouTuber Uketsu, real identity unknown (he wears a papier-mache mask), is responsible for what must be the most idiosyncratically unsettling crime novel of the year.Strange Pictures(Pushkin Vertigo, translated by Jim Rion) is a sequence of connected mysteries with visual as well as narrative clues, beginning with creepy artwork by an 11-year-old girl who was arrested for matricide. It’s heartening to see that the genre remains as versatile and dynamic as ever.To browse all of the Guardian’s best books of 2025, visitguardianbookshop.com.

It’s the best thing I ever did. I do schools, universities, supermarkets, Christmas lights switch-ons … As soon as Santa comes along, everybody melts. One little girl brought her guinea pig, who leapt off her hand and dived straight into my Santa beard. The parents were in stitches while we tried to get him out. My favourite Christmas songs areEartha Kitt’s sultry version of Santa Baby, because it gets all the adults in the mood to get up and have a boogie with Santa, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, because the lyrics are so pure. No Christmas songs drive me mad. It’s Christmas: they’re all great.Paul Fessi‘Spike Jones is just so cheesy!’I know I look the part. I wear the green Santa outfit from before Coca-Cola turned him red and white to match their branding, but if I just put a Christmas hat on, people shout “Oi Santa!” at me. Someone said I look more like a fat elf, which is fair enough. I’ve had lots of funny incidents. I once felt a tug on my beard, looked down and there was a two-year-old dangling from it. I do Santa for the domestic abuse charityIDAS, distributing donated presents to child survivors. My favourite song is obvious:Do They Know It’s Christmas?, because Band Aid drew attention to global inequality. The song that drives me nuts is [Spike Jones’s 1948 hit] All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth. It’s just so cheesy. Really irritating!Arnold Warneken AKA Green Santa‘I’d rather hear a grime Christmas song’View image in fullscreen‘I wasn’t sure how the kids would process a Black Santa’: Cleve Freckleton AKA Rasta ClausI was teaching at a school for kids with special educational needs and they asked me to be Santa. I wasn’t sure how the kids would process a Black Santa, so I made up this jokey character, Rasta Claus. The parents loved it – their children are classed as “different” so it made sense for them to have a “different” Santa. One kid once said, “You’re not the real Santa”, so I said I was Santa’s cousin and worked for him. He believed we were related because we both have white beards – he didn’t see skin colour. I love how children think. My favourite festive songs areBaby It’s Cold Outside,Winter WonderlandandWhen a Child Is Born. None of them mention Christmas but they couldn’t be more Christmassy. I’d rather hear something different than hear Mariah Carey for the 1,000th time – maybe a grime Christmas song or a punk version of Silent Night.Cleve Freckleton AKA Rasta Claus‘I don’t like When Santa Got Stuck Up the Chimney for obvious reasons!’For me, Santa is the Christmas spirit. Families – especially with kids – are in awe, and you can feel the magic. It gets very hot in the costume, wig and beard. For the first hour you feel really uncomfortable, then your body starts to adjust. It’s always a challenge to go to the loo in costume. Kids always want to tell you what they want for Christmas, although you get some funny requests. A four-year-old girl told me she wanted a reindeer. My favourite song isUnderneath the Tree by Kelly Clarkson, because we did a choreographed dance to it in a Santa show and all the families joined in. The one I can’t bear is When Santa Got Stuck Up the Chimney for obvious reasons but I make a joke of it. I say, “It only happened once!”Joseph Ridgely‘Christmas Wrapping drives me bananas – though it’s a total earworm’View image in fullscreen‘On Boxing Day I have to get a beard trim, otherwise I can’t get rid of him’: Keith Leech.Photograph: Santa’s Calling YouI used to be a science teacher but one day my daughter said: “Dad, your beard’s gone white. You could play Father Christmas.” As soon as I put the outfit on I feel warm and fluffy inside. If kids go, “Is that beard real?” I tug on it and say: “It feels real to me.” On Boxing Day I have to get a beard trim, otherwise I can’t get rid of him. My favourite song is Jingle Bells, believe it or not, because like Santa it’s very jolly and Christmassy. The songs that drive me nuts are things I’ve heard too much, like [Slade’s] Noddy Holder shouting: “It’s Chriiiiiistmmmmassss!”Christmas Wrapping by the Waitressesdrives me bananas – the singing leaves a lot to be desired, although I have to admit the riff is a total earworm.Keith LeechThe 20 greatest Christmas carols – ranked!Read more‘Stop the Cavalry is a heartfelt plea to stop all war’My favourite Christmas song isJona Lewie’s Stop the Cavalrybecause it’s bouncy, has that wonderful brass section middle bit and is just a heartfelt plea to stop all war. I don’t likeNat King Cole’s The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgotbecause it’s just so sad – the boy hasn’t got any parents, so he gets nothing at Christmas. Being Santa can be heartbreaking – I’ve had a child say to me: “I only get one present but my friend gets 30. Does that mean I’m naughty?” – but it’s almost like a calling. I went to see a little boy in hospital who’d been in a terrible accident. When we got talking, the room fell silent and people started crying. Afterwards I was virtually rugby tackled by his mum and dad, who said: “That’s the first time he’s spoken for six months.” That’s the power of Santa.Nigel Harvey AKA Santa Himself‘You grin and bear Donny Osmond for the love of Christmas’‘If you hear any of them too often they drive you nuts’: Simon Anthony.Photograph: Santa’s Calling YouI’ve got a beard and wear braces. One day I was in a shop and someone shouted: “Oi Santa!” A couple of days later two blokes on bikes shouted the same thing. I thought: there must be something in this. So I became Santa. I must be convincing because a grandfather came up and said: “Thank you for the guitar you gave me when I was 12.” I love Doctor Who and am pretty sure that Santa is a Time Lord: lots of faces and the ability to charge around different places at different times. I’m a classical music buff so I’m very partial to Prokofiev’s Sleigh Ride. It was part of the trade test music when BBC Two was launched and I just loved listening to it there. If you hear any of them too often they drive you nuts. As a child I found Donny Osmond’s Christmas songs particularly distressing, but you grin and bear it for the love of Christmas.Simon AnthonyExplore more on these topicsMusicChristmasPop and rockMariah CareyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The decision to award her the prize was made the day before shedied, aged 79, last month following a long illness, said judging chair Peter Florence.The author won the award for her 2005 novel A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, a family drama described by Vintage Bollinger judgeClaudia Winklemanas “laugh out loud funny, utterly original and also deeply moving”. At the time of publication, the book was longlisted for the Man Booker prize and shortlisted for the Orange prize, now the Women’s prize for fiction.Lewycka’s partner, Donald Sassoon, and daughter, Sonia Lewycka, accepted the award on the writer’s behalf at a ceremony held in Westminster on Monday evening.The event also saw Rosanna Pike take home the 2025 award for her novel A Little Trickerie, for which she wins a pig being named after her book, a jeroboam and case of Bollinger Special Cuvée, and the complete set of the Everyman’s Library PG Wodehouse collection.The novel, described as “lovable, fun and emotionally juicy” by critic Imogen Hermes Gowarin the Guardian, was inspired by a real-life woman: Elizabeth, the “Holy Maid of Leominster,” in Hereford, who supposedly appeared as an angel in the priory there but was found to be a fraud. Pike imagines Elizabeth “with great panache: white-haired adolescent Tibb Ingleby is frankly and unashamedly herself from the first page, dancing and whooping with her mother ‘with a big hoot-hoot’,” wrote Hermes Gowar.Both Lewycka and Pike’s novels are published by Fig Tree, an imprint of Penguin, in the UK.View image in fullscreenMarina Lewycka is presented with a jeroboam of Bollinger in the presence of the customary pen of Gloucester pigs, after winning the Wodehouse prize in  2005.Photograph: Justin Williams/ShutterstockLewycka was named the winner-of-winners from an illustrious alumni list that features Jonathan Coe, Geoff Dyer, Ian McEwan, Terry Pratchett, Helen Fielding, Alexander McCall Smith, Percival Everett and Bob Mortimer among others.Florence, co-founder of Hay festival, said that while it seemed “daunting” to “garland one book among so many as the funniest book of the last 25 years”, the judges “came to a book that some people were discovering for the first time and were laughing aloud at and loving. [Lewycka] has us at the title, and she rocks us on every page. And it’s a book that is reshaped by the 20 years since it was first published, by both the history of Ukraine and the story of refugee experience in the UK. The comedy is somehow both darker and more vivid.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The Daily Mail went with the headline: “David Lammy’s Foreign Office ‘removed portrait of Queen Elizabeth II in favour of pan-African flags’”.The work comes from the government art collection (GAC), which is run by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and contains thousands of pieces.It is routine for new governments to change the work that is hung, but the fact some of the works of art “appear to reference and critique colonialism” led the Reform UK MP Lee Anderson to call Lammy “spineless” and claim: “He is forever criticising our history.”View image in fullscreenA picture of Queen Elizabeth II by portrait photographer David Bailey.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APAchiampong’s work Pan African Flag for the Relic Travellers’ Alliance (Motion) is hanging in the Foreign Office and is a large green, yellow and red design featuring 54 black stars that represent all nation states on the African continent.Speaking to the Guardian, Achiampong said the coverage of his work was linked to growing anti-immigrant sentiment that elements of the media had exacerbated.“The fuss over the fact that the queen’s image has been replaced with pan-African colours speaks to this narrative of ‘immigrants are here, they’re coming over, they’re taking over everything’,” he said, calling the angle of some reporting “deeply problematic”.View image in fullscreenYinka Shonibare’s original Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle sat on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in London, England.Photograph: Fotomaton/AlamyThe Telegraph reported that Himid’s 2021 work Old Boat, New Weather, which represents “slavery and imperial trade”, sat alongside a small version of Shonibare’s Nelson’s Ship in a Bottle, a replica of Nelson’s flagship, HMS Victory. The original saton the Fourth Plinth in 2010.Achiampong added: “They’re not thinking about what Yinka Shonibare, Lubaina Himid or myself have given and devoted to the general public within the UK. We are celebrated and awarded artists that have done incredible things with our work.”Himid is representing the UKat next year’s Venice Biennaleandwon the Turner prize in 2017, while Shonibare was nominated for the Turner prize in 2004, became a Royal Academician in 2013 and was awarded a CBE in 2019.Achiampong’s pan-African flag design also features on the roundel of the Westminster tube stop where itwas installed in 2022 by Transport for London.The British-Ghanaian artist said that the purpose of his piece, which was commissioned with support fromArts Council England, was to make people think about nationalism.“My practice has always been about – in a sense – getting underneath the skin to talk about these issues,” he said. “If that pisses people off, then, in a way, the job’s being done.”The issue of which portraits and pieces hang in government offices has made headlines since Labour came to power in 2024.The removal of a portrait of Margaret Thatcher from 10 Downing Street showed Keir Starmer “wants to drag Britain down”, according to the former Tory minister John Redwood.Rachel Reeves was also criticised after she said she intended to replace every painting in the state room at 11 Downing Streetwith artworks of or by women.The Foreign Office was approached for comment.The DCMS did not provide comment but the Guardian understands that David Bailey’s HMQueen Elizabeth II(1926-2022) is currently at the GAC.Explore more on these topicsArtArts Council EnglandDavid LammyQueen Elizabeth IIColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

First seen off-Broadway in 2019, it is framed as a show created by best friends George and Harold, the duo Pilkey presents as the comic’s creators. Drawing on instalments from the series including A Tale of Two Kitties and Lord of the Fleas, the plot brings together familiar characters from the irreverent Dog Man world such as the dastardly cat Petey, his clone Lil’ Petey, the robot 80-HD and the cyborg fish Flippy.View image in fullscreen‘Breezily directed’ … a scene from the US tour of Dog Man: The Musical.Photograph: Jeremy DanielThe musical, aimed at over-fives, had several sell-out seasons off-Broadway and also toured the US. Its arrival in London will mark 10 years since the publication of the first Dog Man book. The character of a badly injured policeman who emerges from surgery newly sporting the head of his trusty mutt had previously appeared in Captain Underpants.Reviewing the 2019 production of the musical at the Lucille Lortel theatre, the New York Times’ Laurel Graeberwrote: “Breezily directed and choreographed by Jen Wineman, the show benefits from Tim Mackabee’s designs for the set and some small puppets, which preserve the novel’s comic-book feel.” Graeber praised Brad Alexander’s “high-energy score” and how lyricist Kevin Del Aguila imaginatively “preserved the novel’s wry parody of Charles Dickens”.The Dog Man series has sold more than 70m copies worldwide and has been translated into around 50 languages. A movie,Dog Man, and a video game, Dog Man: Mission Impawsible, were both released in the last year. The 14th book in the series,Big Jim Believes, was published in November.Pilkey said that the musical “surpassed my highest expectations” and left the audience “especially me, in complete awe”. He described the show as “the perfect mash-up of memorable music, humour and love”. Dog Man: The Musical is at theSouthbank Centre,London, from 30 July to 16 August.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's books: 7 and underChildren and teenagersChildren's theatreSouthbank CentrenewsShareReuse this content"

In this epic three-parter, he examines the role the royals have played – and predicts what will happen next. The opening episode asks how politically impartial the monarchy is and how much power its members really have, looking at, among other things, letters written by King Charles III, when Prince of Wales, to Tony Blair, and Queen Elizabeth II’s approval of the suspension of parliament in 2019.

More than any politician anywhere in the world in my adult lifetime, she looked like an actual member of the human race who was catapulted to office too fast to have acquired the defensive carapace of the professional politician. She was vulnerable and scrutable and likable in ways utterly alien to everyone else.Obviously this sympathetic film has been edited in such a way as to omit most of the hard business of internal politics and to foreground this humanity, although there is one fascinating moment at the very end when her partner Clarke Gayford gently asks if she might be doing too much; with a tiny flash of temper she asks if he is telling her to “delegate”. Gayford got his Denis Thatcher closeup there. Did we see a subliminal moment of the non-niceness vital for all successful politicians?Ardern was the target of misogyny – like Australia’s Julia Gillard – but never seems hardened, embittered or even changed all that much. The film, with intimate access, tracks her life with Gayford as she became the smart and personable new leader of theNew ZealandLabour party in 2017 and then, in short order, prime minister – first in coalition and then on her own, the world’s youngest female elected leader. (She even gave birth to a baby while in office.) Ardern dealt with the Christchurch mosque shootings with utter sincerity and compassion; she spent her political capital shrewdly at that moment by banning assault rifles. The world loved her for it.Then when Covid came along, Ardern had not only political skill but what Napoleon famously valued in his generals: she was lucky – at first. New Zealand seemed to have been miraculously spared the worst of the outbreak, but then a new wave struck, Ardern’s poll numbers dipped and an ugly new far-right anti-vax mob made their encampment outside parliament. The film shows how they were succumbing to the delicious thrill of bullying a woman. The sad thing is that there doesn’t appear to be much space for someone like Ardern in modern politics; less space than ever in fact.Prime Minister is out in Australia now and on HBO Max in the US, and in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsJacinda ArdernNew ZealandAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Many expected it to play a huge part in the awards conversation, with key scenes surely destined to be shown in sizzle reel clips at endless prize ceremonies and invoked in endless op-ed pieces about fragile masculinity. But no. Now it is almost a modern filmmaudit, all but forgotten, a cursed film only now coming out quietly, and maybe its star ismauditas well.Majors plays Killian Maddox, an iron-pumping wannabe caring for his disabled grandfather and cultivating a fan obsession with the stars of the bodybuilding circuit. He is particularly keen on a preening beefcake named Brad Vanderhorn, whose magazine covers Killian plasters over the walls of his sad bedroom, and dreams of making it on to these covers himself. Killian is plagued with loneliness, depression and incipient mental illness, body dysmorphia and inability to connect with women. At one point he has a full-tilt, Travis Bickle-style disastrous date with Jessie (Haley Bennett), a co-worker at the supermarket where he has a day-job. And he is addicted to steroids, which trigger terrifying ’roid rage.But the film and Majors own career were sunk byhis 2023 conviction on two counts of assault and harassment against his then girlfriend. The situation seemed worryingly similar to the film’s scenario, only without its fictional reassurances that the man involved was fundamentally gentle. Magazine Dreams itself, though flawed by a cumbersome flashback structure in which he is talking to a counsellor, has powerful moments and Majors is very good, especially in the bizarre scene when Killian insists on going onstage at a bodybuilding event just after being beaten up. The plot twists to an interesting revelation about #MeToo style abuse, although the impact of this too was clouded by Major’s own life. Unclothed, Majors presents an amazingVesalian anatomyof pain.Magazine Dreams is in UK cinemas from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBody imageJonathan MajorsHealth & wellbeingHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the subject of a documentary from Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady. Over winter months of almost continuous darkness, the teens cleanse themselves with tasks such as camping out in subzero weather, making their own fires and driving sledges with huskies.Prior to all this of course is presumably a solemn promise to do without their phones, tablets and laptops, although there are no scenes of the kids actually having to surrender these gadgets (this isn’t rehab, after all). They have to swim in icy water; and they make it look like fun. What doesn’t look like fun is the camping out and there is one tense moment when a whingeing student is told that he cannot avail himself of his teachers’ fire and will have to build his own. As for the hunting part, well, yes, they do hunt, though the moment of the kill isn’t shown on screen.‘A fire, a dog, and the starry sky’: the teens overcoming phone-addiction through Arctic pursuitsRead moreVarious teenagers bring their own problems to the school, of which the most important is surely that of Hege, who is deeply depressed after the murder of her biker dad.

Then again, there are bigger problems in this gender-switched reworking of Arthur Conan Doyle’s tales of sleuthing than a mere Americanism tossed into Victorian-era Baker Street.These detective adventures take place in post-pandemic London. Joan Watson (Simona Brown), who tells us she is “not” a doctor, is an American on a grown-up gap year of sorts. An advert for a flatshare brings her to the apartment of Sherlock Holmes (Lucy Farrett), who emphatically tells us she is not called Shirley. Despite Watson’s reluctance to be there, and her suspicion of Holmes, they set about solving cases together.Under the direction of Sean Turner, it might be a satire or outright parody with shades of The Play That Goes Wrong (which Turner has directed). It gives off improv sketch vibes with ropey comic timing and pallid, overfamiliar jokes.The title’s “Ms” hints at covert lesbianism in an era when it could only be insinuated. Are Joan and Sherlock a same-sex blueprint for the likes of Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas? No such luck. American playwright Kate Hamill is on to a good idea but does not do nearly enough with it. Holmes might be a lesbian, Watson might swing both ways, but whatever frisson there is between the duo and the panoply of accompanying characters (all adeptly played by Tendai Humphrey Sitima and Alice Lucy) gives way to relentlessly plotty larks.View image in fullscreenToo elementary … (from left) Alice Lucy, Simona Brown, Lucy Farrett and Tendai Humphrey Sitima in Ms Holmes and Ms Watson – Apt 2B.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe underlying purpose behind Hamill’s central gender switch remains opaque because the play sticks so faithfully to Doyle’s purpose of solving one crime to the next. It is too elementary, in a sense, and neither as funny as you want it to be nor as serious. Instead it is jejune, reliant on types (including lazy “Irish” jokes) and with little probing beneath the surface of plot or character.Holmes rubs Watson up the wrong way with her eccentricities, drug-taking and insistence on turning everything (including Watson’s past) into a game of logical deduction. You can see Watson’s point. Holmes is a high-pitched character, delivering little more than cliches. In the end, you wish for less capering, more drama.AtArcola theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Arthur Conan DoyleCrime fictionFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Martin Phillipps, leader of the Chills,died last year.Hamish Kilgour, drummer and co-founder of the Clean, took his own life in November 2022. Andrew Brough, guitarist for the Straitjacket Fits, died in non-suspicious circumstances in 2020; David Wood, the same band’s bass player, succumbed to cancer in 2010.On and onit goes.In 2019 Shayne Carter, leader of the Fits (as well as Dimmer, the DoubleHappys and more), published an excellent memoir. He called it Dead People I Have Known. Sections from it form the spine of a new documentary byNew Zealandfilm-maker Margaret Gordon titled Life in One Chord, named after one of the Fits’ early songs.The Straitjacket Fits, and Carter especially, are feted in their home country. Two of their songs,She SpeedsandDown in Splendour(written by Brough) have beenrankedamong the finest compositions the nation has produced. For a brief moment, around 1990–1991 – pre-Nirvana’s crossover success – they were hyped as the greatest guitar band in the world. So what went wrong?Well, lots of things. Some were within the band’s control, most weren’t, and none are unusual: think warring egos, clueless A&R flunkies, unsympathetic producers and an indifferent public that didn’t get what all the fuss was about. Gordon, wisely, doesn’t spend too much time dwelling on this side of things. If you know the band (and this partially crowdfunded film is for fans), you’ve heard it before.Doja Cat review – ignore the headlines, this is a pop provocateur at the top of her gameRead moreIf you don’t, they were a volatile group. The handsome Carter wrote thespikier material. Brough sported glasses, a perfect blond mop-top and added the kind of Byrds-inspired jangle-pop that was everywhere in the 80s. The sweet and sour combination was irresistible, but Brough’s George Harrison-like strike rate of between one and three songs per release caused tensions. When he left, the band lost its point of difference.But this is Carter’s story, not the Fits’. The film opens with an aerial drone shot of the singer walking a narrow isthmus back to shore in Dunedin: a homecoming. The sound that explodes behind him isCrystalator– the abrasive first single by Dimmer, made in 1995 after the Fits’ split. Depending on how you look at it, it’s the sound of a maverick talent who can’t be bought, or a man familiar with the dark arts of self-sabotage.Both are true, but Gordon’s film gives more weight to the former than the latter. There’s a slightly rote but necessary retelling of punk’s impact on New Zealand and Carter’s role within it, as “Peter Putrid” in his post-pubescent band Bored Games. Things really take off when he formsthe DoubleHappyswith talented childhood friend Wayne Elsey and an unreliable drum machine they call Herbie Fuckface. Herbie dies after getting stomped on once too often and is replaced by another schoolmate and future Fit, John Collie.But Elsey dies in an appalling accident, Carter and Collie are traumatised witnesses, and Carter never quite puts the pieces back together. The odds were already against him: raised by an alcoholic mother and violent stepfather, born part-Māori but raised white, he’s a perennial outsider with a seriousElvis fixation. He hasn’t spent a lifetime trying to find his place in the world so much as reconciled himself to life on the edge of it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He too struggles with alcohol and anger management – but those are the embarrassing sections that we don’t get enough of in Gordon’s film. “He could be a bit of a brat,” saysLook Blue Go Purple’s Francisca Griffin, and it’s an understatement. John Collie is more forthright: “I think everyone went through a phase of hating Shayne.”He’s a force of nature though. The best footage in the documentary is of the Straitjacket Fits playing one of their last shows at an outdoor festival in Palmerston North in 1994. They’re playing in driving rain, the band is in serious danger of electrocution, and they’retearing through Dialling a Prayer like their lives depend on it.

Riding around Cyrodiil on horseback, taking in its gleaming city and backwater towns, it was so easy to get drawn into unexpected shenanigans that closing the story’s threatening hell-gates became a distant second priority.Uno(2006)View image in fullscreenThe most addictive version of the classic card game… Uno on Xbox 360Photograph: Carbonated Games/MicrosoftLook – don’t @ us – Uno was one ofthemost important Xbox 360 games. It was the first game that many people ever played on webcam (for better or for worse), letting you see the expression on an opponent’s face when you played a wild draw four. It was one of the first downloadable multiplayer games that console players could enjoy. It was astonishingly moreish. Many, many times you’d pick up the controller intending on making a dent in Halo or Mass Effect, and instead be drawn into round upon round of late-night online Uno. We still sometimes hear the pleasing sound effects in our dreams.Viva Piñata (2006)View image in fullscreenDarwinian brutality? … Viva Piñata.Photograph: MicrosoftBuild a beautiful garden, attract colourful piñata-creatures to reside in it – then watch on as they all eat each other.

This one is a shooter of astonishing scale for its time, the concluding part of gaming’s most maximalist and justifiably self-serious space drama. Where most modern shooters are glorified rollercoaster rides, corridors linked together by triggered set-pieces, Halo is full of intelligent enemies and opportunities for emergent chaos. But what we all remember best is the multiplayer: tanks and Ghost airships and Warthogs all clashing in endlessly entertaining remixes of the same outrageous grand battles. Its Forge map editor and fully customisable game rules made it feel infinitely entertaining.Mass Effect(2007)View image in fullscreenBetter than Star Wars?… Mass EffectPhotograph: Electronic ArtsBioWare’s vast sci-fi trilogy may not have had an ideal ending, but its mix of interplanetary war and inter-species romance held fans enraptured for a decade, starting with this brilliant first game.

Perhaps too easy, as it’s over surprisingly quickly – but it has more heart and personality than any other Xbox role-playing game. It’s a mood-lifting fairytale with a heap of good ideas.

The company tempted a series of storied Japanese developers to make exclusive games for the 360. Most of them sank without trace, but Lost Odyssey is a standout in its genre: it’s about what happens to our humanity in the face of technological revolution. Given that it was directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi, a Final Fantasy veteran, it is perhaps unsurprising that it feels like a lost entry in that series.Ninja GaidenII (2008)View image in fullscreenChoreographed violence… Ninja Gaiden IIPhotograph: Team NINJABefore Dark Souls came along, it was Tecmo’s viciously difficult acton adventure that had players either grinding their teeth in frustration or gleefully hacking the limbs off adversaries.

Friends and family remember a paradoxical manChristian HouseMon 1 Dec 2025 19.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 1 Dec 2025 19.09 ESTShareNorway has never looked as wet as in the photographs of the late Tom Sandberg. There are shots of drizzle and puddles, of asphalt slick with mizzle. A ripple of water appears to have a hole in it, a figure looms behind a rain-dappled window, a gutter glows after a downpour.Shot in either bold chiaroscuro or gentle orchestrations of greys, these are pictures with the power to make the everyday seem dreamlike. But they are also uplifting, in a confusing kind of way, like being told to dress for sun even when the clouds are black.View image in fullscreen‘He loved myth-making’ … Untitled, 1990s, by Tom Sandberg.Photograph: Tom SandbergSandberg, as a new retrospective at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter next to the Oslo fjord makes clear, was not only Norway’s most famous photographer, pivotal in making the medium a serious art form in the Nordic region during the 1980s and 1990s. He was also a paradoxical character: hard-living, erratic, with a propensity for fanning his own myth with his tongue firmly in his cheek – and yet able to produce compositions that are contemplative, calming and uplifting.View image in fullscreenJohn Cage, 1985, by Tom Sandberg.Photograph: Tom SandbergCovering four decades, from student work taken in the mid-1970s through to pictures made shortly before his death in 2014, Tom Sandberg: Vibrant World is the first major Sandberg show since his death aged 60. The setting is apt: Sandberg was once the in-house photographer at Henie Onstad, capturing art happenings in its galleries and making closely cropped, vastly enlarged, monochrome portraits of visiting dignitaries, including the composer John Cage and the artist Christo. They are topographical in their scrutiny of pitted, sandpapery skin.He was born in 1953 in the town of Narvik on the coast of northern Norway. The family subsequently moved to Oslo, where Tom’s father worked as a photojournalist. “His father took him to the darkroom for the first time and exposed Tom’s hand on the photo paper. He said he was immediately smitten by that alchemical magic and never looked back,” recalls the art historian Torunn Liven, a long-time friend and trustee of the Tom Sandberg Foundation.After his father abandoned the family, Sandberg helped his mother raise his sister in a rough suburb of the city. In the mid 1970s, he studied photography at what is now Nottingham Trent University, where he was taught by the American photographer Minor White.Sandberg considered the darkroom process, in which he experimented with materials and retouching, to be a pivotal part of image-making. And, as his practice progressed, his prints became larger, almost cinematic. A noirish interior of the lounge at Oslo’s Gardermoen airport could be a film still from a Wim Wenders feature.View image in fullscreen‘His work arrested his unrest’ … Untitled, 2007, by Tom Sandberg.Photograph: Tom SandbergHe returned to Oslo in the late 1970s, and began collaborating with printers and designers. Though he developed an interest in Zen-like compositions, his social life was far from monk-like.“Tom had a huge social capacity. When he went in a taxi, he’d make friends with the taxi driver. He was friends with Norway’s crown princess,” says Liven. “He had a large need and capacity for having people around him. I think that unrest is the shadow side of that liveliness. And that, in a sense, his work arrested that unrest.”Liven recalls how Sandberg had a particular affinity with young photographers who sought to learn his “wizard darkroom skills” and careful editing process, an old-school meticulous, intuitive and slow way of working. “We are very happy at the foundation that all the 15-year-olds from the secondary schools in the county around the museum area will participate in a workshop inspired by the Henie Onstad exhibition,” says Liven. “The teenagers will be restricted to work on one single picture, instead of the usual overload of endless digital snapshots.”Morten Andenæs, Sandberg’s former assistant, photographer and co-curator (with Susanne Østby Sæther) of the Henie Onstad exhibition, recalls his unruly moments as well as his productivity. “He was a wild soul,” he says. “He was one of those guys with a wry smile. He didn’t take himself seriously but he took his work very seriously. It was how he dealt with existential issues.” Sandberg struggled with alcohol and substance abuse, says Andenæs. “He would periodically go on benders.”View image in fullscreen‘Studies of strange shapes’ … Untitled, 2005, by Tom Sandberg.Photograph: Tom SandbergSandberg told Andenæs that “if it weren’t for photography he’d probably go to the hounds.” Rumours swirled around him. “If you look at his ear in portraits, part of it is missing. And how did that happen? I think he loved myth-making. Like, was it a woman who bit off his ear? That kind of stuff,” says Andenæs. “He would tell interviewers that he dreamt in black and white.”Although Sandberg’s obsessive methodology, poetic sensibility and pared-back subject matter suggests a modernist lone wolf – his photographs often feature solitary figures with their back turned to the camera – he was no recluse. “He was seen by everyone he drew into his orbit,” notes Andenæs. “And he had a drive and intuition that rumbled on like a lorry without brakes.”His human subjects are really studies of strange shapes. In one, a man appears to dance with his own shadow. In the early 2000s, he photographed his young daughter, Marie, as a whirligig of blonde hair. He shot human doodles.View image in fullscreen‘Being in his company felt like the sun was shining on you’ … Untitled, 2002, by Tom Sandberg.Photograph: Tom Sandberg“I don’t think he was one thing. He was a diverse person,” Marie, who is now 30 and has been at the helm of her father’s estate for more than a decade, tells me. “He was a very funny person and charismatic. But not always easy to be with.”How was he as a father? “He was always very protective of me when I was a child. We had many different chapters as well. And I chose to live with him when he didn’t have the best time of his life,” Marie says. She sees the photographs he took of her as a form of self-portraiture. “I think he saw a lot of himself in me.”Marie recalls how her father would take his camera bag with him everywhere. “To go from our house to the tram it could take anything from 10 minutes to two hours. He was taking pictures of me, the street, the sky, the ground. He just saw moments he wanted to capture.” That engagement with his subjects and surroundings extended to his friendships, as Morten Andenæs recalls: “Being in his company felt like the sun was shining on you.”View image in fullscreen‘Like a lorry with no brakes’ … Sandberg’s self-portrait, 2001There were some periods of sharpness and sobriety. In his lifetime, he saw considerable success, including a solo show at MoMA Ps1 in New York in 2007, and his legacy continues to grow. Henie Onstad has Sandberg works on loan from the Norwegian National Museum and the Tangen Collection, arguably the most important collection of Nordic photography in the world.The exhibition includes just one photograph of the man himself: a self-portrait taken in 2001, in which Sandberg is seen sitting in an armchair in an empty room. He looks like a security guard. The man you wouldn’t notice.Tom Sandberg: Vibrant World is at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Oslo, until 1 March 2026Explore more on these topicsPhotographyArtNorwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

ForChristmas, I often employ much the same process for turkey legs – it’s a lovely way to eat them. Serve with colcannon, although basmati rice, boiled new potatoes or roast carrots would also go great.Braised turkey legs with sage, mustard and creme fraiche, and colcannonThis can easily be scaled up to feed more people – you’ll just need a larger pan.Prep20 minCook1 hr 30 minServes2Sunflower oilSaltand black pepper2 bone-in turkey legs1 tbsp butter5 garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped2 shallots, peeled and halved5 slicesstreaky bacon, diced8 sage leaves70ml white wine60-100mlchicken stock½ tbsp dijon mustard1 tbsp creme fraicheFor the colcannon500glargefloury potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks.100gunsalted butter2 garlic cloves, peeled and diced½ savoy cabbage, thinly slicedSaltand black pepper100ml milkHeat the oven to 200C (180Cfan)/390F/gas 6. Heat two tablespoons of sunflower oil in a 23cm wide x 7cm high cast-iron frying pan or similar. Season the turkey legs, then lay them in the pan and fry, turning once, until nicely coloured on both sides. Transfer the legs to a plate, then pour out and discard the fat.View image in fullscreenMax Rocha’s colcannon.Add the butter to the pan, followed by the garlic, shallots, bacon and sage, and cook on a medium-high heat for five to 10 minutes, until the shallots and bacon take on some colour. Pour in the wine, then lay the turkey legs on top of the vegetables. Pour in the stock so the turkey legs are covered halfway, then carefully stir in the mustard and creme fraiche. Cover the pan with foil and roast for an hour, or until the turkey legs can bend in half with ease.Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a pan of boiling water and cook for 20 minutes, until tender when pricked with a sharp knife.Meanwhile, in a second pan, melt two tablespoons of the butter, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, for two minutes. Add the cabbage and cook on a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, until soft. Season, then set aside.In a third saucepan, warm the milk and the remaining butter. Drain the cooked potatoes, then return them to their pan. Mash the potatoes with the warm milk and butter until smooth, then add the cabbage and stir it through. Season again to taste, and keep warm (or reheat gently just before serving).Once the turkey is cooked, serve with the colcannon and the vegetables and juices from the cooking pan.Max Rocha is chef-owner ofCafe Cecilia, London E8Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkMain courseFoodIrish food and drinkPotatoesChristmasMeatrecipesShareReuse this content"
