Two rounds of golf at his very own course in Turnberry.On the SaturdayDonald Trumphad broken the record with a round of just 18. A hole in one at every hole. Largely because there had been men stationed about the course to pick up the ball and place it in the hole. Then on the Sunday he had gone one better. A round of 17. The ball had gone straight into the cup at the fourth hole, had rested there for a couple of seconds and then had flown out, soaring over the links and straight into the hole at the fifth. Scottie Scheffler could only dream of such a shot.So The Donald was in an expansive mood as he waited forKeir Starmerand his wife, Victoria, to pay him a visit on Monday morning. Which was more than could be said for the small contingent of the British press who had been sent to the South Ayrshire golf course to cover the meeting.On the table of the games room in which they had been penned, there were plates of sandwiches and biscuits. Just not for them. They were only for the US press corps. The Brits had to bring a packed lunch. Clearly, the special relationship still has a way to go.Keir and Victoria arrived at the main entrance, where Trump was waiting to greet them, along with a bagpiper who drowned out the first couple of minutes of conversation. The Donald went into overdrive. His mum was Scottish, he said several times, as if reminding himself. His attention then turned to Victoria. She was a respected person all over the US. “I don’t want to get myself into trouble,” he added, “but she’s very, she’s a great woman.”Victoria looked a little creeped out. Her husband might be a master Trump-wrangler, an expert at sycophancy and genuflection, but she wasn’t. She knew that almost no one in the US had heard of her and that’s the way she liked it. So she just tried to suck it up. She longed to get inside, away from the cameras.The Donald had other ideas, taking question after question from the gaggle of reporters gathered for the arrival. The US president is like a radio presenter on the graveyard night-time slot. Uncomfortable with silence. Filling the dead air with a long rambling stream of unconsciousness. Saying the first thing that comes into his head. Needy – greedy – for any attention he can get. No longer just the most important person in his own life but the most important person on the planet. Life doesn’t get any better than this for the supreme narcissist: he speaks and people have to suck it up and listen.Europe was in a bad place. Almost unrecognisable from the Europe of 10 years ago. Too many foreigners. He didn’t know anything about the small boat crossings, he admitted, but he was still sure they were all rapists and murderers. At this point, Starmer interrupted to say that he was very, very tough on irregular migration. Not that anyone was listening.The Donald hardly drew breath. Yes,he did think people were starving in Gaza and Israel would have to allow more aid in. He seemed to want thanks for sending food, rather than seeing it as a legal and moral obligation. Putin had disappointed him. He was going to have to rethink his 50 days. And it was time to acknowledge the six wars he had stopped. Almost one a month. There was Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Rwanda and the DRC. He couldn’t remember the others. It sounded as if he was nominating himself for the Nobel peace prize.0:54Trump gives Russia ‘10 or 12’ days to move on Ukraine peace deal – videoAn hour later, Trump and Starmer were gathered in the modestly named Donald J Trump Ballroom for the press conference proper. It was billed as a double act but everyone knew it wasn’t going to be that way. Keir was there purely as The Donald’s plus one. This was to be The Donald Show, with just the occasional interruption from Starmer to allow the president to draw breath. A series of rambling, self-congratulatory monologues in which we actually learned very little.We started by going over familiar territory that had already been covered in the 10-minute impromptu press conference earlier. Yes, Gaza was bad. Very bad, Keir added. So much so that he had upgraded it from “appalling but no need to do anything” to “appalling and something needs to be done”.Trump ignored him. Hamas was bad. He had always said so. Israel must do something. He didn’t say what. As for Putin, he would give him 10-12 days. This was said impulsively, on the spur of the moment, rather than as a considered news event.Then an acknowledgment to the British prime minister. He had negotiated a very good trade deal. Though it’s still not entirely clear Agent Orange understands that it’s US consumers who will pay the tariffs. Moving on. He had also just negotiatedthe bigliest deal in the history of the world with the EU. Starmer had just been put on notice that the UK wasn’t as important as all that. The Donald had been doing us a favour all along.The questions came from all quarters. Anything goes. Windfarms? Hate them. Ugly and expensive. What’s wrong with oil? Here, Keir tried to stand up for himself. “Actually, we like them as part of a mixed energy portfolio. Along with oil.” The Donald didn’t seem convinced and started slagging off the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. “He’s a friend of mine,” squeaked Starmer. Trump wasn’t bothered. Speak to the hand. Talking of people he didn’t like, he moved on to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Jeffrey Epstein. “I’m not a drawing kind of guy,” he said.By now, time was beginning to seriously drag. Almost 70 minutes in and no sign of an ending. The Donald moved on to how he had spent £100m on expensive plywood while renovating the golf club. The Scottish tradesmen must have seen him coming. It looks like Trump has been stiffed. So much for the art of the deal.Keir was just willing the presser to come to an end so that the talks and his confused embarrassment could be kept private. Eventually he got his wish.Trump looked as if he could have gone on for another hour and a half. Still, good to get away to his other golf course in Aberdeen. Maybe he’d complete a round in 16 there.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

(Mine: always hire a professional to do your taxes and just accept you look best with a side part.)It’s tempting to imagine what we might have done differently. Unfortunately, wisdom tends to be hard-earned, and often only arises after a series of mistakes – like parting your hair in the middle for five years even though it makes you look like a potato.While personal wisdom takes time and patience to cultivate, we can always listen to what other astute people have learned over the years. For our seriesThe joys of ageing, we asked seven influential women what advice they would give their 30-year-old selves if they could go back in time.Julia CameronTeacher and authorView image in fullscreenJulia Cameron, teacher and author.Photograph: Florence MontmareI’d tell my 30-year-old self to write morning pages: three pages of longhand, morning writing, done daily.

I wasn’t going to be able to achieve, own, lease, marry well enough to feel fulfilled for any length of time. That I could stop dancing as fast as I could trying to fill up on all the prizes and rewards and glitter that the world had to offer – because it was outside of me, it was not of lasting value.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Joan MacDonaldTrainer and fitness influencerView image in fullscreenJoan MacdonaldPhotograph: Courtesy Joan MacdonaldI would have told myself to do everything I could do to make myself stronger, keep fit and be the best of what I could be.

But life doesn’t work that way. We earn our wisdom, year by year. Yes, I wish I had the overwhelming gratitude for our blue jewel of a planet at age 30, as I do now, at age 75. I wish I had been more forgiving of myself and my blunders. I wish I had been more tolerant of others’ blunders. We, all of us, are on an arc of personal evolution. Wisdom can’t be rushed. The only goal we can strive for is to eventually arrive at becoming the person we can admire.Sharon SalzbergAuthor and meditation teacherSharon Salzberg, author and meditation teacher.Photograph: Tawni BannisterThe understanding that would have been most helpful would have been something like: “When a door closes, another one can open.” No, I won’t go to journalism school after all – a long-held, quiet aspiration – but I’ve learned a lot contemplating the role of truth-telling, wise detachment and compassionate witnessing. I won’t still traipse around Asia as I began doing when I was 18, but I can have a vibrant sense of adventure, a strong love of learning and an ability to not excessively rely on creature comforts. I may not have so many firsts – like I’ve already had with my first book, my first recording, my first public talk to crowds of people. But you know what – I just might.Michelle YeohActorView image in fullscreenMichelle Yeoh, the best actress winner for Everything Everywhere All at Once, at the Academy Awards in 2023.Photograph: Mike Coppola/Getty ImagesWhat’s ahead will take courage, but you are ready.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s a scene in the documentary Motherboard in which life as a lone parent is very much going off the rails. While film-maker Victoria Mapplebeck is having treatment for breast cancer, her 14-year-old son Jim is partying hard and refusing to do his homework. After a huge row, he storms out. His mother recorded their subsequent phone call. “When he said he couldn’t wait to be old enough to move out, that was like a dagger through the heart,” she says. “That cancer year was when life’s difficult stuff was happening and I was filming the process all at the same time.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Back in 2004, when Mapplebeck found herself pregnant after a short romance with a man who wasn’t keen on being a father, she was all too aware of the Cyril Connolly quote about there being no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall. “So I trained my camera on that pram in order to find a way to combine life as a film-maker and a mother,” she says. Filmed over 20 years on a succession of phones,Motherboardis a doc that comes with equal amounts of jeopardy, trauma and humour.We first meet Jim as a foetus on an ultrasound screen, giving his mum-to-be the thumbs up. Over the following 90 minutes we see him grow into a warm-hearted young man with a gift for comedy. As a longitudinal project, the film has been compared to Michael Apted’s influential 1964 TV series Seven Up!, which followed the same 14 childrenover the yearsto see how their lives changed. It has also been likened to Richard Linklater’s 2014 coming-of-age feature Boyhood,made over 12 yearswith the same actors. But where those films were made by invisible directors seamlessly stitching together a narrative, Motherboard puts Mapplebeck centre frame with Jim, and shows her toggling between being a parent and a film-maker.Mapplebeck was a 38-year-old freelance TV director when she became pregnant. As this was hardly the most financially stable of jobs, she moved into teaching when she realised she would be bringing up a baby up on her own. As an innovator who had made thefirst C4 webcam series, Smart Hearts, back in 1999, her experience with virtual reality, self-shooting and using iPhones as cameras led to her becoming professor of digital media at Royal Holloway, University of London.Realising she missed film-making, Mapplebeck made the 2015 short 160 Characters,about the relationship that had led to Jim’s conception, using old text messages found on her redundant Nokia phone.160 Characterswas followed by another short,Missed Call,about Jim’s wish when he was 13 to meet his absent father. That film won a Bafta in 2019, but footage of the two of them going up on stage to collect the award doesn’t tell the whole story. Mapplebeck had been undergoing treatment for breast cancer and was worried she wouldn’t live long enough to see Jim grow up.View image in fullscreen‘We can talk honestly’ …a young Jim in Motherboard.Photograph: First Person FilmsShe had already started filming her year-long treatment as aVR projectfor the Guardian: “I’ve always looked at painful experiences through a lens and on the whole it’s helped. With cancer, you’ve got no control over it and you have to lean into that. It’s not about whether you’ve got a positive attitude as to what your outcome is, it’s in the lap of the gods. I wanted some sense of agency and decided to document this whole year of cancer treatment and explore its effect on family life.”Jim wasn’t sure at first: “Even if I was putting myself in her shoes, it still didn’t make sense. But what I slowly learned was that for every person, therapy looks very different. And I realised that putting a camera in front of it was my mum’s way of getting through it. I saw how positive it was for her, so then I was backing it.”Jim is now 21 and studying drama at university. He still lives in the south London flat his mother moved into before he was born. Closely involved with the film-making process throughout, he is credited as creative consultant on Motherboard. Talking alongside his mother, he remembers the 18-month edit: “It was quite a funny time because I’d have my life and you’d have yours. And I’d come back home and it’d be pitch black; you’d just been so busy all the lights would be off except the illuminated screen. And you would go, ‘Oh, could you watch this?’ I was regularly watching cuts and giving feedback about what I did and didn’t like. It was really cool.”Mapplebeck is at pains to stress the care taken to ensure that making the film didn’t add to Jim’s worries about the future: “The bad stuff and the very difficult moments, they’re not recorded live. And that was a very conscious decision. I didn’t come back from the oncologist and say to Jim, ‘OK, this is the diagnosis’, with the camera in his face. All of that is off-camera. But then days, weeks later, we’d record a kind of recap. I always felt it was a myth that it’s only going to be good if it’s live and you’re doorstepping. Having a bit of time to reflect made for really good material.”View image in fullscreen‘That year was when life’s difficult stuff was happening’ … Mapplebeck in hospital.Photograph: First Person FilmsJim comes through as a natural performer, whether singing his made-up songs as a charming toddler or acting in a school play. He admits: “I like being the main character – as an actor that is nice. And I feel lucky we can talk honestly.”Not everything seen on screen was filmed by Mapplebeck. Snatches of Jim’s life outside their flat – wading through muddy music festivals or partying with his friends – come from footage shot on his phone. Jim remembers: “Mum would be like, ‘Oh, could I get this?’ And it was nice including a lot of my friends because they will always be a very big part of my life, especially those years.”Motherboard also weaves in telephone calls and texts between mother and son, even when their relationship is at its most fraught during the cancer treatment and Covid restriction years. At one point Jim texts: “I can’t think straight any more, this year needs to fuck off”. Unlike mom influencers with their “sharenting” videos that stream their children’s antics almost-live online – and too often without their consent – Mapplebeck makes it clear that there were lengthy negotiations between her and Jim: “There were three years of showing Jim cuts. Asking, ‘What do you think? How would you feel about using this?’” She would put the phone in selfie mode and film them talking side by side: “You see us going back and forth about consent. There was the scene where Jim says, ‘Nineteen minutes you’ve been recording. Nineteen minutes gone! You’re a thief!’”View image in fullscreen‘I know I’ve got a dad out there, but I am very, very happy with my current family’ … Jim in Missed Call.Photograph: First Person FilmsThey agree that the toughest discussions were about using that phone call, recorded after their biggest argument: “You had stormed out and I didn’t know where you were and you were supposed to be going to your grandma’s and it was pre-vaccine. I was worried you’d infect her and you were screaming, ‘Shut up, shut up!’ It’s so visceral. Both of us knew it was really powerful. You kept on saying to me, ‘I think that people might hate me when they hear me talk to you like that.’”But at a test screening, Jim was reassured that the scene worked in the way that his mother intended: “It was quite a rite of passage because I think Jim really felt the love in the room. And he realised that people have either been that teenager or they’ve been that parent – or both – and that everybody got it. Nobody was judgmental or down on him, and that was a real turning point. Jim said to me, ‘You can’t make a film about parenting unless you show the shit stuff.’”“People can say I did the film to please my mum,” adds Jim, “but there was no devil on my shoulder saying, ‘Do this for her.’ If I hadn’t wanted to do the film, it wouldn’t have happened.”Mapplebeck received guidance fromOKRE(Opening Knowledge across Research and Entertainment) about protecting Jim, as well as legal advice on ensuring his father’s anonymity on screen. “I would not want internet sleuthery and I’ve never been interested in naming or shaming, or even being judgmental of his decisions. It was a real lightbulb moment for me when I thought, ‘I don’t want to try and get into his head.’View image in fullscreen‘You can’t make a film about parenting unless you show the bad stuff’ …mum and son today.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“I will never understand his own experiences and what led him to these decisions. The advice we’ve always had from lawyers and compliance people has been: ‘Yes, you can tell your story. You’ve got a right to your truth, a truthful and honest account of how this situation affected you.’”A 2013 study found that 13% of fathersreport having no contact with their children. Jim was 14 by the time he met his dad. They saw each other three times that year, and haven’t met since. Jim expresses ambivalence about him: “I don’t hate him at all. Don’t even dislike him. I just have a very neutral view, which is that he did what he did in his life. I’ve done what I’ve done in my life. I don’t want him to watch the film and regret anything. We all make choices, and I think, yeah, he might someday think that wasn’t the best choice, but I wouldn’t want him to feel like he should regret anything he’s done. I know I’ve got a dad out there, but I am very, very happy with my current family and there’s no guarantee that I would be who I was if he was in my life.”Motherboard is in cinemas 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s called women’s football and the LionessesAva VidalEven now, some want to downplay last night’s historic win, but the facts are plain. We yearn to be the best: palpably, our women are doing thatMon 28 Jul 2025 05.39 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareItfelt like deja vuwhen Chloe Kelly smashed the ball into the back of the net, winning the game for the Lionesses and signalling the end of the Women’s Euro 2025 final.England beat Spainafter a tense penalty shootout. The word of the tournament was “resilience”, declared presenter Gabby Logan after the game. It is hard to argue with that.It was as though the team had written a list of milestones they were ticking off as the tournament progressed. They are the first English senior team to defend their title, and the first to win a major tournament on foreign soil. Their coach, Sarina Wiegman, simply said: “A team is what we really are. We can win by any means.”And that positivity was infectious. They genuinely believed in themselves, and in turn we believed in them. When Lucy Bronze casually revealed she’dplayed the entire tournament with a fractured tibia– “If that’s what it takes to play for England, that’s what I’ll do” – it encapsulated the attitude that surrounds the whole team. Unlike with the men, we never questioned if any of the players even wanted to be there due to a lack of financial incentive given thatinternational matches pay so much less than club games do. I tried to work out what felt so different for me watching them rather than the men’s team. Not once did I give up hope. I never once had to “self-soothe” by cramming sugary snacks down my throat. There was no mental preparation for the inevitable disappointment of yet another loss.Amid the celebrations, a question: why are we continually chasing glory through our men’s teams when the women are the ones delivering? They have reached three major tournament finals in a row and have the level of success that the men’s team can only dream of. There is a disdain we see time and time again across different sports. The women’s rugby team have suffered the same kind of patronising attitude as well as those who compete on the track and field. The men’s 100m final is referred to as “the jewel in the crown” of track and field events: the women don’t get nearly as much attention.It wasn’t easy: it’s never easy. The Lionesses’ tournament was briefly marred by the widespread media coverage of the onlineracial abuse received by Jess Carterafter the admittedly dismal performance in that first game against France. But refusing to let that be the story, the Lionesses acted quickly, condemning the “online poison”, putting out a unified statement and announcing that they were opting to not take the knee before matches, as “we and football need a new way to tackle racism”.After the final, Carter revealed she had been next up to take a penalty had Kelly missed, confessing she hadn’t wanted to take it. Who could blame her? No one needs reminding ofthe racist abuse and death threats received by her male counterpartsMarcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and BukayoSaka during the Men’s Euro 2020 final. She also said she had been “disappointed” at how she had been painted during the tournament, but now “couldn’t give a damn”. The sweet taste of victory had clearly been enough to remove the bitterness left by the abuse.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Jess Carter, who received racist abuse and death threats during the tournament, fends off a challenge from Spain’s Esther González.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APThe 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, who had been a ballgirl at Wembley only four years ago, was named young player of the tournament in recognition of the fact that the goals she scored in the quarter-final against Sweden and the semi-final against Italy saved England from elimination. The fact that, days earlier,she had been left off a photo of the teamattached to a “good luck” message issued by the royal family didn’t seem to be on her mind at all.Today’s joy is infectious: for the nation, for the nation’s women. I can have a different conversation today with my daughter. We can talk about the team and what it is to be tough. We can talk about the naysayers, such as Piers Morgan’s 32-year-old son Spencer, who perhaps wants to be a contrarian just like his dad when he grows up, whoposted on X: “That shootout was the funniest thing I’ve seen since the last one. ‘Why can’t the men win?’ Because they’re playing against people capable of kicking a ball,” he said. The dinosaurs: they live, they tweet.I remember seeing an interview with theopera singer Kiri Te Kanawaafter her retirement, when she was asked what it had been like to live at the height of her glory days. She replied: “I hadn’t realised at the time that’s what they were.” For the Lionesses these are their glory days. Stop singing about “years of hurt” and enjoy their success. It’s everyone’s success.Ava Vidal is a standup comedian based in London and patron of the charity Show Racism the Red CardDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Based on television, I would say not particularly, because those children look very hungry.”He later added: “We can save a lot of people, I mean some of those kids. That’s real starvation; I see it and you can’t fake that. So we’re going to be even more involved.”Asked what he would ask Netanyahu for next time they spoke, Trump said: “We’re giving money and we’re giving food, but we’re over here … I want him to make sure they get the food. I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food.”Trump criticised Hamas for not releasing the remaining hostages and said the militant group was “very difficult to deal with”, while suggesting he had asked the Israeli government to change its approach. “I told Israel, I told Bibi, that you have to now maybe do it a different way,” he said.The president was speaking before a bilateral meeting with Starmer, who flew to Ayrshire to meet him on Monday. The two leaders were due to visit Trump’s second golf course in Aberdeenshire and have dinner together on Monday evening.Trump said he was “very disappointed” with Putin and was “not so interested in talking to him any more” because of his decision to continue airstrikes against civilian targets in Ukraine.“We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,” Trump said. “You have bodies lying all over the street, and I say that’s not the way to do it.”Trump said he would cut his 50-day deadline for a ceasefire to between 10 and 12 days before he imposed secondary sanctions on Russia’s trading partners.He piled pressure on Starmer to cut taxes and immigration, calling the prime minister and Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, “good men”.“I assume there’s a thing going on between you and Nigel and that’s OK,” Trump said. “But generally speaking, the one who cuts taxes the most, the one who gives you the lowest energy prices and the best kind of energy, the one that keeps you out of wars … I think the one that’s toughest and most competent on immigration is going to win the election.”Speaking alongside Trump, Starmer told the press conference that the British public were “revolted” at the “absolute catastrophe” in Gaza and said there was an urgent need for a ceasefire.Israel announced over the weekendthat it would suspend fighting in three areas of Gaza for 10 hours a day and open secure routes for aid delivery, while the UK confirmed it was working with Jordan to carry out airdrops into the territory.However on Monday at least 25 Palestinians were killed, including four children, when Israeli troops opened fire on people seeking aid from a truck convoy passing through the southern Gaza Strip, according to health officials and witnesses. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.Aid agencies say the new measures are not enough to counter worsening starvation in the territory.Martin Penner, a spokesperson for the UN food agency, told the Associated Press that all 55 of its aid trucks that entered on Monday were looted by starving people before they reached world food programme warehouses. Another UN official said nothing on the ground has changed and no alternative routes were allowed.In total at least 78 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire on Monday, local health officials said, including a pregnant woman and her baby, who was delivered after her death but also died.Starmer is due toconvene an emergency cabinet meetingon the humanitarian crisis in Gaza on Tuesday afternoon. Ministers will be presented with a peace plan which the UK is working up alongside France and Germany.The prime minister isunder pressure from senior cabinet ministers and more than 220 MPsto immediately recognise Palestine as a state, after Emmanuel Macron announced that France would do so at the UN general assembly in September. Trump dismissed the idea on Monday but suggested he had no objection to the UK or other allies doing so.Trump also said the US and its allies would set up “walk-in” food centres without barriers in the region, though he gave little detail about how these would operate.On Monday afternoon,about 100 protestersgathered in Balmedie, the closest village to Trump’s Aberdeenshire golf course, waving Palestinian flags and chanting: “You are not welcome here.”Kay Collin, a retired modern studies teacher, said she had made the trip from Edinburgh because “watching what is happening in Gaza, if it was happening to my grandchildren I would hope other people would stand up for them”.While many people cited the starvation crisis in Gaza as the most urgent reason for their protest, Trump’s policies on immigration, transgender rights and cuts to international aid, and there were placards and chants accusing him of misogyny and bullying behaviour.Jenna Harpin, a mother of four from Portsoy, said she was “disgusted” at how much money was being spent by the Scottish and UK governments on hosting Trump’s visit, especially at a time when local councils were making cuts to vital services.The protesters marched through the village as the police presence swelled in anticipation of Trump’s arrival. Local access had been significantly restricted with lines of police officers blocking off the beach and snipers spotted on the dunes.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGazaIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, more homes for sale, particularly across southern England, is re-enforcing a buyer’s market, keeping price rises in check.”While market activity usually slows during the summer, this is not happening this year. Buyer numbers in July are 11% higher than in the same month of 2024, resulting in an 8% increase in sales being agreed.Earlier this year property experts had reported a dampening effect on house price growth after the end of astamp duty holidayin England and Northern Ireland on 31 March. However, recent government-backed changes to the way lenders assessmortgage affordabilityhave served as a catalyst for increased activity, Zoopla said. Homebuyers using a mortgage can now borrow up to 20% more than they could as recently as three months ago.With mortgage rates “holding steady”, Donnell said: “Less stringent affordability testing has boosted buying power.”At the start of the year Zoopla predicted house prices would rise 2% in 2025, but it has cut this to 1%. While the index showed the annual rate of price inflation slowed to 1.3% in June, the report pointed to stark regional differences.While house prices in Scotland, Wales and northern England are experiencing faster growth – typically of 2-3% annually – prices are rising at a much slower rate in the south. Prices have risen by 0.2% in the south-east and London and by 0.3% in the south-west.The figure for the capital is pulled down by declines in some areas, including a fall of 1.5% in west London. Elsewhere in England, Truro, Torquay and Exeter registered some of the biggest declines, down 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.1% respectively.“Greater supply of homes for sale and mortgage rates remaining higher than expected are the key reasons for weaker growth,” Donnell said.New figures from Rightmove showed average asking rents across Britain, excluding London,rose 1.2% to a new record of £1,365 per month in the second quarter of 2025. The average advertised rate in the capital also reached a new high of £2,712, up 0.5% over the quarter.The property website’s report said the average monthly rent paid by new tenants was £417 more than in 2020. This is an uplift of 44%, outpacing a 36% rise in average earnings over the same period.However, much of this growth occurred at the height of the Covid pandemic. Since 2023, yearly rent rises have gradually slowed as supply and demand rebalanced. The number of available properties is now 15% higher than this time last year. However, it is still 29% below 2019’s level.The less frenzied market means landlords are taking longer to find tenants, in some cases leading to rent reductions. Nearly a quarter (24%) of asking rents were cut during marketing, the highest number since 2017.Rightmove’s property expert Colleen Babcock said despite rising asking rents, the “big picture is that yearly rent increases continue to slow”. “Supply and demand is slowly rebalancing towards more normal levels, though we still have a way to go before we reach pre-2020 levels,” she added.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketPropertyHousingMortgagesReal estateHouse pricesnewsShareReuse this content"

Many supporters had dressed for the Lionesses’ return, wearingEnglandkits and holding flags.Cheers erupted at the Essex airport as the plane approached the runway and again as the team emerged from the airport to walk along a red carpet waving at fans.The team’s captain, Leah Williamson, led the squad out of the private terminal just before 5pm, carrying the trophy. Among the fans were the twins Poppy and Daisy Macdonald, 11, from Benfleet, Essex, who were holding a sign asking for a photo with the star striker Alessia Russo.Poppy said: “We’re so proud. They’ve won it two times in a row and they’ve worked so hard for it. They’ve had a lot of injuries and setbacks but they’ve done really well.”Daisy admitted she struggled to watch the penalty shootout. “I couldn’t watch, I was very nervous, but very happy that they won,” she said.The players attended a celebratory reception at Downing Street, hosted by the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the sports minister, Stephanie Peacock.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman, the England manager, holds the trophy outside No 10 after the win in Basel.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianNo 10 was decorated for the occasion, with St George’s flags draped over windows and bunting along the railings. Welcoming the team, Rayner called it a “historic day for English football, for women’s sport – and for the country”.“The Lionesses have brought it home again,” she said. “With grit, and with determination and skill, you roared. And I know I wasn’t the only one roaring with you.“You’ve made us all so, so, proud. Your performances have inspired the nation and lifted women’s football to new heights … Role models like you send such a powerful message. The Lionesses are a shining example of a talent and excitement of women’s football.“This win is a brilliant advert for the sport and will inspire thousands of girls to dream big,” she added. “The next generation of Lionesses are out there now – playing in schools, parks, and grassroots clubs.”“It was amazing. I just burst out crying just in pure emotion,” said one fan waiting outside the black gates in front of Downing Street. “Just that little girl inside of me watching football when I was younger and seeing how far the game has grown since then, it all just kind of got to me.”Another fan waiting to get a peek of the team had only just come back from Switzerland to watch the team romp to the final. Izzy said seeing the players arrive at Downing Street was an opportunity that could not be missed.“For me there wasn’t really a doubt that they were going to win, but it was still really stressful,” said the 30-year-old, who asked not to share her surname after calling in sick to work to celebrate the Lionesses’ victory.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson leaving the team’s hotel in Zurich while carrying the trophy on Monday.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAAs a former player herself, she travelled to London alone and is staying in the capital for Tuesday’s open-top bus tour.

Back in Januarythe government approved the £28.6m investmentto support the reopening of the mine, which is being led by Redruth-based Cornish Metals.Cornish tin was sold all over Europe 3,000 years ago, say archaeologistsRead moreDon Turvey, the chief executive of Cornish Metals, said: “Tin is a critical mineral for the clean energy transition, essential to electronics, electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure. By reviving domestic production at South Crofty, we’re not only creating over 300 direct jobs but also supporting many more across local supply chains and regional businesses.”The government estimates that a further 1,000 jobs will be created as the company uses more local suppliers such as metal fabricators and electricians, and supports supply chains in the UK.After operating for more than 400 years, South Crofty was the last tin mine to close in the UK due to lack of investment andfalling metal prices in the 1990s.However, there has been a rise in prices over the past decade – from $16,000 (£11,957) a tonne in 2016 to about $34,000 – with tin used as solder in consumer electronics and other sectors, including electric cars and solar cells.“Despite having so much potential to grow, Cornwall has been neglected by successive governments, and its families and businesses have suffered as a result,” Reeves said. “Like in every part of the UK, I am determined to unlock growth that creates jobs and puts more money in Cornish people’s pockets.”The government made the investment through the national wealth fund, supporting its industrial strategy to boost growth in priority industries.Ian Brown, the head of banking and investment at the national wealth fund, said: “Cornish Metals have made excellent progress as they work towards reopening South Crofty. Our financing is designed to help them crowd further investment into the region, bringing skilled, year-round opportunities, and driving local growth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with five-year survival rates ranging from approximately 5% to 30%. We risk seeing close to a doubling of cases and deaths from liver cancer over the next quarter of a century without urgent action to reverse this trend.”Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death. The number of deaths is predicted to grow from 760,000 in 2022 to 1.37 million in 2050.Previous analyses have predicted that the number of new liver cancer cases will nearly double from 870,000 in 2022 to 1.52m in 2050, mostly due to population growth and ageing populations, with the largest increases expected in Africa. At present, more than 40% of the global liver cancer cases occur in China due to its relatively high rates of hepatitis B infections.One of the fastest growing causes of liver cancer globally is fatty liver disease, and this is expected to rise because of increasing rates of obesity.One-third of the global population is estimated to have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) – previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where fat builds up in a person’s liver – though it can be prevented by eating a balanced diet, being physically active and potentially losing weight.Only 20% to 30% of people with MASLD go on to develop the more severe form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to liver cancer. The commission said the proportion of liver cancer cases associated with MASH was projected to increase from 8% in 2022 to 11% in 2050.The second fastest growing cause is alcohol, with associated liver cases projected to increase from 19% in 2022 to 21% in 2050. In contrast, the proportion of liver cancer cases linked to hepatitis B is expected to decrease from 39% in 2022 to 37% in 2050, while hepatitis C-related cases are projected to drop from 29% to 26%.The commission author Prof Hashem B El-Serag of Baylor College of Medicine in the US said: “Liver cancer was once thought to occur mainly in patients with viral hepatitis or alcohol-related liver disease. However, today, rising rates of obesity are an increasing risk factor for liver cancer, primarily due to the increase in cases of excess fat around the liver.”The commission’s recommendations included that governments boost HBV vaccination and implement universal screening for adults; introduce minimum alcohol unit pricing and sugar taxes along with warning labels; invest in early detection of liver damage and cancer; and improve palliative care for sufferers.The commission author Prof Valérie Paradis of Beaujon hospital in France said: “There is an urgent need to raise awareness within society about the severity of the growing health issue of rising liver cancer cases.“Compared with other cancers, liver cancer is very hard to treat but has more distinct risk factors, which help define specific prevention strategies. With joint and continuous efforts, we believe many liver cancer cases can be prevented, and both the survival and quality of patients with liver cancer will be considerably improved.”Dr Matt Hoare, an associate professor in hepatology at the University of Cambridge’s EarlyCancerInstitute, said liver cancer was “unlike many other cancers” in that the death rate was still rising, with the causes varying by region.He said public health policy changes have proven effective, since Japan had successfully reduced its death rate by implementing preventive policies and improving detection to find cancers earlier. His team is seeking to identify new ways to spot patients with liver disease who will develop cancer through DNA sequencing of the liver.Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthObesityVaccines and immunisationHealth policyHepatitis BHepatitis CnewsShareReuse this content"

Wilson, who has worked with the broadcaster for years, said he had “never heard Sir David deliver a sequence as good as that … it sort of brings a lump to your throat … he’s the master at delivery”.The combination of Attenborough’s words, atmospheric music by the Mulan and Ted Lasso composer Tom Howe (which “adds to the whole horror”) and painstaking filming to capture the spiders in their nest, is “probably one of the best” sequences Wilson said he had worked on in 30 years of film-making, but will also chill parents “to the bone”.He joked: “There will not be a parent of the land who won’t turn up to school pickup without snacks ever again!”The spiderling matricide scene is likely to spark debate among parents about the sacrifices they make for their offspring; scientists think the ageing mother spiders deliberately make similar vibrations to those of insects caught in a web so their children prey on their decaying bodies to ensure the youngsters’ survival.The footage may also become a breakout moment in the way Planet Earth II’s“iguana v snakes”did and provoke discussion about thegeneration wars: the spiderlings eating all their elderly relatives so only the younger generation remains in the nest is a situation that some millennials keen to get on the property ladder may take note of.Wilson said: “It makes one feel quite sort of chilled to the bone that you know that your own young could do that. It’s an extraordinary behaviour [but] when you step away from it and from the horror of it, it sort of makes sense.”Filmed over three years on six continents in conjunction with scientists, the five-part Parenthood is the firstBBCnatural history series about parenting and also looks at how animals are adapting to ensure their children can survive in the face of climate breakdown.View image in fullscreenDr Tharina Bird helps the crew as they film matriphagy in spiders for the first time.Photograph: BBC/Silverback Films/Pete CaylessThat affected the producer Silverback Films’ shooting plans. “Some of the things that we set out to film were extremely difficult to pin down, simply because the climate is changing around all of our locations and the behaviours that you would normally expect at certain times of year are changing,” Wilson said.The “fieldcraft” skill required by Silverback’s camera crews was immense due to the “intimate, delicate relationship between parent and offspring”, which meant ensuring the animals were not disturbed.New methods of filming were used – such as military-grade, infrared cameras mounted on gimbals on off-road vehicles – to enable filming of hippos being chased by lions at night.Wilson thinks such fieldcraft means artificial intelligence will never replicate the “serendipity” of natural history TV: “There are things that happen in the natural world, whatever behaviour you’re going to film, that outweigh any scripting process or anything that one could design, you know, through AI or through a computer.“There is more magic out there than anybody understands or even believes in.

Bonmatí thumped the ball hard and left, but Hampton was there, arms outstretched,to block the shotwith both hands.“Better pens than the last time, let’s be honest!” Hampton said after the match, a reference to the more painful shootout against Sweden in the quarter-final that went to sudden death before England prevailed. Hamptonsaved two penaltiesthat time, too.It was an extraordinary tournament for Hampton, the Chelsea player who only became England’s first choice goalie in Mayafter the retirement of Mary Earpsfrom international football. Hampton’s penalty-saving record is perhaps even more impressive given that doctors told her that, because of an eye condition, she wouldn’t be able to play football.Hampton was born with strabismus, or a squint, meaning that when she was looking at an object with one eye, the other would be looking in another direction. It was severe enough that she had three operations by the age of three to correct the misalignment. The surgery was not a complete success: Hampton told the i paper in 2022 how she would try to pour juice into a glass and miss if she wasn’t holding it.During a medical check-up at Stoke City, when Hampton was 12, doctors diagnosed another problem. She had impaired depth perception, meaning she struggles to tell how far away objects are. It is often seen in patients with strabismus.“Depth perception requires our eyes to be aligned, really from birth, and also for the visual input from the two eyes to be equal,” says Prof Jugnoo Rahi, an ophthalmic epidemiologist at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of ChildHealth. If children have misaligned eyes, the brain suppresses the input from one eye because the brain cannot cope with double vision. “If that goes on for a long time, if you can’t align the eyes through surgery, for example, then you get permanently reduced vision in one eye,” she adds.But children who have limited depth perception grow up using other cues, the most obvious being that objects appear smaller when further away. It’s often the finer perception tasks that are most affected – threading a needle more than intercepting a speeding football. “People do learn,” Rahi says, “And I suspect if you’re also particularly talented and your hand-eye coordination is good, you may be better able to overcome that.”From Stoke City to Aston Villa and Chelsea, Hampton has certainly learned. After countless bloody noses and broken fingers from stopping the ball too near her face, or having her hands in the wrong position, she made a conscious effort to alter her hand position. It hasn’t stopped all the blood: in extra time against Sweden, a collision left her with absorbent tissue up her right nostril.Hampton might be compensating in other ways, too. Setting aside the notes she had taped to her arm before the shootout with Spain – evidence she had done her homework – Hampton might be finely attuned to the subtle cues penalty takers reveal. And given the fraction of a second a goalie has to respond once the ball is kicked, these might be more important than depth perception.In his book,The Penalty Kick: the Psychology of Success, Prof Daniel Memmert at the German Sport University in Cologne dissects the science of the art. Body movement is particularly revealing, he says. When a right-footed striker aims for the left corner, the supporting leg, hip and upper body all start to rotate to the left. If the goalie is looking, “they can anticipate the direction of the penalty”, he says. “It’s extremely difficult not to move the limbs like this if you are going for the left corner, and good goalies have this picture.” Often, such cues are picked up subconsciously, he adds.And then there are the tricks goalies can play. When goalies make themselves big – throwing their arms out in a Y-shape – strikers tend to shoot closer to the goalie. But it’s not the only tactic. “One of the most important factors is that you make the striker feel that one of the corners has a little more space,” says Memmert.If the goalie stands slightly off centre – no more than 10cm left or right – a penalty taker who is still making up their mind will often shoot to the side with slightly more room. Even if they cannot perceive the extra space. If a goalie knows a striker favours one side, making a little more room can nudge them more in that direction, giving the goalie an advantage. “It’s the best trick a goalie can do because the striker will never know if the goalie is standing exactly in the middle or not,” says Memmert.Explore more on these topicsScienceEngland women's football teamHealthEnglandWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nabil’s name has been changed.Here is the letter, which was written in Arabic and translated by the author using Google Translate, in full:Warm greetings,I am writing to you from a deeply human perspective, hoping to share a point of view that is often overlooked in public discourse and media coverage about refugees.We, as refugees, are frequently labeled with harmful stereotypes – that we came only for benefits, that we live off taxpayers, or that we are uneducated or disrespectful. These assumptions hurt us, hinder our integration, and most importantly, do not reflect the truth.I want to be honest: yes, there are some refugees who do not behave respectfully or who do not follow the rules of the host society. But those individuals do not represent all of us. As with any group of people, there are both good and bad – and it is unfair to judge the majority by the actions of a few.I did not come here seeking wealth or running from poverty. In fact, I had a stable life back in my country, Yemen. I had a job, a house, a car, and everything I needed to live with dignity. What forced me to leave was not economic hardship, but persecution and fear for my safety and the safety of my family.We refugees are not here to take advantage of the system. We are here to rebuild our lives, to work, and to contribute. We will pay taxes like anyone else, not to “drain the system”, but because we believe that mutual respect and responsibility are the foundation of any strong and united society.This letter is not a plea for sympathy, but a call for understanding and fairness. I believe the media plays a vital role in breaking down stereotypes and presenting the truth. I hope you can be a voice for fairness and show the world that every refugee has a story – and every human being deserves dignity.With sincere appreciation,NabilFrom YemenExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEssexEnglandYemennewsShareReuse this content"

At a press conference at his Ayrshire resort announcing a trade deal with the EU this weekend, Trump launched into an unprompted tirade against windfarms, instructing European countries to get rid of theirs. He was visiting Turnberry for the first time since the nearby onshore Kirk Hill windfarm began producing energy from eight turbines.But were his comments about wind power correct?Trump’s war on windmills started in Scotland. Now he’s taking it globalRead moreIt’s the ‘most expensive form of energy’View image in fullscreenDonald Trump plays a round at Turnberry golf club on Sunday.Photograph: Hugo Philpott/UPI/ShutterstockTrump claimed: “It is the worst form of energy, the most expensive form of energy, but windmills should not be allowed.”This is certainly not true for onshore wind, which ischeap to buildand generates electricityvery inexpensively. Offshore windfarms cost more to build but, when it is windy, produce electricity extremely cheaply. There are costs associated with wind; the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has recentlyfaced criticismfor setting the maximum price at his upcoming renewable energy auction at £113 a megawatt-hour for offshore wind, for record-length contracts of 20 years.By comparison, the wholesale gas price is £78/MWh at present. However, during the price spike of 2022, wholesale gas went above £170/MWh. Because Britain’s electricity grid has not been sufficiently updated, windfarms are also often paidmillions to switch offwhen it is very windy to avoid overloading the network.However, even with these added costs, offshore wind is less expensive than nuclear to build, has a stable price compared with gas, which is sold on international markets, and ischeaper to generatethan fossil fuels.Turbines drive whales ‘loco’View image in fullscreenIt does not appear there is direct evidence that offshore windfarms frequently cause whale deaths.Photograph: Klaus Thymann/REX/ShutterstockTrump has often claimed that offshore wind kills whales and drives them crazy.It is tricky to make definitive claims about whether or not whales are driven “loco” by offshore wind, as many aspects of whale behaviour are not well understood by scientists. However, it does not appear there is direct evidence that offshore windfarms frequently cause whale deaths. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationhas said:“There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”Whales could be disturbed during the initial stages of offshore-wind construction. High-resolution geophysical surveys to map the seafloor are carried out that could disturb marine mammals. However, these are much smaller in scale than those conducted for oil and gas exploration.Most of the known direct causes of whale deaths are related to the fishing industry, with the mammal caught in or ingesting fishing equipment. The warming and acidification of oceans caused by global heating from burning fossil fuels is also a threat to whales’ survival.They kill birdsTrump said windfarms “kill the birds”, and this is true, to an extent. Birds can collide with the turbines, and offshore windfarms are sometimes constructed in important feeding sites for seabirds such as puffins as they are put in shallow waters where sand eels are found.However, the proportion of birds killed by turbines istiny compared withthe amount killed, for example, by domestic cats and from flying into power lines. Destroying bird habitat and poisoning their foodwith pesticideshas also had a greater impact on populations than the prevalence of wind turbines.Some wind companies are taking action to become less lethal to birds; a project in Norwaypainted its turbines black, which resulted in 70% fewer bird deaths.Turbines only last eight years before having to be binnedView image in fullscreenWind turbines have a typical lifespan of 20-25 years, and the industry is getting better at recycling old parts.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianTrump claimed: “When they start to rust and rot in eight years you can’t really turn them off, you can’t burn them. They won’t let you bury the propellers, the props, because there’s a certain type of fibre that doesn’t go well with the land.”This is not true. Wind turbines have atypical lifespanof 20-25 years, and the industry is getting better at recycling old parts; according to the National Grid, 96% of a wind turbine is made from recyclable materials. Their outer shell, shafts, gearing and electrical components are typically made from steel, copper, aluminium, other precious metals and recyclable plastics. The blades are made from fibreglass, which is not biodegradable and is indeed typically sent to landfill. However, scientists have found a way to repurpose them into cement, and the blades have been used to create pedestrian footbridges in Ireland and noise barriers for highways in the US.They’re made in ChinaHe’s right on this one; China accounts for about 60% of global wind turbine manufacturing. However, the country dominates the rest of the globe on most manufacturing, so this isn’t a surprise.The UK wind manufacturing sector isgrowing aspart of the green economy, providing jobs in post-industrial areas in particular.They’re ‘killing us’Trump claimed wind turbines were killing people. There have been a handful of human deaths linked to turbines, but these are construction accidents. Deaths are not uncommon in many big industries, includingoil and gas, but wind turbines do not pose a fatal threat to the general public.Explore more on these topicsWind powerDonald TrumpRenewable energyEnergyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Or eat a sandwich. Or look at trampolines. I knew it would change how I see others – watching people die tends to do that. But nearly 10 years in, I’ve realised how much it’s quietly altered my day-to-day life.Being a paramedic makes you see danger everywhere, so you avoid risks because you’re always expecting you’ll need to spring into action, even when you’re not in uniform. Once you’ve seen as many stretchers loaded with avoidable disasters as I have, you end up wired differently, and always brace for the next catastrophe.I can’t walk into cafes, living rooms or kids’ birthday parties without conducting a risk assessment. I look for the nearest exits and sharp corners and often wonder if that defibrillator sitting on the wall covered in dust still works.I worked as a triple zero call-taker for six months. It hardened my heart and changed my view of humanity | Bunny BanyaiRead moreAt a party I once caught a toddler chewing on a deflated helium balloon. His parents were deep into their fourth round of Aperol spritzes, so I had to gently explain to them that a balloon can block an airway faster than you can sing Happy Birthday.It’s from experience more than from anxiety. A loose paver. Stray grapes. A poorly timed bomb into a pool. You stop seeing everyday life as nonthreatening once you’ve spent 45 minutes tearing apart someone’s lounge room on your hands and knees looking for a button battery in the hope it’s not halfway down a digestive tract.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve been to too many scenes where someone came off second-best to physics,’ Booth says of the risk of jumping on trampolines.Photograph: Svetlana Repnitskaya/Getty ImagesI will never again get on a motorbike, or on a trampoline. No judgment to the people who ride them. Or bounce on them. But I’ve been to too many scenes where someone came off second-best to physics. Motorbikes and trampolines both offer the illusion of freedom – right until the moment your femur is split into six parts.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOne of my first traumatic jobs involved a man who was clipped at an intersection. His helmet survived but his spinal cord didn’t. I’ve seen legs detached, ribcages shattered and vital organs thrown three metres from where they belonged.Trampolines have morbid minds of their own. I once treated a child who launched clean off the mat and on to a garden stake. Now, every time I see someone weaving through traffic in shorts and thongs – or letting their kid somersault unsupervised on a back yard trampoline – I think: “That’s too much paperwork for my day off.” I guess you could call it pattern recognition.I don’t touch recreational drugs – not that I would have anyway – because I’ve seen what happens when people assume their party cocaine isn’t laced with fentanyl. The Pulp Fiction-style overdoses aren’t fiction any more. And after watching the ketamine I’ve administered turn people into catatonic zombies, I’ve got no desire to try it myself (unless I take up trampolining and end up with a fractured femur).View image in fullscreen‘Death doesn’t scare me any more. I’ve just learned to see it coming because I’ve seen it turn up in all the places you don’t expect’But just as I’ve learned to fear what others overlook, I’ve also stopped worrying about some of the things that send everyone else into a panic. I’ve lost count of the number of people who’ve called an ambulance because their smartwatch told them their heart rate was “elevated” or “irregular”. Some were convinced they were having a heart attack because the little waveform on the screen looks vaguely medical, as if a cheap wrist sensor compares to our $50,000 ECG machines. It’s usually anxiety. Or coffee.We also get alerts triggered by watches mistaking burpees for car accidents, or older people dropping their watches on the tiles and the sensor thinking they’ve fallen. It’s becoming the new version of rolling on to your VitalCall pendant in your sleep. I’m not anti-technology. I think these devices have their uses. But increasingly, people are outsourcing common sense to apps. Algorithms don’t do context.View image in fullscreenMaybe strapping on and plugging into these devices is our attempt to control life’s inevitable chaos, as if a notification might keep death at bay. But I’ve seen too much in my time to believe that kind of insurance is possible.Death doesn’t scare me any more. I’ve just learned to see it coming because I’ve seen it turn up in all the places you don’t expect. Like during a jog. Or in a McDonald’s toilet. Even halfway through mowing the lawn. I just assume the universe is indifferent.If anything, this has made me calm. Because I’m useful in a crisis, I’m more patient with people who panic over minor things. If someone cuts their hand on a poorly stacked knife in the dishwasher, I don’t stress. I grab a tea towel and tell them if they apply some pressure, they’ll live.You Went to Emergency For What?by Tim Booth is out now (Pan Macmillan Australia, $36.99)Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleWork & careersHealth & wellbeingHealth (Australia news)Health (Society)Emergency servicesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What is it? Have you had your hair done?That’ll be my new tinted lip balm – I’ve succumbed to thelipstick effect.You’ve done what now?I bought a luxury lip balm to make myself feel better about everything and I’m not alone:according to the Times, the market research organisation Circana has just reported that despite, or rather because of, the cost of living crisis, British consumers are “splashing out on affordable luxuries like lipstick and other beauty buys to boost their mood”, with “prestige lip” product sales up 16% to £80.4m in the first half of this year.And that’s the lipstick effect, is it?Yes. The phrase “lipstick index” was popularised in 2001 by Leonard Lauder of cosmetics giant Estée Lauder, who noticed that lipstick sales across the company rose 11% after 9/11.Isn’t there a similar theory about skirts?It’s not quite the same: thehemline index, invented by economist George Taylor in 1926, was the theory that skirts got shorter in boom times and longer during a recession.Data suggeststhere is some truth to that, but it lags three years behind economic reality, so it doesn’t tell you anything useful about the economy.So what about the lipstick effect– is that real?Well,cosmetics sales increased 25%during the Great Depression, too, and researchers found that during the 2008 crash there was “a significant increase in average cosmetics expenditures among younger women (age 18-40)”. So, something might be going on.I don’t understand why youwould buy lipstick when the economy is circling the drain.Because it makes you feel better, dummy. In 2020,a research teamexplored whether lipstick purchasers in recessions might be trying to “increase their attractiveness in order to find a mate” or boost their employment prospects, but concluded that they really just wanted a cheaper treat than clothes.So this is another iteration of “little treat culture”.Probably:bougie condimentandfancy snack salesare also booming as people cut back on eating out. It’s not surprising that when times are tough, people replace big splurges with small, affordable luxuries to keep their spirits up.Not surprising but fiscally irresponsible.

So irresponsible.Your lips look awfully pale and thin when you purse them like that – I recommend a swipe of ultra-hydrating kissable berry balm.Do say:“I needed a little treat and this balmbuilds well to create a subtle, flattering, just-bitten lip effect.”Don’t say:“Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s an irrational response to impending global recession.”Explore more on these topicsMakeupPass notesLipstickBeautyUK cost of living crisisConsumer affairsEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Discuss with spoilersThe franchise flat pack has been ditched for something weirder, warmer and more self-contained. So, what did you make of this retro sci-fi bedtime story?This article contains spoilers for The Fantastic Four: First StepsBen ChildMon 28 Jul 2025 08.04 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 08.05 EDTShareThe Fantastic Four: First Steps is a curious hybrid: part Jetsons fever dream, part nuclear family therapy session, part cosmic horror birthing video. It ditches Marvel’s usual franchise flat-pack assembly for something weirder, warmer and vastly more self-contained: a superhero movie that unfolds like a retro sci-fi bedtime story, then ends with a glowing new mum hurling an invasive space god into a binbag full of stars.This is a Fantastic Four movie that finally figures out why the team works – not because they’re the strongest or the smartest, but because they’re messy, human and weirdly functional in the face of total annihilation. Yes, the fate of this gloriously future-retro version of Earth (828) is at stake. Yes, someone gives birth to a child that (at least in the comics) is basically a deity. But the thing you’ll remember is the squabbling, the love, and the actual screen chemistry.It’s not flawless – the midsection wanders like it’s looking for a post-credits tease that never arrives – but for long stretches it plays like the best origins movie Marvel has made in years: a superhero film with heart, smarts, and bonkers space Dada. Here’s what makes it tick.Finally, a Marvel movie that doesn’t feel like homeworkOne of the greatest things about First Steps is how refreshingly normal it feels to watch a Marvel film with a beginning, middle and end. No portals to Phase Seven, no Hulk cameo to remind you that everything’s connected, and that the entire movie might well end up as just emotional scaffolding for a Disney+ series about Ant-Man’s aunt. Just four people, one suspiciously powered infant and retro-futurist weirdness.Would you agree that Marvel’s decision to set the film in an alternate universe where extraterrestrial space travel and flying car technology has somehow been achieved by the 1960s has paid off in spades? It certainly adds Apollo-era colour and chrome-plated optimism to an episode that could easily have been just another murky slab of multiversal franchise soup.Most importantly though, director Matt Shakman delivers a Fantastic Four who actually – finally – deserve the moniker of Marvel’s first family. Reed Richards is a man so pathologically rational he sees parenthood as a physics problem; Johnny Storm is a flame-powered himbo who somehow still nails the movie’s major emotional beats; Sue Storm is the stabilising force of the group; and Benjamin Grimm is a sad slab of sentient gravel who delivers the film’s most moving lines through a mouthful of misery and granite-hard Brooklyn stoicism. All basic stuff, you might think but something that no one has even got close to achieving before with this particular superhero team.Sue Storm finally gets a character arcView image in fullscreenWho run the world? … Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman.Photograph: Marvel Studios/20th Century Studios and Marvel StudiosPrevious attempts to bring Marvel’s first family to the big screen always seemed to give us an Invisible Woman who spent most of the movie reacting to male genius or bickering with her brother. By contrast, Vanessa Kirby’s version announces herself as a major force: a superhero capable of taking on Galactus, tempering Reed’s more unhinged techno-saviour spirals, and holding the emotional centre of the team. She’s not sidelined or fridged while the boys save the world. She’s proactive, pragmatic and crucial to the team’s survival. It’s Storm’s force-fielded stand against the oncoming god-storm that ultimately tips the balance – not Reed’s madcap equations or Ben’s giant rocky fists. For once, the Invisible Woman doesn’t disappear.The Fantastic Four: First Steps review – Marvel regains buoyancy with wacky superhero family sitcomRead moreWith great power comes terrifying childcareView image in fullscreenGurgling god … Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) and Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) with Ada Scott (baby Franklin Richards).Photograph: Marvel Studios/APOne of the strangest – and weirdly most moving – aspects of First Steps is the way it frames the reality of Sue’s pregnancy and baby Franklin Richards’ impending birth not just as a plot device, but as a full-blown meditation on the terror of newfound parental responsibility. Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman are far from the first parents trying to understand the scary implications of raising something they can barely comprehend: all mums and dads know that the universe is about to change forever. The difference this time (as we know from the comics) is that the little bundle of joy in question isn’t just a baby: he’s a cooing, gurgling multiversal reset button in the shape of a very small god.The movie doesn’t oversell this shift with soft-focus sentiment. There are no cheesy monologues about motherhood, no slow-motion cradle shot. But what it does capture – with more resonance than most Marvel films manage – is the panic, awe, and overwhelming love that comes with the arrival of something entirely new.Galactus, the Silver Surfer, and the moment Marvel remembered how to do cosmic horrorView image in fullscreenA chrome-faced angel of annihilation … Julia Garner as the Silver Surfer.Photograph: Marvel Studios/APWould you agree that the studio has seriously upped its supervillain game this time around? Julia Garner’s Shalla-Bal is spellbinding as a chrome-faced angel of annihilation – she glides into view like a brushed-steel omen. And then there’s her gargantuan boss Galactus – less a villain, more a celestial extinction event. How do you counter something so vast, so ancient, and so cosmically indifferent that it makes human fear feel like background noise. While Thanos committed mass murder with the cold, binary efficiency of a guy solving an overcrowded bus schedule, Galactus doesn’t even bother with motive. He isn’t evil – he’s entropy in a helmet, a planetary digestive system with vague opinions on balance.First Steps might be the closest the MCU has come to genuine cosmic horror – not just a threat that’s big and powerful, but something unmistakably Lovecraftian: eerily unknowable, disturbingly inscrutable, and fundamentally indifferent – like being judged by a black hole. It was probably inevitable that the only way to defeat the devourer of worlds was to chuck him through a portal into who-knows-where and make him (at least temporarily) somebody else’s problem. But how long before he comes back hungry to turn Avengers: Doomsday into the comic-book movie equivalent of La Grande Bouffe?Doctor Doom’s fascination with Franklin – and the seeds of Avengers: DoomsdayView image in fullscreenFledgling force … Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman with Ada Scott as Franklin Richards.Photograph: Marvel Studios/20th Century Studios and Marvel StudiosIt’s clear from the way Reed describes his son in First Steps that this baby might be just as powerful on screen as he is in print. If he’s able to bring his mother back to life after her brush with Galactus, might he also be capable of creating entirely new worlds, and breaking down the boundaries between different universes, using just the power of his mind? (He certainly can in the comics.) Is that why Doctor Doom appears to be so interested in the mid-credits scene, set four years after the events of the film? He doesn’t say a word, but the way he watches the child – now a toddler – suggests malevolent intent.Whiteboard warrior: Marvel is priming Mister Fantastic to be the new leader of the AvengersRead moreShakman has already confirmed thatisRobert Downey Jr in the suit inFirst Steps, but we’re still not 100% certain that this version of the supervillain is the same one who will turn up in next year’s Avengers: Doomsday. Is he a Tony Stark variant (explaining the casting) or is it a complete coincidence that he looks exactly like Iron Man? Does this scene directly set up the next film? Or is this just an example of Marvel distraction tactics? It would be uncharacteristically direct for the Disney-owned comic book studio to show its hand so clearly: Doom kidnapping Franklin and inspiring a multiversal rescue mission feels more like fan fiction than Phase 6 strategy. But this would certainly explain the sight at the tail end of Thunderbolts* of a retro-finned rocket, painted conspicuously in what appears to be Baxter Foundation white, heading towards the solar system. And how else are the supervillain (if it is the same version of him) and our heroes supposed to make the jump to Earth-616? Smoke and mirrors, or clear signposting for the next movie?

Cunard’s Queen Victoria, for example, although launched in 2007, feels like a 1980s reimagining of the liners of the early 20th century; think Titanic, complete with bellhop boys standing to attention as you embark, afternoon tea and grandiose, wood veneered, art deco-themed decor throughout. In Cunard’s publicity the term “voyage” is often quietly substituted for “cruise” with the implication that the latter has overtones of vulgarity that are best avoided.View image in fullscreenThat this is indeed a huge industry becomes apparent with one peek from the carpeted corridors through the service doors to the functional areas. No glamour here, just echoing metal staircases, laundries, kitchens and steel workstations populated by the hundreds of diligent, ever-smiling staff who keep the show on the road. It’s reminiscent of a massive beehive: the 2,000 occupants of the ship are fed, watered, tidied, cleaned and cooled. If necessary, the dead are removed; this unhappy outcome is not unlikely given the advanced age of many passengers and the fact that we are experiencing a heatwave.View image in fullscreenBell boys attend to passengersBut cruising involves a series of such collisions between fantasy and reality. Getting on to the ship is the first problem: with formal attire de rigueur for the evenings and gala nights, suitcases are bulging and cumbersome; in addition cruisers – sorry voyagers – have to manage hanging bags containing their tuxedos and evening wear. In the days of freely available porterage this would not be a problem, but passengers manhandle all their luggage, heaving suitcases on to security belts, trundling them across the tarmac in the scorching heat. Many arrive in their staterooms bathed in sweat. The same applies on return to the ship after every day in port, even unencumbered with baggage. In temperatures above 30C, it is a slog getting from the terminal buildings to the gangway. There, overheated daytrippers are met by Cunard staff handing out glasses of iced water and cold towels. The captain’s evening address from the bridge contains the words “welcome home” a nod to the sense of relief one feels entering the cool.View image in fullscreenThe rooms on the Queen VictoriaThe term “stateroom” is amusing if, like us, you opt for the cheaper, inside option. No windows, functional decor, minuscule bathroom; the traditional-style bedside lights and blue and gold velvet cushions cannot distract from the cabin’s undeniable pokiness. As one friend remarked on viewing a photo of our room: “Are you staying in an institution for young offenders?” The advantage of this kind of room is that it is easy to get to sleep. You enter a womb: warm, dark, with the reassuring sound of the ship’s engine throbbing like the maternal heartbeat.View image in fullscreenArt gallery onboard the linerBrief glimpses through open doors on the other side of the corridor reveal another life altogether: cabins with balconies, sofas, champagne in ice buckets, light and space. Slowly one realises that cruising reframes the entire class system. The voyage is no longer the domain of toffs and sophisticates – despite the marketing. It is nothing to do with breeding or extreme wealth and everything to do with brand loyalty. Some people clock up two or three cruises a year, happily claiming the associated upgrades, discounts on wifi and numerous other perks such as a drink with the captain. The highest echelon Princess or Queen Grill-status passengers enjoy superior facilities, exclusive eating places and other advantages that we can only dream of.View image in fullscreenSunbathing on deckView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSome voyagers display traditional signs of their superiority: understated linen outfits, expensive sunglasses, authentic panama hats, leather holdalls and an aloof manner. But these are truly in the minority. Most cruisers hail from all walks of life and dress accordingly. In some parts of the ship, notably the pool areas and the pub, quizzes, karaoke, and round-the-clock sport on the big screen add to the package holiday atmosphere. We could be in a budget hotel on the Costas.View image in fullscreenA couple at the Lido buffetThis floating Wetherspoon’s – as one person termed it – has a dedicated eating place: the Lido, which houses a massive all-you-can-eat buffet throughout the day and into the night. Unlike the other eateries, the Lido welcomes casual attire, so those diners who don’t want to dress up feel at home morning, noon and night. The advantage of dining at the Lido is that you can choose what you eat, and much of it is very good quality: exceptional salads, fruit, and seafood. One can eat very well here, but other less healthy options can be piled on plates and washed down with tolerable tea and bad coffee.View image in fullscreenThe Britannia restaurantIt is a quite different experience eating in the Britannia restaurant, where smart attire is compulsory, waiters unfurl napkins with a flourish before placing them on your lap, sommeliers proffer the wine list and the menu is Frenchified a la carte. The mixed quality of the cooking – understandable given the scale of operations – makes this another place on the ship where expectation sometimes collides with reality.View image in fullscreenThe Commodore LoungeWhile there is place onboard for traditional British pub culture, Cunard goes all-out to foster the sense of sophistication elsewhere. There are several areas on the ship that feel exclusive yet are open to all, even the occupants of inside staterooms. The Commodore Lounge with its marvellous views, deeply cushioned seating and cool background jazz, is a retreat for voyagers who prefer their murmured conversation without the accompaniment of blaring pop music. In the comfortable, spacious Chart Room, cocktails are prepared and served by immaculate, charming waiters. The well-stocked library, with its deep armchairs and reading lights, is a haven for those who want to browse diverse material – from gardening to nautical history – in peace and quiet.View image in fullscreenWaiting for an excursionBut the ultimate Cunard experience must be afternoon tea, served in the Queen’s Room between 3 and 4 every afternoon accompanied by a medley of light classics played on the grand piano. Crustless sandwiches, savoury nibbles, fancy cakes and most importantly scones, jam and cream, are served by white gloved waiters. Freshly brewed tea is poured from china teapots, a far cry from the push button operation in the Lido.View image in fullscreenAfternoon tea – the ultimate Cunard experienceView image in fullscreenThe fact that the waiters – and indeed the majority of staff – are predominantly Filipino, West Indian or South African gives the whole afternoon tea scenario a faintly post-colonial feel reminiscent of postwar expat clubs in the tropics. But it is this kind of service that makes Cunard – as one traveller put it – the Waitrose of cruise lines.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAt afternoon tea, you can if you choose to mingle with other passengers and learn a lot about cruise life. I heard complaints from American, Dutch, German and Spanish passengers that they can’t participate in the quizzes because they are so geared to British popular culture and therefore incomprehensible. I also talked to people who never leave the ship to visit the ports because they have been there before on previous trips or because it is much more comfortable staying onboard where your every need is met and it is blessedly cool. For these voyagers, the journey itself – rather than the destinations – is what matters. They are happily immersed in ship culture and reluctant to run the gauntlet of taxi drivers and trip organisers waiting for passengers to emerge blinking into the light. Not for them the challenges of grappling with a foreign town or city.View image in fullscreenTai chi classView image in fullscreenTai chi and chair yogaView image in fullscreenThe upmarket theme continues in some of the numerous activities timetabled for the days at sea and the evenings on the ship. One can refine one’s golf strokes, play deck quoits, learn how to paint watercolours, acquire basic salsa moves or listen to a lecture on popular psychology (why do disasters happen?) in the mindboggling full-size theatre – complete with stalls, circle and boxes. Cunard caters for all tastes; if so inclined you can also join line and ballroom dancing sessions, learn how to flatten your stomach, watch Wimbledon or fit pieces into the enormous communal jigsaws.View image in fullscreenSilent disco, and dancing in the Queen’s RoomView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe logistics of this enterprise are astounding. How many yards, or possibly miles of cucumber must be peeled and sliced ready for sandwiches for 2,000 people daily? How many people labour in the laundry that deals with all the bed linen, towels, and every day turns the chefs and the crew (or “ship’s company” as the captain calls it) out in starched, pristine whites? When and where do the kitchen porters, technicians and cleaners sleep and eat? Who organises work rotas, trains and monitors 900 people? Waitrose or Wetherspoon’s, the sheer scale of the operation is bound to impress.

But they show leaders can’t ignore public opinion for everMon 28 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 03.14 EDTShareThe children die first. In conditions of starvation, their growing bodies’ nutritional needs are higher than those of adults, and so their reserves are depleted faster. Their immune systems, not yet fully developed, become weaker, more susceptible to disease and infection. A bout of diarrhoea is lethal.Their wounds don’t heal. The babies cannot be breastfed as their mothers have not eaten. They die atdouble the rateof adults.Last week, over a period of just 72 hours,21 children diedin Gaza of malnutrition and starvation. The path to death from starvation is a slow and agonising one, especially in a territory suffering shortages of not just food, but medicine, shelter and clean water. The total death toll from hungersurpassed 100 at the weekend; 80 of those were children. Anaid worker reportedthat children are telling their parents that they want to die and go to heaven, because “at least heaven has food”.Every single one of these deaths, and those that will come, is preventable. The World Health Organization described the starvation as “man-made”, but it is more than that. It is foreseeable and thus deliberate. Israel’s siege on Gaza has blocked tonnes of aid from entering, or being distributed to those who need it,according to humanitarian organisationsthere. The “tactical pause” of military operations for a few hours a day in three parts of the Gaza Strip to allow in some aid is a measure that does not ameliorate a crisis accrued over time. The starvation,long warned about, is the latest phase of a campaign almost two years long, for which words are now entirely inadequate.Genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass punishment – all these descriptions still somehow do not capture the lurid and varied ways in which Palestinians in Gaza are being killed: bombed in their homes, and in their tents,burned alivein their hospital beds,shot while queueing for foodand now starved. It almost doesn’t matter what it is called any more, because all you need to see to know that what is happening is a crime that requires immediate action is the bones of a child sticking out of its thin skin, while the food it needs is being blocked by Israeli soldiers.The time for justifications, arguing aboutsemanticsand hand-wringing over the “complexity” of the conflict has long passed. The only question now is, how is it that the world cannot get Israel to allow a morsel of food into a starving civilian’s mouth? How is this a government still not decisively cut off, sanctioned and embargoed? How is this a government, still, that David Lammy thinks he can “urge” to do the right thing? The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen,posted on Xcalling the images from Gaza “unbearable”, and called for more aid to be let in and for Israel to “deliver on its pledges”. This, and other EU social media statements, wasdescribedby an Oxfam official as “hollow” and “baffling”.Benjamin Netanyahu has proved, over and over, that he has no intention of complying with anything. Only last week, aministersaid that “there is no nation that feeds its enemies”, and that the government was “rushing toward Gaza being wiped out” while also “driving out the population that educated its people on the ideas of Mein Kampf”. The truth is that there is no strategic goal for defeating Hamas, only constantly shifting goalposts, under a prime minister who has yoked his political survival to the indefinite extension of an assault on Gaza.0:45Gaza facing man-made mass starvation, WHO chief says – videoAnd in the meantime, the escalating horrors and their relentless continuation unsettle and reconfigure the world. But the more the hard, cold core of support for Israel’s actions is revealed, the more credibility and legitimacy drains away from it. The result is a head-on confrontation between political establishments and the public in a situation that is no longer manageable. The recentescalating rhetoric, for it is only that, from Keir Starmer is an indication that Gaza is now an issue that must be paid lip service to if it is not to further coalesce into a domestic problem for an already embattled government.But still, that rhetoric seems to be part of an elaborate game, in which everyone dances increasingly performatively around what needs to happen. That game is to maintain, no matter the violation, the tenability ofIsraelas a moral player, while pretending that when it transgresses it will be scolded back into compliance. The “when” here is important. The players of this game are constantly inventing new beginnings, new red lines, new watersheds, which mean the necessary point of rupture with Israel is constantly moved to a new point on the horizon. Whether it is the killing of aid workers, the killing of those actually seeking aid, or now the starvation, each escalation of Israel’s campaign seems to trigger a fresh wave of finger wagging.The result is a permanent moment of impending action, as threatened by Lammy. Action that never comes. And while we wait, the status quo is maintained in a holding pattern until the latest horror fades from our screens and front pages. Or Israel applies some temporary measure, such as its “tactical pause” in the fighting, that does not address the fundamental conditions of siege, blockade and civilian killings.Israel announces daily military pauses as fury mounts over starvation in GazaRead moreBut protest, no matter how ostensibly ineffective, remains the only way any pressure can be applied on those who have the power to censure Israel in ways that are meaningful, by ceasing military and trade relations. Protesting might feel like screaming into a void, but even the little change we have seen – the pitifully fewtrucks of aidnow rolling into Gaza – is down to the strain of that confrontation with the political establishment. What else public anger is capable of achieving can only be realised if it does not relent.The way that strain translates into something meaningful can be impossible to divine, because being subjected to these placatory ruses for almost two years has been enough to inflict a sort of cognitive injury. We are told by powerful politicians that things cannot continue as they are, and then, suddenly, it is another few months and things have not only continued but worsened. There is something genuinely mind-bending about it, something exhausting and scattering of resolve when it seems that finally, something seems to be shifting and sanity is prevailing, and then it doesn’t.The purpose is to quieten the public through verbal laudanum, or distract it by the lowest-cost calls for recognising a Palestinian state. These are phantom wins, a grotesque exercise in crowd control, reputation laundering and public opinion management. Innocents are now starving to death.

It’s high time police acted on these red flagsMon 28 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 14.21 EDTShareThe idea that violent men seek out fresh opportunities to attack people and property is hardly news. That one form of violence is a predictor of others, on the other hand, has yet to be fully recognised by the criminal justice system. If that were not the case, domestic abuse would be treated as the red flag it undoubtedly is, requiring much more effective identification, prosecution and management of offenders.The latest example of violence in the home spilling into the streets comes from last summer’s riots. Two out of every five people arrested – 41% of the 899 individuals arrested for taking part in violent disorder, to be exact – had previously been reported to the police for domestic abuse, according todata obtained by the Guardian. The offences they were accused of included actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm, stalking, breach of restraint and non-molestation orders, coercive control and criminal damage. In some areas where violence broke out on the streets, the figure was as high as 68%. In Rotherham, where 75 people were arrested after rioters set fire to an asylum hotel, 35 turned out to have been previously reported to the police for domestic abuse.The irony is unmissable: in some towns, many of the men who claimed to be protesting about the savage murders of three little girls at a dance class in Southport had themselves been accused of attacking women. The profoundly misogynist rampage that killed Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King and Alice da Silva Aguiar was hijacked, in other words, by “protesters” some of whose own record of behaviour towards women doesn’t stand up to a moment’s scrutiny.There are two other statistics that need to be considered here. The 41% figure maps almost exactly on to the proportion of terrorist suspects who were revealed to have a history of domestic abuse byProject Starlight, a joint research project undertaken by counter-terrorism policing and the Home Office in 2021. Initial analysis of 420 individuals considered vulnerable to radicalisation by extremists showed that 39% had a link to a domestic abuse-related incident, either as an offender, victim or witness. This is much higher than the figure for the population at large.It’s also important to remember that domestic abuse is an underreported crime. Victims are afraid to go to the police, fearing further violence from the perpetrator or that they will not be believed. They are right to be pessimistic: in the case of last year’s riots, police reports show that fewer than a quarter of the individuals accused of domestic abuse before the Southport protests had ever been charged.This is nothing short of catastrophic. It’s alarming for victims, who have to live with the threat of a revenge attack by a man who has nothing to fear from the police. But it also creates a sense of impunity among perpetrators who think, correctly, that they have got away with serious offences. Many of the individuals who joined the disorder last summer would already have been familiar with the criminal justice process; they had been interviewed, perhaps even confronted with evidence in the form of statements from wives or girlfriends and photographs of injuries. Yet the bar for prosecution is set so high, and victims are so lacking in support, that most men accused of domestic abuse never see the inside of a courtroom.The impact on their confidence, and propensity to commit further offences, is rarely considered, even though we know thatperpetrators become bolderwhen they are not charged or convicted. It “legitimises” violence as an outlet for their rage and habituates them to the effects of abuse, seriously diminishing their capacity to feel sympathy for the people they hurt. That goes for current and future partners, victims of terrorist attacks and, in the case of last year’s riots, asylum seekers who were an easy target during a national outpouring of rage and grief.There is now an unanswerable case for treating domestic abuse as a “gateway” offence, very much like indecent exposure. For decades, such behaviour was trivialised as “flashing” and received wisdom was that it didn’t lead to anything else. We now know that could not be further from the truth, a reality demonstrated by the rape and murder of Sarah Everard in 2021. Her killer, Wayne Couzens,had been reportedfor exposing himself on a number of occasions, but the offences were not properly investigated. He didn’t even lose his job as a serving police officer.Two in five arrested for last summer’s UK riots had been reported for domestic abuseRead moreAnother man,Abdul Ezedi, was convicted of indecent exposure and sexual assault at Newcastle crown court in 2018. He was sentenced to 36 weeks in prison for the exposure offence and nine weeks for the sex attack, but both sentences were suspended. In 2024, he drove to London where he threw a corrosive substance in the face of a former partner, causing “life-changing” injuries. His body was later found in the Thames.What’s urgently needed is a revolution in the way domestic abuse is understood and handled by the criminal justice system. Allowing abusive men to avoid convictions is a failure of justice for their victims, but it also has terrifying implications for society as a whole. A domestic abuser register, along the lines of the sex offender register, would protect women by allowing monitoring of perpetrators released on licence.But it’s not just the partners of such men who need to be protected. As last summer’s scenes of burning buildings and police cars showed, dangerous men are not choosy about their targets. A year on, the link between private and public violence has never been clearer.Joan Smith is an author, journalist and a former chair of the mayor of London’s VAWG board.

But even this doesn’t buy an end to the transatlantic trade warPaul TaylorThe US president humiliated Ursula von der Leyen at his Scottish resort – but she still has no certainty on tariffsMon 28 Jul 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 11.09 EDTShareSurrender is always one way to end a war. Thecapitulation of the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to Donald Trump’s demands for a grossly lopsided trade deal in which most EU goods exported to the US will face far higher tariffs than US products face in the EU is not only humiliating; it also does not prevent a transatlantic trade war.Indeed, to paraphrase the Prussian military thinker Carl von Clausewitz, it is merely the pursuit of a trade warby other means. After six months of bullying by Trump, the Europeans have acquiesced to a provisional settlement that penalises their exporters and commits the world’s largest trade bloc to buying hundreds of billions of dollars of US fossil fuels and weapons for the duration of his presidency, rather than risk the blanket 30% tariffs he had threatened from 1 August.This was far from the zero-for-zero tariff deal that the European Commission pitched at the start of the talks. The 15% across-the-board tariff von der Leyen ended up accepting was worse than the 10% rate – similar to theUK’s deal– that Brussels officials thought they had secured only two weeks ago.The deal marks Trump’s second humiliation of his European partners in two months, following a Nato summit at which alliesyielded to his demandsthat they spend 5% of their economic output on defence, with 3.5% on core military expenditure. Both were marked byundignified fawningby European officials to the US president’s outsized ego, and by their unwillingness to challenge or correct even his most blatant falsehoods during excruciating joint media appearances.The commission president declared that the deal creates “certainty in uncertain times” and delivers stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the world’s biggest trading relationship, worth $1.7tn. Yet even that claim seems doubtful, since uncertainty remains around the status of pharmaceuticals, which she insisted were covered by the 15% tariff but Trump said would not be part of the deal.Von der Leyen’s statement that this was “the second building block, reaffirming the transatlantic partnership” put a brave face on the fact that it was the second time Trump had wielded threats and bluster to extort protection money from timorous European countries desperate to avoid a complete US disengagement in the face of Russia’s threat to the continent.Yet aside from the disadvantages that European manufacturers now face in the EU’s biggest export market, it is not clear that the deal will buy an end to transatlantic trade friction, or make Trump take a tougher stance against Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine.Sunday’s meeting at Trump’s golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, was a display of raw power. As one wag described it, the commission chief’s posture should henceforth be known as “von der Lying Down”.The optics could hardly have been more humiliating for the representative of 450 million Europeans. Von der Leyen had to fly to Scotland and wait until the president and his son had finished their round of golf, then endure his boasts about the magnificence of the gilded Donald J Trump ballroom in which they met.She sat in silence as Trump claimed thatonly the USwas providing emergency food assistance to starving Palestinians in Gaza, although the EU is the one of the biggest providers of humanitarian aid. She did not challenge his narrative on Israel’s months-long prevention of UN food deliveries to displaced people in the war-ravaged region.Worse, she felt obliged to parrot Trump’s narrative that EU-US trade was unbalanced and that the objective of the negotiation was to “rebalance” the relationship, without referencing the largeUS surplus in services tradewith Europe. Neither leader mentioned the EU’s digital regulations, which remain a potential landmine in transatlantic relations that could blow up within weeks if the commission slaps fines on US tech giants judged to havebreached the Digital Markets Act.Far from bringing peace in our time, Sunday’s deal leaves some crucial loose ends that have yet to be worked out, including which tariffs on agriculture the EU drops and whether alcoholic drinks are exempted from tariffs. On steel and aluminium, Trump insisted the 50% US tariff would continue to apply globally, whereas von der Leyen said the two sides would revert to historical quotas at lower tariffs.EU-US tariffs: five key takeaways from the trade dealRead moreThis was at most a damage-limitation exercise to avoid a bigger immediate hit to European business. “We should not forget where we would have been on 1 August,” the commission chief said in defence of the agreement. “We would have been at 30% and it would have been much more difficult to get down to 15%.” The deal appears to protect the interests of German carmakers better than those of Mediterranean food and drink producers, although von der Leyen said she had made clear that some EU agricultural tariffs would stay.What would have been the alternative? Some European officials,especially in France, say the EU should have been tougher from the outset, implementing retaliatory measures as soon as higher tariffs clicked under Trump’s “liberation day” announcement in April and invoking its anti-coercion instrument to threaten action against US services companies and investments in Europe.Brussels was unable to make stronger use of its trade powers because of divisions among the 27 member states, with Germany, Italy and Ireland urging restraint to protect their economic interests, while France and Spain supported a more robust EU stance. The result was a deal that will undoubtedly hurt the European economy – the Axa Group chief economist Gilles Moec calculates that it could knock 0.5% off the bloc’s GDP– but averted potential tit-for-tat trade measures that could have exacted a higher price.Europe must now accelerate the conclusion of trade deals with other partners around the world to mitigate the damage from Trump’s policies. At best, this humiliation could stimulate the EU to build an alliance of like-minded, rules-based trading nations and blocs without the US. But that would take more courage and more unity than the bloc has shown in handling Trump.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Only some of us were focusing on goals and stuffMon 28 Jul 2025 07.47 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareIf, like me, you know nothing about women’s football, you have to be really careful to emphasise that you also know nothing about men’s football, otherwise you move from the crowd of cheery bystanders, willing on a victory that will bring gaiety to the nation, into the crowd of the patriarchy, which has ground the women’s game down with a drone of contempt, only to – bad luck, patriarchy – make it stronger. As England v Spain drew near on Sunday, my 15-year-old wondered whether I had to emphasise anything – had I tried simply not talking?An hour before kick-off, she tried to give me a crash course in staying silent. She wasn’t even intending to watch the match with me, just selflessly worrying about how it would affect other people’s vibe if I entered a fan environment without this life skill. It was too late for backstories, or a 30-second, “previously, in women’s football”, or even a quick refresh on the rules. The best thing would be if I didn’t talk at all. And that, sadly, was never going to happen.I watched theEuro 2025final with a fan so ardent that she had a lucky England shirt that had never let her down, except that in certain weather conditions it was too small to wear as a top layer, so she had to drape it over herself like an antimacassar. Her father was out of the room when England equalised, which led to him being made to go stand in the corridor superstitiously whenever things looked dicey. Her mother shared a surname with one of the players, and this came up so frequently that I thought at one point there were two Walshes on the pitch, one of them Spanish.Another devotee revealed a nationalistic fervour so powerful that he would only refer to the Spanish manager as Señora Evil.I have no problem with this, but newcomers to the game also have to avoid making saccharine remarks about how supportive the players seem to be to one another, whether any of the English ones are dating any of the Spanish ones, or whether it’s because they are female that they can play on through astronomical pain (Lucy Bronze played the whole tournament with a fractured tibia, she revealed at the end). Otherwise they’ll get blasted from beneath the antimacassar: “It’s not, ‘Everyone make a daisy chain because we like women so much’ – we’re here to win the [insert swearing] Euros.”It is also frowned upon to make any personal remarks about the players’ appearances, which is a trap I most likely wouldn’t fall into – one of the things I love about women’s sports in general is that they’re never thinking about how they look. It’s the only time you get to see women concentrate in a public sphere without someone saying: “The voters won’t like her – she looks too grumpy.”However, it turns out there is aLeah Williamsonexemption, and you’re allowed to call her the most beautiful woman in the land, and every time she does anything, intone that she has always been brilliant at doing that. “Look at that,” said the non-playing Walsh. “She won the toss for which end. She won the toss for who starts. She’s so good at heads or tails.”It’s hard to go wrong with penalties, even for a novice. You are supposed to be happy when they score, gutted when they don’t, and these emotions seem to be hardwired, probably for some evolutionary purpose, just arriving in your bloodstream with no complicating factors or qualification. By this point, incidentally, nobody cares whether this is the first game you’ve ever watched or the lush climax of your life’s desire; it is enough that you all want the same people to win.The Lionesses’ emotions,upon their victory,were also pretty uncomplicated – you have seen footballers hug each other before, I’m sure, and gesture magnificently at the crowds, and leap on the spot like fish who are glad to be alive. But when it got to the point that they were lying on the pitch making angel shapes with glitter streamers, I said the one thing you’re not meant to say: “Is this a women’s football thing? Do England’s men’s team also celebrate so hard, so inventively, when they win?” But nobody knows.

One of the tellings of the legend has it that young Annie Palmer, the “White Witch of Rose Hall”, was a sadistic 19th-century killer and torturer who terrorised enslaved people, murdering the grand-niece of her African lover, Takoo, with a curse, before he killed her. Annie’s spirit now apparently haunts a golf course in Montego Bay.Even as a kid, touring the beautiful island with Jamaican loved ones on holidays, I noticed the British men who had controlled the island’s sugar plantations were largely forgotten.It was the heroes of the 18th- and 19th-century resistance against slavery’s violence who were everywhere, such as the guerrilla commanderQueen Nanny of the Maroons,who was said to have been able to catch bullets. Or Sam Sharpe, a pioneer of liberation theology whose uprising led to abolition, or the political activist Paul Bogle. Their faces were on the banknotes we used to buy pineapple soda.This is one way descendants process the legacies of enslavement: through the memory of ancestors who resisted their oppressors, the worst of whose crimes were so obscenethatthey became spectral, like Annie Palmer, or the pirates ofPort Royal, swallowed by an earthquake.But the legacy of slavery in Jamaica, and across theAmericas, is pervasive in persistent inequality, in generational trauma, and in the elite schools and words plantation owners left behind. Some of those words are Scottish. Scottish surnames, such as Campbell and Gordon, and placenames, including Aberdeen and Dundee, are everywhere in Jamaica. But until fairly recently, in the UK, there was relatively little interrogation of this deep Scottish imprint.Edinburgh University’s report into its history,reported in the Guardianthis week, is the latest research into this legacy. It illuminates the forgotten mechanics of Scotland’s colonial project, exposing the institution’s racial ideologies as algorithms of exploitation, from the 18th century onwards.The 2015 book Recovering Scotland’s Slavery Past, edited by Prof Tom Devine, detailed how, at the height of transatlantic slavery, “a fifth of the ship captains and two-fifths of the surgeons” on ships sailing out of Liverpool, which dominated the trade, were Scots. “Scots owned and managed enslaved people – from Maryland to Trinidad, from St Croix to St Kitts,” comprising, in the late 18th century, a third of Jamaica’s white population.The new report complements these histories, revealing thatEdinburghUniversity was a “haven” for white supremacist thought between 1750 and 1850. It found the institution had an “outsized role in developing racial pseudo-sciences” that “habitually positioned Black people at the bottom and white people at the top” – even hoarding Black people’s skulls.The report charges moral philosophers of the Enlightenment such as Adam Ferguson,David Humeand Dugald Stewart – men long appreciated as intellectual giants – with leaving a “damaging” legacy of ideas used to justify enslavement and colonialism, which in turn fuelled Edinburgh University’s growth.In an era of “anti-woke” backlash, this research is bound to invite accusations that the university is putting dead heroes of their time on trial, excavating their bones to shore up a present-day reputation. But the research undoubtedly matters. Building onEric Williams’s seminal 1944 work Capitalism and Slavery, it fights the false, seductive notion that enslavement, critical to sectors from commodities to finance and philanthropy, was a discrete chapter, separate from the wider story of British national development.It throws down the gauntlet to other institutions reluctant to examine their past. But, most importantly, research of this kind, though unsettling, matters to descendants of the millions of enslaved Africans trafficked to the Americas, as the Caribbean’s determined genealogists seek answers.“New World” slavery societies offered lots of opportunities to Scottish settlers, “sojourners” and landowners. Devine’s book describes Scotland, for centuries, as a country in which “emigration was the norm”. Slaving voyages from Scottish ports were only a fraction of the British total, but “nomadic” Scots went to the West Indies as professionals and adventurers seeking social mobility, as well as indentured workers, pirates, and transplanted Jacobite prisoners, in smaller numbers, leading to a “greater per capita Scottish stake” in slavery than any other UK nation.Scotland’s claimants accounted for 15% of compensation payouts after abolition, with Glasgow’s enslaversrepresenting“one of the largest regional groups of claimants”. The Caribbeanprovided marketsfor Scottish textiles and herring, supplying Scotland in turn with coffee, cotton, rum, sugar and tobacco.Against this backdrop, Edinburgh’s thinkers sustained a racial “ideology that helped to exploit, kill and dominate”, says Prof Tommy J Curry, who co-chaired Edinburgh University’s report, adding that “Scotland has a moral debt to pay”.The Enlightenment had a shadow. In the same climate in which the values that underpin liberal democracy developed, so did “some of the most damaging ideas in human history”, says the university.For Peter Mathieson, the university’s principal, these revelations align with the Enlightenment’s “enormously important” spirit of inquiry, opposing the comfort of “selective memory”.The reasons why Edinburgh University assumed this “outsized” role lie in the modern, unified, secular structure it had by the 18th century, attracting some of Europe’s most curious minds. The city was in the vanguard of medicine, which meant it produced doctors for slavers’ ships and plantations in countries such as Jamaica, which took these theories of race with them, before funnelling back profits from the plantation economy.The “great irony” of this, says the university’s Ian Stewart, was that while their racial ideas were adopted by the enslavers of the American south, Scottish Enlightenment figures such as Ferguson and Dugald Stewart were “lifelong, vocal abolitionists”.“They understood the law of unintended consequences better than anyone,” Ian Stewart says. “They wouldn’t be phased one bit by the fact these ideas took on an awful life of their own.”Edinburgh University didn’t invent racism. What it did was provide a thinktank, codifying ideologies – in the yellowing handwritten books examined for the first time in years for the new research – that aligned with the basest interests of capital.But from the Windrush scandal toracial inequalities on maternity wards, to the UK government’s refusal to formally apologise and pay reparations for slavery, and on to the far right’s “Dark Enlightenment”, the ghosts of Edinburgh’s theories still haunt.Chris Osuh is a community affairs correspondent for the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is as good a reason as many of those given over the past week for the fact that the billionaire whoseFox Newschannel has acted as a Trump cheerleader throughout is now, alone among US media titans, preparing to do battle in the courts.Trump’s onslaught on the US media – withdrawing federal funds, banning reporters and launching multi-billion-dollar lawsuits – has led once-renowned defenders of media freedom such as the Washington Post, ABC News and CBS to crumple, either changing their editorial policies or agreeing to apparently frivolous settlements. Yet ranting calls to both the WSJ editor, Emma Tucker, and his old frenemy Rupert failed to prevent the publication of a story suggesting he had senta hand-drawn pictureof a naked woman to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein with the words: “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Last week, helaunched a $10bn lawsuitover this “fake”. After the WSJ doubled down with stories saying Trump had been told he was in the Epstein files,sources close to Murdoch reportthat, at 94, he refuses to be “intimidated”.He is also enhancing his reputation as the most mercurial media titan. Media veteran Tina Brown asked how the world had come to depend on “the Darth Vader of media” to stand up for press freedom, while a thoughtful friend asked: “Suppose Murdoch had a Damascene conversion and sought to atone for his many sins – would we welcome him as an ally?” Can a man whose companies have paid out more than a billion pounds for either knowingly broadcasting lies or for hacking phones be preparing to die as the Severus Snape of the media world, the final protector of press freedom?Two years ago, when Murdoch announced he was standing down (sort of), he told staff to “make the most of this great opportunity to improve the world we live in”, a line that seemedridiculous to meat the time. Is his battle with this madman in the White House really his final chance at leaving the world a better place?Before Murdoch watchers get carried away, there are of course a number of rational and personal reasons for Murdoch’s decision not to kowtow to Trump.Throughout his long career at the nexus of media and power, one thing that has been consistent is Murdoch’s desire to pick the winning side. Trump’s friendship with Epstein is the only issue currently close to dividing him from a Maga power base that also forms the heart of the Fox News audience.And Murdoch’s enthusiasm for the former real estate mogul has never been wholehearted. After the 6 January attack on the US Capitol in 2021 he sent an email to a former executive, saying: “We want to make Trump a nonperson.” Despite this, the support of his Fox News channel helped elect a man he has little respect for.Not only is he spreading his bets on the Epstein fallout, Murdoch is also riding two horses by allowing his respected financial news organisation to defend its reporting, while Fox continues to downplay the story over Trump’s card.A newsman at his core, Murdoch isjust as likely to give his editors stories as ask for them to be spiked. But Murdoch is also known to have kept a particularly respectful distance from the Journal’s editorials since buying it in 2007; one called Trump’s tariff plans “the dumbest trade war in history”. Besides, defending its journalism is good for business in a landscape in which the owners of CBScancel a hit showcritical of Trump andpay millions to his presidential libraryjust days before receiving a government blessing for a huge deal.As always with Murdoch, there is also the psychodrama of an old man whose life is closer to Shakespearean than most. Michael Wolff, responsible for several of the many books on both men, tells me that Murdoch’s support for his journalists is an “old man’s revenge” after the Fox fallout divided his family and promptedan inheritance battlestill playing out in the family courts. Besides, says Wolff, Murdoch wants revenge on Trump simply for winning when Murdoch did “everything to make sure [he] didn’t”.Trump’s behaviour in his second term – using his powers to further any whim or grievance, and approaching absolutism – could also have revealed to Murdoch the end result of a truly free market. What is to stop Emperor Trump from stripping his commercial empire of the protection of the rule of law once the old man is gone, for example?Murdoch is undoubtedly a flawed hero. And there is a chance after all that the drawing is a hoax, as Trump insists, despite the Journal’s robust defence. Murdoch’s papers have been tricked before. But for now, he is the closest thing journalism has to a Trojan horse, invited into the inner sanctum yet still apparently ready to do battle.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media GroupExplore more on these topicsRupert MurdochOpinionPress freedomDonald TrumpNews CorporationFox NewsNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

Sunday’s heroically hard-foughtvictoryover the world champions, Spain – in a Euro 2025 final which required yet another comeback – was the first successful defence of an international title by a senior England team. It was also the first time a major trophy has been acquired away from the home comforts of Wembley.That gives the measure of the achievement. What will live long in the memory was the manner of it.Well beatenby France in the group stages, 2-0 down to Sweden late in thequarter-final, 1-0 down to Italy in injury time in thesemi-final, 1-0 down to Spain at half-time in the final, a remarkable group of players seemed somehow to thrive in such adversity.Their spirit was epitomised by the dogged determination of 33-year-old Lucy Bronze, perhaps playing in her last big tournament, whorevealedafter the final that she had played throughout with a fractured shin. Courage of a different kind has been displayed by England’s goalkeeper and Uefa’s player of the match on Sunday, Hannah Hampton, who overcame a serious eyeconditionto fulfil her ambition of pursuing a football career. And by Jess Carter, the defender who suffered racist abuse earlier in the tournament, but ended it with a faultless performance in the final. The effervescent Chloe Kelly, who had considered quitting last season when her career was in the doldrums, had the last word as England’snervelesspenalty-shootout match-winner.Increasingly, such inspirational sporting narratives are the things that young girls’ dreams are made of.Researchby the Football Beyond Borders charity suggests that the number of 13- to 18-year-olds who play and follow the game continues to grow. This summer’s excitement will deliver another huge shot of adrenaline to the domestic women’s game, which was already preparing for a different set of firsts.This season, Arsenal Women will break new ground byplayingall of their Women’s Super League (WSL) home games at the 60,000-capacity Emirates Stadium. Already, 15,000 season tickets have been sold. Everton Women will take overGoodison Park, one of English football’s most beloved stadiums, as the men’s team decamp to a new ground on the banks of the Mersey. The Lionesses effect, combined with new televisioncontractscovering two fully professional divisions, and a new Sunday kick-off time designed to maximise exposure of the game, should pave the way for further growth.Challenges remain. As a slightdrop-offin WSL attendances last season suggested, rapid bursts of growth driven by international success is not a reliable long-term strategy. The task in the future will be to maintain upward momentum, even when the England women’s team is not sweeping all before it. And as more girls seek opportunities to play and pitches to play on, a grassroots infrastructure that has been historically geared to the requirements of men’s and boys’ teams needs anoverhaul.That is for tomorrow, though. Once again the Lionesses have lit up an English summer, forging legends that will fire the imaginations of future generations of girls. The extraordinary Ms Wiegman, after winning the Euros first with her native Netherlands, has consolidated her position as by far the most successful England manager of all time. Even more significantly, she has empowered and inspired a formidable group of athletes to transform the profile of women’s sport in this country.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the real challenge for institutions and the societies they are part of is to act in ways informed by new knowledgeMon 28 Jul 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 14.26 EDTShareThe British campaign against slavery and the slave trade has long been recognised as an inspiration for later social movements. But for centuries, the brutality inflicted on the millions of African people who were bought and sold into chattel slavery in British colonies was eitherveiled from viewor treated as a sin that was expunged when it was abolished.New research from the University of Edinburgh, about itshistory of involvementin slavery and the slave trade, is part of a belated reckoning by UK institutions with this disturbing aspect of their past. Another Scottish university, Glasgow, was among the first to embark on such a process. In response to evidence about substantial gifts from plantation owners and slave traders, it partnered with the University of the West Indies on areparative justiceprogramme in 2019.Edinburgh’s report highlights a minimum of £30m in funds raised, over the years, from numerous donors with links to slavery, and points to the university’s historic role as a “haven” for racist thinkers, some of them prominent advocates of thepseudoscience of phrenology. It also criticises the university for being less active in the abolitionist movement than others.Recommendations, to which the university is weighing its response, include the establishment of a new racism and colonialism study centre, the renaming of buildings, and efforts to diversify the university’s staff and student body, with a particular focus on the low number of Black students and academics. But as well as new policies and financial decisions such as the creation of new scholarships or a summer school, the researchdemands a reactionbeyond the institution itself.TheUniversity of Edinburghhas a prominent role in the life of the Scottish capital, with Gordon Brown and John Swinney among its alumni. Steps to address injustices within academia, which are part of the legacy of slavery, are important. But the point of such investigations goes beyond this. As well as prompting internal changes, the report should promote stronger public understanding of the ways in which present-day unfairness is rooted in the abusive practices and ideologies of the past.For too long, the myriad ways in which our modern world was shaped by grossly unequal colonial-era relations were glossed over as historians focused on other topics – often those which showed Britain in a favourable light. But the truth is that traces of the exploitative dynamics of previous centuries are all around us: in our global financial system; in the landscapes and built environments of former imperial powers and the countries they colonised; in museum collections; and in the histories of organisations such as the Guardian, which examined its own links to slavery in theCotton Capitalproject.Institutions with centuries of power and influence behind them, and endowments of obscure provenance, have a responsibility to be open that some have started to recognise. Universities such as Edinburgh cannot, in good conscience, continue to trade on past achievements unless they are also honest about theparts of their pastthat provoke anger and regret. But reflecting on historical events, while necessary, is not sufficient. As this report makes clear, the challenge for organisations that benefited directly from slavery, and colonial-era exploitation more broadly, is to ensure that theiractions in the presentare guided by awareness of the past.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Rather, many of us reached the position by long working hours, and saving for such a retirement. Putting money into saving for a future, rather than buying a new car each year, doesn’t make me responsible for low growth of the UK economy. Indeed many early retirees are driving charities through their volunteering work. These charities often now fill the gap left by government austerity.This notion that we can all have happy productive jobs into our 70s is for most a fallacy. Anyone over 55 looking for a job will tell you that companies prefer cheaper “just done the training” younger candidates over older “with experience” candidates. For many people, even those like teachers, the sometimes hidden physical demands of their roles make being forced to work longer a frightening experience. Where are the jobs for us oldies to do? If there are any left in this artificial intelligence/technology-driven world, we’d be taking them from the young anyway.Of course for many people, the idea of early retirement is a fantasy and any retirement looks impossible. This is, however, just another example of the ever-widening inequality in society. The solution has to be a wealth tax on those who do suck money out of the economy to fund their excessive lifestyles continuously, and not just in retirement.Neil Heydon-DumbletonPathhead, MidlothianExplore more on these topicsRetirement planningFamily financesPensionsAgeingWork & careersArtificial intelligence (AI)EmployabilitylettersShareReuse this content"

This behaviour will have far-reaching consequences, which are unlikely to be beneficial either to the doctors or the country.Clearly, the action will cause delays in treatment and probably unnecessary morbidity and mortality. This will make theNHSvulnerable to pressure from those who favour its abolition. Already, it has alienated large sections of the population whose support the doctors have always been able to count on previously.But the British Medical Association has assured resident doctors that it is necessary for them to put their livelihood ahead of the wellbeing of the public, to ensure that the NHS survives into the future. This is a false promise.The commitment of resident doctors and nurses has always been integral to the success of the NHS, and there is no doubt that this has been central to the incredible efficiency it has demonstrated since its inception. It was conceived as a non-commercial organisation.There have always been areas of the globe where doctors could earn more than at home. But for most, the attractions of the NHS outweighed pecuniary advantages available elsewhere. I fear that in setting their sights purely on increased remuneration, today’s resident doctors are leading the NHS towards a change in its entire ethos, the ethos that made it a success. The BMA should concentrate on improving doctors’ working conditions, as Wes Streeting has offered them.Robert BehrmanCookham Dean, BerkshireOn Sunday I cancelled my subscription to the British Medical Association after being a member for 39 years, in disgust at its insistence on going ahead with the strike of resident doctors in pursuit of a 29% pay rise, despite having had a 22% rise over the previous two years.It is hard to know what is the correct rate of pay for resident doctors, but no other group in the health service is seeking such a rise in pay, and the decision to strike seems to ignore patients, as well as all the other staff alongside whom they work. I believe that improvement in the working conditions of doctors and all other groups should be sought through discussions, as the government has offered, not strikes.Whatever the appropriate pay should be for resident doctors, they should be glad that they don’t get the equivalent of the £2 per hour we were paid in the 1980s for each of the 60 hours a week we had to be in the hospital over and above our basic 40-hour week.Prof David CameronBelhaven, East LothianI do have a lot of sympathy for our resident doctors, even though I was on call on Sunday as a consultant. It is not just that pay has been eroded, but also that the cost of becoming a doctor has gone up, as has the cost of living in general.Unlike in most other higher-paid professions, half of doctors are women. The cost of childcare has gone up significantly since my day. There is no more cheap hospital accommodation. And the student loan system is misogynistic in principle, the interest accumulating during maternity leave.Women earn less during their careers but end up paying back a lot more for their student loans as a group. And because of the forced itinerant lifestyle, most doctors get their foot on the housing ladder quite late, having to pay increasingly unaffordable rents.Marianne GemmekeEastleigh, HampshireWes Streeting rightly points out that 90% of resident doctors voted for strike action, with a 55% turnout (Resident doctors’ strike undermines union movement, says Wes Streeting, 25 July). That means just under 50% of all resident doctors voted in favour.He fails to point out that Labour is in power on the votes of34%of the60% who turned out– about 20% of the electorate. The doctors’ result looks more convincing as a test of opinion, whatever you think of the pay award.Peter WestLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

That’s my job, to find that person for the players, they deserve the best.” Those were the words of Sue Campbell, the Football Association’s former head of women’s football, in the summer of 2020 as – alongside the chief executive, Mark Bullingham, and technical director, Kay Cossington – she sought to find a new England head coach to replace Phil Neville, who was to leave his role the following year.The Lionesses had reached three consecutive major tournament semi-finals, but kept enduring heartbreak and missing out on an elusive final. The FA’s mission was simple: find someone with the knowhow to take the team to the next level. A total of 142 applied for the role, Baroness Campbell said at the time and it was Cossington who first suggested: “There’s this brilliant woman calledSarina Wiegman... ”England’s warrior Lucy Bronze pushes through pain to burnish her legendRead moreThe less said about some of the decision-making from people in power in this country in that bleak summer of 2020, the better, but when it comes to that particular appointment, it is now abundantly clear that Campbell, Bullingham and Cossington made the correct choice. Just three tournaments, three finalsand two titleslater, Wiegman has overseen the transformation of the women’s national team’s identity into winners, a team oozing belief, with a never-say-die attitude and an unrelenting focus on success.The first thing Wiegman commanded on day one in the job was respect. The England players knew that Wiegman had done something they had not yet done – she had won a major international trophy, with the Netherlands in 2017 – and that made them eager to listen to her every word. Not only a former player at the highest level, she is also a former PE teacher and, as one source close to a squad member told the Guardian on Monday, Wiegman’s man-management skills have made her like “that favourite teacher you had at school” because she has found a balance of being firm but fair, simultaneously being an instructor and a friend.Her motherly side has clearly made new additions to the squad feel at ease. This summer she encouraged them all to open up to each other, to be “vulnerable” around each other, to grow closer bonds. The 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang said during the Euros: “I think most people will say, when they work with Sarina, she’s like a mum to us, almost. She cares about our wellbeing [and] she’s ready to step in and tell us: ‘That’s not good enough, let’s be better.’ So I think she has that fine balance and she’s put a lot of trust in me, which I’m really grateful for.“She shows the same type of care to me, who’s the youngest, to the oldest, showing the same sort of care to each and every one of us, no matter what our role is, even if we don’t play, she’s still willing to go and shake your hand and say ‘well done’, even if we didn’t touch the pitch, and that shows we’re valued in the squad.”Wiegman’s tenure has been defined by the fact that, at every step of the journey, with every decision she has made, however large or small, she has only had one priority: on-pitch performances. With every plan that she and her staff make, from the scheduled time of a training session, to the location of a hotel, to food, rehydration and recovery, right through to the way she can often seem reluctant to give away inside information during press conferences, it all boils down to one thing: what will help the team the most?View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman holds the European Championship trophy as England arrive for their celebratory visit to 10 Downing Street.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersFor a reporter, that performance-first approach might sometimes mean a media session is rearranged at relatively short notice to help the team’s training schedule, and so be it, because everything else is secondary. For a player, it means there is very little room for sentimentality. Just ask Steph Houghton, whose exemplary service to the game was not enough for her to be picked by Wiegman if she felt others were in better form.Another crucial aspect has been attention to detail and Wiegman would be the first to say that it is a team effort with her staff. England’s analysts have gone into forensic detail on all of their opponents and the benefits have been abundantly clear, whether it be in the homework done to aid Hannah Hampton’s preparationto save penalties, or in the notes prepared on how frequently an opponent might cut inside, or in the way players’ output in training is monitored to check how well they are performing physically. Every detail counts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThen there are Wiegman’s personality, body language and level-headed reactions. There is a composure to her mannerisms – even when her team are 2-0 down with 12 minutes to goin a Euros quarter-final against Sweden– that would make a player retain their belief even in the middle of a hurricane. That was touched on by the midfielder Keira Walsh this month when she said: “She’s probably one of the best managers I’ve played for in terms of trying to make everyone feel loved. She really, really cares about the human side. Another thing that you notice when you play for her is how calm she is. It makes a massive difference in the 95th minute when you’re losing 1-0, and you look to the side and she’s very calm. That speaks volumes of her as a manager.”That calmness has also shone through in the vast majority of Wiegman’s press conferences over the past few years, with the 55-year-old never seeming overly pleased when her team were winning games in the run-up to tournaments and, equally, never overreacting when they underperformed or lost. A lot of coaches preach the cliche of never getting too high with the highs nor too low with the lows, but Wiegman embodies that approach naturally.That said, even she allowed herself wry smiles, excitement and jokes of “having a heart attack” amid the last-gasp drama her team put the nation through this summer. She also made a point of thanking the travelling media, all of her staff, Uefa and the people of Switzerland in a classy speech in Basel, offering a little glimpse into her character. She has two more years left on her contract, for now at least. The journey is not over but she has reached that Everest summit twice already. The view from the top looks good.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they were not alone in veering away from their pre‑match preparations.Gilbert Enoka, the All Blacks adviser who made famous their “no dickheads” policy, did some work with England on the training days, only for them to act briefly like … well, let’s just say their adoption of something similar remains a work in progress.In the wash-up this has become known inevitably as handshake‑gate. At 5.20pm on day five, the start of the last hour and with the draw a dead certainty,Ben Stokeshoped to get his players off the field pronto after 143 overs of toil for four paltry wickets. The physical act of shaking hands at this juncture is only customary but the playing conditions permit an early finish if both captains – or the batters out in the middle, who can act on behalf of their leader – agree. It was not an unreasonable or unusual request.Pietersen defends Stokes over criticism of reaction after India delayed Test drawRead moreIndia wanted to bat on, however, to reward two players with the centuries that they felt their efforts merited. While the seasoned Ravindra Jadeja, on 89, had been there four times previously, Washington Sundar, on 80, was chasing his first in Test cricket. Though in one sense a confection – 100 is just one more than 99, etc – all players crave three figures and see their careers judged on them also. Declining England’s offer, and giving their own supporters a couple of moments to cheer, was also not unreasonable.So as tedious as the last rites were going to be for them, it was here where England had to simply crack on. Harry Brook sending down some of his right‑arm filth to spare the frontliners and hasten matters was fine but it was the sarcastic chirping that was objectively poor. In contrast to their aggression at Lord’s – a legitimate tactic in pursuit of a victory, India doing much the same – shouting “Embarrassing” and “Fucking hell, Washi, get on with it” amounted to sour grapes at being denied the early cut.Although there is some mitigation. Like a stopped clock,Kevin Pietersen was rightwhen he posted on social media to stress the exhausted state in which Stokes and his men found themselves (something India were also happy to deepen). This has been a brutal series for both sets of players, the kind that will inevitably lead to lapses in judgment. Four unyielding five‑day surfaces in five weeks have strained sinews and synapses in a manner that, with all due respect, the Hundred is highly unlikely to match next month.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes and Ravindra Jadeja finally shake hands on a draw in the fourth Test at Old Trafford.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd the needle that has bubbled up during this series is at the very least a byproduct of the commitment that paying spectators demand. There is a reason Test cricket still commands the bulk of the television revenue in the UK, or why Virat Kohli describedwinning the Indian Premier Leagueas being “five levels” below any achievements in whites. Franchise cricket does feature the odd flashpoint and many of its players compete as hard as they would for a national team. But by definition it is the lesser product and, in this country at least, yet to stir anything close to the same emotions among the public.David Rudder, the legendary calypsonian, summed it up neatly when speaking to me from his home in Canada a few years ago: “I always tell people in North America who say Test cricket is boring that they should look at it this way: you can have a regular soldier in the army – a GI – but then you have special forces. And that is what Test cricketers are. It’s not just basic training, it’s sending guys out to survive for days.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionEngland’s GIs simply got it wrong during those graceless final moments and since then there may even be some sheepishness in the camp. Not that Stokes is likely to voice it publicly. He may have only just drawn level with Ian Botham’s 14 Test centuries but he has long since been cut from the same cloth: never look back, no regrets, onwards, upwards and the like. The Botham gene is what makes Stokes such a force, the very foundation of his maniacal approach to training and playing. This contest, and England’s 2-1 lead going into the fifth Test starting on Thursday, would be diminished without it.What that last day in Manchester did show unquestionably was that England struggle when Stokes cannot operate at full tilt and India, even in transition, can never be written off.

Vollering also crashed in the Femmes last year, again injuring her back, when leading the race overall.Despite her injuries, she was able to warm down on her bike and ride to the team’s nearby hotel. Her general manager, Stephen Delcourt, appeared to blame others in the peloton, saying: “It’s not normal, the attitude of many teams and many riders. They’re disrespectful. We lose the respect in the last years in men’s and women’s cycling.”Vollering, he said, was “in pain, in her knee, her glutes and her back”. The Dutch rider has also been critical of the attitude of her peers, particularly after her damaging crash in 2024. After Tadej Pogacarcrashed in Toulouseduring the recent men’s race, she posted: “So kind of the bunch not to use this crash to take time on Pogacar. Guess men are a bit more kind.”Delcourt said: “When you crash at this speed, it’s never easy. She’s completely shocked. We need to wait, because we never know if it’s just the shock of the crash, but she will be examined by the team doctor.

It was pretty chaotic, especially coming into the city on a descent with high speed. It’s not really about respect, but everybody is fighting for every centimetre and unfortunately things can happen. Of course, it’s the riders fighting for position that makes it dangerous, but it’s not about respect.”The crash, 3.6km from the finish on a wide left-hand bend, was inside the 5km “safe zone”, negating any time losses on the general classification. Already the racing has taken its toll and while the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma, has safely navigated the first three stages, plenty of others, including Vollering, have suffered.Marlen Reusser, winner this year of the Tour of Switzerland, abandoned the race on stage one, while Elisa Longo Borghini, the Giro d’Italia winner, quit before the start of stage three. For Kristen Faulkner, the Olympic road race champion, the opening stages have been a baptism of fire. On stage two the American was caught up in a crash and only just made the daily time cut, although she finished safely in the main peloton in Angers.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingTour de FrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Yet once again this weekend it was the climate that held courtat the Belgian Grand Prix, leaving the sport divided over a circuit where the appeal of racing in the rain on a track of such fearsome risk and reward makes for difficult decisions.The race on Sunday, ultimately a somewhat pedestrian affair,was won by McLaren’s Oscar Piastriafter the start had been delayed for an hour and 20 minutes owing to the rain that swept in across the Ardennes mountains. This was not an unusual occurrence. In 2021 the meeting here ended in farce as all but two lapswere completed behind a safety carwhen an afternoon deluge continued until a “result” was declared, as unedifying and insulting to the fans as it was.Max Verstappen condemns delayed Belgian Grand Prix start amid wet weatherRead moreA midsummer day in July guarantees nothing in Spa. Cycling to the track on Sunday morning there were vast stair rods of precipitation yet by the descent into Francorchamps the sun was shining again. The past is a foreign country across 10 minutes in the Ardennes.By the time the race was ready to go the weather was similarly fickle. The downpour that swamped the grid had largely stopped when the formation lap began but the circuit was still wet.The rain was not the real problem however. Spray from these ground-effect cars is huge. The regulations were designed to improve overtaking by channelling the dirty air in their wake upwards. But it also ensures that in the wet the water is similarly channelled and hurled vertically with enormous force.This spectacular plume of liquid then promptly comes down on all the following cars and makes for very low visibility. This was the problem on Sunday, not whether the tyres were able to cope with a wet track. The intermediate rubber was fine with the conditions in Spa, which did not even require the full wet tyres. Indeed of late it is almost always visibility not grip that prevents racing, suggesting full wet tyres are now all but pointless. Were they ever to be used the conditions would be such that racing would surely not commence because of visibility problems.View image in fullscreenLando Norris’s McLaren throws up a huge plume of water, threatening the visibility of those behind.Photograph: DPPI/ShutterstockAs it was, after the delayed start, it was only seven laps in when Lewis Hamilton decided the track was already dry enough for slick tyres. He was right and the field followed him in. The reaction afterwards ranged from Max Verstappen – whose car was set up for a wet race – arguing that classic wet racing was in danger of disappearing because of the FIA’s caution, to George Russell bluntly stating it would have been “stupidity” to start on time given the conditions when the race was supposed to begin.The majority appeared to concur with Russell given Spa is such a challenging track. Quite apart from its historic legacy in the old configuration that claimed so many drivers’ lives, it is still a formidable and unforgiving test. In recent yearsboth Anthoine Hubert, in 2019,and Dilano van ’t Hoff, in 2023, were killed here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For that reason, I’d rather be safe than too early.” It was an opinion echoed by Fernando Alonso and Piastri among other drivers.The problem it highlighted for F1 is that many drivers and fans alike want to see racing in the rain. It is a great leveller, where mechanical and aerodynamic advantage are negated and the seat of the pants feel and touch of a driver counts for so much. The call at Spa by the FIA feels like the right one, to err on the side of safety, but as the sport heads into new regulations for 2026 it was a reminder that it might try to find a way to allow the contest everyone wants to see, even when the heavens open.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Sheep on the line. It is enough to jolt you forward and you fear for any British & Irish Lions fans who have not quite got out of their system the celebrations of the night before. We are five-and-a-half hours into a 12-hour journey, the road less travelled on this odyssey around Australia, navigating the rocky landscape around Cootamundra Creek and disaster is narrowly avoided.The first thing to address is why. Why turn down a 90-minute flight in favour of a train journey eight times as long. Backtrack to the day before and the afternoon beforethe Lions’ second Test victoryat the MCG. A colleague in the press pack has received some bad news and is seeking the soothing effects of perpetual motion, watching the world go by and some company while doing so. Sold on the promise of avoiding the airport and all associated ordeals, a journey through the Australian countryside and the guarantee of wild kangaroos, tickets are bought: A$99. Cheap. Too cheap?Andy Farrell’s victorious Lions stand on the verge of all-time greatness | Robert KitsonRead moreTwelve hours in cattle class didn’t much appeal but maybe here was an opportunity to get a little closer to the essence of a Lions tour. Away from the airport transfers, check-in queues, luggage carousels and Ubers. Maybe that is the essence of a Lions tour. If so a 12-hour break would be welcome. The train could be a sea of red, perhaps just a puddle, but it was a pretty safe bet there would be no members of the 2013 squad punting an insurance brand on board.It was an inauspicious start. Departure was supposed to be at 8:30am, 10-and-a-half hours after full time in the second Test, but the train was late arriving from Sydney. An hour late. It left a crowded platform frustrated and Melbourne mornings in winter are a little too fresh. The arrival of Spirit of Bendigo, a spectacular steam train, provides a welcome distraction. Once it leaves and the spotters follow, the platform is significantly less crowded, and the smattering of Lions supporters surface. There is a white blazer adorned with a bright red dragon, though this particular fan does not appear to have much fire left in his belly. A few couples, the odd group of threes who either left it late to book flights or are watching the pennies but it is left to a group of four young Welsh lads to bring the energy. It is unclear how long they will last.Nearly time to board and there is a confidence-boosting familiar face along the platform in Stephen Larkham. If this train is good enough for a World Cup-winning Wallaby it’s good enough for me – and as we get on board it’s impossible not to wonder what difference Larkham in his prime might have made the night before.Into our seats. We’re in different carriages but an obliging chap headed for Wagga Wagga is happy to swap. The officious conductor less so. As we were for the first couple of hours then. I’m aware I’m not being good company but there is sleep to be caught up on and 545 miles ahead of us. It is striking how flat the landscape is as we leave the state of Victoria for New South Wales, ticking off the townships, each with its picture postcard colonial train station. The Rock is an eagerly anticipated stop – only one door of the train will open so small is the platform – while the lunch menu offering includes bush pumpkin curry. Perhaps best avoided.Spotting kangaroo No 1, just a few metres from the train tracks, brings more of a rush than expected. He’s a big ol’ fella, standing his ground, unnervingly still, a scarecrow with a tail spoiling for a fight. This train is 43 years old, the line in operation since 1883, but his family has been here a damn sight longer than that.View image in fullscreenStephen Larkham was a familiar looking face also taking the same train.Photograph: Mike Mayhew/SportsphotoTime for some work and to try to explain precisely why Finn Russell has, at the age of 32, found the smoothest groove of his career for Guardian readers. He was talking of a “calmness” after the match on Saturday – perhaps he took the train to Melbourne? – and that just about sums it up better than I could. You sense it has been a while since Russell has felt uncomfortable in his own skin and certainly itfits like a gloveat the moment.Saturday night was the first time we have spoken to Russell in Australia, odd for someone so at ease at doing so. Star players are increasingly inaccessible but Russell is such a throwback that his absence has jarred. Inaccessibility is at odds with the essence of a tour and for all the understandable back-slapping since Saturday night, in time the Lions hierarchy may come to realise that their win-at-all-costs mentality has not quite hit the right notes in Australia. Speaking of lesser-spotted creatures, meanwhile, five or so kangaroos suddenly come into view, bounding through a cluster of trees. Now we’re touring.A stop in Albury – bang on the state border – makes for a crew change and the perfect opportunity to swap seats again. An announcement goes out that the buffet carriage will be reopening shortly and promise that alcohol will be available. “I know we’ve got some rugby blokes on board,” says the crew member who doesn’t sound delighted by the prospect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a sprawling 16-room pub that was apparently given away for just A$100 a few years ago – a demonstration of just how far off the beaten track we are now.View image in fullscreenThe train platform at Circular Quay in Sydney. The capital of New South Wales will host the final Test.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty ImagesCuriosity kicks in and we go looking for Larkham, what would he have made of theWallabies’ gallant defeat? Was he as incensed by Jac Morgan’s clearout on Carlo Tizzano as so many of his countrymen? Alas he is nowhere to be seen; we have already reached Brumbies country in Canberra, a sure-fire sign that time is flying. The four Welsh lads are out for the count, sprawled across the train carriage. This is a journey of recovery rather than revelry.After a couple more kangaroos, the last hour goes by in a blur of nicotine withdrawal, under the cover of darkness and a slow crawl into Sydney. It is a short hop though to the Rocks and a rooftop overlooking the harbour to catch up with more colleagues. Bridge on one side, opera house the other.While there is the odd regret that Sydney does not host a decider, there is a sense of approaching the home straight and the second wind that comes with it. A determination to make the most of what’s left. If these past 12 hours have taught me anything it is that while pinpointing the essence of a modern Lions tour is complicated, you will not go far wrong with companionship.Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025British & Irish LionsAustralia sportRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lucy Bronze celebrated on the pitch amid the glitter with her young nephews while Beth Mead hugged her partner, the Netherlands and Manchester City forward Vivianne Miedema, in the stands.The families and friends then travelled to the Dolder Grand hotel – the Lionesses’ luxurious base overlooking the city of Zurich as well as Lake Zurich and the distant Alps – and were ready to greet the team when their coach arrived. The players, all wearing deliberately back-to-front England shirts emblazoned with “Champions, 25”, arrived at the party to the sound of the London-born singer Small’s debut solo single from 2000, Proud, a song that had been played repeatedly throughout the Lionesses’ run to the final.In a moment that is now becoming something of a tradition for the team at such Lionesses parties, the captain, Leah Williamson, and Wiegman are understood to have cut a cake in celebration. Before long, all present were singing along to some of the team’s favourite celebratory tunes such as Gala’s Freed From Desire – which burst into popularity with football fans in 2016 at the men’s European Championship in France – as well as Sweet Caroline and, several hours later, Bedingfield’s Unwritten.View image in fullscreenElla Toone (left) and Alessia Russo of England pose for a ticker-tape filled portrait with the Women’s Euro 2025 trophy.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Uefa/Getty ImagesThere was also an impressive rendition of Ike & Tina Turner’s River Deep, Mountain High, performed with a microphone by the England midfielder Ella Toone. A 1996 version of that same song by Céline Dion had become popular with the Lionesses after their wins at Euro 2022 on home soil, most memorably being sung by Rachel Daly on stage in Trafalgar Square at the team’s public celebratory event the day after their victory against Germany that year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Handled the pressure brilliantly with two player-of-the-match performances. Her two penalty saves in both of the Lionesses’ shootouts were crucial, as was her shot-stopping throughout. Produced match-saving stops in the final to deny Esther González and Clàudia Pina while her last-minute effort against Italy ensured the game went to extra time.9/10Appearances6| Minutes played630| Saves made17| Goals conceded7| Passing accuracy73.3%Lucy Bronze (defender)“I think the only way to get her off the pitch is in a wheelchair,” Wiegman said after her exemplary quarter-final performance. England’s warrior at right-back revealed after the final that she had played the entire tournamentwith a fractured tibia. Epitomises the Lionesses’ never-say-die attitude and provided leadership. The scenes of her bandaging up her own leg during the Sweden game before ripping it off to bury her penalty – her first for her country – will live long in the memory. 8Appearances6|Minutes played598| Goals1| Assists0| Balls recovered36| Passing accuracy78.34%| Yellow cards1Lionesses’ Euro 2025 triumph will ‘inspire people’ and spark change, Wiegman saysRead moreAlex Greenwood (defender)Came into the tournament having just recovered from a knee injury and played every game. Started at centre-back but was shifted to full-back after the loss to France exposed England’s left side. Her return to the position where she began her career brought more stability. Struggled defensively at times but was a key outlet going forward and built a strong relationship with Lauren Hemp.7Appearances6 |Minutes played625| Goals0| Assists0 |Balls recovered36 |Passing accuracy82.5%| Yellow cards0Leah Williamson (defender)The first England captain to win back-to-back trophies and the first to do it overseas. Led her team by example both on and off the field while carrying an ankle knock. One of the best ball-playing centre-backs in Europe, her passing ability adds a different dynamic to the attack. A near-perfect performance in the final where she didn’t concede a single foul in 120 minutes. Only blemish was seeing her penalty saved.8Appearances6|Minutes played580| Goals0| Assists0| Balls recovered47|Passing accuracy86.84%| Yellow cards0Jess Carter (defender)Struggled down the left against the speed of France and Sweden but looked much more comfortable when moved to centre-back. The character she displayed after receiving racist abuse was admirable. A quiet leader who gained her 50th cap during the tournament.Her performance in the finalwas standout for the way she commanded the backline and handled Spain’s numerous tricky attackers with ease. 7Appearances6|Minutes played431| Goals0| Assists0|Balls recovered27|Passing accuracy73%|Yellow cards0Keira Walsh (midfielder)Ever present at the heart of midfield. Can struggle to impact proceedings when marked out of games but found herself higher up the field than normal and influencing the attack. Strong dynamic with both Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone. Rewarded with a goal against France. Tireless performance marshalling Aitana Bonmatí in the final and played a crucial role in the buildup to Alessia Russo’s equaliser.7Appearances6|Minutes played599| Goals1| Assists0 |Fouls committed5|Passing accuracy82.67%|Yellow cards0View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze (left) and Michelle Agyemang, celebrating after the final, were two of England’s strongest performers.Photograph: Pedro Porru/SheKicks/SPP/ShutterstockGeorgia Stanway (midfielder)Produced her best performance in an England shirt for quite a while in the final with her undimmed energy and tenacity in a challenge. Struggled at the start – not completely unexpected given her time out with injury – but grew into the tournament and role. Her two goals – one from the spot and one trademark effort from distance – contributed to the Lionesses’ progression from the “group of death”. 7Appearances6| Minutes played519| Goals2| Assists0 |Fouls committed7|Passing accuracy81.5%|Yellow cards0Ella Toone (midfielder)“I’ve missed this Ella Toone. I’ve not had it for a while,” Toone said after her standout performance against Wales. There is no doubt it has been a tough year for England’s No 10 after the loss of her father, Nick, in September. Found her form at the perfect time. Her marshalling of Patri Guijarro in the final was tireless and effective.8Appearances6|Minutes played427| Goals2| Assists2 |Fouls committed2|Passing accuracy84%|Yellow cards10:51Lionesses greeted by jubilant England fans on return home after Euro 2025 victory – videoLauren James (forward)When James is on the pitch, anything can happen. Her recovery from a hamstring issue that had kept her out since March was a massive boost but maybe too soon for her to show her best consistently. Player-of-the-match worthy performance against the Dutch and Wales, with the iconic celebrations to boot, but an ankle injury sustained against Sweden and Italy hampered her performance in the final as she was forced off early. 7Appearances6|Minutes played391| Goals2| Assists0 |Total attempts14|Passing accuracy85.34%|Yellow cards0Lauren Hemp (forward)Another of England’s injured cohort who just about made it back in time. Lack of minutes in the buildup to the tournament probably meant she wasn’t always at her most effective but an ever-dependable outlet on the left. Her shift to the right side against Spain was a crucial tactical element to the Lionesses’ success as she challenged Olga Carmona constantly with her speed.7Appearances6|Minutes played528| Goals1| Assists0 |Total attempts13|Passing accuracy77%|Yellow cards1View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo celebrates with Ella Toone (left) and Lauren Hemp (right) after scoring the equaliser in the final.Photograph: Harry Langer/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockAlessia Russo (forward)Goals always matter when judging a centre-forward’s performance and she was unable to find the form in front of goal that had served her so well this season – until the final, when she scored a superb header to equalise against Spain. She was not helped by a lack of service but it is her work out of possession that really influenced England. Her tireless running and intelligence in activating the press was second to none.8Appearances6|Minutes played507| Goals2| Assists3 |Total attempts16|Passing accuracy82.84%|Yellow cards1Esme Morgan (defender)Made her first major tournament appearance against Sweden as a second-half substitute and was instrumental to the success of England’s shift to a back three that changed the course of the match. Her aerial ability and pace were crucial in steadying the defensive ship. Strong against Italy despite the pressure of the occasion with a performance that displayed her growing maturity.7Appearances2|Minutes played170| Goals0| Assists0 |Balls recovered12|Passing accuracy94.5%| Yellow cards1Michelle Agyemang (forward)The breakout star of Euro 2025. Propelled into the senior side at the last minute, the 19-year-old forward grabbed her opportunities with both hands. Displaying a maturity beyond her years, she was one of the Lionesses’ gamechangers. Saved England’s tournament twice with late equalisers against Sweden and Italy, while she came on to provide fresh energy with the score level in the final. Never looked fazed by the pressure.9Appearances4|Minutes played138| Goals2| Assists0 |Total attempts6|Passing accuracy72.5%| Yellow cards1Chloe Kelly (forward)England’s title winner not once but twice. When Kelly enters the pitch, you know something will happen. Her impact from the bench was undeniable as she challenged tiring defences with her direct running and pinpoint deliveries. Her trademark penalty style just added to the story. A rollercoaster of a year but she finishes on a high with Champions League and Euros winners’ medals.9Appearances6|Minutes played251| Goals1| Assists2 |Total attempts8|Passing accuracy78.84%| Yellow cards1View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly enjoys her winning penalty, the second time she has come on to decide a Euros final.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockBeth Mead (forward)Ever reliable when called upon despite the disappointment of having to start from the bench. Her goal against Wales and the celebrations that followed were emotional. Asked to play in every midfield position in the knockout stages and did so with competence. Added crucial defensive cover in addition to her attacking abilities.7Appearances6| Minutes played278| Goals1| Assists1 |Total attempts3|Passing accuracy71.67%|Yellow cards1Niamh Charles (defender)Reliable whenever she was called upon. Her goalline clearance against Sweden was notable as was the way she brought composure to England’s defence in the latter stages against Spain. Confident penalty in the final shootout.6Appearances5|Minutes played78| Goals0| Assists0| Balls recovered3| Passing accuracy82%| Yellow cards0Aggie Beever-Jones (forward)Saw less game time than she was perhaps hoping for but caught the eye when given her opportunity. An instinctive goalscorer, she opened her major tournament account with a fine finish against Wales. Crucial impact and energy from the bench to help England over the line in the semi-final.7Appearances3|Minutes played74| Goals1| Assists1 |Total attempts2|Passing accuracy79.34%|Yellow cards0Grace Clinton(midfield)Given limited time from the bench but replaced tired legs in midfield with efficiency on multiple occasions.

Would probably have hoped for more.6Appearances1|Minutes played45| Goals0| Assists0|Total attempts1|Passing accuracy87%|Yellow cards0Anna Moorhouse (goalkeeper)Came into the squad off the back of an outstanding season at Orlando Pride, providing competition to a goalkeeping unit that was dealing with the loss of Mary Earps. Did not play.Khiara Keating (goalkeeper)Potentially England’s No 2 in the tournament but was not called upon. A vivacious, bubbly character who, in her own words, brings the vibes and no doubt plenty of competition. Did not play.Maya Le Tissier (defender)Can count herself unlucky to be on the fringes after a superb season at Manchester United. Would have upped the levels in training and her leadership on the bench would have been key. Celebrations with Beever-Jones after the win against Sweden were an example of the team unit England have built. Did not play.Lotte Wubben-Moy (defender)The ultimate team player. Wiegman knows she can rely on her to step up behind the scenes and provide both competition and leadership on and off the field. Did not play.Sarina Wiegman (head coach)It often seems that Wiegman herself doesn’t even understand how she has managed to win three straight European Championships. Guided England with composure and quiet leadership even in the tensest of moments. A clear bond with and trust in her players to create the environment where their resilience can thrive. Maybe a bit slow to make changes in games at times but it is hard to argue with her judgment given her record. 9Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nine clubs voted in favour of that proposal on Monday afternoon; the Guardian understands that Hull FC and Hull KR voted against the idea, while Wigan Warriors abstained from voting.However, the next steps towards expansion are complicated and epitomise the chaos that continues to engulf the sport’s boardrooms following Wood’s controversial return to power.Twelve of the 14 teams that play in Super League next year will be determined bythe IMG gradings systemwhich was introduced last year. That measures clubs in a variety of on- and off‑field metrics, giving them a score out of 20. The 12 clubs which rank the highest in October will be automatically assured of a spot in Super League in 2026.The expectation as things stand would be that the Championship side Toulouse would replace Salford in the top 12. But that will not be the only change, as two more clubs will essentially be handpicked by an independent panel, based on a selection of criteria that is yet to be finalised.That panel will be led by the RFL board member Lord Jonathan Caine but will also include members of Wood’s strategic review committee. Wood was, up until earlier this year, the chair of another side that will now be strong favourites to return to Super League, Bradford Bulls.They are not the only ones who will be hopeful of promotion through this unique and somewhat peculiar method. The Championship leaders York Knights are confident they have a compelling case to become a Super League side for the first time, while London, who would have missed out under the gradings system, now have an increased chance due to support in the boardrooms at certain clubs for the Broncos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Super League is keen to position itself in as strong a position as possible ahead of a new broadcast cycle beginning in 2027.Supporters of the move believe a more simplistic fixture list, with the elimination of loop fixtures where some teams play each other three times, will appeal to all stakeholders. There were also concerns in some quarters about having two French sides, Toulouse and Catalans, in a 12-team competition, which would limit revenue streams.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Morecambe Football Club will also be removed from the National League Cup for the forthcoming season.”The committee will meet again on 20 August to consider whether Morecambe have satisfied its financial concerns and “to decide the club’s ability to retain membership in the competition”. That meeting is scheduled for after what would have been Morecambe’s opening three games of the new season.Whittingham’s Bond Group Investments have been involved in a contentious takeover saga over the past two years that has led to the resignation of Morecambe’s board of directors, seen wages paid late and prospective owners, Panjab Warriors, threaten legal action. Panjab Warriors received EFL clearance to complete a takeover last month only for Whittingham to announce that a new buyer had come forward.Whittingham issued a long-awaited statement on the takeover on Sunday in which he claimed his company “has continued to work with the consortium led by Jonny Cato in their efforts to acquire the majority shareholding” in Morecambe. He blamed negative media reports for giving the consortium “cause for concern and pause” and claimed the Bond Group had been unable to contact Panjab Warriors over the past week.Morecambe were relegated from the EFL last season after 18 years. Lizzi Collinge, the Labour MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said recently there was a “very real risk” that the club would soon cease to exist.Explore more on these topicsMorecambeBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

He suggests a change to the ratio of duty to Levy, combined with an extension of the Levy to bets on overseas racing, would improve significantly the proportion of overall betting turnover that is returned to the sport.View image in fullscreenThe Labour MP for Halesowen, Alex Ballinger, provided a foreword to the report by the Social Market Foundation.Photograph: PetaPix/AlamyThe SMF report notes that Martin Cruddace, the chief executive of the major racecourse group Arena Racing Company, recently proposed an inversion of the rates charged for Levy and betting duty, but suggests that this “does not go far enough” to address “systemic underfunding”. It proposes that a reduction to 5% of gross profits for racing bets alone, alongside an increase to 20% for the Levy, “would ensure fiscal neutrality for the betting industry, while fundamentally reorienting the distribution of revenue in favour of the sport”.Johnson was among several representatives of racing’s key stakeholder groups who met Noyes last week to discuss the SMF proposals, and said on Monday that the report is “a sensible and informed piece of work that could be a route for the government to resolve the issues that have beset the sport in recent years and which are affecting our ability to compete with other jurisdictions”.He added: “Whilst our immediate priority has been to ensure that the Treasury does not inflict a significant blow on racing via tax harmonisation, we are aware that success here does not resolve the challenges faced by the sport at present, or undo some of the damage inflicted in recent years.Quick GuideBHA announce start date for new chairShowThe British Horseracing Authority said on Monday that Lord Allen of Kensington will take up his new role as chair of the organisation on 1 September, after the Labour peer won his first major battle in the world of racing politics and persuaded the  BHA board to back his plans for a fully independent board of directors.Allen was  announced as BHA chair in November 2024 with a start date of 2 June, but his arrival as the head of racing’s ruling body was postponed in May to allow him to “continue meeting stakeholders to better inform his vision for the sport”.The board  comprises an independent chair, four independent directors and four member-nominated directors, two from racecourses and two to represent the sport’s participants, including owners, trainers, jockeys and stable staff.Allen is believed to have insisted on an end to the member-nominated directors before agreeing to take up his new role, having concluded that the presence of sectional interests at the top of the organisation was a potential barrier to progress and innovation.Following a meeting of the board on Monday, there was agreement that the BHA would start working towards an independent board of directors, allowing Allen to take up his new role in a few weeks’ time.“I am delighted we have agreed to a process towards a new independent BHA board,” Allen said in a statement on Monday, “and I look forward to formally starting in September. Horse racing has a strong future. There is work to do, but I am in no doubt as to the passion and commitment of the many thousands of people who make up our industry.”Greg WoodWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The SMF proposes a tax solution that is mindful of the very different social and economic aspects of different types of gambling, and which seeks to support a sport that means a great deal to the British public.”In his foreword to the SMF report, Ballinger, the Labour member for Halesowen, said that “as the Treasury considers changes [to the tax regime around gambling], it is vital that they reflect the real impact of gambling on people’s lives”, and describes its “practical” proposals as “smart, fair ideas that deserve serious attention”.Ballinger said: “The evidence is clear: some gambling products – like online slots – cause far more harm than others”, adding: “These harms carry huge costs, from personal debt and family breakdown to rising pressure on public services. Our tax system should reflect this.”The British Horseracing Authority released research on Monday which suggests that tax harmonisation at a rate of 21% could lead to an industry-wide revenue loss of “at least £330m in the first five years” and put “2,752 jobs at risk in the first year alone”. The BHA has also launchedan online petitionwhich calls on the government to “rethink” its plans on gambling taxation.The Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), the main body representing the gambling industry in the UK, said on Monday that arguments for a hike in gaming taxes were “naive”.“Some naively argue that tax increases should target gaming while sparing sports betting or carving out horse racing,” a BGC spokesperson said.“But the reality is our members don’t ringfence products in that way, these are integrated businesses. Any tax rise, whether on betting or gaming, affects the whole operation. That means less money available for sponsorship, media rights and support for sports like racing, which is especially vulnerable to changes in the customer offer.”Sun can shine for MenuisierThe Goodwood Cup is the feature event on the opening afternoon of Glorious Goodwood on Tuesday, when the locally trainedSunway(3.05) could prove to be a decent each-way alternative to Aidan O’Brien’s Illinois, the runner-up in last year’s St Leger, in the two-mile Group One contest.Illinois has progressed steadily since his near-miss in the Doncaster Classic and put up a career-best to finish a seven-length runner-up behindTrawlerman in the Gold Cup at Ascotlast time.He is also Ryan Moore’s pick for Tuesday’s race ahead of his three-year-old stable companion, Scandinavia, but he looked a little ill-at-ease on the undulations at Chester in May and does not have as much to spare on ratings as an early price of around 6-4 might suggest.Scandinavia, meanwhile, will be making his third start at a staying trip in the space of six weeks, and at around 14-1, Sunway makes plenty of appeal to spring a surprise.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowGoodwood1.20 Tony Montana (nap) 1.55 Zavateri 2.30 Kinross 3.05 Sunway  3.45 Dream Composer (nb) 4.20 Naval Light 4.55 Dash Of Azure 5.30 Cinque VerdeBeverley2.10 Blue Yonder 2.45 Rosso Levanto 3.20 Jeddaal 4.00 Haberdash 4.35 Believe In Glory 5.10 Catch Cunningham 5.47 Mayberry MoonFfos Las5.42 Neptune Legend 6.15 Shetakesthegold 6.50 Sundiata Keita 7.25 Zilfee 8.00 Fifty Sent 8.30 ZooksRipon6.00 Al Shaham 6.30 A’Ali G 7.05 Silver Chamber 7.40 Canaria Queen 8.10 Ferrari Gold 8.40 HomelandWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.David Menuisier’s colt has not raced beyond 12 furlongs since finishing just a length and a half behind Illinois in the St Leger, and remains unexposed at staying trips.He was also less than a length behind Los Angeles in last year’s Irish Derby during a run of five straight starts at Group One level, and a sharp two miles around Goodwood could be the ideal track and trip for Sunway to register a first success at the highest level since his juvenile campaign.Goodwood 1.20:Tony Montanadid not appreciate the drop back to a mile for the Royal Hunt Cup last month and is better judged on his two-length second behind an unexposed rival over track and trip in May.

Every time the new Arsenal striker stepped on to the pitch, defenders, goalkeepers and managers braced for 90 relentless minutes. Across his two years atSporting, he scored 68 goals in 66 league appearances – and added another 29 in other competitions. But what is it really like to face the Swedish forward? And how can Premier League teams hope to contain him?For Kewin Silva, the name stirs up difficult memories. In April, the then Moreirense goalkeeper was forced to fish the ball out of his net three times during one of Gyökeres’s standout performances for Sporting. Earlier in the season, the modest northern club had stunned the Lisbon giants with a 2–1 home win. Gyökeres did score from the penalty spot that day, but Moreirense’s defence managed to keep him quiet otherwise. In the return fixture, however, with the title race intensifying, nothing could stop him.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres delivered one of his standout performances for Sporting against Moreirense.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/Reuters“I don’t have the best of memories from him – he scored in most of the games,” the Brazilian goalkeeper says with a chuckle. “We were fully aware of his individual quality. Because of that, we knew we had to be extra cautious, especially in terms of cover when he managed to break free. We’d often have to foul him just to slow him down.”Describing Gyökeres almost like a recurring nightmare, Kewin vividly recalls some moments that showcased the striker’s brilliance. “I remember in one match, he dribbled past my centre-back near the edge of the box and took a toe-poke shot,” he says. “It was really powerful, but I managed to save it. He’s that kind of complete player – able to finish from anywhere, read the game intelligently and give depth by holding up play.”How to stop him: the tactical breakdownCarlos Carvalhal, the former manager of Swansea City and Sheffield Wednesday, was at the helm of Braga last season. His team were one of the few to take points off Sporting in the run-in, earning a hard-fought draw in Lisbon. Gyökeres opened the scoring early, but was effectively shut down for the remainder of the match. So what can Premier League teams learn from that performance?“He has a preferred movement – drifting from the centre out to the left wing,” Carvalhal says. “To neutralise that, we focused on maintaining balance on our right side – their left. Sporting would try to draw our right-back out of position to create space for Gyökeres. So we trained our right-back specifically to avoid being lured out. That way, Gyökeres always had to deal with him directly. As a result, we didn’t allow him many clear chances.”View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres prefers to drift out from the centre to the left wing.Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty ImagesThat wasn’t the only key, but Carvalhal says it was the most critical tactical element. Corners and other set pieces can also be a particular challenge. Although Gyökeres scored only five goals with his head for Sporting, Carvalhal says: “He is a very strong player in the area whenever there is a cross. We played with a very finely tuned sectorial tactic, keeping the four defenders really close together so he didn’t have space. It turned out well.”Carvalhal also highlights how Gyokereshas grown during his timeat Sporting, developing into a more complete forward. “If Arsenal are leading, he’ll exploit the open spaces. If not … well, I believe he’s improved a lot in terms of link-up play. Arsenal don’t just play wide; they also construct through the middle. Right now, he’s much better suited to their style than when he first arrived in Portugal. Back then, he was all about pace and power. He’s since refined his game considerably.”‘One player on him at all times’Gyökeres built a reputation for tearing through defences. Rúben Fernandes, the former captain of Gil Vicente, was one of the players tasked with shadowing him. He remembers with pride the night his team kept a clean sheet against Sporting – one of the rare occasions that season. The match, played in December 2024 in Barcelos, ended 0-0.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were “two or three players” specially assigned to make sure the forward didn’t have his way. “He was one of the most dangerous players; it’s normal he has at least one player on top of him at all times,” he says.View image in fullscreenRúben Fernandes was tasked with shadowing Viktor Gyökeres when Gil Vicente managed a rare clean sheet against Sporting.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesAfter the match, the dressing room was filled with pride. The draw felt like a victory against the champions. “We felt like we’d completed our mission,” Fernandes says with a grin. “He was scoring in nearly every game. So for us to shut him down – that’s something all the players, especially the defence, could be proud of.”Asked what advice he’d give to Premier League defenders, Fernandes acknowledges that things may be tougher for Gyökeres now. “Players in England are more physical and used to his power. What tips can I give them? Never leave him alone, always have players around him.”The message from Portugal is clear: Gyökeres can be stopped – but never easily.Arsenalfans hope his best is ahead, as a more complete and dangerous version of the player who barely got a look in during his time at Brighton from 2018-21 and has played in the Championship with Swansea and Coventry steps on to the Premier League stage. For defenders across England, his arrival should be a warning sign.Explore more on these topicsArsenalEuropean club footballSportingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The European trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič described it on Monday as a “breakthrough” in the face of a potential ruinous trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.The deal willimpose 15% tariffs on almost all European exports to the USincluding cars, about triple the 4.8% tariff now in force, but avoid the threat of punitive 30% import duties being imposed on Trump’s 1 August deadline for a deal.EU-US tariffs: five key takeaways from the trade dealRead moreThe high-level French criticism, and Emmanuel Macron’s silence since the deal was signed between Trump and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, shows potential divisions as Brussels seeks to get approval for the deal from member states.Merz said the deal, which was clinched in a ballroom at Trump’s golf resort in Scotland, avoided “needless escalation in transatlantic trade relations” and averted a potentially damaging trade war. However, he said Germany would face “substantial damage” from the tariffs but: “We couldn’t expect to achieve any more.”Meloni welcomed the deal, saying it had avoided “potentially devastating” consequences.Speaking at a summit in Ethiopia, she said a “trade escalation between Europe and the US would have had unpredictable and potentially devastating consequences”, while adding that Rome would have to “study the details” of the deal.The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he gave his support for the deal “without any enthusiasm”.European stock markets hit a four-month high at the start of trading on Monday, amid relief that a deal had been reached. Germany’s Dax jumped by 0.86%, and France’s Cac 40 index rose by 1.1%, lifting the pan-European Stoxx 600 index to its highest level since late March.However, the rally fizzled out after France made clear its disapproval. Germany’s Dax, France’s Cac and the Stoxx 600 all closed lower on Monday. Wall Street was roughly flat by early afternoon in New York.The euro fell by almost 1% against the US dollar, down one cent to 1.163.“This state of affairs is not satisfactory and cannot be sustained,” the French European affairs minister, Benjamin Haddad, said on X, urging the EU to activate its “anti-coercion instrument”, which would allow for non-tariff retaliation.The French trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, criticised the EU’s handling of the negotiations, saying the bloc should not have refrained from hitting back in what he described as a power struggle initiated by Trump.“Donald Trump only understands force,” he told France Inter radio. “It would have been better to respond by showing our capacity to retaliate earlier. And the deal could have probably looked different.”Fresh details have emerged of the deal, with senior officials saying the 15% tariff on EU exports would apply to 70% of goods sold to the US.Zero rates will apply to EU exports in important sectors including aircraft parts, some chemicals, semiconductor equipment and some agricultural products such as cork used in wine bottles and flooring.The EU pharmaceutical sector will not face tariffs of more than 15% under the deal it struck with Trump, officials have said.Senior EU officials revealed that pharma exports from the EU will remain duty free until such time as Trump completes his section 232 national security investigation into pharmaceuticals.Even if he does decide to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals in the future, EU officials extracted a commitment from Trump that they will be set at a top level of 15% when it comes to EU products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In two major respects, however, the outcome remains much worse than the situation before Trump started his new round of trade wars early this year,” said Holger Schmieding, Berenberg’s chief economist.“The extra US tariffs will hurt both the US and the EU. For Europe, the damage is mostly front-loaded,” Schmieding said in a note to clients on Monday morning.“The deal is asymmetric. The US gets away with a substantial increase in its tariffs on imports from the EU and has secured further EU concessions to boot. In his apparent zero-sum mentality, Trump can claim that as a ‘win’ for him,” Schmieding added.The Italian bank UniCredit also said Trump had got the better of the EU. “Is this a good deal for the EU? Probably not. The outcome is heavily asymmetrical, and it leaves US tariffs on imported EU goods at much higher levels than EU tariffs on imports from the US,” UniCredit said in a note to clients.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionTariffsEuropeDonald TrumpFranceItalynewsShareReuse this content"

There’s no reason in waiting. It’s 50 days. I want to be generous, but we just don’t see any progress being made.”Russian and Ukrainian diplomats met in Istanbul last week, agreeing on little more than a prisoner exchange. Ukraine proposed a summit by the end of August between the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but Russia’s reply was that such a meeting would only be appropriate if it were to sign an agreement. The meeting was the third negotiation in Istanbul. Putin has not attended any of the talks, despite Trump’s exhortations.Trump’s comments in recent weeks reflect the continuing change from his almost-conciliatory posture. US diplomats asked China to stop exports of dual-use goods that the Washington says contribute to Russia’s military industrial base.Trump said he was “disappointed” in Putin earlier on Monday. “We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever. You have bodies lying all over the street, and I say that’s not the way to do it. So we’ll see what happens with that.”Two weeks ago, Trumppromiseda punishing round of new sanctions against Russia if Putin did not begin a ceasefire period for negotiations. An agreement for European allies to purchase billions of dollars in additional armaments for Ukraine, including Patriot missile defense systems, accompanied the 15 July statement during a meeting with Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He faces a 12-year prison sentence in a case that has become highly politicised.The case dates back to 2012, when Uribe accused the leftwing senator Iván Cepeda before the supreme court of hatching a plot to falsely link him to rightwing paramilitary groups involved in Colombia’s long-standing conflict.The court decided against prosecuting Cepeda and pursued his claims against Uribe. As the judge started reading her verdict, Uribe – who attended the trial virtually – sat shaking his head. He is Colombia’s first-ever former head of state to be convicted of a crime.Paramilitary groups in Colombia emerged in the 1980s to fight Marxist guerrillas that had taken up arms against the state two decades earlier with the stated goal of combating poverty and political marginalisation, especially in rural areas.Many armed groups adopted cocaine trafficking as their main source of income, the genesis of a deadly rivalry for resources and smuggling routes that continues to this day.Uribe was a politician on the right of the political spectrum – like all Colombian presidents before the current leader, Gustavo Petro, who unseated Uribe’s Democratic Centre party in 2022 elections.During his tenure, Uribe led a relentless military campaign against drug cartels and the Farc guerrilla army, which signed a peace deal with his successor, Juan Manuel Santos, in 2016.After Cepeda accused him of having had ties to paramilitary groups responsible for human rights violations, Uribe is alleged to have contacted jailed ex-fighters to lie for him. He claims he only wanted to convince them to tell the truth.More than 90 witnesses testified in the trial, which began in May 2024. Prosecutors produced evidence during the trial of at least one paramilitary ex-fighter who said he was contacted by Uribe to change his story.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Vanessa Whyte, 45, a vet originally from County Clare, her son James, 14, and daughter Sara, 13,were also killed.A murder investigation was launched last week, with police saying a triple murder and attempted suicide was one line of inquiry. All four suffered gunshot wounds.“Detectives have reiterated their appeal for anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, to come forward,” a police spokesperson said.The shooting stunned the rural community, prompting tributes. “We are heartbroken. May they rest in peace,” said a note left with flowers at the scene.A prayer service for Whyte and her children took place in Barefield, Co Clare, followed by a community vigil in Maguiresbridge on Friday.During the service, parish priest Tom Fitzpatrick said: “The unspeakable tragedy that has befallen our parish is something that is very hard to focus in on and get our minds around.“What affects an individual or affects a particular family in the parish, it affects everybody,” he added. “I know Vanessa was a woman who gave, and who gave, and who gave, and James and Sara were light made flesh themselves.”View image in fullscreenVanessa Whyte and her children, Sara and James, were killed at their home last Wednesday.Photograph: PSNI/PAHe said: “Let us remember Vanessa not just by the way she died, but by the life she lived, her smile, her strength, her incredible powerful love for her children. She gave it her all to the very end.”“We remember James and Sara, not just as victims of violence, but as children who played and who laughed and had their favourite stories, of course favourite foods I’m sure as well, and great dreams. Dreams that will never be fulfilled, but dreams that mattered because they were theirs.”A funeral service is expected to take place in Co Clare later this week.Whyte reportedly moved to Fermanagh several years ago and was employed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Enniskillen.Colleagues and friends said she was popular, down-to-earth and devoted to her children. Enniskillen Royal grammar school said it was mourning “the loss of two vibrant and much valued pupils”.The ambulance service said it had received a call at 8.21am on Wednesday and dispatched emergency crews to the scene, where Whyte and one child were pronounced dead.Rutledge was airlifted to the Royal Victoria hospital in Belfast, while the second child was taken to a hospital in Enniskillen, where they were pronounced dead.Pat Cullen, the Sinn Féin MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said people were mourning valued members of the community. “Two wee children have lost their lives and a mummy, when they just should be enjoying the school holidays and having a wonderful time,” she told the BBC.A tribute to Whyte and her children was displayed at the All-Ireland final in Croke Park in Dublin on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

In these areas, heat index values (how hot it feels once humidity is accounted for) are forecast to range between 105 and 113F (40.5 to 45C).Some locations inMississippiandLouisianaface an even greater threat, with the heat index possibly soaring as high as 120F (49C).Meanwhile, the midwest isn’t escaping the heat. Conditions there remain hazardous into Monday and Tuesday, after a weekend in which temperatures felt as if they were between 97 and 111F (36 to 44C) in areas from Lincoln,Nebraska, north to Minneapolis.How climate crisis makes rainstorms that flooded New York more commonRead moreCities such as Des Moines, St Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Raleigh are under extreme heat warnings. In these locations, temperatures will climb into the mid-90s and low 100s, with heat indices potentially reaching 110 to 115F.The most dangerous conditions, classified as level 4 out of 4 on the heat risk scale, encompass much of Florida and extend north intoGeorgiaand the Carolinas. A broader level 3 zone stretches from the eastern plains through the midwest and into the mid-Atlantic. This follows a weekend already dominated by extreme temperatures.Tampa experienced an unprecedented milestone on Sunday when it reached 100F (37.8C). Other cities also broke daily temperature records, and more are expected to follow suit.The dangerous heat and humidity are expected to persist through midweek, affecting major metropolitan areas including St Louis, Memphis, Charlotte, Savannah, Tampa and Jackson,Mississippi. Actual air temperatures will climb into the upper 90s and low 100s, while heat index readings are expected to remain between 105 and 115F for several days due to high tropical moisture.Relief will be hard to find, even during the night. Overnight and early morning temperatures are forecast to dip only into the 70s or above, keeping conditions uncomfortable around the clock.However, a cold front moving in later this week is expected tobring a drop in temperaturesacross the eastern US, offering a much-needed break from the extreme heat by the weekend.Elsewhere, triple-digit temperatures will dominate the central US. The combination of soaring heat and dense humidity in the Mississippi River valley and central plains could make conditions especially hazardous, with some areas possibly seeing the heat index reach 120F.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

While no one single weather event can be blamed on the global climate crisis, the warming world is experiencing a greater frequency of extreme weather incidents.According to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(Noaa), excessive heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the US, and the problem is only intensifying. For vulnerable populations, such as migrants, prisoners or schoolchildren in under-cooled buildings, the burden of rising temperatures is compounded.Despite the increasinglycrucial need to find solutionsfor the rising temperatures, many US agencies are currently understaffed due to cuts from the Trump administration and the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).Federal science agencies such as Noaa are now operating at reduced capacity despite the outsized weather threats.

The SFI, which pays farmers to look after the environment, wasfrozen this year in a surprise move. The scheme is expected to reopen next year.Reed said: “We also have to work with the farming sector to tackle pollution from agriculture. We are looking at how we can reform SFI so that when it opens in the new year there will be more actions in there focused on cleaning up water, because that’s in the interests of the country as a whole, but it’s also in the interests of the farming sector. So we’ll have more to say on that.”He is expected to launch these changes by the end of summer.The NFU announced it was starting a new programme that would work with scientists to help farmers measure the pollution in the waterways near their farms, so they could take steps to improve the water quality and see the progress.The summit was held on the NFU vice-president Rachel Hallos’s farm. On her land, which is owned by YorkshireWater, there are two reservoirs. Reed toured these and saw they were completely dry, which has raised concerns about water supply and food production in the area. Yorkshire was the first area of the UK to implement a hosepipe ban this summer. It is in drought after the driest spring on record.The NFU president, Tom Bradshaw, said farmers were having to deal with weather extremes due to climate breakdown. He added: “I think that, rather than being extreme, that is now the reality that we’re all having to deal with, and that as farmers, we’ve got to work out how we can mitigate the risk, how we can try and manage the situation so that we don’t lurch from one catastrophic problem of not being able to plant out crops, then them flooding, or not having enough fodder because we haven’t had the rainfall.”Reed suggested he might make it easier for farmers to build reservoirs on their land to hold water during dry conditions. He said planning had been “too slow”, adding: “Farmers can’t get on and build reservoirs that they need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Here is the story of how plastic contaminates entire ecosystems – and even the food we eat.Illustrations by Claire HarrupThe age of extinction is supported byAbout this contentPhoebe Weston,Tess McClureMon 28 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 11.27 EDTShareThelife ofplasticThe beginning: a single threadView image in fullscreenAsingleThread-2Illustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAsingleThread-PinkIllustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianThe story starts with a single thread of polyester, dislodged from the weave of a cheap, pink acrylic jumper as it spins around a washing machine. This load of washing will shed hundreds of thousands of tiny plastic fragments and threads –up to 700,000 in this one washing machine cycle.Along with billions of other microscopic, synthetic fibres, our thread travels through household wastewater pipes. Often, it ends up as sewage sludge, being spread on a farmer’s field to help crops grow. Sludge is used as organic fertiliser across theUS and Europe, inadvertently turning the soil into a huge global reservoir of microplastics. One wastewater treatment plant in Wales found1% of the weight of sewagesludge was plastic.From here, it works its way up the food chain through insects, birds, mammals and even humans. Perhaps our jumper’s life as a garment will end soon, lasting only a few outings before it emerges from the wash shrunken and bobbling, to be discarded. But our thread’s life will be long. It might have only been part of a jumper for a few weeks, but it could voyage around the natural world for centuries.Into the world of soil and wormsView image in fullscreenLifeInTheSoil-2Illustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianView image in fullscreenLifeInTheSoil-PinkIllustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianSpread on the fields as water or sludge, our tiny fibre weaves its way into the fabric of soil ecosystems. A worm living under a wheat field burrows its way through the soil, mistaking the thread for a bit of old leaf or root. The worm consumes it – but cannot process it like ordinary organic matter.The worm joins nearly one in three earthworms that contain plastic, according toa study published in April, as well as a quarter of slugs and snails that ingest plastic as they graze across soil. Caterpillars of peacock, powder blue and red admiral butterflies all contain plastic too, perhaps from feeding on leaves contaminated with it, research shows.With the plastic in its gut, the burrowing earthworm will find it more difficult to digest nutrients, andis likely to start shedding weight. The damage might not be visible but for insects,eating plastic has been linked to stunted growth, reduced fertility and problems with the liver, kidney and stomach. Even some of the tiniest lifeforms in our soil, such as mites and nematodes – which help maintain the fertility of land – arenegatively affected by plastic.Plastic pollution in the marine environment has been widely documented, but aUN report foundsoil contains more microplastic pollution than the oceans. This matters not only for the health of soils, but because creepy crawlies such as beetles, slugs and snails form the building blocks of food chains. Our worm is now enabling this plastic fibre to become an international traveller.Up the food chain, into mammals and birdsView image in fullscreenBirdandMammals-FinalIllustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianView image in fullscreenBirdandMammals-PinkIllustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianIn a suburban garden, a hedgehog snuffles through a dozen invertebrates in a night, consuming plastic fibres within them as it goes. One of them is our worm.A study that looked atthe faeces of seven hedgehogs, found four of them contained plastics, one of which contained 12 fibres of polyester, some of which were pink. If hedgehogs don’t live in your country, substitute another small, scurrying mammal or bird: the same study found mice, voles and rats were also eating plastic, either directly or via contaminated prey.Birds that eat insects such asswifts,thrushesandblackbirdsare also ingesting plastic via their prey.A study earlier this year foundfor the first time that birds have microplastics in their lungs because they are inhaling them too. “Microplastics are now ubiquitous at every level of the food web,” says Prof Fiona Mathews, environmental biologist at the University of Sussex. Themeat, milk and bloodof farm animals also contain microplastics.At the top of the food chain, humansconsume at least 50,000 microplastic particles a year. They are in ourfood,water, and the air webreathe. Fragments of plastic have been found inblood,semen,lungs,breast milk,bone marrow,placenta,testiclesand thebrain.Washing into rivers and blowing in the windView image in fullscreenWater,Soil,Air-2Illustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianView image in fullscreenWater, Soil, Air-PinkIllustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianEven as it makes its way up the animal food chain, our polyester fibre has not been broken down. At some point, the thread returns to the dirt when the creature that consumed its host dies, and a new adventure starts. The body will decay, but the polyester fibre will endure. Once in the soil, it is ploughed in by the farmer before crops are sown. But it may not stay there for long – strong winds blow the dry, degraded soil into the air, taking with it a pink fragment of plastic. In heavy rain, the fibre could be swept into a river flowing to the sea: a major source of marine contamination isrun-offfrom land.This process of moving through natural systems over years has been called “plastic spiralling”.Scientists have foundthat microplastics equivalent to 300m plastic water bottles have rained down on the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree and other US national parks. Even the most remote places are contaminated.One scientist found12,000 microplastic particles a litre in samples of Arctic sea ice, swept there by ocean currents and blown in by the wind.Infiltrating plants, flowers and cropsView image in fullscreenPlants-2Illustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianView image in fullscreenPlants-PinkIllustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianWith the passage of time, our plastic thread has still not rotted, but has broken into fragments, leaving tiny pieces of itself in the air, water and soil. Over the course of years, it could become so small that it infiltrates the root cell wall of a plant as it sucks up nutrients from the soil. Nanoplastics have been found in the leaves and fruits of plants and, once inside, they can affect the plant’s ability to photosynthesise,research suggests. Here, inside the microscopic systems of the plant, the bits of our pink fibre cause all kinds of havoc –blocking nutrientand water channels,harming cellsandreleasing toxic chemicals. Staples such as wheat, rice and lettuce have been shown to contain plastic, which is one way they enter the human food chain.Eight billion tonnes of plastic and countingView image in fullscreenSourcesOfPlastic-2Illustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianView image in fullscreenSourcesOfPlastic-PinkIllustration: Claire Harrup/The GuardianFrom its humble beginnings, our fibre may have journeyed around the world, shedding bits of itself along the way, and working its way into almost every layer of different ecosystems and the far reaches of the natural world. Extracting it once it begins that journey is extremely difficult. The best way to prevent its spread is to stop it at the outset – before the worm, before the soil, before the washing machine, even before the jumper is made.Since the 1950s, humans have produced in excess of8.3bn tonnesof plastic – equivalent to the weight of one billion elephants. It finds its way into packaging, textiles, agricultural materials and consumer goods.Opting to live withoutit is almost impossible.Fast fashion companies, drinks giants, supermarket chains and big agricultural companies have failed to take responsibility for the damage this has caused, says Emily Thrift, who researches plastic in the environment at the University of Sussex. She says individual consumers can reduce their consumption but should not feel that this is entirely their responsibility. “If you do make this level of waste, there needs to be some form of penalisation for doing it,” she says. “I truly believe until there is policy and ways to hold big corporations accountable, I don’t see it changing much.”"

The price of chocolate on UK supermarket shelves has also been pushed up by poor harvests linked toextreme temperatures in west Africa, whilecoffeeprices have been pumped up by bad weather hitting production in Brazil and Vietnam.Drawing together climate data, analysis of international and domestic trade flows, and economic modelling, the Autonomy researchers said that increasing numbers of heatwaves and droughts would imperil staple crops, disrupt supply chains and intensify inflationary pressures.Scientists say climate breakdown caused by the burning of fossil fuels means more frequentfloods and droughtsare likely in the UK. Food prices worldwide have also been affected by poor harvests, conflict and Donald Trump’s trade wars.With almost half of food consumed in the UK imported from overseas, British households are highly vulnerable to climate shocks hitting the price of groceries from key producers in countries including Spain, France and Brazil.Domestic farming is also under pressure, with storms and floods slashing UK vegetable production by 12% in 2023.Warning that rising temperatures affecting major food producers in Europe and beyond stood as a major risk to household finances, the report said by 2050, under a high-emission “worst-case” scenario, food prices could rise by 34%.Under a “best-case” scenario, whereby global heating would be limited to 1.5C by 2100 rather than 4C in the worst-case, it warned that cumulative food price inflation could still reach 25% by 2050.Lower-income households would be disproportionately hit because they spend a larger share of their monthly budgets on essential items such as bread, rice and meat. It said heatwaves in the UK, as one of several drivers of climateflation, could cost an average household between £917 and £1,247 by 2050.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one case the BMA refused a plea for a resident doctor – one below the level of consultant – to return to Milton Keynes university hospital to help staff a prostate cancer biopsy service.The union declined the request because it judged that there was no urgent clinical need for the doctor to return to work, in line with its policy that derogations should be for emergency situations only.NHS England says the BMA had by Sunday rejected 18 requests for derogations during the strike – the 12th involving training-grade doctors since 2023 – and granted nine.An NHS spokesperson said: “Derogation requests for resident doctors to work in exceptional circumstances are being made by the most senior clinical teams on the ground, and delays or refusals by the British Medical Association questions their integrity and risks patient safety.”However, the BMA told members via social media on Sunday that it had received 47 requests and as a result agreed that 16 resident doctors, from a total of 125 the NHS asked for, could break the strike and return to work. For example, over the weekend a doctor went back in to help staff the neonatal intensive care unit at Nottingham city hospital while three others provided cover overnight at the Northern general hospital in Sheffield.The union claimed NHS chiefs were asking for too many derogations because they had failed to ensure that some hospitals had enough medics on duty to cover for striking resident colleagues.“Unfortunately, often due to poor timing of requests … there have been some situations where patients’ safety has been at risk, with not enough doctors to ensure emergency care, leading to last-minute derogations,” it said in a social media post.“These hospitals have a lot to answer for, to the resident doctors, and the patients they have failed.”Senior NHS officials say that fewer resident doctors have joined the ongoing strike compared with the 11 walkouts that junior doctors staged in 2023 and 2024 and also that more planned hospital activity – operations and outpatient appointments – had gone ahead this time round.One well-placed source estimated that whereas about 80% of eligible doctors took part in the previous strikes, the figure appears to have dropped to about 60% in this stoppage.“Participation is lower this time. Some resident doctors are less comfortable going on strike this time round, after the 22% pay rise over two years they got last year.“There’s less sympathy among other NHS staff for resident doctors this time. And there’s frustration about how quickly they went on strike so soon after their significant pay rise.”The BMA will try to increase the pressure onWes Streeting, the health secretary, on Tuesday by picketing King George hospital in Ilford, the main hospital that provides care to people in his Ilford North constituency.Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsHospitalsIndustrial actionHealthWes StreetingNursingShareReuse this content"

He always denied being Stakeknife.Inhis ruling, published on Monday, Flaux said a hearing to decide whether the will should be sealed was held in private on 21 July. The application was made by a man named Michael Johnson, who had said he was prepared to act as Scappaticci’s representative providing that the will was sealed.Christopher Buckley, acting for Johnson, had told the court that making the will public would be “undesirable” and “inappropriate”. A barrister for the attorney general, who represents the public interest, had supported the application.Flaux said: “There is nothing in the will, which is in fairly standard form, which could conceivably be of interest to the public or the media.”He added that there was “the need to protect the applicant and those named in the will from the real risk of serious physical harm or even death because they might be thought to be guilty by association with the deceased”. This was demonstrated, the judge said, by “the real risk to his life and wellbeing which the deceased faced in his lifetime”.He ordered the will should be sealed for 70 years.A seven-year investigation into Stakeknife – alleged to have been the highest-ranking British intelligence agent in the IRA during the Troubles in Northern Ireland – published last year found thatmore lives were lost than savedbecause of his activities. Scappaticci, from west Belfast, was not named as the agent in the report.Scappaticci, who went into hiding in England afterhis identity was revealed in 2003by the media, failed in a legal attempt to force the government to publicly state that he was not Stakeknife.He was linked to more than a dozen murders during his time as a senior member of the Provisional IRA’s ruthless internal security unit known as “the nutting squad”, which was tasked with identifying and killing security force informers.Flaux said in his judgment: “The allegation that the deceased was working for the British government was particularly inflammatory in the Catholic community inNorthern Irelandgiven that he was alleged to have been responsible within the IRA for dealing with individuals accused of spying on the IRA.”In 2022,the Guardian revealedthat senior government officials privately believed that the practice of keeping secret the wills of the royal family was legally questionable and warned ministers not to discuss it in parliament. The same year,the court of appeal dismissed a legal challengeby the Guardian to the exclusion of the media from a secret court hearing in which a judge banned the public from inspecting Prince Philip’s will.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandIRAEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

In some experiments, an additional subset of participants were shown the faces displaying an expression of fear.In one experiment, participants were asked to press a button as fast as possible after receiving a mild touch to their face while an avatar was shown.The team found that when the avatars showed signs of sickness, participants pressed the button when the faces appeared further away than for faces showing a neutral or fearful expression.Results from EEG tests to investigate the electrical activity of the brain tallied with these findings. As expected, as avatars loomed closer, the brain system that represents the space closely surrounding our body became activated. However, this activation differed when the avatars showed signs of infection compared with neutral expressions, even when they appeared far away. These differences, the team add, were localised in areas of the brain involved in detecting and filtering threats.The team found that functional MRI (fMRI) brain scans supported these results, further revealing that when infectious avatars were shown there was a greater connection between this threat-detection network and part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which acts as a key regulation centre for the body.The team also found differences in participants’ blood when they were shown the infectious avatars compared with neutral or fearful faces.“[In terms of cells], we saw mainly that there is an activation of an immune cell family called the innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)that [are] early responders in immunity to basically alarm other immune cells,” said Prof Camilla Jandus of the University of Geneva and an author of the study.The team added that they found a similar activation of ILCs when they examined the blood of individuals who had received an influenza vaccine but had not been exposed to the VR setup.Dr Esther Diekhof of the University of Hamburg, who was not involved in the work, said the study chimed with previous research,including that of her own team.“The study provides yet another good example for the existence of a mechanism that responds to potential contagion threats even before the immune system has come into contact with pathogens,” she said.But Prof Benedict Seddon, of University College London, said questions remained, including whether the observed responses help the immune system actually fight an infection.“When we get infected, by Sars-CoV for instance, it can take a day or two for the infection to establish and for the immune system to become aware of it and respond, a long time after the initial encounter that stimulated this short-lived mobilisation,” he said.Explore more on these topicsImmunologyInfectious diseasesMedical researchBiochemistry and molecular biologyVirtual realityBiologyMicrobiologynewsShareReuse this content"

More than 220 MPs, a third of parliament, signed a letter addressed to Starmer on Fridaycalling for the UKto recognise a Palestinian state.“We are expectant that the outcome of the conference will be the UK Government outlining when and how it will act on its long-standing commitment on a two-state solution; as well as how it will work with international partners to make this a reality,” the MPs wrote in the letter.Starmer will recall his cabinet from their summer break for an emergency meeting on theGazacrisis this week and government sources have said that formal recognition of Palestinian statehood was a matter of “when, not if” under the Labour government.He was also expected to pushDonald Trumpon the issue of humanitarian aid and a growing crisis of malnourishment and starvation in Gaza. On Monday, two leading human rights organisations based in Israel, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights, were reported to say thatIsrael was committing a genocideagainst Palestinians in Gaza and the country’s western allies have a legal and moral duty to stop it.Trump says he does not endorse Netanyahu’s claim there is no starvation in GazaRead more“We need to galvanize other countries in support of getting that aid in, and yes, that does involve putting pressure on Israel, because it absolutely is a humanitarian catastrophe,” said Starmer in remarks alongside the US president on Monday as the two leaders met at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland to discuss trade and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.The talks begin just days after Macron said that Francewould recognise Palestinian statehoodin September, saying that the decision would “ensure its viability, and ensure that by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, it contributes to the security of all in the Middle East”.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, condemned Macron’s decision, saying that it “rewards terror” and that a Palestinian state would be a “launchpad to annihilate Israel”.Israel also criticised the Saudi-French-led conference on Monday. “This conference does not promote a solution, but rather deepens the illusion. Instead of demanding the release of the hostages and working to dismantle Hamas’s reign of terror, the conference organizers are engaging in discussions and plenaries that are disconnected from reality,” said Danny Damon, the Israeli ambassador to the UN.The US has echoed the Israeli sentiment and on Monday called the conference “unproductive and ill-timed.”“The United States will not participate in this insult but will continue to lead real-world efforts to end the fighting and deliver a permanent peace,” state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. “Our focus remains on serious diplomacy: not stage-managed conferences designed to manufacture the appearance of relevance.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaFranceUnited NationsEmmanuel MacronIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Details continue to emerge regarding the treatment of Venezuelans by Salvadorian prison officials.On 18 July, the US,El SalvadorandVenezuelaengaged in a prisoner swap that released 252 Venezuelan men from the notorious Central American megaprison.According to press reports, Venezuelan immigrants who were sent by the US to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, known as Cecot for its Spanish acronym, have said they were subjected to horrific abuse, including beatings, torture, denial of food and, in one case, sexual assault. Lawyers for some of the mensaid they endured“state-sanctioned torture”, the Guardian reported.Men freed from El Salvador mega-prison endured ‘state-sanctioned torture’, lawyers sayRead more“I am concerned that, in paying the Salvadoran government to detain immigrants at Cecot, the administration funded human rights violations with taxpayer dollars,” Ramirez’s letter says. “I urgently request that we hold a hearing on how US funds were used to enable these flagrant human rights abuses at Cecot.”Garbarino did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment about Ramirez’s letter.The second Trump administration has designated a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, a foreign terrorist organization. In March, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act and claimed that the Venezuelan government had sent members of Tren de Aragua to “invade” the US.Intelligence agenciesreportedly contradictedthe administration’s claims linking the gang to the Venezuelan government. But in mid-March, immigration officers quietly filled planes with Venezuelan and Salvadorian immigrants who were detained by the US and quickly sent them to El Salvador to be detained in the Cecot prison.A federal judge ordered the planes to return after they took off. Despite the court order, the flights arrived inEl Salvador, setting the stage for a unresolved court battle between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary.Chart into migrationSee more of the Guardian’s immigration crackdown charts and datahere.The Trump administrationsent more peopleto El Salvador’s Cecot prison later in March.After the expulsions and deportations, news reports revealed that the US government relied on flimsy evidence to accuse the deported immigrants of gang membership.One case that gained significant media attention was that ofAndry Hernández Romero, a 32-year-old gay makeup artist whose crown tattoos near the words “Mom” and “Dad” in Spanish were cited as evidence that he was a gang member.The Venezuelan men were detained in Cecot for months and released on 28 July in a prisoner swap. The Venezuelan men were sent back to Venezuela, while a number of US nationals detained in the country were returned to the US – among them a former US marine who had beenconvicted of a triple murder. The Salvadorian men sent to Cecot by the US government were not released as part of the swap.After his release, Hernández Romero told journalists his time in Cecot was “an encounter with torture and death”,Reuters reported. “Many of our fellows have wounds from the nightsticks; they have fractured ribs, fractured fingers and toes, marks from the handcuffs, others have marks on their chests, on their face … from the projectiles.”In another interview with Venezuelan media, Hernández Romero said he was sexually abused by guards.The Venezuelan government has said it will investigate El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, a close Trump ally, over the alleged abuses.Bukele’s Cecot prison has been a defining centerpiece of his administration in recent years. In 2022, Bukele declared a state of exception, leading to a massive crackdown on gangs in the country and the construction of a network of secretive prisons, including Cecot. Bukele’s government has invited US representatives, social media influencers and international media to tour the facility.Details of the deal between the US government and El Salvador to detain the nearly 300 immigrants are still mired in secrecy. The US frequentlyinvoked the “state secrets” privilegeduring court proceedings to avoid any disclosures regarding its deal with Bukele.In recent months, more questions have arisen regarding the deal between the Trump administration and Bukele. During the Alien Enemies Act expulsions, the Trump administrationexpelleda top MS-13 leader to El Salvador and is currently trying to return a second one, leading to accusations that the US is trying to do a favor for Bukele.Bukele reportedly requested the return of key MS-13 leaders from US custody, critics say, to allegedly prevent them from revealing further information about a controversial 2019 pact between his government and the gang.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationHouse of RepresentativesEl SalvadorDemocratsUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Now he’s bringing a new work to the UK, featuring a revolving mirrored door and a pole dancerMon 28 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 06.52 EDTShareYou may have seen a certain video online of a man climbing some stairs. Actually, he’s repeatedly falling from them but then magically bounces back up, weightless as a moon-walker. Out of sight is a trampoline, which gently catapults his looping, twisting body up the staircase each time he falls, turning a would-be simple journey into anepic, poetic odysseythat has caught the internet’s imagination. Pop star Pink saw it and immediately got on the phone to its creator; Martin Short even madehis own versionon Only Murders in the Building.The act is the work of French choreographer-director Yoann Bourgeois, 43, whose live performances have been touring festivals for years. But the popularity of his videos online has propelled him into new realms, working with Harry Styles, Coldplay, Selena Gomez and Louis Vuitton. He continues to create new, live work and brings his latest outdoor piece, Passage, to Greenwich and Docklands festival this summer.Some people run away to the circus; others have it arrive on their doorstep. Bourgeois’ parents separated when he was growing up in Jura, eastern France, and their house was sold to a circus group, Cirque Plume. Bourgeois was already interested in theatre (and later studied dance) and he began to train with the group. “In a way I was looking for a way to get back home,” he says, via a translator. It wasn’t just about returning to the physical building, but the spirit of childhood. “I really wanted to continue to be a child. I’ve searched for a life where I can continue to play; it drives my career even now.”What Bourgeois plays with are the invisible physical forces that surround us – gravity, tension, suspension – and the interaction between those forces, the performers’ bodies and symbolic ideas. For example in Ellipse, the dancers are in costumes like lifesize Weebles with semi-circular bases, rocking and spinning, but never falling. A man and woman “dance” together, swaying past each other but never quite managing to connect. (Missy Elliott wore a version of the same costume in her videoCool Off.) InCelui Qui Tombe (He Who Falls), the performers stand on a wooden platform that rotates, at some speed, then tilts, forcing their bodies to lean at precarious angles to keep their balance, and the group have to navigate this peril together.View image in fullscreenYvonne Smink in Passage.Photograph: Lydie RoureThe short piece Bourgeois is bringing to London is called Passage, and features a revolving mirrored door and pole dancerYvonne Sminkhanging, swinging, balancing and turning the simple act of crossing a threshold into something of infinite possibilities. Much like the way sculptor Antony Gormley hit upon a universal idea in his use of the body, Bourgeois works with the same kind of directness: a seemingly simple setup or visual idea that represents something huge – life, death, time, mortality, struggle, hope – in a way that’s easily readable but can feel profound. Here he is talking about suspension: “In physics, suspension means the absence of weight. But if we speak about time, suspension means absolute presence. And I think this cross between absence of weight and absolute presence is like a small window on eternity. That’s what I search for: to catch the present, to intensify the present.”Even though Bourgeois seeks to be live in the ephemeral moment, you can see why the recorded versions have gone viral. He admits his work looks good on screen. “I feel very lucky because, by chance, my work can be eloquent in this kind of frame, on Instagram for example,” he says. He’s interested in clarity not overcomplication and embraces his wide fanbase. “I didn’t grow up in a family interested in art,” says Bourgeois, and that’s who he imagines making his work for.He’s reaching even more eyeballs now with his pop star collaborations. For the Harry Styles videoAs It Was, Bourgeois designed another revolving platform that saw Styles and his lover being pulled together and apart. “Behind the superficial pop veneer of the song, there’s a great sense of despair,” he says.Bourgeois designs his own stage machines, but the revolving floor is, he points out, a very old theatrical device. The question of what’s truly new in art came to the fore when he was accused of plagiarism in a video posted online comparing scenes from his work with scenes from other artists. There are some striking similarities but Bourgeois is robust in his defence, saying that the works referenced motifs from the history of art, which he considers to be in the public domain. Many circus performers will use the same props. “If you use just a frame of a video, it’s easy to make a comparison,” he says. “What is original is the treatment and the creative process.” We need to look at the whole work rather than an isolated image, he insists. What’s certain is that Bourgeois can turn universal ideas into something eye-catching that connects deeply with audiences – imbued with the wonder of circus and the grace of dance.Greenwich and Docklands international festivalruns from 22 August to 6 September.

And once those algorithms get going, you can’t stop them. It’s the first French-language song to hit more than a billion streams on Spotify’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 28 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTSharePatrick Watson, singer, songwriter, pianoI’d been commissioned to do the score for a French film, Mères et Filles [released with the English title The Hidden Diary, 2009], starring Catherine Deneuve. I’ve done quite a few scores and usually you talk to the director, then it’s your job to help the storyline do what it needs to. There’s a scene at the end of the film where the main character leaves a letter under the door, which to me suggested the title Je te laisserai des mots, meaning: “I will leave you some words.”In my studio in Montreal, I came up with what I thought was a nice little melody. I’m from Quebec, so although I’m an English-speaking person, I’ve always been surrounded by French. Whenever I have the opportunity to sing or write in French, I do. Although I like singing in French, it’s a very difficult language to sing in because of the vowel structure. There aren’t many words in Je te laisserai des mots and the first verse is entirely wordless. I didn’t think it needed any more words so I just made vocal sounds. Also I probably imagined the song starting to play at the end of the film while there is still dialogue, so didn’t want words to clash. We were kind of half-drunk when we did the strings arrangement. It was a really fun night – but outside the film, I didn’t think anyone would ever listen to the song.I might be renting skis and they’ll see my name and go: “Oh, you have the same name as the singer.” I say: “It’s me!”It initially appeared as a bonus track on my debut album. Then it suddenly took off in the pandemic. Because I couldn’t tour, I was doing lots of live Instagrams, which prompted someone to send me a video they’d made of Je te laisserai des mots. It had a million views and once those algorithms get going, you can’t stop them. Sometimes certain emotions hit at a certain time and a song can become the soundtrack of that moment. Before I knew it, people all over the world were making their own lockdown videos featuring Je te laisserai des mots.When I first came into the music business, execs didn’t take me seriously because I didn’t have “radio songs”, but the advent of syncs and then streaming have made a new kind of hit possible. The song’s now had something like 200,000 TikTok videos featuring it, more than 60bn TikTok plays and it’s the first French language song to hit more than a billion streams on Spotify. I find such huge numbers hard to digest but the song is much more famous than I am. I might be renting skis or something and they’ll see the name and go: “Oh, you have the same name as the singer.” I’m like: “It’s me!” And they don’t believe me.Mélanie Vaugeois, violinOur string quartet played with Patrick for 15 years and we’re still close. When we started touring with him, our kids were quite young so Patrick named us Mommies on the Run. We were his first experiment with a string quartet but after a while on tour we were wilder than him. We’d shout: “No kids!”It was such a great adventure and we all spent a lot of time together. We’d go to Patrick’s place, there would be things everywhere and you’d put your violin case on the ping-pong table. Patrick would play on the piano and we’d improvise around that. One night Patrick said: “I have a French song. What do you think of my accent?” He speaks French very well but had never sung in it and there were a lot of mistakes in the pronunciation, but they were part of the charm so he kept them in.It was a fun session and at one point we had some Jameson whiskey. We tried for a long time to find the right notes and got a little drunk. Everything was starting to slide when suddenly it all just fell into place. There’s almost no rhythm to Je te laisserai des mots, which again is part of the charm. It’s a beautiful song that makes your heart melt, and during the pandemic, when we were all very lonely, it touched a lot of people’s hearts. I first became aware that it was taking off when my kids were on TikTok and I heard the song. I went: “That’s my quartet!” They couldn’t believe it. They told me: “That song’s everywhere.”Although Patrick isn’t obliged to give us songwriting royalties, every year he gives us a symbolic amount to show his gratitude, which is really nice and shows that he respects the fact that people pulling together in that moment created something special.Patrick Watson’s new album, Uh Oh, is released in the UK on 26 September.

It seemed faintly ridiculous that Aliens was the chill-out film for this particular moment, but we watched it and, as ever, it hit the spot.‘I am elated each time I watch’: why Rushmore is my feelgood movieRead moreI’ve viewed Aliens at least once a year for the last decade. It is both an excellent and terrible movie. Helmed byJames Cameronin place of the original Alien director Ridley Scott, this pumped-up-on-steroids 1986 sequel retains the grisly design of its predecessor. Its walls and ceilings are covered in wet gloop and fleshy tendrils, like the insides of a giant body. Its monsters bring to life the trailblazing designs of the Swiss “fantastic realist” artist HR Giger. Almost four decades after its release, the film’s world building remains chillingly authentic, as a group of marines – plus a villainous corporate executive, heroic android, feisty lone-survivor child andSigourney Weaver’s gun-toting yet wholesome protagonist Ellen Ripley – discover then attempt to escape a nest of parasitic aliens, their nightmarishly outsized mother and her lethal henchmen.The film’s high stakes are rarely far from the action while it hits just the right balance between absurd terror and genuine emotion. Like many of Cameron’s movies, it simultaneously sends up and fetishizes military power, though ultimately the characters that survive are head-smart first and trigger-happy second. Its cheesy humour stops the violence from descending into cold detachment. The blusterous self-assurance of Bill Paxton’s Pte Hudson is repeatedly undermined by douchebag lines like “We just got our asses kicked, pal!” I’ve watched it so many times, I can picture his exact look of wide-eyed incredulity. Al Matthews’ cigar-loving Sgt Apone satirises the macho marine trope, admonishing his unit with “All right sweethearts, what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?”Aliens is a fast-paced, jump-scare-ridden scramble to violent demise or unlikely escape. Once it’s been rewatched to death, there is a calm relief to its desperate fight for survival. I know who will live and who will perish; that the invasive titular form will ultimately not endure. In place of leaping out of my skin and hiding behind a cushion, viewing this movie now brings something else: the chance to process my own physical and emotional angst. When done well, the horror sci-fi genre functions on multiple levels, creating thrilling entertainment while also inviting its audience to digest real life experiences that are too painful or immediate to look at directly.The culturally deep-rooted terror of women’s bodies and their functions is a central aspect of the movie. The young facehugger aliens attach to their victims’ mouths to plant an embryo inside, which then grows in their hosts’ bodies before bursting out the chest. There are undeniable parallels with the oft-unspoken horrors of pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the unsettlingly sci-fi retrievals and implantations of IVF. The movie revels in a certain revulsion at hyper-fertility and the act of birth, but it also captures the natural fears and frustrations of existing in a body that can grow and explosively eject a living being in a manner that is richly cathartic.Alien designer HR Giger: ‘I am afraid of my visions’Read moreAs a psychotherapist currently in the middle of Kleinian training, I am drawn to embracing the dark side of the body. The British psychoanalyst Melanie Klein addressed the feelings of violence, rage and disgust that can be a normal part of the embodied psyche. I can’t help but see her ideas woven through Aliens, as Ripley relentlessly tears through a grotesque symbol of extreme motherhood. A romcom may distract me temporarily from the bodily dread of IVF needles, speculums and dearly longed for new life, but the visceral sight of exploding eggs and torsos hits something deeper and more real.Aliens, with its invasive, parasitic monsters, finds parallels with other psychological and bodily battles that are often repressed. Over the years, this film has always provided a release, whether working through rage, sexual trauma or long Covid. It strikes the perfect tonal balance that enables momentary relief without further traumatising. After Ripley settles Newt, Hicks and Bishop into their cryo-sleep, her final long rest is well-earned and beautifully peaceful. I, too, always sleep well after watching it, my nightmare-prone mind settled knowing the on-screen and internal big beasts have momentarily been vanquished. I just have to pretend Alien 3 was never made.Aliens is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAlienMy feelgood movieSigourney WeaverJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An Iranian exiled in France, he has made documentaries about the most fervent supporters of the Islamic regime, starting with Bassidji in 2009.In 2012, Tamadon was detained by Iranian authorities for hours of questioning, and though he was subsequently released, he became persona non grata in his home country. Now the director has turned to the tools of film-making to try to lay out a path for a return. He gathered a group of fellow exiles, with whom he re-created the lengthy interrogation sessions they once endured. His hope was that that final film would stir introspection, and even empathy, in the hearts of their former tormenters.This idea was, in truth, a naive one – as is his directorial approach. In the beginning, we see Iranian refugees take turns cross-examining Tamadon in various abandoned buildings in Paris. These role-playing scenarios, however, pale in comparison to the testimony of exiles, who speak of harrowing abduction and torture that unfolded over months, if not years. In contrast, there are no real stakes to the reenactment, which wraps up in a matter of hours.Tamadon’s film only gains political heft when Zar Amir Ebrahimi, the acclaimed star ofHoly Spider, joins the experiment. Her probing questions, delivered in character as an intelligence officer, expose the various ethical issues surrounding Tamadon’s practice. Not only does role-playing reveal little about methods of autocratic control, such exercises may well re-traumatise victims of state violence. Framed in intimate, handheld cinematography, the tense two-day session between Tamadon and Ebrahimi bristles with a taut energy and Tamadon commendably builds the bulk of the film on these critiques, turning My Worst Enemy into an act of self-interrogation. It becomes a work about failure, and ultimately the limitations of cinematic techniques in dissecting and analysing systematic abuse.My Worst Enemy is on True Story from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIranMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Hailey Freeman in 40 Acres is the former – it’s in the genes. Her great-great-grandfather was a slave who escaped a plantation and made his way to Canada to farm. Now the land is Hailey’s and helpfully she’s ex-military, which comes in handy fending off cannibalistic marauders in a post-apocalyptic hellscape. Even better, she’s played by Danielle Deadwyler, the actor inexplicably snubbed for an Oscar nomination for Till.Set 14 years after a fungal pandemic wiped out the planet’s animal life, 40 Acres is essentially a home invasion thriller. Unfortunately, not everyone has gone vegan; gnarly cannibals prowl in packs, human body parts dangling from their necks as trophies. On the farm, Hailey (Deadwyler) lives with her partner Galen (Michael Greyeyes), his daughter, their kids, and her teenage son Manny (Kataem O’Connor). Galen is of Indigenous heritage, and is teaching the family Cree. To survive, Hailey rules her household like a general: iron discipline and daily push-ups. Deadwyler plays it with grit and feeling; her beautifully expressive eyes convey Hailey’s strength but at the same time the constant terror.Deadwyler’s performance is the driving force here. Without her, the audience’s attention might drift to the predictability of a plotline that hinges on Manny’s adolescent rebellion against his mum. There’s also the matter of some unnecessary flashbacks filling in backstories, leaking out tension. Which is a shame because first time feature director RT Thorne skilfully executes the cat-and-mouse games between the farm and the invaders, resulting in some uncomfortably suspenseful moments. And there are really interesting ideas, too, about this new horror in the context of Black and Indigenous experiences: displacement, generational trauma and survival.40 Acres is in UK cinemas and on MGM+ from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsThrillersHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Made after he withdrew from directing Howl’s Moving Castle for Studio Ghibli, it flits between a fraught, soap-operaish saga about a family reunion near the city of Ueda and the metaverse of Oz. It isn’t as sophisticated perhaps in its understanding of the online/real-world interface as his2021 film Belle, but the multilayered storytelling still shows plenty of panache, especially on the visual front.Maths boffin Kenji (voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas in the English-language dub) is browbeaten by schoolmate Natsuki (Brina Palencia) into attending her great-grandmother Sanae’s (Pam Dougherty) 90th birthday on her family estate; she needs a willing victim to pose as her boyfriend to impress the matriarch. Fending off his new in-laws, the teenager – also a part-time moderator for Oz – solves an encrypted math problem that opens a backdoor for a malevolent AI called Love Machine to corrupt the network. With much of the world dependent on the services hosted by Oz, much more than the birthday party is at stake.Hosoda shows a novelistic attention to detail that puts Summer Wars a cut above genre anime: from the sense of history underpinning the sprawling Jinnouchi family, always harping on about being descending from famously uncowable samurai, to the baseball game that is a meta-commentary on the unfolding online catastrophe. The deep texturing also extends to the images: not only the translucent and, from a 2025 perspective, somewhat utopian-looking online realm, but also piercing touches of IRL beauty. Sanae’s flowers blooming by night as Kenji solves his maths puzzle is a particularly delicate touch.Insisting, via Sanae, on family solidarity and civic spirit in the face of existential challenges, Hosoda also shows something of a moralistic streak. But in the case of Summer Wars, this conviction dissipates somewhat in a gabbled finale that leans into the film’s frantic tempo and assigns every Jinnouchi a supposedly key role in defeating Love Machine. Battling an apparently motiveless AI – whose link to bad boy prodigal son Wabisuke (J Michael Tatum) is underexploited – it feels increasingly consequenceless, as virtual action often does. But the narrative complexity and bravura imagery still impress.Summer Wars is in UK cinemas from 3 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeThrillersDrama filmsJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

I rip my shirt off’: the exploding career of Hanumankind, India’s hottest rapperCiaran ThaparHe’s a thrilling performer who rails against injustice and ‘mob mentality’ in his homeland – but is he burning himself out? Recovering from an onstage injury, he discusses stereotypes and subversionMon 28 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 06.08 EDTShareTwo weeks ago, halfway through his first ever UK show, Hanumankind instructed the crowd to mimic him by hopping to the right then to the left, back and forth, in unison. But the rapper fromIndiaslipped and fell, limping to the end of the gig in evident pain, kept upright by his DJ and inspired by the audience’s singalong familiarity with his catalogue.“We were ready to have a good time,” he sheepishly grins from an armchair at his record label’s offices three days later. It turns out he has torn a ligament. “It was a battle of internal turmoil. The show was like a fifth of what it was meant to be, but I gave it my all. London has a beautiful energy which gave me strength.”Even without the leg injury, the 32-year-old star, who was born Sooraj Cherukat, has reached a testing threshold in his short, explosive career. His tracks Big Dawgs and Run It Up, helped by action-movie music videos, have made him one of the most talked-about MCs in the world. A$AP Rocky and Fred Again are among his recent collaborators. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi even invited Cherukat to perform at an event in New York last September.But as a rare south Asian face in globally popular rap, he feels a certain responsibility. “The past year has been hard,” he says. “I’m trying to navigate through it.” What’s more, although he expresses a deep pride about life in India, “a lot of things are off. There is a mob mentality. There’s a lot of divisiveness because of religion, background, caste. It doesn’t sit well with me. I’m in a unique space to change the way people can think within my country.”I’m not just trying to speak to people who already agree with meBorn in Malappuram, Kerala, which he remembers as a “green, beautiful environment”, Cherukat spent his childhood following his father’s work abroad, from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia to Britain. “We’d traverse different countries and I’d sing songs in whatever language I was picking up,” he says. “Wherever I went, I had to get involvedandbe ready to leave. I learned to connect with people. That’s why the power of the word is so important to me.”At the age of 10, he landed in Houston, Texas, and found a rare stability. It was the early 2000s and the city was an engine room for rap innovation. Cherukat’s set his accent to a southern drawl. Already a fan of heavy metal – which makes sense given his grungy, rockstar leanings today – he became hooked on the local chopped-and-screwed subgenre pioneered by DJ Screw, Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat. In his teens he was “burning CDs full of beats, riding around smoking blunts and hitting hard freestyles”.He returned to south India just before hitting 20. “The only place I had roots,” he says. He completed a university degree in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, before working a corporate job in the tech hub of Bengaluru. Seeing rap as “a party thing, a way to de-stress and stay connected to the art form”, he performed at open-mic nights, softening his US accent and perfecting his stage show for an Indian audience. “Friends would come to watch and be like, ‘Dude, you’re not bad. You should lock in.’”View image in fullscreen‘There are days when you love the rain’ … artwork for his latest recording.Photograph: Diego BendezuSo he did. At the end of 2019, Cherukat played his first festival: NH7 Weekender in Pune, Maharashtra. The crowd went wild, quickly morphing from a small handful into a packed moshpit. “They’re rowdy and they’re fucking vibing,” he says. “I rip my shirt off. I’m like, ‘OK, I can do this!’” He quit his job and began plotting his next move, filling notebooks with lyrics throughout the pandemic. These are a blend of cheek and grit delivered with a flow that keeps respawning at different speeds and scales. Soon, Cherukat was signed by Def Jam India.Part of a movement to reject the remnants of British colonialism in favour of local expression, the proud, rebellious patchwork of Indian hip-hop encompasses the vast country’s “hundreds of languages, each as deeply rooted as the next”, Cherukat explains. “Someone who speaks Hindi or another regional language will give you a vast amount of depth and detail in what they’re doing.” His decision to rap mostly in English therefore came with risks of being perceived as inauthentic at home, but it has certainly helped his global crossover.Besides, he has found other ways to communicate a homegrown aesthetic.Run It Upmarches to the beat of Keralan chenda drums, while its video features martial artists from disparate corners of India. Cherukat performed it with a band of drummers at Coachella festival, his debut US gig. “Most people don’t know what is going on in my country,” he says. “Maybe I can open up some doors, open up some eyes, break out of these bubbles and stereotypes.” Although not religious, Cherukat has a divine figure woven into his performing name. Over recent years, Hanuman, the simian-headed Hindu god of strength and devotion, has been employed everywhere from the car stickers of hypermasculine Indian nationalism to the bloody, satirical critique ofDev Patel’s 2024 thriller, Monkey Man. Where does Hanumankind fit into this:traditionalist or progressive? “I need to make music for myself first,” he says simply. “But when you have a platform, you can bring about change through your words and actions.”Some fans were disappointed that he accepted the New York invitation from Modi – whose Hindu nationalist government has been accused of democratic backsliding and Islamophobia.Cherukat has defended his appearance, describing it as “nothing political … We were called to represent the nation and we did that.”View image in fullscreenBeautiful energy … performing live.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for CoachellaBut today he claims his “political ideology is pretty clear” to anyone who has been following his career. In one of his earliest singles, 2020’s Catharsis, he rails against systemic corruption, police brutality and armed suppression of protest. “I’m not just trying to speak to people who already agree with me,” he says. “I’m trying to give people who are otherwise not going to be listening a chance to be like, ‘OK, there is some logic to what he’s saying.’”Monsoon Season, his new mixtape, is just out. It features the mellow likes ofHoliday– performed on the massively popular YouTube series Colors – as well as raucous collaborations with US rap luminaries Denzel Curry and Maxo Kream. It is less a narrative album, more a compilation, with songs gathered over the years before the spotlight shone on him.“I have a lot of memories of coming into Kerala during the monsoon,” says Cherukat of the project’s name. “You can have days where things are absolutely reckless, flooded, out of control. There can be days where you get introspective and think about life. There are days where you love the rain: it feels good, there’s that smell in the air when it hits the mud, the soil, the flowers. Your senses are heightened. You can fall in love with that. Or it can ruin all your plans and you hate it.”Cherukat’s knee will take some time to recover before he embarks on a North American tour later this year. It’s clear he needs a break: not just to heal, but to continue processing fame, adapt to its changes and return to the studio. “I’m still adjusting,” he says. “The attention, the conversation, the responsibility, the lifestyle, all this shit. Things have been a little haywire. So I just want to go back to the source – and make music.”Monsoon Season is out now on Capitol Records/Def Jam IndiaExplore more on these topicsRapHip-hopIndiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thisshort obituaryconveys something of the range of his achievements, and suggests the sociability that was an additional gift and a vital dimension of the vocation as he lived it.A Hundred Doors is the title ofhis 2011 collectiondedicated to fellow Belfast poet,Frank Ormsby. Much of it is set in the west of Ireland townland, Carrigskeewaun, the ecological matrix of Longley’s later work. In 2010, Longley estimated that a third of all his poems had been inspired by the townland and places nearby.Longley’s regular stays in Carrigskeewaun were far from retreats into isolation. The poems grown there are as sociable as pastoral in spirit. Nature is cherished, but animals sighted and wildflowers identified open imaginative doors through which human individuals step, children, grandchildren, friends, always ready in the poet’s mind for the conversations, or possibilities of conversation, that crystallise into poems.The title-poem of A Hundred Doors is exceptionally silent. On the Greek island of Paros,Panagia Ekatontapiliani(also known as the Church of the Hundred Doors) becomes in the poem an un-social space that encloses the speaker in his own solitude. The mood is abrasive from the start: “God! I’m lighting candles again, still / The sentimental atheist.” The exclamation “God!” here might be an ironical summoning of the Almighty as witness or the mild curse of everyday grumbling: either way, that “still / The sentimental atheist” has a distancing, melancholy-humorous effect. It may even remind readers of the harsh honesty of the Welsh clergyman-poet RS Thomas: although Thomas wasn’t an atheist he wrote plentifully of his relationship with God as an exchange of absences or disappointments.Longley in this Church of a Hundred Doors seeks the homing ritual of “family names” that are themselves “a kind of prayer or poem”. We’re reminded of his particular art of poetic “listing” – oftencombining mourner and celebrant. In A Hundred Doors he doesn’t get far with naming names. The second stanza seems to begin with the slamming of a door as he finds himself “Supervised / by a xenophobic sacristan”. There’s no evidence in the poem that the intruder is “xenophobic”. The term may have been comic exaggeration, but it seems in earnest, an expression of anger. At this point, A Hundred Doors resembles an eloquent contribution to that old poetic genre,the complaint.Complaints are often addressed to the person or object complained of, whether a betraying lover or an empty purse. The anger here at first is murmured by the speaker only to himself. This inoculates the tone against humour, and ensures that longing and hurt are predominant. The emotions are shared only when the poet looks through “the windows in the floor” and sees “marble stumps aching through glass / For their pagan temple, the warm / Inwardness Praxiteles brought out, / The intelligence of stone.” This restorative and beautifully balanced stanza refers to the remains of the Greek temple, possibly dedicated to Demeter, over which the church was built. The word “stumps” evokes the hauntingly broken-armed statue ofHermes and the Infant Dionysus, attributed to Praxiteles and at the same time sets shivering another of those eco-connective threads in the collection, the moving handful of short war poems it contains, such as Citation, where the poet’s father receives the Military Cross “for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty”. His would be one of the names the poet wished to recall. The candles themselves become “names and faces”, following the poet as he kneels to “the windows in the floor”.In the last stanza anger rises to the surface, and its effect is to draw the reader in as witness. Figurative power increases: the “flame-flowers” suggest an instant of return to the townland, and a newly threatened pastoral, as the sacristan, knowing he’s watched and not caring, “blows them out, only minutes / Old”. Perhaps the sacristan symbolises Anthropocene man, maker of war on the environment, maker of wars that shatter civilian families, babies and children. The anger and even disgust at the casual inhumanity is a reminder that Longley was always a consummate poet of witness in the Belfast of the Troubles.The line-breaks are impeccable. In the penultimate line, the stress asserts plain fact: “HeknowsI am watching.” The subsequent enjambment allows a heavy, angry stress to fall on the negative: “and he /doesn’tcare as he shortens my lives.” It’s impossible to stand outside this judgment, and not to understand it as a voiced demand on the conscience of contemporary hearers and readers. You canhear Longley read it here.Explore more on these topicsMichael LongleyCarol Rumens's poem of the weekPoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The immigrant melting pot of New York is his stage; the intricate English language his prop. Shteyngart’s characters, typically lightly veiled alter egos, are always getting lost, tripping up and mangling basic social interactions. It’s the missed connections and short circuits that give his fictions their spark.Shteyngart’s sixth novel is a lively, skittish Bildungsroman, shading towards darkness as it tracks the journey – literal, educational, emotional – of 10-year-old Vera Bradford-Shmulkin, an overanxious, over-watchful academic high achiever whose run of straight As has just been blighted by a B. “Being smart is one of the few things I have to be proud of,” laments Vera, who diligently maintains a “Things I Still Need to Know Diary” in which she makes note of difficult words and intriguing figures of speech. The girl is articulate and precocious, bent on self-improvement, and never mind the fact that she confuses “facile” with “futile” and “hollowed” with “hallowed” and is wont to wax lyrical about the “she-she” districts of Manhattan. Her vocabulary is almost – but crucially not quite – sufficient to give us the whole story and explain what it means.Always happy to show his workings, Shteyngart cites Henry James’s 1897 novel What Maisie Knew as the prompt for Vera, or Faith’s child’s-eye account of complicated adult affairs, although his gauche heroine bears a passing resemblance to the author himself as portrayed in his 2014 memoir,Little Failure. Friendless Vera lives with her rackety Russian-Jewish father, Igor (Shteyngart’s name at birth), who edits a floundering liberal arts magazine, her harried Wasp stepmother, Anne (who added the “e” in tribute toAnne Frank), and a boisterous younger half-brother, Dylan, who likes exposing himself to houseguests. But she also has (or possibly had) a Korean-born mother, long since vanished from the scene. Invisible Iris Choi plays the tale’s white whale or MacGuffin; the elusive hidden figure that Vera is determined to locate.Desperate to redeem herself at school, Vera prepares to debate in support of a piece of racist legislationThe eccentric Bradford-Shmulkins are lurching towards crisis, but they seem a model of stability when compared with the rest of the country, which reveals itself in unflattering flashes in the corners of the narrative. Shteyngart’s novel, we come to realise, plays out a decade from now, in a “post-democracy” USA where red state officials monitor menstrual cycles, self-driving cars shop their owners to the feds and the news platforms are abuzz with Russian disinformation. Desperate to redeem herself at school, Vera prepares to debate in support of the proposed “Five-Three Amendment”, a piece of racist legislation that would grant added voting weight to those “exceptional Americans” whose ancestors arrived before the revolutionary war, “but were exceptional enough not to arrive in chains”. In so doing, of course, she’s arguing against her own interests. Blond, blue-eyed Dylan would count as an “exceptional American”. Dark‑haired, brown-eyed Vera would not.Henry James provides the prompt but his involvement begins and ends there, because Vera, or Faith isn’t Jamesian at all. The prose is simple, breezy and conversational, even when it’s stumbling artfully over its words. If Shteyngart’s novel possesses anything so fixed as a north star or a patron saint, it’s surely not James but Vladimir Nabokov. The title references Ada, or Ardor, while its protagonist comes styled in the manner of a pint-sized Timofey Pnin: a dogged innocent caught between cultures and half-lost in translation. In the course of her adventures, Vera learns that she was named after Nabokov’s wife, “a woman who was a genius herself but in the olden days she had to serve her husband”. Vera Nabokov’s 21st-century namesake – driven and decent and at the top of her class – similarly risks being dismissed as a second-class citizen.The novel is busy and ingratiating, almost to a fault, which is to say that it feels distracted, unsettled; a cultural code-switcher itself. Vera, or Faith was reputedly drafted at speed in a little under two months, incorporating elements from a spy novel that the author had recently abandoned. That accounts for its messy vitality and its frequent, perturbing shifts of gear. Shteyngart’s ode to a good American in a bad America conspires to be, by turns, a rueful human comedy and a coming-of-age caper, a dystopian chiller and an espionage yarn. The colourful tale never satisfyingly hangs together; its component pieces tend to jar more than gel. But Shteyngart sets about his material with abundant energy and charm. He sketches a convincing caricature of a near-future USA and provides a stoical heroine that we can uncomplicatedly root for. Even in a degraded, compromised, up-is-down social climate, that has to be deserving of a solid B grade at least.Vera, or Faith by Gary Shteyngart is published by Atlantic (£16.99).

The stony heart of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini contained only rage and a desire for vengeance towards the King of Kings (the Iranian monarch’s official designation). “This man has no place in Iran, and no place on Earth,” Khomeini told me in a chilling television interview before leaving Paris for Tehran. On the plane bringing him back from a 15-year exile a few days later to overthrow the shah’s regime, Khomeini muttered that he felt nothing –hichi– on returning home.The fact is, not many of the people close to him really loved the shah. He let his friends down, he dithered, he habitually took the advice of the last person he spoke to. “He was a difficult man to like,” said Sir Anthony Parsons, the British ambassador during the shah’s last days, who was closer to him than any other foreign diplomat. “He was so suspicious, so certain we were all trying to do him down. And yet there was a naked vulnerability about him which made you feel genuinely sorry for him.”King of Kings is a good and worthwhile account of his undoing, even if part of the subtitle – The Unmaking of the Modern Middle East – promises more than it delivers. It amply demonstrates the ways in which the shah was the author of his own downfall, constantly interfering in things he should have stayed away from. Of course there were broader causes of the Islamic revolution, chiefly the tidal wave of corruption that overwhelmed Iran when the oil price quadrupled after 1973; though the shah was partly responsible even for that, urging OPEC to screw more and more money from the battered west. But the revolution’s immediate cause was a single foolish brainwave of his own, at the very start of 1978 – exactly a year before he was dethroned.That was when the shah entertained Jimmy Carter, and his wife, Rosalynn, at the Niavaran Palace in Tehran. There they celebrated the apparent fact that for the first time in years there was no major threat to either of their nations. Peace and stability seemed entrenched. As Anderson notes, it was the last time an American president would set foot on Iranian soil. Days, perhaps hours after the Carters left, the shah called a senior minister and told him to organise a pseudonymous, innuendo-laden newspaper article accusing the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini of being a British agent. The minister, an intelligent and rational man, complained that publishing the article would stir up trouble. But the shah, buoyed up by Carter’s compliments, refused to listen.The article did stir up trouble. Khomeini’s followers in the religious schools of Qom and other centres poured out on to the streets in violent protest, and the army and police shot some of them down. In Shia Islam and Persian custom, each burial is followed 40 days later by another public commemoration, and every time, the police and army killed more demonstrators.Even when the demonstrations were a regular and growing occurrence, the Ayatollah Khomeini, the absentee leader of the demonstrations, had long been a virtual prisoner in the Shia religious centre of Najaf, in neighbouring Iraq, then ruled by Saddam Hussein. It was impossible for outsiders to get to Najaf and speak to Khomeini; but for no good reason the shah put immense pressure on Hussein to get rid of him. Hussein (who had no time for the shah and could see how this would end) duly threw Khomeini out. Khomeini’s more worldly-wise advisers persuaded him to take shelter near Paris, in the village of Neauphle-le-Château, where, as Anderson puts it “the residents [adjusted] to the sight of the old man in his black turban and brown robes given to morning strolls along the surrounding country lanes”. Suddenly, the world’s press could visit him and interview him whenever they wanted, and every word was beamed back to Iran. By November 1978 the shah’s downfall was inescapable.Anderson’s book suffers, in a way so many accounts by American writers seem to do, from concentrating on the Iran-US relationship to the virtual exclusion of any other (his excellent bookLawrence in Arabia’ was naturally free of this limitation). But he has interviewed some of the key people, including the genuinely tragic figure of the shahbanu, Farah Pahlavi, who understood what was happening in Iran but failed to influence her husband sufficiently, and gives a thorough overview of the sweep of events.From the Middle East to the war in Ukraine, the world is still experiencing the aftershocks of the fall of the shah, and it’s not over yet. And all, one is tempted to say, because this latter-day Richard II couldn’t help meddling in things best left alone. It was a tragedy – and not just for him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

At least, not in cinemas. However, for the first time in Bond history, the world will meet a newJames Bondin a video game, before a new 007 makes their debut on film.As developed by Danish studio IO Interactive for next year’s 007 First Light, the new Bond is blandly handsome in a doll-like way. He is fresh-faced, with blue eyes that appear more cocksure than piercing, in contrast to the refined older Bond of most films or Craig’s ruggedness – although he is clearly inspired by Craig’s man-of-action approach. The implication is not that this Bond will eschew these traits but acquire them. First Light is an origin story intended to define one of the most durable protagonists in entertainment for a new generation of game-literate fans.“The way we went about it was to start with the origin. Because then we get to play with questions such as, ‘Who is James Bond the young man, and what does it mean to be a 00 Agent?’” says IO Interactive co-owner and First Light creative director Christian Elverdam. “What does it mean to become 007?”Most James Bond video games to date have been shooters, in the mould of 1997’s wildly popular Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007. Despite the continued success of the first-person shooter genre that GoldenEye helped popularise, subsequent 007 games saw diminishing returns. The tepid reviews and poor sales of 2012’s 007 Legends put Bond’s video-game career on hiatus, until IO approached Eon Productions with a deceptively straightforward pitch: a game that is less about shooting things and more about recreating the experience of a Bond film.“There are great shootouts in the movies – but, if you think about it, it’s not that many, right?” says Elverdam. Correcting this discrepancy between the movies and games became “the nucleus” of IO’s pitch to Eon: to do Bond right in a video game, Elverdam says, meant letting players inhabit a character who is “not always shooting”.This was an easy case for IO to make, because it had done it before. Between 2016 and 2021, the studio released an impressive three-part reboot ofHitman, its series about an elite contract killer. With an admirable lack of self-consciousness, IO kept what worked about older Hitman games (prioritising elegant planning and problem-solving over wanton violence) and jettisoned what didn’t (a sometimes lurid tone and confounding story). The result was remarkable: a series of endlessly replayable puzzles whose solutions involved the untimely deaths of the worst of the global elite with little collateral damage and allowed the assassin to escape entirely unnoticed. Satirical, witty and clever, Hitman: World of Assassination was a compelling calling card for IO to leave in Eon’s hands.“All this stuff [in Hitman] feels like spycraft already,” Elverdam says, “So if we take that, and we take some leaps” – these leaps being the things a Bond game ought to include, such as driving, fisticuffs and, yes, shootouts – “that becomes the pitch for what would eventually be First Light.”View image in fullscreen‘Not always shooting’ … Bond takes to the road in 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveThe title is apt, as this game is the first glimmer of promising news for an entertainment property in a precarious position. Initially announced asProject 007in November 2020, the game has survived a tumultuous period for Bond, which began withthe $8.45bn (£6.3bn) mergerof the character’s studio home MGM with the e-commerce giant Amazon in March 2022. While the newly christened Amazon MGM would control the lucrative existing Bond catalog, the idea was that creative decisions on future films – including who would play the MI6 agent – would remain with Eon, with producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson steering the family business.Then, this February, Broccoli and Wilsonhanded creative control over to Amazonin an undisclosed but allegedly massive deal that ended the Broccoli family’s 63-year tenure as the stewards of James Bond’s cinematic exploits. In the months since, Amazon has begun to announce its plans, and selectedDenis Villeneuve to direct the next film. But everyone with a passing or professional interest in Bond is still waiting with bated breath fora casting decision, and what it may mean for one of the most lucrative film franchises in the world.With the next cinematic Bond in limbo, however, a new video game Bond can make a stronger impression. The firsttrailer for 007 First Lightisn’t terribly specific but it exudes confidence. It’s a montage affirming that everything fans love about 007 will be present. The death traps and gadgets from the Roger Moore era are there, as is the muscular physicality of Craig’s Bond, and the devil-may-care attitude consistent across all onscreen depictions of the character.View image in fullscreenEverything fans love about the series will be present.Photograph: IO Interactive“If you want to really do this with high ambition, you have to look at the different Bond instalments and figure out what each of them tried to do, and then let that inform your own take,” Elverdam says.While the creative director of First Light has much to say about 007 in general, he is not quite ready to talk specifics in relation to his version. The name of the voice actor playing Bond, for example, remains classified. But Elverdam is aware that, for all Bond’s enduring popularity, he is not a character who can just be dropped thoughtlessly into the modern world.“Every Bond is a Bond of their time, no matter how intentional you are. It’s unavoidable,” he says. “There is a zeitgeist in what you perceive as a threat, what you perceive as aspirational qualities – all that changes over time.” Elverdam rattles off some questions that IO’s version of Bond will consequently contemplate: when do you do your duty? When do you improvise? What does it mean to serve King and Country? Why do it in the first place?If Elverdam and IO are clever enough in answering these questions, they may give the next film-star Bond a run for his money.Explore more on these topicsGamesJames BondfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mariam Batsashvili was an enthralling soloist in Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 20.Clive PagetMon 28 Jul 2025 08.37 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 11.57 EDTShareThe ghost of Richard Wagner hovers over Anton Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony, most obviously in the monumental Adagio, completed mere months after the death of the Austrian composer’s musical hero and occasional drinking buddy. The slow movement duly occupied centre stage in Ryan Wigglesworth’s somewhat restrained interpretation with theBBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, its utterances simple, yet profound. This was no funeral oration, however, but a fond farewell, its tender tones occasionally ruffled by the phalanx of Wagner tubas unsettling the harmonies towards the bottom of the orchestra.Wigglesworth’s conducting benefited from his composer’s ear: orchestral balance was spotless; instrumental colours blended with an instinct for detail. Equally effective was his way of always keeping something in reserve, especially important in Bruckner where the slow build is paramount. In the first movement, the architectural framework was clearly defined, the conductor adopting a (mostly) non-interventionist approach to phrasing and rubato. Not that the performance lacked incident, with great wodges of brass giving way to the sound of solitary flutes crying in the wilderness. In contrast, the scherzo was almost jaunty. It was left to the finale to climb one final mountain and end in a blaze of glory.View image in fullscreenMariam Batsashvili plays Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 20, with Ryan Wigglesworth and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.Photograph: Mark AllanA similar grasp of the musical trajectory paid dividends in Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 20. Wigglesworth kept the orchestral sound down, though its sinister presence was always there, lurking beneathMariam Batsashvili’s vital account of the solo line. The Georgian pianist gave an enthralling, controlled performance, notes dropping like liquid pearls. Her choice of Beethoven’s flinty cadenzas upped the dramatic stakes. The central Romance was finessed with a supple grace before a fiery finale in which the conductor finally allowed the orchestra its head. Batsashvili’s encore, Liszt’s La Campanella, was dispatched in a blur of coruscating finger work, proving she can showboat with the best.The concert opened with For Laura, after Bach, composed by the conductor in tribute to the BBCSSO’s former leaderLaura Samuel, who died last year. Inspired by her recording of the Gigue from Bach’s third solo partita, Wigglesworth incorporated its themes into an elaborate 10-minute memorial for strings where wheeling violins soared heavenward in intricate canons and sombre cello lines hinted at heartbeats and lullabies.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Pitfalls remain – singing to backing tracks, too much waiting around and an unnecessary interval – but Yolonda, with her Scarecrow (Tori Burgess), Tin Man (Gareth Cassidy) and Cowardly Lion (Helen Longworth), keeps us rooting for her as she counters the sleepy spells of the Wicked Witch (Lisa Howard) and exchanges her red shoes for a pair of silvery wellies that, magically, enable her to walk on water.Ostensibly, Dorothy is on a quest to find her dog – and, yes, Toto makes a grand entrance – but her deeper aim, armoured with courage, brains and heart, is to learn the power of love. It is that power that turns the witch into nothing but a pointy red hat bubbling up from the lake and gives Dorothy the capacity to wake up from her reverie, at peace with her adoptive family and ready, like us, for home.AtWilliamson Park, Lancaster, until 24 August.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreChildren's theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Thereafter he largely maintained his dominance, while switching between the WWF and various other competitions over the next two decades.During a typical bout he would soak up blow after blow from his opponent until defeat seemed inevitable, only to suddenly snap into a fury that would turn the encounter around, often finishing things off with a trademark leg drop by bouncing off the rope, leaping into the air and then landing, leg first, on to his foe.View image in fullscreenHulk Hogan puts a chokehold on the neck of the Utah Jazz basketball star Karl Malone at a pay-per-view wrestling match in July 1998 in San Diego.Photograph: Lenny Ignelzi/APPerhaps his most acclaimed performance came during 1987 in the third iteration of wrestling’s annual WrestleMania event, in front of 93,000 fans at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, where he won the world heavyweight championship against the 2.24m (7ft 4in), 220kg (35st) André the Giant, who was said to have been unbeaten in the ring for almost 15 years. The bout set pay-per-view television records at the time, and confirmed Hogan’s position at the centre of WWF’s money-making machine.Hogan was born Terry Bollea, in Augusta, Georgia, the son of Ruth (nee Moody), a dance teacher, and Peter Bollea, a building site foreman. Growing up in Tampa, Florida, where he went to Robinson high school, he first worked as a dockworker while developing his showmanship as a bass guitar player in local rock bands.After a short period at the University of South Florida, he dropped his studies in 1977 to pursue wrestling. Eventually taking the Hulk moniker, after the muscle-bound comic book character The Incredible Hulk, at 2m (6ft 7in) and 137kg (21st) he was certainly built for the name, to which he added the alliterative Hogan in 1979 when he joined the WWF. He came to wider attention in 1982 after a memorable appearance in the film Rocky III as the combative wrestler Thunderlips, who beats Rocky (Sylvester Stallon) in a charity fight.Having initially been branded as a bad guy in the ring, by the mid-80s Hogan had been recast by the WWF as the opposite, and he was striding into the ring to the song Real American by Rick Derringer, fighting for national pride against sinister “foreign” rivals such as the Iron Sheik, nominally representing Iran, and Nikolai Volkoff, supposedly appearing on behalf of the Soviet Union.Soon the US was subject to a long period of “Hulkamania” as Hogan reached even wider fame, selling out stadium events, commanding massive TV audiences and appearing in further wrestling-related film roles, including in No Holds Barred (1989) and Mr Nanny (1993), while also starring as a mercenary in the television series Thunder in Paradise (1994). He lent his name to video games, a chain of restaurants and a merchandising empire that was turning over $1.7bn by 1991.View image in fullscreenHulk Hogan and Sylvester Stallone  in a scene from Rocky III (1982).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyIn 1994, around the time he confessed that he had used steroids, Hogan moved to a new franchise, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), with whom he adopted a more villainous but equally popular persona. He was WCW’s star performer for several years until returning to the WWF (by then renamed WWE) in 2002, after which he left and returned several times, wrestling for other entities in between.He was still taking part in occasional bouts into his 60s, but by then was more frequently in the public eye for other reasons, including from 2005 to 2007 in the reality TV series Hogan Knows Best, which looked in on his family life.In 2012 Hogan sued the Gawker website for posting a video of him having sex with a friend’s wife, claiming invasion of privacy. Four years later a court awarded him $140m in damages, although he eventually settled for $31m as the website’s owners filed for bankruptcy. In 2015 the release of another section of the same video showed him using racist language, for which he apologised unreservedly.In recent years he had been a vocalsupporterof Donald Trump, and last year he appeared at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, tearing off his top in typical Hulk style to reveal a Trump/Vance shirt underneath.Hogan was married three times and divorced twice. He is survived by his third wife, Sky Daily, two children, Brooke and Nick, from his first marriage, to Linda Claridge, and two grandchildren.Hulk Hogan (Terry Gene Bollea), wrestler, born 11 August 1953; died 24 July 2025Explore more on these topicsWrestlingobituariesShareReuse this content"

He taught, wrote and lectured, in the UK and abroad, as well as training many future analysts. But it was his clinical work over the course of 40 years or more that gave him the greatest satisfaction.Richard started formal training as what was sometimes called a “post-Kleinian” in the late 1980s. His training analyst wasElizabeth Spillius, who had also been an anthropologist and who was herself one of the foremost Klein scholars. (Richard was later to co-edit her papers.)Once established in private practice, he saw patients in his north London home. When his death was announced, several of his patients took to social media to say what a profound effect their time with him had had. One wrote: “He completely changed my life, my relationship with myself and with my family.” Another said: “Richard was my life witness. It’s a sad and scary world without him in his chair behind my head, occasionally saying ‘quite’.”Richard was born in Lusaka, in what was then Northern Rhodesia, where our father, GH Rusbridger, was deputy director of education and our mother, Barbara (nee Wickham), was a nurse.Our parents returned to the UK from Africa; they had no permanent home here, and another brother, Guy, who had been born with severe disabilities, needed intensive nursing care. So when Richard was only eight, he was packed off to board at a prep school in Taunton in Somerset.Once the family was settled, in Guildford, Surrey, and after Guy’s death, Richard returned to live at home. He was a chorister at Guildford Cathedral under the redoubtable Barry Rose, and sang at the building’s consecration in 1961.He progressed to become a music scholar at Cranleigh. One of Richard’s near contemporaries, James Harpur, wrote a fine volume of poems about the school they both knew, which included the stanza:“Each night I prayed / for protection / from arrest and sadism / each day believing in / my random luck.”They were lines that would have spoken to Richard.At Magdalene College, Cambridge, he struggled to choose between his two loves, music and literature. One close friend at the time recalled: “He did incredibly little work, but he was fascinated by other people and the contrast between what we pretend to be and what we are.”After a brief period of teaching he began his long immersion in the world of professionally helping others: as a social worker, as a child psychotherapist and then a child analyst and training analyst. He was, his colleagues said, a skilled clinician, with a combination of sharp clinical perception and sympathetic humanity. He was also a popular supervisor, an inspiring trainer of future analysts, and was appointed honorary reader at University College London.His interest in music and literature surfaced in a number of papers exploring artistic works through the lens of psychoanalysis, including studies of Mozart’s Don Giovanni, on narcissism in King Lear, and comparing Shakepeare’s Othello and Verdi’s Otello.In 1982, he married Gill Philpott, a psychotherapist; they had two children, Charlie and Alice. They all survive him.Explore more on these topicsPsychologyOther livesCounselling and therapyobituariesShareReuse this content"

The same applies to all the other people in our livesMoya SarnerMon 28 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTShareYou need a break. It is very important, from time to time, to take a break from your partner, from your work, from your children, from your exercise, from your screens, from alcohol and drugs and therapy and podcasts and crisps. We need time and space to rest; this is a crucial part of a better life. This much is obvious.But we need to take breaks for less obvious reasons too.As any patient of psychodynamic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis knows, come July, therapists are banging on about their August break. You tell them a dream about losing your child in the supermarket; they interpret this as you feeling like a lost child because of the break. You talk about feeling angry at a friend who cancelled plans; they suggest you are feeling angry and abandoned because of the break. It’s outrageous and ridiculous – and most of the time, in my experience, absolutely true.I know this because I have fought off many of these kinds of interpretations over the years as a patient – and I still do sometimes. And I always try to understand the unconscious impact of my break as a therapist on my patients; because I know it cuts deep. Feeling left, excluded, disappointed, unwanted – nobody wants these emotions, but if you want to build a better life, you need to feel them, so they can find a home in your mind. Otherwise, this unwanted part of you ends up feeling abandoned and excluded twice over, and the emotions get locked down and stuck instead of understood and felt. When therapy is unboundaried and without breaks, the patient is robbed of this opportunity to grow.Over time, my daughter has thrived in her sense of separateness, in learning new things without meThe break is part of the treatment. Deeper change is made possible by the therapist’s absence and the patient’s survival of it. It hurts – but at least we don’t have to pay for that part.This is true of all relationships in life: separation is a prerequisite to growth. This came alive for me when I took my daughter to nursery for the first time. The pain and anxiety of leaving her felt almost unbearable for both of us – and that “almost” is important. Actually, it was bearable, after a settling-in period in which she could begin to feel safe in the nursery in my presence, and grow the capacity to tolerate my absence for longer and longer periods. Thanks to her keyworker’s sensitivity, understanding, care and hugs (for both of us), it was difficult and painful, but not a trauma. And, over time, my daughter has thrived in her sense of separateness, in having grown through a difficult experience, and in learning new things without me. In beginning to build her own life.For both our sakes, I had to let her go and learn to take breaks. Not only because I needed to rest. I also had to understand something about myself, which I think lies at the heart of a struggle that many of us experience. We don’t want to believe the fact that we are not indispensable, that our loved ones can survive without us, that they can manage. The conviction of the necessity of our constant availability is so compelling, we don’t believe life can go on when we aren’t there. And that makes sense; that’s how it often is at the beginning. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott said: “There is no such thing as a baby” – meaning, the baby simply cannot exist in the absence of maternal care (not only, but usually, provided by the mother).But as time goes on, and as babies grow up, separation has to become possible, and a child has to come to exist in the absence of the mother. And the same is true of friendships and romantic relationships. Nothing kills a friendship or sex life like long-term and unflinching dependence on one another with no time apart.For some, there are practicalities that make a break impossible. Parents and carers with children with disabilities who need additional care, for example, can struggle to secure the right kind of support that might make it possible for them to take a break of any kind. But the absolute necessity of these breaks is recognised in law (by the Children Act 1989 and the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2011). So while I do understand that of course there may be external reasons why someone may not be able to take a break, that may make it even more important to find a way to do so.External reasons are probably not the only thing stopping us. The belief in the necessity of our constant presence protects us, unconsciously, from our awareness of our own limitations, of our vulnerabilities and needs. It protects us from the experience I had recently, of putting my daughter to bed earlier than usual and thinking, “What am I going to do with myself now?” and not knowing the answer. It can protect us from an empty feeling of not knowing ourselves, that we’ve been unconsciously filling up with all sorts of obligations and duties, which take us further away from what we truly need.So sometimes, in the interests of building a better life for you and your loved ones, taking a break really is the most important work you can do.That’s my story, and I’m sticking with it.

Now, on one cup a day, I feel so much betterI kicked my habit on a retreat. Now I savour my daily coffee dose, which clears my thoughts and gives me a sense of wellbeingArifa AkbarMon 28 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShare‘Alittle bit of what you fancy” is a call for moderation that has never worked for me. Not for my coffee habit, at least, which slides from the steely resolve to drink just two cups a day, to a wobbly-willed four, five mugs, or more. I’m better at giving it up altogether. Total detox brings the high of self-control and the illusion that I have overcome the caffeine addiction, at least until I fall off the wagon again.But some vices shouldn’t be given up, because they bring pleasure – and coffee is one of those for me. I love its mood-transforming uplift. It revs me up and calms me down. I once gave it up for two months – my longest abstention – hoping to shake off a virulent bout of insomnia, and it seemed as if I had entered the wilderness. Life felt more austere and my sleeplessness wasn’t solved, either. It was lose-lose.So, three months ago, I decided, emphatically, not to kick the habit (and fail again) but to enjoy a single daily dose. This was initially born out of necessity: I went to a retreat where we were limited to a single cup of freshly ground coffee a day, at a time of our choosing, and I took great pains over deciding when I’d have mine, and where. Then I savoured it, desperate to make its effects last.Strangely, when I got back home, I stuck to that single cup.It has turned from an unthinking habit into a treat. You could call it mindful coffee drinkingIt is a change that feels simultaneously small and immense. I haven’t slid back into excess, even in times of stress. I don’t glug it down while scrolling or sitting at my laptop. I sit down and enjoy it, that’s all. It has turned from an unthinking habit into a treat. You could call it mindful coffee drinking, I suppose. Several times a week, I go down to a dinky little cafe called Lilac on my north London high street, where they also sell coffee by the kilo, which they grind freshly. I have found that the nicer the coffee, the less I need of it.A moment that changed me: I stopped drinking – and realised what friendship really meantRead moreIf Idofeel a desire for more, I ask myself why. Am I anxious or tired? In which case, wouldn’t it be better to rest? Or am I thirsty? Is this a physiological craving or a psychological one? Because water perks up the organs and wakes up the mind, too. I have found myself gravitating towards the exotic loose-leaf herbal tea and realised that my apparent craving for a coffee is simply the need for a warm drink and a break from work. A habit is sometimes a displacement activity; once I had become conscious of the underlying reasons for mine, I could address them.Importantly, I feelbetterfor the coffee drinking. It clears my thoughts, and brings a sense of wellbeing. It is a reminder that it is excess that is detrimental, not coffee per se, which has circulatory benefits and is full of antioxidants. It’s amazing how my body has adjusted, too. On the rare occasion that I have had two coffees in one day, I feel uncomfortably wired. The rule of a single cup works, as long as it is actively savoured. A pleasure, not a vice at all.Wolf Moon: A Woman’s Journey Into the Night by Arifa Akbar, is published by Sceptre (£16.99).

Just reduce your overall salt intake – and beware how much is hiding in bread and saucesKate LloydMon 28 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTShareFlaky sea salt, pink rock salt, fleur de sel … Thanks to a generation of TV chefs sprinkling gourmet seasonings on dishes with flair, it feels instinctive that these natural, premium versions of sodium chloride are somehow healthier than humble table salt.And many of them market themselves that way – claiming that lower levels of processing and higher levels of minerals like potassium and magnesium make them the superior choice.But Sonia Pombo, a registered nutritionist and head of research and impact at Action on Salt, disagrees. “The evidence linking a high intake of salt to raised blood pressure is very well documented,” she says. (Overconsumption is also linked to an increased risk of stomach cancer, osteoporosis and kidney problems.) “Some of these companies may try to convince the public they’re better,” she says. “But if you look at the tiny amounts of magnesium or potassium in these salts, it’s laughable. If you want micronutrients, eat a piece of fruit.”In the UK, adults are advised to consume no more than six grams of salt a dayThe benefits of electrolytes, too, are often overstated, she says. Saline drinks can be helpful if you’re recovering from a stomach bug or training like an elite athlete on a restricted salt diet. But for most of us? “They’re not really necessary – we’re already eating too much salt.”In the UK, adults are advised to consume no more than six grams of salt a day. The most recent figures show we eat40% more than that– but even six grams isn’t a target to aim for, Pombo says. “We can survive and thrive on as little as one gram per day.”If you’re worried about how much salt you use, the only “better” kind is low-sodium salt. The real answer is to gradually reduce consumption – slowly, so you don’t notice the difference. Cook at home more often and beware of hidden salt in products like bread and sauces.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingIs it true that …Food scienceDiets and dietingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the words “halloumi fritters” have your friends and family zooming towards a tray as quickly as mine, you might even want to double up on the quantities below. Unsurprisingly, these are also my children’s preferred way to eat courgettes.Prep20 minCook20 minMakes25+200g courgettes, trimmed and coarsely gratedSalt200g halloumi, coarsely grated200g drained chickpeas(jarred, ideally), mashed with a fork40g plain flour1egg4-5tbsp olive oil50g mayonnaise50g greek yoghurtJuice of ½ lemon10g chopped dillPut the grated courgette in a sieve with a pinch of salt, mix, then leave to sit for 10 minutes while you prep the other ingredients. Tip the courgette into a tea towel or kitchen roll, then squeeze it out to expel all the excess water.In a large bowl, mix the courgette with the halloumi and mashed chickpeas until well incorporated, then stir in the flour and egg to make a thick batter.Put a tablespoon of the oil in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, then, working in batches, scoop scant tablespoons of the fritter mixture into the hot oil, using a second tablespoon to nudge and shape them into neat rounds. Fry the fritters on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through, then transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain. Repeat until you’ve used up all the batter (with my largest frying pan, this usually takes four batches).While the fritters are frying, mix the mayonnaise, yoghurt, lemon juice and dill in a small bowl and set aside. If you’re not eating the fritters straight away, leave to cool, then cover and refrigerate, along with the dip, until needed. Warm through in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for five minutes, then arrange on a platter and serve with the dip in a nice bowl in the middle.Explore more on these topicsSnacksQuick and easyFoodVegetablesCheeseGreek food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Surprisingly for us, visiting from England, that meant he got a driver, a gun, a nice pad to live in and a team of sensational cooks to dish up various delicacies from wherever he was stationed. In the south, his favourite was black pork curry, and at my restaurantRambutanwe now make a marinade from similar spices for pineapple, beef and, my preference, chicken, before we grill it over coals. To lift it a little, the bird is finished with a quick fragrant oil of tempered spices and parsley (similar to the peppery island herb we callvallarai). You can eat it with or without the cool, green coconut rice and tomato sambol, which is my attempt to recreate a very tasty lunch I had at one of my favourite Colombo spots, Taste of Asia.Green coconut rice with tomato and red onion sambolFragrant with spices, cooked in coconut milk and with a grassy, fresh taste from the greens, this rice is very quick and easy, and perfect with the citrussy, tomato sambol that you find all over the island.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4For the rice50g spinach, washed15g fresh coriander, washed2½cm piece fresh root ginger, peeled2 garlic cloves, peeled250g white rice25g salted butter3green cardamom pods, gently crushed5black peppercorns150ml coconut milk2 tsp saltFor the sambol1 large ripe tomato, cut into 10-12 wedges½ large red onion, peeled and finely sliced1-2 green finger chillies, finely sliced, or to taste2 limes1 tsp salt, to taste1 tbsp coconut oil, or neutral oilPut the spinach, coriander, ginger and garlic in a small blender or food processor, and blitz to a smooth paste – you want all the fibres to break down, so you may need to add a splash of water to help things along.Put the rice in a fine-meshed strainer and rinse under cold running water for about a minute, until the water runs mostly clear (this helps remove any surface starch, so the grains will be fluffy and separate when cooked). Leave the rice to drain.Melt the butter in a medium-sized pan on a medium heat, then add the cardamom and black peppercorns and cook on a low heat for a minute or two – the spices should turn fragrant and start to sizzle slightly, but the butter should not be browned.Stir the washed rice and blended greens into the butter, then pour in the coconut milk, salt and 300ml water, and bring to a boil. Turn down to a low simmer, cover and cook for 17-20 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and has absorbed all the liquid; stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and leave covered to keep warm while you make the sambol.In a bowl, combine the tomato, red onion and green chilli. Season with lime juice, salt and oil, then taste and add more salt if need be. Mix well, making sure to break up the onion slices.To assemble the dish, spread the rice over a large platter. Spoon some sambol over some of the rice, put the rest in a bowl to the side and serve.Black chicken with tempered parsleyView image in fullscreenPrep15 minMarinade2 hr+Cook1 hr 15 minServes4For the black spice mix1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp fennel seeds2 tsp black peppercorns1 stick cinnamon1 tsp cardamom seeds1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp cloves seeds2 tsp chilli powderFor the chicken1 large whole chicken(about 1½-2kg)4 tbsp black spice mix(see above and method)1 head garlic, cloves separated and peeled1 handfulcurry leaves, fresh, ideally120ml cider vinegar1 tbsp salt3 large red onions, peeled and cut into wedges3 sticks lemongrassFor the temper100ml coconut oil, or neutral cooking oil½ tbsp mustard seeds½tsp cumin seeds¼tsp fennel seeds4-5 fresh curry leaves½ bunch parsley, finely chopped1shallot, peeled and finely diced2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely diced2tsp cider vinegarSalt, to tasteRoast all the whole spices for the spice mix (ie, everything bar the chilli powder) in a dry frying pan on a low to medium heat, stirring often, for five minutes, until they smell fragrant. Take off the heat, leave to cool, then tip into a spice grinder or mortar and blitz or grind to a fine powder. Put the powder back in the dry pan and toast on a high heat, stirring constantly, for a minute or two, until it turns dark brown and almost black in colour; this will turn them nutty and almost smoky. Take off the heat, leave to cool completely, then stir in the chilli powder. Store in a clean sealed jar and use within two months.Turn the chicken breast side down, use kitchen scissors to cut all the way along each side of the backbone, then lift it out and discard (or save for stock). Flip the bird over so it’s now breast side up, then press down with the palm of your hand to flatten and spatchcock it.For the marinade, mix four tablespoons of the black spice mix in a roasting tray with the peeled garlic, curry leaves, vinegar, salt and red onions. Rub this mixture all over the bird, making sure you get it into all the crevices and under the skin, then cover and put in the fridge to marinade for two hours or overnight.Take the chicken out of the fridge at least half an hour before you want to cook it. Lightly bash the lemongrass stalks, so they smell fragrant.To barbecue the bird, lay it skin side down over medium-heat coals, put the lemongrasson top, then cover with foil. After 20 minutes, uncover and grill for 20 minutes more, until the skin crisps up and the chicken is cooked through yet juicy – if you have a probe, it should have an internal temperature of 70C. Alternatively, cover and roast in an 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for about 40 minutes, again topped with the lemongrass, until the juices run clear.Put the chicken to one side to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the quick tempered oil. Put the oil in a small pan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the mustard seeds and cook for 20 seconds,until they start to pop a little (be careful not to burn them, though). Turn down the heat, add the cumin and fennel seeds, and cook for 30 or so seconds, until fragrant. Tip into a bowl, stir in the curry leaves and leave to coolto warm. Stir the parsley, shallot, garlic and vinegar into the cooled temper, then season to taste.Carve the chicken, arrange on a platter, dress with the parsley temper and serve.Cynthia Shanmugalingam is chef/owner ofRambutan, London SE1Explore more on these topicsSri Lankan food and drinkMain courseFoodChickenRiceSide dishesMeatrecipesShareReuse this content"

The Earth Photo exhibition, which focuses on the environment and the climate crisis,runs to the beginning of September.In order to cool down, lidos and community swimming areas can give some reliefParking fees vary between parks. For example, Moors Valley charges £16.50 a day, while Wendover Woods charges £13.The Beamish Museum near Stanley in Durham tells the history of the region from the 1820s to the 1950s through immersive exhibits, and was recently voted the Art Fund museum of the year. It has family tickets (two adults and two kids) for £82, with access for a full year. If you travel to the museum on any Go North East bus, you can get a 25% discount on a standard individual admission.In order to cool down, lidos and community swimming areas can give some relief. TheClevedon Marine Lakeon the Somerset coast is a tidal pool and gets filled with seawater from the Bristol channel every spring tide. Run by a charity, swimmers are asked to donate when they visit.Do the mathsIf an attraction charges an entry fee, look out for family tickets and do the sums to get the best value. For example,the Sea City Museum in Southamptoncharges £42.50 for a family ticket for two adults and three children – it’s cheaper than buying individual tickets for two adults and two children. It works out cheaper to buy individually if you are two adults visiting with one child. For one adult and three children there’s another family ticket option costing £28.50.Prices for Legoland in Windsor start at £34 each – children under 90cm go free – if bought on the website in advance, compared with £68 if you walk up and pay. Chessington World of Adventures starts at £32 online or £66 in-person on the day.ATwice the funticket gives entry to two attractions for the price of one at Legoland, Chessington World of Adventures, Thorpe Park or Alton Towers. Prices start at £32 if youvisit Chessington first.View image in fullscreenA ride at Thorpe Park.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianCadbury isrunning a promotionwhere you can get between 10% and 50% off entry for up to four tickets at Merlin UK attractions, which include Legoland, Sea Life and Thorpe Park, among others.Many attractions offer annual family tickets but again you will have to do the maths to work out whether the deal works for you. For instance, going to London zoo on an off-peak weekday for two adults and two children will cost £94.20. A silver membership (which gives unlimited visits) runs at £200. It offers entrance to Whipsnade, and with a peak-time visit there you will have paid for the membership.Explore more on these topicsMoneyMoney hacksRail faresConsumer affairsBus faresMuseumsTheatreFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then again, the name, suggestive of a 1970s-style fat farm, is misleading. Based in a rustic farmhouse in the hills north-east of Nikšić, the country’s second largest city, theYoga getawayI’m here to sample may focus on wellness and plant-based food – the antithesis of traditional Montenegrin fare – but its friendly dogs and cats would de-stress many a frazzled urbanite.“We especially want to take care of solo travellers, tailor stays to their needs, and help them reconnect with themselves and nature,” says co-owner Andjela Djokic, as amiable Sivi, part hunting dog, part sheepdog, trots out for a sniff.View image in fullscreenThe retreat is my first stop on a whirlwind trip exploring Central Montenegro. Unlike the overcrowded Adriatic coast (in 2024,94%of overnight stays in the Balkans country were in coastal areas), the interior of Montenegro is virgin territory for nature lovers. Historically a battleground – the Romans and Ottomans lorded over the region – for me it’s love at first sight, a landscape brimming with pristine karst mountains, forests, lakes and rivers.Getting here involved an 80-minute drive from Podgorica, the capital, on a panoramic road, one that on a clear day (alas, it’s gloomy when I arrive) takes you within view ofOstrog Monastery, cut high into a rock face in the Dinaric Alps. (These, I learn, stretch the length of the Balkans.) Still, as the wispy clouds trail across the peaks and ridges, I feel I’m entering a delicious hinterland.At the farm, which Andjela runs with her husband, Matija, I settle into my en suite apartment, one of two available to guests. Once a stone barn, it has a balcony from which to soak up the rippling birdsong and mountain scenery. Over in the shared community space, a homely kitchen-cum-lounge area, I tuck into scrambled eggs and thick Montenegrin coffee. “Every day is a mission to find the eggs,” chuckles my host.View image in fullscreenJini Reddy hiking up to Durkovo Brdo viewpoint.Photograph: Dušan StuparLater, I’ll visit the chicken coop and permaculture garden, and hear about plans to transition to solar power, but right now I’m itching to unfurl my limbs.It’s too wet for yoga, offered on a wooden platform in a meadow on the farm’s 19 acres of land. Instead, sockless, I tread gingerly on the adjacent barefoot walk, an array of beach pebbles, pine cones, moss and sharp stones. The sensory stimulus (nature’s reflexology) awakens me from my post-travel stupor. There’s just time for a snack and a glorious toast withrakija, the local spirit, before Tamara Miljanic, the serene yoga and meditation teacher, offers a pranayama (yogic breathwork) session. As the flute-like call of a cuckoo haunts the skies, I feel the tension seep out of my body. After a salad supper, made by a holistic nutritionist who joins us for the meal, I sleep like a log.A winding road leads us through the beautiful terrain, carpeted with meadows, and dotted with peaks and hobbity holiday homesThe next morning the sun is out and I try the property’s heart trail – another cue to be mindful. Wandering along the kilometre-long wooded path, I step over soft, moss-covered stones and flit from wildflower to wildflower like a butterfly. I spot carmine-hued thistle, elegant mauve lupins, ox-eye daisies and dog roses. The dogs, who have come along, plonk themselves next to me like forest sentinels when I sit quietly for a bit.It’s hard to leave, but Vučje calls. Amountain lodge and tourist centrewithin the wider Nikšić region, 18 miles to the east, Vučje is a ski resort in winter and the perfect spot for hiking, horse-riding and cycling in the warmer months. Nestled in a valley, it lies south of the vaunted alpine jewel that isDurmitornational park.View image in fullscreenFitCamp Montenegro is based in a rustic farmhouse in the hills.Photograph: Jini ReddyA slow-food culture is embraced here. After a stroll in the woods, in the company of the Vučje dogs (owner Andjahas a soft spot for strays) it’s time for a feast. “We cure our own meat,” she says, waving towards the meat-drying room. I do my best with a pork steak steeped in cream and mushrooms,kačamak(a rich, tasty concoction made of wheat and cornflour, potatoes, cheese and cream) and local wine – and silently apologise to my arteries. (Vučje caters to vegetarians too.)The room I’m staying in is a little worn but comfortable. In the morning, afterpriganice(moreish fritters with rosehip jam), more cured meat andpljevaljski(a local cheese), I hike to Durkovo Brdo, a popular viewpoint and, at 1,546 metres, an easy-to-climb peak. Two charming guides, Enisa Djokovic and Dušan Stupar, lead the way. Enisa points out the wild garlic, beloved of the local ursine population, as we emerge from the forest canopy to open pastures ringed by mountains.“We call them ‘bear onions’,” she says. “But don’t worry, we carry pepper spray.”I board a small boat for a ride on the lake, through narrow channels teeming with birdlife. ‘This is our Amazon,’ says the captainLater, the pair drive me eastward to Lukavica, a mountain plateau. A winding road leads us through the beautiful terrain, carpeted with meadows, and dotted with peaks andkatuns, hobbity holiday homes (some still used by sheep herders).Astonishingly, ours is the only vehicle. When I step outside, the silence feels potent. A deer bobs away in the distance, and a lone church, St Ilija, stands framed by the mountains. “There is a 2,000-year-old gravestone here,” says Dušan, before pointing to the looming peak, Mali Žurim (1,962 metres). It looks impossibly steep. “Next time you come we can hike it. It’s easier than it looks,” he says.View image in fullscreenJini on a bike ride to Lake SkadarAfter a coffee stop at Lake Kapetanovo Jezero, where I spot wild horses, we drive back and the heavens open. Enisa tells me she is Muslim, “from a small village near Podgorica”, and that she celebrates Ramadan and Eid. Dušan, who is also her partner, is Bosnian and Orthodox Christian. “During the war, my family fled across the mountains,” he says, quietly. “I was a child and my mother was pregnant at the time.” I wonder if, for him, the mountains represent refuge, a place of sanctuary.Wild east: five Balkn discover for your next holidayRead moreFor my last day, I head south toJablan Winery, in the village of Rvaši, south of Podgorica. Wine tastings are popular here, and you can rent an apartment amid the vines. I’ve spied the e-bikes and I’m off, down euphoria-inducing hairpin bends to Lake Skadar, the largest in southern Europe and anational park. Framed by forest-green slopes, the views of the serpentine Rijeka Crnojevića river and canyon, within the lake system, are ethereal, like a fairytale.At a small resort named after the river, I park the bike and board a smallboatfor a ride on the lake, through narrow channels teeming with birdlife. “This is our Amazon,” says Captain Dusko, at the helm, before telling us the giantDalmatian pelicanis Skadar’s symbol. As we drift past a carpet of water lilies, I spy a jet-black pygmy cormorant diving for fish, and grey herons in flight. Back on shore, the captain whips up a meal of smoked carp, carp paté, fish soup and grilled trout at hislakeside restaurant. Then it’s back on the bike to the vineyard, where a glass of natural wine lulls me into a contented sleep, nursing a yen to return to this enchanted land.The trip was provided by FitCamp Montenegro; its five-nightyogagetawayis available May-November for €900, including breakfast, activities and a day trip.

And she isn’t convinced anything has been done to prevent future tragediesAnna MooreMon 28 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 05.59 EDTShareThe last time Katie Amess saw her dad, the Conservative MPSir David Amess, he was dropping her at Heathrow for her flight home to Los Angeles. Usually, she would cry when they said goodbye, but this time neither were sad – they were both excited. In six weeks, Katie would be back for her wedding.“It was going to be in the House of Commons and my dad could not wait to walk me down the aisle,” she says. “He’d been practising, taking my arm, walking me around. We joked about it – we were calling it the ‘royal wedding’. At the airport, we hugged goodbye and he kissed me on both cheeks. I skipped off thinking the next time I saw him would be the best day of my life.”Instead, just four weeks later, her father was murdered at his surgery, stabbed 21 times by an Islamic State sympathiser. He was buried in the suit he was going to wear to the wedding. The music planned for walking Katie down the aisle – Pachelbel’s Canon – was instead played as his coffin was carried into the church.The murder of David Amess in October 2021, while serving his constituency in a church hall in Leigh-on-Sea, sent shock waves across the country – and the details that have since emerged should have deepened the outrage and furthered the questions.Amess’s killer,Ali Harbi Ali, was a once bright, motivated teenager planning to study medicine who had self-radicalised during Syria’s civil war. The teachers at his Croydon school had noticed – one described it as a light going out and that his “eyes were dead”. Ali’s attendance fell, his grades plummeted and attempts to talk to him only raised more concerns, leading the school to contact Prevent, the government-led counter-terrorism strategy designed to identify and deradicalise extremists. One home visit was made, followed by one brief meeting between Ali and an “intervention provider” in a McDonald’s. Conversation was limited to two subjects: whether western music and student loans were unlawful in Islam. Ali was deemed a “pleasant and informed young man”. (He later said: “I just knew to nod my head and say yes and they would leave me alone afterwards and they did.”) There was no follow-up, no further consultations or contact with his referring teachers. There was no monitoring.View image in fullscreenDavid and Julia Amess with their children Katie, David and Alexandra.Photograph: Bill Cross/ANL/ShutterstockDespite the atrocity Ali went on to commit, Katie believes there has been little scrutiny of any of the above, no accountability or consequences for the anonymous officials involved and no requirement to give a public account of their actions and lessons learned. For almost four years, Katie, on behalf of the Amess family, has pushed for an inquiry. Partly as a result of this pressure, the Home Office commissioned Lord Anderson, the interim Prevent commissioner, to produce arapid review of the casein order to identify whether questions remain unanswered. It was published last week and concluded: “Though the information available on [Ali’s] case is not complete and likely never will be,” the “unhappy story” of his engagement with Prevent had been “squeezed almost dry”. Katie doesn’t agree. “I’m not going to give up,” she says. “All we want is for someone to say: ‘We’re sorry. This is what happened, these are the mistakes made and this is what we’re doing to make sure it never happens again.’ I shouldn’t have to fight for answers.”Born in Plaistow to an electrician father and a dressmaker mother, David Amess was a working-class, Catholic Conservative and had been anEssexMP for 38 years when he was murdered. He was approaching his 70th birthday – on that last airport trip with Katie, she had broached the subject of retirement. “He didn’t want to retire any time soon,” she says. “He felt he had so much left to do.”Home secretary rejects call for inquiry by family of murdered MP David AmessRead moreHaving an MP father was all Katie had ever known, but Amess was not an absent figure, away at Westminster. He was committed to his constituency with no ambitions for higher office. “When I was young, I used to ask: ‘Do you think you could be prime minister?’ He’d say: ‘Absolutely not!’” For Katie, the second of five children, all born within seven years, he was present and fun and always loomed large in her life. “My dad was absolutely hilarious and completely inappropriate,” she says. “He’d do the craziest things and sometimes they were a bit dangerous.” He would booby trap the house at Halloween. He would take all five children to water parks even though he couldn’t swim and would have been unable to rescue any of them. At toll booths, on family road trips, all five children were instructed to blow raspberries while he paid the operator. “He was obsessed with animals, so we had dogs, cats, chickens, bunny rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, a goat called Tinkerbell,” says Katie. “He wanted a small pony at one point, but Mum vetoed that. He had fish and birds in his office even though no animals were allowed, but he didn’t listen to rules. At Halloween, he’d go to Westminster in full goblin outfit. At Christmas, he’d put a tree on his balcony at Westminster, which was definitely not allowed, and his whole office was lit up with flashing lights.”From the age of four, Katie accompanied him to constituency events. “My elder brother was out playing football and my mum had my three younger sisters to look after, so I was all dressed up and dragged to garden parties and village fetes.” Later, when she moved to London for drama school – she is now an actor – she stayed in her dad’s London flat. “I’m so glad I spent all that time with him so I could just be around him and soak up what he was about,” she says. “I never knew I wouldn’t be with him for another 30 years.”Amess was very well known in his Southend West and Leigh constituency. “He spent so much time there,” says Katie. “Everybody knew his name and face. I’ve received so many messages since he died saying: ‘We didn’t agree with him politically, but he helped my elderly parents’; ‘He got support for my disabled child’; ‘He visited my sick grandma in hospital.’” In some ways, his profile and accessibility made him vulnerable. He was the face of government and easy to locate. In fact, it later emerged that Ali had worked through a list of possible victims, including Michael Gove and Keir Starmer, both of who were deemed too complicated to find. Amess – targeted because he had voted in favour of airstrikes against Islamic State – was holding a surgery. (The pinned tweet on Amess’s account gave the date, place and details of how to book.) “I always worried about Dad’s safety, but I thought if anything was going to happen, it would be a punch-up from a local yob,” says Katie. “Never in your wildest dreams would you imagine that a terrorist would go through a list and then come and murder your dad. It’s just so shocking. It’s still unbelievable.”View image in fullscreenA photograph of Katie and her father with Pope John Paul II hangs on the wall in her office.Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianIn the immediate aftermath, the family were too stunned to think about inquiries or even formulate questions. Katie remembers flying straight back to the UK, walking into the family home and seeing the runner beans Amess had picked from the garden before going to surgery. “I washed up his breakfast plates – tea and toast – from the morning it happened as well as his dinner plates from the night before and could not believe it was the last time I’d ever be doing this,” she says. “All those times I was annoyed that he’d left his plates for me to clean when I was in his London flat for drama school. Now, I just wanted to be able to clean them one more time.”When details about Ali’s history with Prevent began surfacing, the family assumed an inquiry would be announced after his trial. (In April 2022, Ali was given a whole-life sentence.) Two home secretaries – Priti Patel and Suella Braverman – assured the family that they were working on it, but their successor James Cleverly refused to meet them.Instead, there has been only aPrevent learning review, completed in February 2022. This gives a glimpse of Prevent’s failures in the case – the strange decision‑making (why focus on student loans and western music only?), the lack of record-keeping, the absence of communication, returned emails or follow-up. “I was absolutely gobsmacked when I read it,” says Katie. “I could run Prevent better with my friends. If these are the people entrusted to save us from terrorism, we’ve got a huge problem.”Equally striking is the sparsity of the review. No one involved is identified or even interviewed. It’s a review of secondhand accounts and the records kept (and not kept). “The main conclusion it seems to draw is that so much has changed with Prevent, it’s all been fixed, so we don’t need to look any harder,” says Katie. “If that was true, why were three little girls murdered in Southport last year?” Axel Rudakubana, the Southport killer, was referred to and rejected by Prevent three times. One of the questions to be asked in the Southport inquiry is whether Prevent needs a complete overhaul. “They could have asked that question years earlier after my dad was killed and perhaps Southport wouldn’t have happened,” says Katie.View image in fullscreenKatie Amess stands behind her mother, Julia, as they visit the church in Leigh-on-Sea where he was murdered.Photograph: Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesCampaigning hasn’t been easy. Katie is based in the US and her mother, Julia, is not well – she had a stroke shortly after Ali’s trial, which the family attributes to trauma and grief. The change of government briefly gave them hope. Katie and Julia had a video meeting with Yvette Cooper, the new home secretary, who told them that Amess was a great friend, their Westminster offices were next door and they used to walk to the Commons chamber together. “We thought: ‘Perfect. Now we’re getting somewhere,’” says Katie. Instead, months passed. Finally, in March, in another video call, Cooper admitted therewouldn’t be an inquiry. “My mum said: ‘Look me in the eyes and tell me as his friend that you think you’re doing the right thing.’ Yvette Cooper could not answer.” In a formal letter, Cooper explained that it was “hard to see” how an inquiry could go beyond what had already been established in the trial, the Prevent learning review and the coroner’s report, as well as the forthcoming rapid review by Lord Anderson.“When an elected official is killed in a church hall in broad daylight by somebody the government is monitoring, there should be an inquiry – it shouldn’t even be a question,” says Amess. “This isn’t a witch-hunt, but there should be some accountability. The mistakes made cost me my father, my mother’s husband, a grandfather, a brother, a son.“I don’t think we’ll ever recover,” she continues. “It’s my 40th birthday this month and I know I’d have flown back to England like I did every summer and my dad would have thrown me a huge party. There’d have been 40 balloons and he’d have made my friends give me 40 bumps! I want to have children, but I think: ‘What sort of mother would I be now when I’m in so much trauma and heartache?’ I used to think he’d be such a funny grandpa. All that has been robbed from me.”For Katie, the lack of support from Westminster after her father’s decades of service is deeply painful and nonsensical, too. “I just cannot believe the way we’ve been treated by his friends and colleagues,” she says. “It’s in all their interests. They are meeting the public day in, day out, so why don’t they want to investigate properly and establish what would make them safer? Dad’s legacy needs to be that through what happened to him, he saves other people. Please, just show some human decency. Do the right thing.”This article was amended on 28 July 2025 to give Plaistow, rather than Basildon, as David Amess’s birthplace.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Check. Wall-to-wall Adidas? Present and correct. Enough lager consumption to fill the Thames? Naturally. Perhaps less anticipated was the prevalence of families at these shows: multigenerational groups spanning from excited kids seeing their first big gigs to aunts, uncles and grandparents who could remember seeing the band back in the 90s.On the first night in Cardiff, one woman told us aboutattending a show in the city 31 years agowhile she was pregnant with her son, now bringing along his own young daughter; another boy was celebrating his 10th birthday there with his dad, who saw the band with his own father when he was a teenager. There have been similar scenes atPulp’s big shows: when they performed to a hometown crowd at Sheffield’s Tramlines last week, there was a noteworthy amount of kids word-perfect on their hits (including, entertainingly, Sorted for E’s and Wizz).So, we’d like to know: have you been on any mass family outings to see live music recently?

Ina report last year, the UN secretary-general noted that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had not been granted access to the territory since 2015, adding that OHCHR “continued to receive allegations relating to human rights violations, including intimidation, surveillance and discrimination against Sahrawi individuals particularly when advocating for self-determination”.Inits most recent country report, Amnesty International said that the “authorities continued to restrict dissent and the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly in Western Sahara”. Reporters Without Borders has described Western Sahara as a“desert for journalists”and said that “torture, arrests, physical abuse, persecution, intimidation, harassment, slander, defamation, technological sabotage, and lengthy prison sentences are daily fare for Sahrawi journalists”.Last month the UKsuggestedit supported a proposal for Western Sahara to remain under Rabat’s sovereignty but with a degree of self-rule.FiSahara’s organiserssay the recent presence of Nolan’s high-profile cast and crew in Dakhla will help whitewash the Moroccan occupation and normalise the repression.View image in fullscreenAn archway at the entrance to Dakhla carries an image of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APThe festival’s directors said that while Dakhla was “a beautiful location with cinematic sand dunes”, it was, “first and foremost … an occupied and militarised city whose indigenous Sahrawi population is subjected to brutal repression” by Moroccan occupation forces.“By filming part of The Odyssey in an occupied territory … Nolan and his team, perhaps unknowingly and unwittingly, are contributing to Morocco’s repression of the Sahrawi people and to the Moroccan regime’s efforts to normalise its occupation ofWestern Sahara,” said María Carrión, the festival’s executive director.“We are sure that if they understood the full implications of filming a high-profile film in a territory whose Indigenous peoples cannot make their own films about their stories under occupation, Nolan and his team would be horrified.”FiSahara said it was calling on Nolan and his crew and cast to “stand in solidarity with the Sahrawi people who have been under military occupation for 50 years and who are routinely imprisoned and tortured for their peaceful struggle for self-determination”.View image in fullscreenChristopher Nolan winning the best director Oscar for Oppenheimer in 2024.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersCarrión saidMoroccowas keen to control how its occupation was perceived abroad, and used tourism and culture to project a distorted view of life in Western Sahara.“Morocco only allows entry into occupied Western Sahara to those who fit its strategy of selling its occupation to the outside world,” she said. “Tourists who go to Moroccan-built and -owned resorts to practise kitesurfing, companies willing to participate in its plundering of natural resources, journalists willing to toe its line, and high-profile visitors like Nolan and his team who help Morocco sell the narrative that Western Sahara is part of Morocco and that the Sahrawis are content to live under its rule are given the red carpet treatment.”But she said Amnesty International, the UN commissioner for human rights, and “the hundreds of journalists and observers who have been barred or deported from the territory” would tell “a very different story”.The Guardian has contacted Nolan’s representatives for a response, but the director has yet to comment.FiSahara, which was founded in 2004, is held in Sahrawi refugee camps in the Algerian desert. Labelled“the Cannes of the desert”, it aims to use film to “entertain, convey knowledge and empower refugees from the Western Sahara”.Explore more on these topicsWestern SaharaChristopher NolanMoroccoAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaThe OdysseynewsShareReuse this content"

He faces a 12-year prison sentence in a case that has become highly politicised.The case dates back to 2012, when Uribe accused the leftwing senator Iván Cepeda before the supreme court of hatching a plot to falsely link him to rightwing paramilitary groups involved in Colombia’s long-standing conflict.The court decided against prosecuting Cepeda and pursued his claims against Uribe. As the judge started reading her verdict, Uribe – who attended the trial virtually – sat shaking his head. He is Colombia’s first-ever former head of state to be convicted of a crime.Paramilitary groups in Colombia emerged in the 1980s to fight Marxist guerrillas that had taken up arms against the state two decades earlier with the stated goal of combating poverty and political marginalisation, especially in rural areas.Many armed groups adopted cocaine trafficking as their main source of income, the genesis of a deadly rivalry for resources and smuggling routes that continues to this day.Uribe was a politician on the right of the political spectrum – like all Colombian presidents before the current leader, Gustavo Petro, who unseated Uribe’s Democratic Centre party in 2022 elections.During his tenure, Uribe led a relentless military campaign against drug cartels and the Farc guerrilla army, which signed a peace deal with his successor, Juan Manuel Santos, in 2016.After Cepeda accused him of having had ties to paramilitary groups responsible for human rights violations, Uribe is alleged to have contacted jailed ex-fighters to lie for him. He claims he only wanted to convince them to tell the truth.More than 90 witnesses testified in the trial, which began in May 2024. Prosecutors produced evidence during the trial of at least one paramilitary ex-fighter who said he was contacted by Uribe to change his story.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Details continue to emerge regarding the treatment of Venezuelans by Salvadorian prison officials.On 18 July, the US,El SalvadorandVenezuelaengaged in a prisoner swap that released 252 Venezuelan men from the notorious Central American megaprison.According to press reports, Venezuelan immigrants who were sent by the US to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, known as Cecot for its Spanish acronym, have said they were subjected to horrific abuse, including beatings, torture, denial of food and, in one case, sexual assault. Lawyers for some of the mensaid they endured“state-sanctioned torture”, the Guardian reported.Men freed from El Salvador mega-prison endured ‘state-sanctioned torture’, lawyers sayRead more“I am concerned that, in paying the Salvadoran government to detain immigrants at Cecot, the administration funded human rights violations with taxpayer dollars,” Ramirez’s letter says. “I urgently request that we hold a hearing on how US funds were used to enable these flagrant human rights abuses at Cecot.”Garbarino did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment about Ramirez’s letter.The second Trump administration has designated a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, a foreign terrorist organization. In March, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act and claimed that the Venezuelan government had sent members of Tren de Aragua to “invade” the US.Intelligence agenciesreportedly contradictedthe administration’s claims linking the gang to the Venezuelan government. But in mid-March, immigration officers quietly filled planes with Venezuelan and Salvadorian immigrants who were detained by the US and quickly sent them to El Salvador to be detained in the Cecot prison.A federal judge ordered the planes to return after they took off. Despite the court order, the flights arrived inEl Salvador, setting the stage for a unresolved court battle between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary.Chart into migrationSee more of the Guardian’s immigration crackdown charts and datahere.The Trump administrationsent more peopleto El Salvador’s Cecot prison later in March.After the expulsions and deportations, news reports revealed that the US government relied on flimsy evidence to accuse the deported immigrants of gang membership.One case that gained significant media attention was that ofAndry Hernández Romero, a 32-year-old gay makeup artist whose crown tattoos near the words “Mom” and “Dad” in Spanish were cited as evidence that he was a gang member.The Venezuelan men were detained in Cecot for months and released on 28 July in a prisoner swap. The Venezuelan men were sent back to Venezuela, while a number of US nationals detained in the country were returned to the US – among them a former US marine who had beenconvicted of a triple murder. The Salvadorian men sent to Cecot by the US government were not released as part of the swap.After his release, Hernández Romero told journalists his time in Cecot was “an encounter with torture and death”,Reuters reported. “Many of our fellows have wounds from the nightsticks; they have fractured ribs, fractured fingers and toes, marks from the handcuffs, others have marks on their chests, on their face … from the projectiles.”In another interview with Venezuelan media, Hernández Romero said he was sexually abused by guards.The Venezuelan government has said it will investigate El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, a close Trump ally, over the alleged abuses.Bukele’s Cecot prison has been a defining centerpiece of his administration in recent years. In 2022, Bukele declared a state of exception, leading to a massive crackdown on gangs in the country and the construction of a network of secretive prisons, including Cecot. Bukele’s government has invited US representatives, social media influencers and international media to tour the facility.Details of the deal between the US government and El Salvador to detain the nearly 300 immigrants are still mired in secrecy. The US frequentlyinvoked the “state secrets” privilegeduring court proceedings to avoid any disclosures regarding its deal with Bukele.In recent months, more questions have arisen regarding the deal between the Trump administration and Bukele. During the Alien Enemies Act expulsions, the Trump administrationexpelleda top MS-13 leader to El Salvador and is currently trying to return a second one, leading to accusations that the US is trying to do a favor for Bukele.Bukele reportedly requested the return of key MS-13 leaders from US custody, critics say, to allegedly prevent them from revealing further information about a controversial 2019 pact between his government and the gang.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationHouse of RepresentativesEl SalvadorDemocratsUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Thailand and Cambodia face the prospect of a 36% US tariff from 1 August.Trump took credit for the ceasefire deal, which was due to come into effect at midnight on Monday local time, after five days of clashes.The talks were attended by officials from the US and China. Malaysia is the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional bloc.The Cambodian prime minister, Hun Manet, told the media he hoped and “confidently” believed that the outcome of the meeting would “provide a lot of opportunities”, for hundreds of thousands of people to return to their homes, for the two countries to stop fighting and to rebuild trust and cooperation.“Today we had a very good meeting and very good results that hope to stop immediately the fighting that has caused many lives [to be] lost, injuries and also caused a lot of displacement of people,” he said.Thailand’s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, said the agreement “reflects Thailand’s desire for a peaceful resolution”, adding that his country had agreed to a ceasefire that would “be carried out successfully in good faith by both sides”.Trump declared himself the “President of PEACE” in a post on his social media platform Truth Social after the ceasefire announcement.“I am pleased to announce that, after the involvement of President Donald J. Trump, both Countries have reached a CEASEFIRE and PEACE. Congratulations to all! By ending this War, we have saved thousands of lives. I have instructed my Trade Team to restart negotiations on Trade. I have now ended many Wars in just six months – I am proud to be the President of PEACE!” he wrote.The White House spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said Trump “made this happen”. “Give him the Nobel Peace Prize!” she posted on X.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said he and Trump were “committed to an immediate cessation of violence” and expected the governments of Cambodia and Thailand to “fully honor their commitments to end this conflict”.The Thai and Cambodian leaders thanked Anwar, the US and China. China has strong economic links to Thailand and Cambodia and is a close ally of the latter.Hun Manet posted on Facebook that Trump had called him to offer congratulations, and that he had also expressed his gratitude again to Trump “for initiating and pushing” the negotiations.He added that Trump had agreed to “engage the United States in monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and continue to cooperate with mechanisms prepared by Malaysia for the successful monitoring.”Phumtham earlier told reporters that Trump had praised Thailand for “being a good role model in maintaining peace”, adding that he also commended Trump for the role he had played in finding a resolution to the conflict.“I believe that Thais will benefit from this,” Phumtham said, adding that he hoped the developments would help Thailand reach a trade deal.Despite the ceasefire announcement, the Thai authorities have warned people who have evacuated from border areas not to return home until further notice, and the news has been met with a mix of hope and some scepticism among affected communities.View image in fullscreenDisplaced people in Sisaket province, Thailand, react after the ceasefire announcement.Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/ReutersUnder Monday’s agreement, Anwar said regional commanders from the Thai and Cambodian military would meet at 7am on Tuesday, and that a meeting would also be held on 4 August by the general border committee, a body established by Thailand and Cambodia to facilitate negotiations over their shared border.Thailand and Cambodia also agreed to resume direct communications between their prime ministers, foreign ministers and defence ministers, Anwar said.Relations between the two countries have deteriorated sharply over recent months.Thailand and Cambodia have a long-running border dispute that dates back to disagreements over colonial-era maps, but the most recent tensions began in May when troops briefly exchanged fire in a contested area, killing a Cambodian soldier. This led toretaliatory measures by both sides.Last week, the two countries recalled their ambassadors, downgrading diplomatic relations. On Thursday, clashes erupted along the border, with the two sides trading rocket and artillery fire, and airstrikes.The crisis has been worsened by a fallout between Hun Sen, a former leader of Cambodia and the father of Hun Manet, and Thaksin Shinawatra, a former Thai leader and the father of the Thai prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Paetongtarn was suspended from office this month after Hun Senleaked a recording of a controversial phone callhe had held with her, underlining the extent of the feud between Hun Sen and Thaksin, who were once close friends.Tita Sanglee, an associate fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said it was too early to tell if the ceasefire would hold, and that it seemed “very fragile and susceptible to disruption”. She added: “Underlying tensions are still very high. Rebuilding trust will take more than time.”Phumtham later urged caution, telling reporters: “It’s not midnight yet. Let’s see how things go – because right now the clashes and talks are still ongoing. But I believe that the [Cambodian defence minister] went back to his country and talked with his people so I believe that it will end peacefully.“We should wait and see the full outcome. We should not only look at the short-term.”Explore more on these topicsCambodiaThailandMalaysiaAsia PacificDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

He has been the leader since he was chosen as a toddler more than 80 years ago. But the Dalai Lama is now 90, and talking openly about the process to pick his successor.Much has changed, however, since he was discovered by senior Buddhist monks in a village in north-westTibetin 1937. Most pertinently, the Chinese invasion of Tibet in the 1950s and the subsequent exile of the region’s Buddhist leadership to India in the decades since.As our south Asia correspondent,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,explains, it means the identity of the next Lama – and the process of how to find them – has become a deeply disputed question, pitting the Chinese state against Buddhist monks.

Regular tourism is still effectively banned, although Russian tourists have been allowed to visit certain parts of the country on group tours, and foreign runners competed in a marathon in Pyongyang in April.In June, North Korean leaderKim Jong-unlaunched a new beach resort located on the country’s east coast which authorities reportedly hope will attract 20,000 visitors a year.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsNorth KoreaRussiaKim Jong-unAsia PacificAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

On 14 July, it called on payment providers to cease providing services to gaming platforms Steam and Itch.io, claiming that hundreds of their games contained content including rape, sexual violence and incest.Itch.io’s swift compliance, however, meant removing not just the content in Collective Shout’s claim but all NSFW adult content from browsing and search – at least temporarily. Some games were also removed entirely.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure,” the company said.“Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologise for the abruptness of this change.”Some users reported they were unable to play games removed from sale that they had already paid for, which Itch.io has denied.Collective Shout, a small but vocal lobby group, has long called for a mandatory internet filter that would prevent access to adult content for everyone in Australia. Its director, Melinda Tankard Reist, was recently appointed to the stakeholder advisory board for the government’sage assurance technology trialbefore the under-16s social media ban comes into effect in Australia in December.Collective Shout routinely focuses its campaigns on underwear advertising and video games in Australia. It has recently campaigned for Elon Musk’s X to ban adult content, but the success of its recent campaign against gaming platforms has brought them the most international attention.In the two weeks since announcing the letters sent to major payment providers including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, video game marketplaces Itch.io and Steam have announced policy changes.Steam, which has an estimated 132 million active monthly users, earlier this month removed an estimated hundreds of titles in response to pressure from payments processors.Tankard Reist said she and her team had been bombarded with “abuse, harassment, rape and death threats” since the campaign launch, which the team was compiling to report to the eSafety commissioner and the police.By Monday, a Change.org petition calling for payment processors to “stop controlling what we can watch, read, or play” has garnered more than 147,000 signatures.“Nobody is forced to engage with content they find offensive – but they have no right to dictate what others are allowed to enjoy, especially when it’s within the bounds of the law,” it said.Elon Musk posted “bravo” in response to an X user’s post about the petition, and – in another reply to criticism of a payments processor forcing the removal of content – said he wanted to get his own X payments platform “going soon”.While Collective Shout solely targeted games it said violated policies held by payment platforms, Itch.io’s move to temporarily remove all NSFW content resulted in games with LGBTQ+ themes being removed.One petition signer who is a member of theLGBTQ+ communitysaid they were concerned that banning sexual-based games would be the start of cracking down on LGBTQ+ content.“Banning sexual content never stops there, it always include non-sexual things. As such the fight to protect people’s right to sexual expression is vital for protecting my right to exist,” they wrote.Face age and ID checks? Using the internet in Australia is about to fundamentally changeRead moreTankard Reist said the blanket removal of NSFW games was not the objective of the campaign, noting that Itch.io has said it would introduce compliance measures for NSFW pages to allow games as long as they abided by the policies of the payment processor linked to their account.“It is likely many games will be restored to the platform after Itch.io’s review,” she said. “Payment processors have a right to determine what services they will provide … according to their CSR [corporate social responsibility], mission and values.”Asked whether the incoming Online Safety Act codes, which restrict access to content refused classification in Australia and bring in age verification for adult content, would have been a better place for the concerns raised by her group, Tankard Reist said the issue did not affect Australia alone.“The internet has no borders. Women and girls everywhere are impacted by male violence against women and misogyny in general which we believed these games perpetuated,” she said. Collective Shout “could not afford to wait” to see if the codes and age verification would be effective, she added.Mastercard and Visa were contacted for comment. Steam did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for PayPal said it could not comment on individual customers. “PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe platform for its customers. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards any illegal activity. Any accounts found to be associated with illegal activity will be closed,” they said.Explore more on these topicsCensorshipGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Kostakidis has not yet filed a defence but has asked the court to strike out the entire claim, or at least substantial parts of it.The chief executive of the ZFA, Alon Cassuto,complained to the Human Rights Commissionbut the matter was not resolved and was escalated to the federal court.Cassuto’s claim says the breach came when Kostakidis shared a video of a speech by Nasrallah on X and added: “The Israeli govt getting some of its own medicine. Israel has started something it can’t finish with this genocide.” A second post sharing the same video on 13 January is also part of the claim.Kostakidis’interlocutory applicationwill be heard by Justice Stephen McDonald on Tuesday in Adelaide’s federal court.Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary as a free newsletterIn documents filed with the court, Kostakidis submitted that the RDA claim is so imprecise and ambiguous about Jewish people and citizens of Israel it could include “Arab ethnicity in the case of an Arab person who follows the Jewish faith” or “a Jewish person who is ethnically Swedish”.The submission argues Zionism “is a political philosophy with many shades of meaning such that to identify as a Zionist says very little about a person’s beliefs and sensitivities”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWeekly BeastFree weekly newsletterAmanda Meade's weekly diary on the latest in Australian media, free every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As she has 28,000 followers on X, she submitted the number of Jewish people who were aware of one or both of the posts would be a total of 120 people.Cassuto said Kostakidis “raises theoretical criticisms of form” to avoid dealing with the substance of the claim made against her, which is “obvious”.“The pleaded reason for the impugned posts is: in the case of Australian Jews, their racial or ethnic origin as Jews; and in the case of Israelis in Australia, their national origin as Israelis,” the ZFA reply said.“No other interpretation is fairly open. The fact that the respondent can point to the fact that an individual in each group may have more than one race or national or ethnic origin is plainly irrelevant.”Cassuto alleges that since the 7 October attack, Kostakidis has posted on X “about Israel and/or Jews, including among other things spreading various antisemitic conspiracy theories. Those antisemitic conspiracy theories include that Israel controls the United States government, that Israel assassinated John F Kennedy, that there was an alliance between Zionists and the Nazis, and that Israeli Mossad agents were involved in the September 11 2001 attacks.”“The pleaded case is clear,” the applicant said in response to the interlocutory application. “Ms Kostakidis has launched a wide-ranging but unjustified attack on a properly pleaded case. Mr Cassuto respectfully submits that the strike out application should be dismissed with costs, and Ms Kostakidis should be required to put on her defence so that his claim may be heard and determined at trial.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian mediaIsraelAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

The group then offered to delay it by a week after the NSW premier, Chris Minns, said the government would not support aprotest of that scale and nature.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMoore said the right to protest was paramount in a democracy.“It would be an incredibly powerful symbol for our most iconic landmark to be the site of a demonstration against starvation in Gaza and in favour of lasting peace,” she said.Minns government rejects pro-Palestine protest march across Sydney Harbour Bridge over timing and ‘chaos’ fearsRead more“The government should work to find a suitable alternate location for this week’s protests, and if the community sentiment is significant enough to warrant the use of the bridge the government should work with organisers to plan for its use.”Minns said in a statement on Monday: “The NSW government cannot support a protest of this scale and nature taking place on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, especially with one week’s notice.”“We cannot allow Sydney to descend into chaos,” he added.The Liberals have backed Minns’s rejection, while the Greens have written to the premier urging him and the roads minister to support it.Anthony D’Adam, who Minnssacked from his parliamentary secretary roles after he criticised NSW police tacticsat a pro-Palestine demonstration, said the assertion that it would cause chaos was overstated and past events showed it had led only to “some inconvenience”.“I’m sympathetic to the arguments around there not being enough notice, but I think that the police should be working with the Palestine Action Group to facilitate the protest,” he said, adding it should be within two to three weeks.Peter Moss, from Labor Friends of Palestine, an internal campaign group of members and politicians that backs the march going ahead, said: “The level of community sentiment for Palestine is comparable to those issues that have seen the bridge closed for previous mass public events.”Josh Lees from the Palestine Action Group said if the government and police were prepared to commit to working together towards a two to three week timeline the group would welcome that.But he said: “If they won’t commit to such support, then it unfortunately reveals that their professed concern for a lack of notice is not genuine, and we are prepared to defend out right to protest in court if necessary.”The group announced the rally in a social media post, highlighting the starvation of adults and children in Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if, under global pressure,Israeltemporarily allows some food into Gaza, it will not mean the end of Israel’s goal of ethnically cleansing the [Gaza] strip,” the Palestine Action Group said.The group said “this extraordinary situation” has led it to call for a March for Humanity over the bridge on 3 August “to save Gaza”.The group also pointed out the bridge is regularly closed at short notice for maintenance or emergencies, and was closed for the historic 2000 march for reconciliation and the 2023 World Pride march.Global condemnation of Israel’s actions in Gaza has sharply increased in recent weeks and days.

The government faces a $2.6bn shortfall in the Treasury Managed Fund which covers the cost of claims by state public servants.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBut the vast majority of submissions to state parliamentary hearings on the changes oppose them, with many arguing the government needs to address other aspects of the scheme and prevent bullying, unreasonable work demands and other causes of psychological injury, rather than curtailing the ability of workers to claim.Unions NSW will tell the committee on Tuesday that the focus of the reforms should be on stopping insurance companies using workers compensation scheme funds to run cases with no reasonable chance of success.In its submission, Unions NSW said legal fees and investigations cost the scheme $332m annually, with minimal benefit to workers or employers.It gave the example of one case where an insurer spent $85,000 of public money to fight a $5,000 knee surgery that a worker’s doctor said she needed. The tribunal ultimately approved the surgery.Workers like Jason question ‘broad brush’ return to office mandates as WFH tussle heads to Fair Work showdownRead more“This inquiry has exposed the shocking waste happening right under our noses – $332m a year being spent on legal fees and investigations that achieve virtually nothing for workers or the scheme’s sustainability,” the secretary of Unions NSW, Mark Morey, said.“While politicians argue about fictional fraud epidemics, insurers are bleeding the system dry with impunity.”The inquiry has received hundreds of submissions from people who have experienced psychological injury at work and from professional groups representing legal professions, doctors, psychologists, employers and insurers.The NSW Secondary Principals’ Council – which represents more than 500 principals in public schools – expressed its strong opposition to the bill. Teachers have made an increased number of claims for psychological injury.“While we acknowledge the government’s intent to address systemic issues, we are deeply concerned that the proposed amendments fail to address the underlying causes of workplace injury – particularly those experienced by principals,” the council said.“According to the Australian Catholic University’s Riley Review (2023), over 50% of school leaders report serious threats of violence, with one in three experiencing physical assault,” the submission said.“These risks are reinforced by the NSWSPC’s own longitudinal data. The 2024 principal wellbeing survey found that nearly one in four principals (23%) reported experiencing a work-related psychological or physical health issue – including depression, PTSD, and anxiety,” it said.The Law Society said its position remains that the government should not proceed with the bill, which was “introduced without adequate transparency and meaningful consultation”.Law firm Slater and Gordon said while it recognised the government’s objective of restoring financial sustainability to the scheme, it should not be achieved through “blunt eligibility restrictions, untested procedural models, and thresholds that will have the effect of excluding all but the most extreme cases”.Clubs NSW supported the change, saying in its submission that psychological injury claims were too readily accepted and paid.“Clubs are regularly liable for injuries caused by reasonable management action like delivering performance feedback,” it said in its submission.Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsIndustrial relationsNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s no reason in waiting. It’s 50 days. I want to be generous, but we just don’t see any progress being made.”Russian and Ukrainian diplomats met in Istanbul last week, agreeing on little more than a prisoner exchange. Ukraine proposed a summit by the end of August between the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but Russia’s reply was that such a meeting would only be appropriate if it were to sign an agreement. The meeting was the third negotiation in Istanbul. Putin has not attended any of the talks, despite Trump’s exhortations.Trump’s comments in recent weeks reflect the continuing change from his almost-conciliatory posture. US diplomats asked China to stop exports of dual-use goods that the Washington says contribute to Russia’s military industrial base.Trump said he was “disappointed” in Putin earlier on Monday. “We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever. You have bodies lying all over the street, and I say that’s not the way to do it. So we’ll see what happens with that.”Two weeks ago, Trumppromiseda punishing round of new sanctions against Russia if Putin did not begin a ceasefire period for negotiations. An agreement for European allies to purchase billions of dollars in additional armaments for Ukraine, including Patriot missile defense systems, accompanied the 15 July statement during a meeting with Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than 220 MPs, a third of parliament, signed a letter addressed to Starmer on Fridaycalling for the UKto recognise a Palestinian state.“We are expectant that the outcome of the conference will be the UK Government outlining when and how it will act on its long-standing commitment on a two-state solution; as well as how it will work with international partners to make this a reality,” the MPs wrote in the letter.Starmer will recall his cabinet from their summer break for an emergency meeting on theGazacrisis this week and government sources have said that formal recognition of Palestinian statehood was a matter of “when, not if” under the Labour government.He was also expected to pushDonald Trumpon the issue of humanitarian aid and a growing crisis of malnourishment and starvation in Gaza. On Monday, two leading human rights organisations based in Israel, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights, were reported to say thatIsrael was committing a genocideagainst Palestinians in Gaza and the country’s western allies have a legal and moral duty to stop it.Trump says he does not endorse Netanyahu’s claim there is no starvation in GazaRead more“We need to galvanize other countries in support of getting that aid in, and yes, that does involve putting pressure on Israel, because it absolutely is a humanitarian catastrophe,” said Starmer in remarks alongside the US president on Monday as the two leaders met at Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland to discuss trade and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.The talks begin just days after Macron said that Francewould recognise Palestinian statehoodin September, saying that the decision would “ensure its viability, and ensure that by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, it contributes to the security of all in the Middle East”.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, condemned Macron’s decision, saying that it “rewards terror” and that a Palestinian state would be a “launchpad to annihilate Israel”.Israel also criticised the Saudi-French-led conference on Monday. “This conference does not promote a solution, but rather deepens the illusion. Instead of demanding the release of the hostages and working to dismantle Hamas’s reign of terror, the conference organizers are engaging in discussions and plenaries that are disconnected from reality,” said Danny Damon, the Israeli ambassador to the UN.The US has echoed the Israeli sentiment and on Monday called the conference “unproductive and ill-timed.”“The United States will not participate in this insult but will continue to lead real-world efforts to end the fighting and deliver a permanent peace,” state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. “Our focus remains on serious diplomacy: not stage-managed conferences designed to manufacture the appearance of relevance.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaFranceUnited NationsEmmanuel MacronIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Still, European leaders are eyeing up the cost to the bloc from being locked in to tariffs of 15% on mostEU exports to the US, when they had previously averaged 4.8%.French and German leaders, following in the footsteps of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, focused on this outcome, rather than the potential damage that could have been inflicted by a US president with an intense dislike for the EU.The French prime minister, François Bayrou, was among leaders who thought Trump’s threatened 30% rate could at least be lowered to match the 10% tariff deal secured by the UK. He said the EU had capitulated anddescribed Sunday as a “dark day”.The irony of one leader beset by factional warring berating another for failing to present a united front to the US was lost on Bayrou. There were many in Brussels who thought he might have taken a more emollient tone given that parliamentary infighting has prevented him from passing a long-delayed budget bill.US-EU trade deal is a ‘dark day’ for Europe, says French PMRead moreAnd especially when Paris is often the cause of friction inside the EU’s Brussels headquarters. On this occasion, Bayrou objected to the EU threat of tariffs on US bourbon, fearing that French wine and brandy producers might be caught in the crossfire.Some insiders asked how the commission president could go nose-to-nose with Trump when the EU was, and remains, divided, with member states seeking carve-outs for their own vulnerable industries.Von der Leyen can also say that most of the trade concessions, including a commitment to buy a large quantity of gas from US producers, matter little when the purchases were likely to be made anyway.She is also hopeful that the deal can circumvent Trump’s obsession with the US pharmaceutical industry. The sector has been left out of all trade deals so far, which means no one yet knows what US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports will be. Ireland is especially fearful after accumulating much of the US offshore pharma industry in County Cork.Brussels is hopeful that 15% will also be the tariff on EU-based pharma exports to the US.David Henig, the director of the UK trade policy project at the European Centre for International Political Economy, said the result of Trump’s actions would probably hit trade and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic, but only marginally.“Nobody wins, there are unlikely to be big trade shifts, but the world keeps turning,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The organization, which is backed by both Israeli and US interests, has been given preferential access to operate in Gaza through coordination with the Israeli military and private US security contractors.Rights groups warn Gaza Humanitarian Foundation it may be liable for international law violationsRead moreHowever, the rollout of the new scheme has been marked by death and destruction from the outset. Jake Wood, the founding executive director and former US marine,resignedon 25 May, saying: “It is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon.”Boston Consulting Group, the US firm handling some of the foundation’s logistics, also withdrew shortly after.Since launching in May, the foundation’s four distribution sites have become killing fields. UN human rights officials report766 peoplewere killed trying to reach GHF sites specifically, with nearly 5,000 more injured in the chaos. More than 1,000have been killedtrying to go to food aid sites in general, according to UN figures, and100 are believed to have diedof starvation.The senators also highlighted concerns about the US security contractors involved in the operation. Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions have reportedly been contracted to provide security at distribution sites, with Associated Press reporting: “American contractors guarding aid distribution sites inGazaare using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food.”According tothe AP reportthey cite, “bullets, stun grenades and pepper spray were used at nearly every distribution, even if there was no threat,” despite many contractors lacking combat experience or proper weapons training.UG Solutions, one of the North Carolina-based contractors, isreported to haverecently hired the crisis communications firm Seven Letter, whose leadership includes former Biden and Obama administration spokespersons, bringing in former Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh in June, according to apress releaseon a now taken-down website.Anthony Aguilar, a US Army veteran and former contractor for the foundation,told BBC Newsover the weekend that he witnessed Israeli forces “shooting at the crowds of Palestinians” and firing “a main gun tank round from the Merkava tank into a crowd of people”. He described the operation as “amateur” and said he had “never witnessed the level of brutality and use of indiscriminate and unnecessary force against a civilian population”.The senators criticized the Trump administration for exempting the foundation from standard oversight procedures, including comprehensive audits usually required for first-timeUSAIDgrant recipients. They noted that USAID officials had raised “critical concerns” about the proposal, citing “operational and reputational risks and lack of oversight”.The foundation has maintained that it has distributed more than95m mealsto civilians across Gaza and denies that violence has occurred at its sites, attributing reports to Hamas misinformation.While on a presidential visit to Scotland, Trump on Sunday claimed that Hamas was stealing food aid sent to Gaza, parroting a similar allegation by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu which is being used to justify restrictions on humanitarian deliveries, despite Israel’sown military officialsadmitted to not having any evidence to substantiate it..In recent weeks, the organization has becomeincreasingly aggressivein its social media responses, with posts claiming the UN “can’t successfully move their aid to Palestinians” and that “they’ve simply stopped trying.” The foundation’s executive chairperson, the Rev Johnnie Moore, also dug in, publishing anop-ed in the Wall Street Journalproposing to take over delivery of all UN aid sitting idle in Gaza. Moore wrote that there were hundreds of UN trucks loaded with food in Gaza, and offered to “deliver all of this aid, for free, on behalf of the U.N”.However, the senators argue that the foundation’s model, with only four militarized distribution sites, cannot replace the UN-led network that previously operated more than 400 aid distribution points during temporary ceasefires.The letter also lands as two prominent Israeli human rights groups, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights – Israel,declared on Mondaythat Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, Their assessment, citing “coordinated action to intentionally destroy Palestinian society”, marks the first time major Israeli rights organizations have publicly reached this conclusion.The senators gave Secretary Rubio two weeks to respond to a series of detailed questions about civilian casualties, funding mechanisms, contractor operations, and compliance with humanitarian principles.“There should be no American taxpayer dollars contributing to this scheme,” the senators wrote.Also on Monday, independent senator Angus King from Maine said he would oppose providing additional US support to Israel until the country addresses the humanitarian crisis, saying Israel’s conduct has been “an affront to human decency”.King, who caucuses withDemocrats, said in a statement: “I am through supporting the actions of the current Israeli government and will advocate – and vote – for an end to any United States support whatsoever until there is a demonstrable change in the direction of Israeli policy.“My litmus test will be simple: no aid of any kind as long as there are starving children in Gaza due to the action or inaction of the Israeli government.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratsUS politicsIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpGazaUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

(See12.49pm.)Trumpdid not seem to recognise the term, andKeir Starmersaid this was a reference to boats coming across the channel. He said the UK government was taking “a lot of action” to stop people coming in the first place.Then Trump added:Immigration is a big factor.And I think, frankly, if they’re coming from other countries and you don’t know who they are – are they coming from prisons? We have them where they came in from prisons. We’re moving them all out.Last month we had zero people come into the country, zero, other than coming through legal means.If you’re stopping immigration and stopping the wrong people, my hats are off to you. You’re doing, not a good thing, you’re doing a fantastic thing.So I know nothing about the boats.But if the boats are loaded up with bad people - and they usually are, because other countries don’t send their best, they send people that they don’t want, they’re not stupid people, they send the people that they don’t want.And I’ve heard that you’ve taken a much stronger stance on this.Starmeragreed with this, saying the government had done “a lot of work” to stop people coming. He said 35,000 people have been returned over the past year.Here are theUS government figuresfor illegal crossings into the country in June. They are not zero, but they are at a record low.Trump also does not seem to understand why people end up trying to enter the UK illegally to seek asylum. It is not because they are “bad people” sent by countries trying to get rid of them; it is generally the opposite – ordinary people trying to get awayfrom terrible regimes.Donald Trump with Keir Starmer and Starmer’s wife, Victoria.Photograph: Chris Furlong/PAShare"

Based on television, I would say not particularly, because those children look very hungry.”He later added: “We can save a lot of people, I mean some of those kids. That’s real starvation; I see it and you can’t fake that. So we’re going to be even more involved.”Asked what he would ask Netanyahu for next time they spoke, Trump said: “We’re giving money and we’re giving food, but we’re over here … I want him to make sure they get the food. I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food.”Trump criticised Hamas for not releasing the remaining hostages and said the militant group was “very difficult to deal with”, while suggesting he had asked the Israeli government to change its approach. “I told Israel, I told Bibi, that you have to now maybe do it a different way,” he said.The president was speaking before a bilateral meeting with Starmer, who flew to Ayrshire to meet him on Monday. The two leaders were due to visit Trump’s second golf course in Aberdeenshire and have dinner together on Monday evening.Trump said he was “very disappointed” with Putin and was “not so interested in talking to him any more” because of his decision to continue airstrikes against civilian targets in Ukraine.“We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,” Trump said. “You have bodies lying all over the street, and I say that’s not the way to do it.”Trump said he would cut his 50-day deadline for a ceasefire to between 10 and 12 days before he imposed secondary sanctions on Russia’s trading partners.He piled pressure on Starmer to cut taxes and immigration, calling the prime minister and Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, “good men”.“I assume there’s a thing going on between you and Nigel and that’s OK,” Trump said. “But generally speaking, the one who cuts taxes the most, the one who gives you the lowest energy prices and the best kind of energy, the one that keeps you out of wars … I think the one that’s toughest and most competent on immigration is going to win the election.”Speaking alongside Trump, Starmer told the press conference that the British public were “revolted” at the “absolute catastrophe” in Gaza and said there was an urgent need for a ceasefire.Israel announced over the weekendthat it would suspend fighting in three areas of Gaza for 10 hours a day and open secure routes for aid delivery, while the UK confirmed it was working with Jordan to carry out airdrops into the territory.However on Monday at least 25 Palestinians were killed, including four children, when Israeli troops opened fire on people seeking aid from a truck convoy passing through the southern Gaza Strip, according to health officials and witnesses. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.Aid agencies say the new measures are not enough to counter worsening starvation in the territory.Martin Penner, a spokesperson for the UN food agency, told the Associated Press that all 55 of its aid trucks that entered on Monday were looted by starving people before they reached world food programme warehouses. Another UN official said nothing on the ground has changed and no alternative routes were allowed.In total at least 78 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire on Monday, local health officials said, including a pregnant woman and her baby, who was delivered after her death but also died.Starmer is due toconvene an emergency cabinet meetingon the humanitarian crisis in Gaza on Tuesday afternoon. Ministers will be presented with a peace plan which the UK is working up alongside France and Germany.The prime minister isunder pressure from senior cabinet ministers and more than 220 MPsto immediately recognise Palestine as a state, after Emmanuel Macron announced that France would do so at the UN general assembly in September. Trump dismissed the idea on Monday but suggested he had no objection to the UK or other allies doing so.Trump also said the US and its allies would set up “walk-in” food centres without barriers in the region, though he gave little detail about how these would operate.On Monday afternoon,about 100 protestersgathered in Balmedie, the closest village to Trump’s Aberdeenshire golf course, waving Palestinian flags and chanting: “You are not welcome here.”Kay Collin, a retired modern studies teacher, said she had made the trip from Edinburgh because “watching what is happening in Gaza, if it was happening to my grandchildren I would hope other people would stand up for them”.While many people cited the starvation crisis in Gaza as the most urgent reason for their protest, Trump’s policies on immigration, transgender rights and cuts to international aid, and there were placards and chants accusing him of misogyny and bullying behaviour.Jenna Harpin, a mother of four from Portsoy, said she was “disgusted” at how much money was being spent by the Scottish and UK governments on hosting Trump’s visit, especially at a time when local councils were making cuts to vital services.The protesters marched through the village as the police presence swelled in anticipation of Trump’s arrival. Local access had been significantly restricted with lines of police officers blocking off the beach and snipers spotted on the dunes.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGazaIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Here are the main takeaways from what he said:Sunday’s aid deliveries were a “start” but represented a “drop in the ocean” of what the civilian population of Gaza needs.During the 42-day ceasefire (that came into effect after Donald Trump re-entered the White House in January) 600-700 aid trucks were getting into Gaza each day (Israel says Gaza got 120 trucks yesterday).The next few days “are really make or break” and much more aid needs to be delivered and delivered much more quickly.The UN and its partners can reach everyone in Gaza in the next couple of weeks with life-saving aid if its teams are granted access at border crossings, are given the security permits they need to operate and are not otherwise blocked.They got “quite a bit of food in” yesterday but “lots of that got looted” as it went across the border.The humanitarian pauses implemented byIsraelmay “last a week or so”, which is clearly insufficient as we are seeing a “21st-century atrocity” unfolding in front of our eyes.There needs to be a sustained period of weeks or months to stop starvation and ultimately a ceasefire is needed.Hundreds of thousands of people are “desperately hungry” inside Gaza – so most of the lorries yesterday “were hit by desperate individual civilians, starving”.“The flour was taken off those lorries … so what we do is we work with local communities, community kitchens, so that what we can get through then gets distributed to those who most need it and importantly that the armed groups, including Hamas, don’t get it”.Fletcher wishes the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – an Israeli-backed delivery group – would distribute aid in a “more principled, humanitarian way”. He said the UN could deliver aid in a way that doesn’t harm civilians and deliver aid at a greater scale.“The next few days are make or break.”Israel has begun to allow more aid into Gaza, amidst warnings malnutrition has reached ‘alarming levels’.Tom Fletcher, the UN’s aid chief, tells#R4Todayrecent aid deliveries have been a ‘drop in the ocean’.— BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today)July 28, 2025ShareUpdated at09.20 EDT"

It’s a social and political phenomenon.”Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) focuses in its report on a detailed chronological account of the assault on Gaza’s health system, with many details documented directly by the group’s own team, which worked regularly in Gaza before 7 October 2023.The destruction of the healthcare system alone makes the war genocidal under article 2c of the genocide convention, which prohibits deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy a group “in whole or part”, said its director, Guy Shalev.“You don’t have to have all five articles of the genocide convention to be fulfilled in order for something to be genocide,” he said, although the report also details other genocidal aspects of Israel’s war.View image in fullscreenRelatives of Palestinians who lost their lives during Israeli attacks mourn during a funeral ceremony at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBoth B’Tselem and PHR said Israel’s western allies were enabling the genocidal campaign, and shared responsibility for suffering in Gaza. “It couldn’t happen without the support of the western world,” Novak said. “Any leader that is not doing whatever they can to stop it is part of this horror.”The US and European countries have a legal responsibility to take stronger action than they have done so far, Shalev said. “Every tool in the toolbox should be used. This is not what we think, this is what the genocide convention calls for.”Israel denies is it carrying out a genocide, and says the war in Gaza is one of self-defence after cross-border attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed 1,200 people, the majority civilians. More than 250 others were kidnapped and taken to Gaza, where 50 remain held hostage, with 20 of them believed to still be alive.On Monday a spokesperson for the Israeli government called the allegation made by the rights groups “baseless”. “There is no intent, [which is] key for the charge of genocide ... It simply doesn’t make sense for a country to send in 1.9m tons of aid, most of that being food, if there is an intent of genocide,” said spokesperson David Mencer.A key element to the crime of genocide, as defined by the international convention, is showing intent by a state to destroy a target group in whole or part.Genocidal statements from politicians and military leaders, and a chronology of well-documented impacts on civilians after nearly two years of war are proof of that intent, even without a paper trail of orders from the top, both PHR and B’Tselem say.1:16International court of justice orders Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza – videoThe PHR report details how “genocidal intent may be inferred from the pattern of conduct”, citing legal precedent from the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda.The extensive documentation, by medics, media and human rights organisations over a long period of time, meant Israel’s government could not claim it did not understand the impact of its actions, Shalev said. “There were enough times and enough opportunities for Israel to stop this gradual systematic attack.”Incitement to genocide has been recorded since the start of the war. It is one of two issues on which the Israeli judge hearing the case at the international court of justice voted with the majority when ordering emergency measures for the protection of Palestinians from the plausible risk of genocide.“We don’t need to guess what Israel is doing and what the Israeli army is doing, because from the first day of this attack, Israeli leaders, the highest leadership, political leadership, including the prime minister, the minister of defence, the president of Israel said exactly that,” Novak said.“They talked about human animals. They talked about the fact that there are no civilians in Gaza or that there is an entire nation responsible for 7 October.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians bring the bodies of victims of Israeli attacks to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis on Monday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“If the leadership of Israel, whether the army leadership and the political leadership, knows about the consequences of this policy and keep going, it is very clear that is intentional.”The destruction of health infrastructure, two years without medical care and the killing of medical workers also meant the toll from the genocide would continue to mount even after any ceasefire halts fighting, Shalev said.“For example, there have been no MRI machines in Gaza for months now, so what about all the illnesses and diseases that were not diagnosed all that time. There are all the malnutrition and chronic diseases that went untreated, we’re going to see the effects of that for months and years to come.”While medication can be brought in within days, there is no easy way to replace medical workers who have been killed, including specialists who took decades to train, he said.“Looking at the conditions of life opens this kind of temporal scale that is frightening if we want to believe in a future where … the people of Gaza somehow get to live their lives safely and in good health. It’s very hard to see that.”The death toll in Gaza from the war is approaching 60,000, or more than 2.5% of the prewar population. Some of those who defend Israel’s war argue that istoo lowfor the campaign to be considered genocide.View image in fullscreenPalestinians wait to receive food from a charity kitchen in Gaza City.Photograph: Khamis Al-Rifi/ReutersThat is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the crime of genocide, which the convention defines as targeting a group “in whole or in part”, Novak said. “It doesn’t mean that you need to kill each and every person.”A genocide targeting Palestinians as a group was possible only because Israel for decades dehumanised Palestinians and denied their rights, Novak said. Collective trauma was exploited by far-right politicians to accelerate an agenda they had been pursuing for years.“[7 October ] was a shocking moment and a turning point for Israelis because it instilled a real sincere feeling of existential threat. That was the moment that pushed a whole system and how it operates in Gaza from a policy of control and oppression into one of destruction and extermination.”Now Israel had launched a genocidal campaign in Gaza, there was an urgent risk that it could spread to target other Palestinians, the B’Tselem report warned.“The Israeli regime now has a new tool that they didn’t use before – genocide. And the fact that that this tool or this policy used in Gaza is not yet [deployed] in other areas is not something that we can count on for long,” Novak said.The West Bank is a particular concern, with almost 1,000 Palestinians killed and more than 40,000 displaced from communities including Jenin and Tulkarem, in a campaign of escalating attacks and ethnic cleansing since 7 October 2023.“What we see is basically the same regime with the same logic, the same army, usually the same commanders and even the same soldiers who just fought in Gaza. They are now in the West Bank where violence is on the rise,” Novak said.“What we worry about and want to warn about is the fact that any small trigger might make the genocide spill over from Gaza into the West Bank.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaHuman rightsPalestinian territoriesInternational court of justiceMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, more homes for sale, particularly across southern England, is re-enforcing a buyer’s market, keeping price rises in check.”While market activity usually slows during the summer, this is not happening this year. Buyer numbers in July are 11% higher than in the same month of 2024, resulting in an 8% increase in sales being agreed.Earlier this year property experts had reported a dampening effect on house price growth after the end of astamp duty holidayin England and Northern Ireland on 31 March. However, recent government-backed changes to the way lenders assessmortgage affordabilityhave served as a catalyst for increased activity, Zoopla said. Homebuyers using a mortgage can now borrow up to 20% more than they could as recently as three months ago.With mortgage rates “holding steady”, Donnell said: “Less stringent affordability testing has boosted buying power.”At the start of the year Zoopla predicted house prices would rise 2% in 2025, but it has cut this to 1%. While the index showed the annual rate of price inflation slowed to 1.3% in June, the report pointed to stark regional differences.While house prices in Scotland, Wales and northern England are experiencing faster growth – typically of 2-3% annually – prices are rising at a much slower rate in the south. Prices have risen by 0.2% in the south-east and London and by 0.3% in the south-west.The figure for the capital is pulled down by declines in some areas, including a fall of 1.5% in west London. Elsewhere in England, Truro, Torquay and Exeter registered some of the biggest declines, down 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.1% respectively.“Greater supply of homes for sale and mortgage rates remaining higher than expected are the key reasons for weaker growth,” Donnell said.New figures from Rightmove showed average asking rents across Britain, excluding London,rose 1.2% to a new record of £1,365 per month in the second quarter of 2025. The average advertised rate in the capital also reached a new high of £2,712, up 0.5% over the quarter.The property website’s report said the average monthly rent paid by new tenants was £417 more than in 2020. This is an uplift of 44%, outpacing a 36% rise in average earnings over the same period.However, much of this growth occurred at the height of the Covid pandemic. Since 2023, yearly rent rises have gradually slowed as supply and demand rebalanced. The number of available properties is now 15% higher than this time last year. However, it is still 29% below 2019’s level.The less frenzied market means landlords are taking longer to find tenants, in some cases leading to rent reductions. Nearly a quarter (24%) of asking rents were cut during marketing, the highest number since 2017.Rightmove’s property expert Colleen Babcock said despite rising asking rents, the “big picture is that yearly rent increases continue to slow”. “Supply and demand is slowly rebalancing towards more normal levels, though we still have a way to go before we reach pre-2020 levels,” she added.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketPropertyHousingMortgagesReal estateHouse pricesnewsShareReuse this content"

Back in Januarythe government approved the £28.6m investmentto support the reopening of the mine, which is being led by Redruth-based Cornish Metals.Cornish tin was sold all over Europe 3,000 years ago, say archaeologistsRead moreDon Turvey, the chief executive of Cornish Metals, said: “Tin is a critical mineral for the clean energy transition, essential to electronics, electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure. By reviving domestic production at South Crofty, we’re not only creating over 300 direct jobs but also supporting many more across local supply chains and regional businesses.”The government estimates that a further 1,000 jobs will be created as the company uses more local suppliers such as metal fabricators and electricians, and supports supply chains in the UK.After operating for more than 400 years, South Crofty was the last tin mine to close in the UK due to lack of investment andfalling metal prices in the 1990s.However, there has been a rise in prices over the past decade – from $16,000 (£11,957) a tonne in 2016 to about $34,000 – with tin used as solder in consumer electronics and other sectors, including electric cars and solar cells.“Despite having so much potential to grow, Cornwall has been neglected by successive governments, and its families and businesses have suffered as a result,” Reeves said. “Like in every part of the UK, I am determined to unlock growth that creates jobs and puts more money in Cornish people’s pockets.”The government made the investment through the national wealth fund, supporting its industrial strategy to boost growth in priority industries.Ian Brown, the head of banking and investment at the national wealth fund, said: “Cornish Metals have made excellent progress as they work towards reopening South Crofty. Our financing is designed to help them crowd further investment into the region, bringing skilled, year-round opportunities, and driving local growth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many supporters had dressed for the Lionesses’ return, wearingEnglandkits and holding flags.Cheers erupted at the Essex airport as the plane approached the runway and again as the team emerged from the airport to walk along a red carpet waving at fans.The team’s captain, Leah Williamson, led the squad out of the private terminal just before 5pm, carrying the trophy. Among the fans were the twins Poppy and Daisy Macdonald, 11, from Benfleet, Essex, who were holding a sign asking for a photo with the star striker Alessia Russo.Poppy said: “We’re so proud. They’ve won it two times in a row and they’ve worked so hard for it. They’ve had a lot of injuries and setbacks but they’ve done really well.”Daisy admitted she struggled to watch the penalty shootout. “I couldn’t watch, I was very nervous, but very happy that they won,” she said.The players attended a celebratory reception at Downing Street, hosted by the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the sports minister, Stephanie Peacock.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman, the England manager, holds the trophy outside No 10 after the win in Basel.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianNo 10 was decorated for the occasion, with St George’s flags draped over windows and bunting along the railings. Welcoming the team, Rayner called it a “historic day for English football, for women’s sport – and for the country”.“The Lionesses have brought it home again,” she said. “With grit, and with determination and skill, you roared. And I know I wasn’t the only one roaring with you.“You’ve made us all so, so, proud. Your performances have inspired the nation and lifted women’s football to new heights … Role models like you send such a powerful message. The Lionesses are a shining example of a talent and excitement of women’s football.“This win is a brilliant advert for the sport and will inspire thousands of girls to dream big,” she added. “The next generation of Lionesses are out there now – playing in schools, parks, and grassroots clubs.”“It was amazing. I just burst out crying just in pure emotion,” said one fan waiting outside the black gates in front of Downing Street. “Just that little girl inside of me watching football when I was younger and seeing how far the game has grown since then, it all just kind of got to me.”Another fan waiting to get a peek of the team had only just come back from Switzerland to watch the team romp to the final. Izzy said seeing the players arrive at Downing Street was an opportunity that could not be missed.“For me there wasn’t really a doubt that they were going to win, but it was still really stressful,” said the 30-year-old, who asked not to share her surname after calling in sick to work to celebrate the Lionesses’ victory.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson leaving the team’s hotel in Zurich while carrying the trophy on Monday.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAAs a former player herself, she travelled to London alone and is staying in the capital for Tuesday’s open-top bus tour.

Vanessa Whyte, 45, a vet originally from County Clare, her son James, 14, and daughter Sara, 13,were also killed.A murder investigation was launched last week, with police saying a triple murder and attempted suicide was one line of inquiry. All four suffered gunshot wounds.“Detectives have reiterated their appeal for anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, to come forward,” a police spokesperson said.The shooting stunned the rural community, prompting tributes. “We are heartbroken. May they rest in peace,” said a note left with flowers at the scene.A prayer service for Whyte and her children took place in Barefield, Co Clare, followed by a community vigil in Maguiresbridge on Friday.During the service, parish priest Tom Fitzpatrick said: “The unspeakable tragedy that has befallen our parish is something that is very hard to focus in on and get our minds around.“What affects an individual or affects a particular family in the parish, it affects everybody,” he added. “I know Vanessa was a woman who gave, and who gave, and who gave, and James and Sara were light made flesh themselves.”View image in fullscreenVanessa Whyte and her children, Sara and James, were killed at their home last Wednesday.Photograph: PSNI/PAHe said: “Let us remember Vanessa not just by the way she died, but by the life she lived, her smile, her strength, her incredible powerful love for her children. She gave it her all to the very end.”“We remember James and Sara, not just as victims of violence, but as children who played and who laughed and had their favourite stories, of course favourite foods I’m sure as well, and great dreams. Dreams that will never be fulfilled, but dreams that mattered because they were theirs.”A funeral service is expected to take place in Co Clare later this week.Whyte reportedly moved to Fermanagh several years ago and was employed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Enniskillen.Colleagues and friends said she was popular, down-to-earth and devoted to her children. Enniskillen Royal grammar school said it was mourning “the loss of two vibrant and much valued pupils”.The ambulance service said it had received a call at 8.21am on Wednesday and dispatched emergency crews to the scene, where Whyte and one child were pronounced dead.Rutledge was airlifted to the Royal Victoria hospital in Belfast, while the second child was taken to a hospital in Enniskillen, where they were pronounced dead.Pat Cullen, the Sinn Féin MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said people were mourning valued members of the community. “Two wee children have lost their lives and a mummy, when they just should be enjoying the school holidays and having a wonderful time,” she told the BBC.A tribute to Whyte and her children was displayed at the All-Ireland final in Croke Park in Dublin on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

You see how beautiful it is?“We had ceilings that were in bad shape. They were falling down. It was very old. It wasn’t properly maintained. Now it’s brand new and beautiful, and we saved everything. If you look outside, it’s equally opulent and beautiful.”With Trump’s use of this visit to further his business interests already in the spotlight, Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, faced significant criticism after announcing that his government was in talks to provide £180,000 of public funding for the Aberdeenshire resort as it hosts the 2025 Nexo championship on the DP World Tour next month.The US president earlier used his trip to repeat his call for the Open championship to return to Turnberry, declaring it “the best resort in the world”.Asked about the Open at Monday’s joint press conference, Starmer said “the decision on the Open is not a decision for me” but was swift to praise Turnberry as “absolutely magnificent, both inside and out”.Starmer’s comments came afterthe Guardian revealedthat senior Whitehall officials had asked golf bosses whether they could host the 2028 Open at Turnberry after Trump’s repeated requests.US ethics experts later said doing socould break the US constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval.Swinney has refused to confirm the cost of policing Trump’s visit, saying he remains in discussion with the UK government, but many critics have questioned why – as one Aberdeenshire protester put it on Monday – “our taxes are paying for his holiday”.Leading a hundred-strong protest at Trump’s imminent arrival at his Menie resort in the nearby village of Balmedie, Alena Ivanova of the Stop Trump Coalition Scotland said: “It was very clear from the beginning that this trip was about Trump benefiting himself.”She also urged people to “consider the reality” of Trump’s business interests in Aberdeenshire.The Menie resort was built after a bitter and protracted dispute with local people and environmentalists, who fought to save the rare sand dunes and their own dwellings which Trump declared an eyesore. When he eventually won planning permission he promised a £1bn coastal resort including expansive courses, luxury housing and high-rise timeshare flats – promises thatmany locals point outhave yet to be fulfilled.Ivanova said: “Trump was supposed to build a £1bn development with accommodation for local people. There were supposed to be a thousand jobs, so far there have barely been a hundred.“The Scottish government was hoodwinked into agreeing proposals that were previously turned down by the local council and the promises have not materialised.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpLobbyingKeir StarmerGolfScotlandThe OpennewsShareReuse this content"

Within four or five minutes, officers found the suspect, who was then taken to a hospital after what police described as an officer-involved shooting.The incident started outside near the resort’s valet area and may have extended to other parts of the property, the Reno Gazette-Journalreported, citing law enforcement officials.In addition to those who were killed and the people taken to the hospital, three more were treated for minor injuries at the resort, according to Devon Reese, chair of the board of health in northern Nevada. One person was grazed by a bullet on their little finger, one was treated for severe anxiety and one was injured while running, he said.Hotel guests heard several shots coming from the resort’s valet area.Michael Sisco, 60, said he was in his room and about to head to the valet for his car when he heard popping sounds. He looked out his window and saw people screaming and running from the valet area.He said he saw a man holding his stomach and staggering before falling motionless next to a car. Sisco moved away from the window as the gunshots continued.“A half-hour after the incident, I started shaking because I realized I could’ve been there,” he said. “That’s exactly where I was going.”Christina Martinez heard the shots just as she was stepping into an elevator in the lobby, and they were still going off when she stepped out on to the 18th floor.Someone in a neighboring room told her there was a gunman right outside the main entrance, near where Martinez said she was getting coffee just moments before.“I feel very blessed, but that’s kind of why I had a panic attack,” she said. “I was like, oh my God. I was just there.”The resort is one of Reno’s most prominent venues, hosting concerts, sporting events and a campaign rally by Donald Trump before the 2024 election. Near the California border and just north-east of Lake Tahoe, the town is a popular summer tourist destination.The Grand Sierra Resort condemned the “senseless violence” in a statement to the Gazette-Journal.“We are heartbroken by the senseless violence that occurred in our parking area earlier today,” the Grand Sierra Resort said.“Our thoughts are with the victims and all those affected by this tragic incident.”“It could have been much, much worse,” said Reno’s mayor, Hillary Schieve. “We don’t know yet quite how it started or who was involved.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNevadaGun crimeUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

In these areas, heat index values (how hot it feels once humidity is accounted for) are forecast to range between 105 and 113F (40.5 to 45C).Some locations inMississippiandLouisianaface an even greater threat, with the heat index possibly soaring as high as 120F (49C).Meanwhile, the midwest isn’t escaping the heat. Conditions there remain hazardous into Monday and Tuesday, after a weekend in which temperatures felt as if they were between 97 and 111F (36 to 44C) in areas from Lincoln,Nebraska, north to Minneapolis.How climate crisis makes rainstorms that flooded New York more commonRead moreCities such as Des Moines, St Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Raleigh are under extreme heat warnings. In these locations, temperatures will climb into the mid-90s and low 100s, with heat indices potentially reaching 110 to 115F.The most dangerous conditions, classified as level 4 out of 4 on the heat risk scale, encompass much of Florida and extend north intoGeorgiaand the Carolinas. A broader level 3 zone stretches from the eastern plains through the midwest and into the mid-Atlantic. This follows a weekend already dominated by extreme temperatures.Tampa experienced an unprecedented milestone on Sunday when it reached 100F (37.8C). Other cities also broke daily temperature records, and more are expected to follow suit.The dangerous heat and humidity are expected to persist through midweek, affecting major metropolitan areas including St Louis, Memphis, Charlotte, Savannah, Tampa and Jackson,Mississippi. Actual air temperatures will climb into the upper 90s and low 100s, while heat index readings are expected to remain between 105 and 115F for several days due to high tropical moisture.Relief will be hard to find, even during the night. Overnight and early morning temperatures are forecast to dip only into the 70s or above, keeping conditions uncomfortable around the clock.However, a cold front moving in later this week is expected tobring a drop in temperaturesacross the eastern US, offering a much-needed break from the extreme heat by the weekend.Elsewhere, triple-digit temperatures will dominate the central US. The combination of soaring heat and dense humidity in the Mississippi River valley and central plains could make conditions especially hazardous, with some areas possibly seeing the heat index reach 120F.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

While no one single weather event can be blamed on the global climate crisis, the warming world is experiencing a greater frequency of extreme weather incidents.According to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(Noaa), excessive heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the US, and the problem is only intensifying. For vulnerable populations, such as migrants, prisoners or schoolchildren in under-cooled buildings, the burden of rising temperatures is compounded.Despite the increasinglycrucial need to find solutionsfor the rising temperatures, many US agencies are currently understaffed due to cuts from the Trump administration and the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).Federal science agencies such as Noaa are now operating at reduced capacity despite the outsized weather threats.

On Thursday the US court of appeals for the federal circuit will hear oral arguments in the case,VOS Selections v Trump.A group ofsmall businessowners are suing the US president on grounds that he lacks legal authority from Congress to impose severe tariffs that could damage their bottom line. The Trump administration has invoked a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), claiming that various national emergencies – including US trade deficits with trading partners and the scourge of fentanyl trafficking – demand urgent action.EU-US tariffs: five key takeaways from the trade dealRead moreBut the plaintiffshave counteredthat the IEEPA does not give the president the power to impose tariffs, and has never been used in such a way in its almost half a century on the statute books.The case has the potential to derail Trump’s most significant tariff deals and negotiations, which he has made a centrepiece of his second presidency. Given how much is riding on it, the suit is likely eventually to be settled by the US supreme court under its current 6-3 supermajority of hard-right justices.In the short term, the challenge under the IEEPA looms as a black cloud over Trump’s desire to claim victory on the tariff front, as his controversial strategy of slapping hefty import duties on major trading partners continues to roil global trade and markets. On Sunday, Trump struck a deal at his golf club in Scotland with the European Commission chief,Ursula von der Leyen, that will see 15% import tariffs on most EU goods entering the US.Then on Friday, a day after the appeals court hears oral arguments, Trump’slatest roundof potentially destabilizing import duties is set to kick in. The targeted countries include some of the biggest suppliers of US imports, including Canada and Mexico.Trump’s tariff gamble has already been deemed to be illegal by a federal court, which ruled in May that the president had overshot his powers under trade laws. That ruling was paused by the appeals court that will be hearing the case on Thursday, pending its decision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The existing contract was to expire at 11.59pm central time on Sunday, but the union said a “cooling off” period would keep a strike from beginning for another week, until 4 August.Union leaders had recommended approving the offer, calling it a “landmark” agreement when it was announced last week. Organizers said then that the offer would improve medical, pension and overtime benefits in addition to pay.The vote came two days beforeBoeingplanned to announce its second quarter earnings, after saying earlier this month that it had delivered 150 commercial airliners and 36 military aircraft and helicopters during the quarter, up from 130 and 26, respectively, during the first quarter.

He described the proposal as “the richest contract offer” ever presented to the St Louis union.“No talks are scheduled with the union,” said Gillan, who is also vice-president for Boeing Air Dominance, the division for the production of several military jets, including the US navy’s Super Hornet, as well as the air force’s Red Hawk training aircraft.Explore more on these topicsBoeingUS unionsAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Spain had won Euro 2012 with Cesc Fàbregas as a false nine, and Germany, who largely took Spain as a model, were less than convinced they needed one at the 2014 World Cup. They fielded Thomas Müller as a false-ish nine until the quarter-final, when Jögi Löw finally went back to basics and turned to Miroslav Klose. That he was 36 only seemed to confirm that the old-fashioned No 9 was an old-fashioned phenomenon – a dying breed. Yet this summer, the main interest in the transfer market has been the carousel of strikers.Of course, strikers never entirely disappeared. The four leading scorers in thePremier Leaguein 2014–15 were Sergio Agüero, Harry Kane, Diego Costa and Charlie Austin. Mauri Icardi and Luca Toni topped the charts in Italy, while Cristiano Ronaldo, his conversion to A No 9 complete, was top scorer in Spain (although that he was followed by Lionel Messi, Antoine Griezmann, and Neymar suggested a greater variety of goalscorer there).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The phenomenon of goalscoring wide players – such as Messi at Barcelona, Arjen Robben at Bayern or Eden Hazard at Chelsea, a mantle which has been taken up today by Mohamed Salah, Kylian Mbappé and Raphinha – meant goals came from a greater array of sources.But while the goalscoring wide forward remains, there has been a return to top-level acceptance for the central striker. Pep Guardiola, the coach who seemed most sceptical of traditional No 9s – never even really seeming entirely convinced by Agüero – perhaps began it when Manchester City signed Erling Haaland. The big Norwegian has caused City to make a significant adjustment to their style. He does not join in play in the way every other Guardiola player does. He does not drop into midfield or pull wide – a creative tension that brought a treble in his first season at the club, but which was perhaps a factor in City’s disappointment last season.At the same time, the most common criticism of Arsenal was that they lacked a center-forward. They needed to play well to win, because they didn’t have a player who could pounce on a half chance to steal a victory from a tight game, or at times even convert their good play into goals. Alexander Isak would have seemed a very natural fit for them, but a fee of £120m/$140m or more was never within range, and so they haveended up with Viktor Gyökeres. It’s a calculated risk given he is 27 and has only really been prolific in the last four seasons – two in the Championship with Coventry and two in Portugal with Sporting – but so long as concerns that he takes too long to get his shot away in crowded situations prove unfounded, he would seem to answer a specific need, even if there are times when Kai Havertz is preferred in that central role.Phenoms to flops: 10 stars who swapped Bundesliga for Premier LeagueRead moreIt’s Isak, though, whostands at the centerof the great striker shuffle. He is tall and quick, his movement intelligent, and he has proved over the past two seasons a consistent Premier League scorer. It’s understandable why Newcastle are so desperate to keep him, but understandable too that he feels undervalued on £120,000 a week/£6.2m ($8.4m) a year. He has three years left on his contract, so beyond the fear that he could sulk, there is little reason for Newcastle to let him go. They can insist on a fee of £140m or more – certainly enough to buy a high-class replacement, possibly Benjamin Šeško from RB Leipzig.Which is what makes it odd that Isak made his availability public only afterLiverpool had signed Hugo Ekitiké, who has a similar profile to Isak but, at 23, is far less developed. Chelsea might also have been interested in Isak had they not already bought two center-forwards in João Pedro and Liam Delap. Perhaps, by selling one or both of Darwin Núñez and Luis Díaz, Liverpool could afford him. To sign a second central forward would be a remarkable step for a club where for several years one of the main roles of the center-forward has been to clear the way for Salah. That perhaps suggests change is coming – Liverpool beginning to prepare for life without Salah, who is, after all, 33.But Isak is not an old-school striker. Alan Shearer was perhaps the last of his line, at least at elite level in England. From Marco van Basten onwards, through Andriy Shevchenko and Thierry Henry, forwards have become much more complete figures, combining elements of the target-man, the channel-runner and the poacher. Isak and João Pedro have the full range of skills; Ekitiké and Šeško are developing them. Central forwards, with a wider range of attributes than their predecessors, are suddenly fashionable again as football moves into a new age of the striker.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Many supporters had dressed for the Lionesses’ return, wearingEnglandkits and holding flags.Cheers erupted at the Essex airport as the plane approached the runway and again as the team emerged from the airport to walk along a red carpet waving at fans.The team’s captain, Leah Williamson, led the squad out of the private terminal just before 5pm, carrying the trophy. Among the fans were the twins Poppy and Daisy Macdonald, 11, from Benfleet, Essex, who were holding a sign asking for a photo with the star striker Alessia Russo.Poppy said: “We’re so proud. They’ve won it two times in a row and they’ve worked so hard for it. They’ve had a lot of injuries and setbacks but they’ve done really well.”Daisy admitted she struggled to watch the penalty shootout. “I couldn’t watch, I was very nervous, but very happy that they won,” she said.The players attended a celebratory reception at Downing Street, hosted by the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the sports minister, Stephanie Peacock.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman, the England manager, holds the trophy outside No 10 after the win in Basel.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianNo 10 was decorated for the occasion, with St George’s flags draped over windows and bunting along the railings. Welcoming the team, Rayner called it a “historic day for English football, for women’s sport – and for the country”.“The Lionesses have brought it home again,” she said. “With grit, and with determination and skill, you roared. And I know I wasn’t the only one roaring with you.“You’ve made us all so, so, proud. Your performances have inspired the nation and lifted women’s football to new heights … Role models like you send such a powerful message. The Lionesses are a shining example of a talent and excitement of women’s football.“This win is a brilliant advert for the sport and will inspire thousands of girls to dream big,” she added. “The next generation of Lionesses are out there now – playing in schools, parks, and grassroots clubs.”“It was amazing. I just burst out crying just in pure emotion,” said one fan waiting outside the black gates in front of Downing Street. “Just that little girl inside of me watching football when I was younger and seeing how far the game has grown since then, it all just kind of got to me.”Another fan waiting to get a peek of the team had only just come back from Switzerland to watch the team romp to the final. Izzy said seeing the players arrive at Downing Street was an opportunity that could not be missed.“For me there wasn’t really a doubt that they were going to win, but it was still really stressful,” said the 30-year-old, who asked not to share her surname after calling in sick to work to celebrate the Lionesses’ victory.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson leaving the team’s hotel in Zurich while carrying the trophy on Monday.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAAs a former player herself, she travelled to London alone and is staying in the capital for Tuesday’s open-top bus tour.

Other team members, wearing their medals, smiled as they high-fived supporters waiting outside the building and signed autographs.The team will take part in an open-top bus procession along the Mall and a ceremony in front of Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.A trip to Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle may be on the cards for the winning squad in the autumn.

Luis Ortiz also is on non-disciplinary leave through 31 August.It was unclear if the cases were related in any way. The Guardians said in a statement that they “have been informed that no additional players or club personnel are expected to be impacted.”The 27-year-old Clase is 5-3 with 24 saves in 48 games this year, but he also has a career-high 3.23 ERA.

In fact, she has never played a minute for England at all. In fact, there was not the remotest possibility that she would play a minute for England at this tournament, and she knew this all along. Her entire Euros has consisted of training, travel and watching football from a hard bench. And yet at the moment of victory, nobody celebrates harder than England’s third goalkeeper.It’s Keating who is one of the first of the substitutes to reach the ecstatic huddle of white shirts on the pitch, Keating being hoisted aloft by the second-choice goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse, Keating doing a funky dance in front of the England fans, Keating beaming behind Leah Williamson and Keira Walshas the trophy is liftedamid a fanfare of ticker tape and smoke.‘Feeling loved’: how Wiegman turned Lionesses from also-rans to winnersRead moreThis is very clearly a triumph in which she feels just as invested and included as any other player, a triumph that isherstoo, as surely as if she had saved the match-winning penalty. And as the dust settleson Sunday’s epic final, perhaps this little snapshot of perfect unity gives an insight into just how England managed to triumph over the odds.“This team shows exactly what it’s like to be English,” Kelly said after the final on Sunday, riffing on a theme that many of her teammates have also taken up in recent weeks. And while the temptation is simply to nod along, surely it’s worth taking a moment to interrogate which part exactly Kelly was referring to. The winning? The close finish? The physicality? The fighting spirit? The calm under pressure? The togetherness? Would a nonchalant 5-1 victory with a late Spanish consolation goal still qualify?This notion of “proper England”, a phrase first deployed after the1-0 win against Spainin February and a recurring trope since, seems to vary depending on who you ask. “It’s that we give everything, we run ourselves into the ground,” Walsh said. For Alessia Russo it means “we’ll stick together”. For Lucy Bronze it means “if push comes to shove, we can win in any means possible”. For Sarina Wiegman, it means “passing with purpose”.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly (left) and Michelle Agyemang soak up the celebrations after the Lionesses’ final triumph.Photograph: Priscila Bütler/SPP/ShutterstockBut of course the Englishness Kelly and her colleagues are referring to here is not really a dictum, far less a tactical blueprint. “Proper England” can mean passing a team off the park or lumping long balls to a big No 9 (the “Hit ’Less” strategy employed against Sweden). Rather – and much like the fluid nature of nationality itself – it is an energy, an ethos, an unspoken creed, a pure vibe. Proper England is playing an entire tournamentwith a fractured tibia. Proper England is Jill Scott swearing at some German who probably had it coming.And of course the method of England’s victories at this tournament is very much of a piece with what we like to imagine as the classic English sporting triumph, from Kelly Holmes coming back from last place at the 2004 Olympics, to Jonny Wilkinson winning the World Cup with the final kick, to the pandemonium of the 2019 Cricket World Cup final. Victory is no prerequisite – there is also a solid place in the liturgy for the heroic failure of Derek Redmond and Frank Bruno. What matters is the intent, the full and undiluted commitment, the sporting equivalent of going “out out”.Lucy Bronze“Proper England” is just the latest attempt by an English sporting team to articulate just what, exactly, makes it English. Bazball, the dogma of the men’s cricket team, is fundamentally a marketing strategy, a doctrine of spellbinding nihilism wrapped up in nonsense slogans and daddy issues. Gareth Southgate’s concept of Englishness, meanwhile, was best expressed in his famousDear England essay of 2021, a patchwork quilt of competing influences that nobody really seemed to realise were competing at the time.So along with the idea of sport as a vessel for fairness, protest and social justice, Southgate also appeals to the traditions of “queen and country … military and service”. This is an England of humility and passive tolerance, a quietly conservative England in which every man swears to do his duty, as long as you don’t put too many noses out of joint. Protesting against racist abuse: fine. Protesting against a Qatar World Cup: oof, bit much.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The women’s team, by contrast, are a group far more engaged with the outside world, more urgently aware of the power of their platform, instinctively closer to progressive causes through their LGBTQ+ allyship. This matters, because even before their plane had touched down at Southend airport their triumph was being co-opted by people who believe the very opposite.For Exhibit A, study Monday’s Daily Mail, which juxtaposed a gleeful photo of Kelly and Michelle Agyemang with the more sombre headline “NOW SHUT MIGRANT PROTEST HOTEL”. Hannah Hampton’s declaration that “we’ve got English blood in us” was feverishly seized upon by Tommy Robinson and his acolytes as proof that the Lionesses are actually a sleeper ethnonationalist cell.0:51Lionesses greeted by jubilant England fans on return home after Euro 2025 victory – videoA columnist in the Spectator, meanwhile, paid begrudging tribute to England before promptly getting on to its main talking points: the taking of the knee, the “foolish and irrelevant” pursuit of equality with men’s football and – bingo cards at the ready! – the usual gratuitous swipes at Labour and trans people. And once you’ve stopped yawning, there is of course an ever-present danger that an achievement this spectacular and unifying will be celebrated by the wrong people for all the wrong reasons.Which is why it is the actions rather than the words of this team that speak to its nature. A team so evidently built on selflessness, individual sacrifice for the common good, inclusiveness and mutual support, hard work and manual labour, where an attack on one is an attack on all, where nobody is grander or more important than anyone else. A team drawn from every corner of the nation, just 4% of them privately educated, a group of women from which we can all learn a thing or two.

It inspires people. Young kids, but also you see so many more people that you inspire, not just little girls but little boys and grandads and grandmas, whole families, in England but also beyond.”A peak audience of 16.2 million watched England’s defeat of Spain in the Euro 2025 final on ITV and the BBC on Sunday and Wiegman took the time to praise supporters for their role, having travelled en masse and tuned in huge numbers.“I’m really looking forward to going back to England,” she said. “The fans have been amazing. I think we always have very good crowds and we never, ever take that for granted. If you look at this tournament, many English fans came to the stadiums and were always in the stands in huge overload.“It’s incredible that all these people took the effort to come and watch us in Switzerland but it’s also about the people at home, we’ve seen some things coming on the social media. It’s really nice to go back to England and come together there and celebrate.”England went through three consecutive spells of extra time in the knockout stage on the way to their second major tournament trophy, and Wiegman contrasted the chaos on the pitch with the tone they had set off it.“Three times going into extra time, that’s crazy,” she said. “I feel this tournament was crazy and chaotic on the pitch. I think off the pitch, everything was pretty calm. Also in the three games, we came from behind – we came from 1-0 or even 2-0 down – I think that shows the quality of the players. The team showed so much resilience but also belief, belief that we can turn things around and we can win by any means. That’s the words they used. That’s what we showed over and over again.”View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly scored the winning penalty for the Lionesses against Spain.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockOf her own reaction afterChloe Kelly’s winning penaltywent in, Wiegman said: “I think I just started running. I’d been screaming for three minutes. I just could not believe that we won it. When she went to take that penalty, it was her conviction again, she just loves these moments.”On Monday another hero of the final, the England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, paid tribute to her late grandfather, who died two days before the tournament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You believed in me before I even knew what this journey would look like. You were always there – watching, encouraging, teaching. You taught me so much, not just about football, but about life. About staying grounded, working hard, being resilient and doing things the right way. I miss our chats. I miss you saying, ‘Only us athletes understand’ – always with a little smirk like you were in on something special. And you were. You got it. You understood what this meant to me. You understood what it took.”Chloe KellyHampton saved two penalties, from the Ballon d’Or holder Aitana Bonmatí and Arsenal’s Champions League winner Mariona Caldentey, in the shootout at the end of the Euro 2025 final, and was named player of the match, her second of the tournament following her penalty heroics against Sweden.Hampton had “Grandpa” printed on the inside of her collar throughout the tournament. “It breaks my heart that you didn’t get to see me walk out for our country at my first major tournament … something you dreamed of for me, something we talked about so many times,” she said. “But I know, deep down, you were still there. I felt you with me. In the tunnel. On the pitch. In the tough moments. I heard you in my head when I needed strength. I hope I made you proud, Grandpa. I carried you through every minute. And I always will. I did it. WE DID IT.”Hampton was one of four England players to make Uefa’s team of the tournament, announced on Monday: Hampton and Lucy Bronze (England); Irene Paredes (Spain), Elena Linari (Italy), Franziska Kett (Germany); Patri Guijarro, Aitana Bonmatí and Alexia Putellas (all Spain); Jule Brand (Germany), Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly (England).Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Part of the Lionesses squad that defended their title from three years ago and became the first England side to win a major trophy abroad, she had been subjected to horrendous racial abuse from the start of the tournament.After thequarter-final shootout win against Swedenshe revealed she was taking a step back from social media because of the abuse, saying: “While I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I don’t agree or think it’s OK to target someone’s appearance or race.”‘Feeling loved’: how Wiegman turned Lionesses from also-rans to winnersRead moreThe Gotham FC defender, who played for Chelsea between 2018 and 2024, was then left out of the starting XI for thesemi-final victory against Italy, only to return and produce her best performance of the tournament in the final against Spain, whichEngland won on penalties.After the game Carter spoke about the toughness required to deal with the Spain attack. “My previous manager at grassroots turned princesses into bulldozers,” she said. “Not many of these girls get to see that princess side of me, but obviously my friends in Fran [Kirby] and Beth [England] do.“That’s what I tried to deliver today. I knew Spain were going to be hard to beat and I had to be on top form if we were going to come out with the chance of winning.”The most heartwarming sight, however, was the joy she was clearly feeling after putting a difficult two weeks behind her to be part of a rearguard that conceded only once against the world champions as the game ended 1-1 after extra time. Asked about having a giggle with the head coach, Sarina Wiegman, after the game she said: “That is normally me. Throughout this tournament I’ve not felt that. I’ve been really quite sad and disappointed at the fact that I’ve not been the relaxed Jess I know.“I’m someone that is ‘what will be will be’. We go out there, give our all, and either it’ll be enough or it won’t. That’s not how I’ve played this tournament until I got to this final where I thought: ‘I’m going to give it my all.’ If we lose, we lose, and if we win, great. In extra time Sarina was giving me a lot of information and we realised she just said a lot of words, and it was cool, like, we got this, and she’s been great.”View image in fullscreenJess Carter (right) and Hannah Hampton shut out Esther González as she bears down on goal.Photograph: Pedro Porru/SheKicks/SPP/ShutterstockEsme Morgan was the player who came in for Carter for the semi-final and the fact that she was superb against Italy shows the strength in depth in the Lionesses’ squad. There is, however, another aspect to this with the two centre-backs having enormous respect for each other. Carter, in fact, was surprised when she found out from Wiegman that she was starting against Spain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t shout loud enough for Esme. She’s been an incredible team player, she was incredible when she came on the pitch. Every role she’s been given, she was outstanding. So to have that faith from Sarina to put me back in the squad and that she believed that I could help this team to a trophy was amazing. It gave me a lot of confidence going into this game.”But even elite players have nerves and Carter admitted to ITV that she had felt fear before the start of the final. “I was super scared to play today for the first time in my life, but when I woke up and I saw my team, and the support I had and the belief I had from my teammates, my family and my manager, I knew I could just come out and give it my all. That’s all you can do.”Carter did just that against Esther González, Mariona Caldentey, Athenea del Castillo and all the other Spanish attackers – and it was enough to win a second European Championship. At the final whistle there was only happiness, not sadness – a wonderful ending to a tough month.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballWomen’s Euro 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Lucy Bronze celebrated on the pitch amid the glitter with her young nephews while Beth Mead hugged her partner, the Netherlands and Manchester City forward Vivianne Miedema, in the stands.The families and friends then travelled to the Dolder Grand hotel – the Lionesses’ luxurious base overlooking the city of Zurich as well as Lake Zurich and the distant Alps – and were ready to greet the team when their coach arrived. The players, all wearing deliberately back-to-front England shirts emblazoned with “Champions, 25”, arrived at the party to the sound of the London-born singer Small’s debut solo single from 2000, Proud, a song that had been played repeatedly throughout the Lionesses’ run to the final.In a moment that is now becoming something of a tradition for the team at such Lionesses parties, the captain, Leah Williamson, and Wiegman are understood to have cut a cake in celebration. Before long, all present were singing along to some of the team’s favourite celebratory tunes such as Gala’s Freed From Desire – which burst into popularity with football fans in 2016 at the men’s European Championship in France – as well as Sweet Caroline and, several hours later, Bedingfield’s Unwritten.View image in fullscreenElla Toone (left) and Alessia Russo of England pose for a ticker-tape filled portrait with the Women’s Euro 2025 trophy.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Uefa/Getty ImagesThere was also an impressive rendition of Ike & Tina Turner’s River Deep, Mountain High, performed with a microphone by the England midfielder Ella Toone. A 1996 version of that same song by Céline Dion had become popular with the Lionesses after their wins at Euro 2022 on home soil, most memorably being sung by Rachel Daly on stage in Trafalgar Square at the team’s public celebratory event the day after their victory against Germany that year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The nomination process for honours is managed by the Cabinet Office, with Kelly and Hampton regarded as shoo-ins for the way they have thrilled a nation who have been glued to the Euros for much of the summer, with tens of millions of people watching on BBC and ITV.Kelly was even more pivotal to England’s triumph in Switzerland. The 27-year-old came off the bench again to change the game in Sunday’s final against Spain by providing the cross for Alessia Russo’s equaliser and then scoring the decisive penalty in the shootout.

The 28-year-old missed the 2023 World Cup after sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury three months before the tournament.Wiegman was awarded an honorary CBE after England’s first European Championship win – she is a Dutch citizen – which is now expected to be upgraded to an honorary damehood. The 55-year-old has two years left on her contract with the FA with no immediate plans to discuss an extension as she has already committed to leading England to the 2027 World Cup in Brazil.The FA’s president, the Prince of Wales, took part in the medal presentation ceremony in Basel and King Charles thanked the team for their “awesome” achievement.

England’s role in hosting that tournament is likely to have attracted more casual viewers, so the overall trajectory of interest in women’s football remains one of significant growth.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Morecambe Football Club will also be removed from the National League Cup for the forthcoming season.”The committee will meet again on 20 August to consider whether Morecambe have satisfied its financial concerns and “to decide the club’s ability to retain membership in the competition”. That meeting is scheduled for after what would have been Morecambe’s opening three games of the new season.Whittingham’s Bond Group Investments have been involved in a contentious takeover saga over the past two years that has led to the resignation of Morecambe’s board of directors, seen wages paid late and prospective owners, Panjab Warriors, threaten legal action. Panjab Warriors received EFL clearance to complete a takeover last month only for Whittingham to announce that a new buyer had come forward.Whittingham issued a long-awaited statement on the takeover on Sunday in which he claimed his company “has continued to work with the consortium led by Jonny Cato in their efforts to acquire the majority shareholding” in Morecambe. He blamed negative media reports for giving the consortium “cause for concern and pause” and claimed the Bond Group had been unable to contact Panjab Warriors over the past week.Morecambe were relegated from the EFL last season after 18 years. Lizzi Collinge, the Labour MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said recently there was a “very real risk” that the club would soon cease to exist.Explore more on these topicsMorecambeBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

He suggests a change to the ratio of duty to Levy, combined with an extension of the Levy to bets on overseas racing, would improve significantly the proportion of overall betting turnover that is returned to the sport.View image in fullscreenThe Labour MP for Halesowen, Alex Ballinger, provided a foreword to the report by the Social Market Foundation.Photograph: PetaPix/AlamyThe SMF report notes that Martin Cruddace, the chief executive of the major racecourse group Arena Racing Company, recently proposed an inversion of the rates charged for Levy and betting duty, but suggests that this “does not go far enough” to address “systemic underfunding”. It proposes that a reduction to 5% of gross profits for racing bets alone, alongside an increase to 20% for the Levy, “would ensure fiscal neutrality for the betting industry, while fundamentally reorienting the distribution of revenue in favour of the sport”.Johnson was among several representatives of racing’s key stakeholder groups who met Noyes last week to discuss the SMF proposals, and said on Monday that the report is “a sensible and informed piece of work that could be a route for the government to resolve the issues that have beset the sport in recent years and which are affecting our ability to compete with other jurisdictions”.He added: “Whilst our immediate priority has been to ensure that the Treasury does not inflict a significant blow on racing via tax harmonisation, we are aware that success here does not resolve the challenges faced by the sport at present, or undo some of the damage inflicted in recent years.Quick GuideBHA announce start date for new chairShowThe British Horseracing Authority said on Monday that Lord Allen of Kensington will take up his new role as chair of the organisation on 1 September, after the Labour peer won his first major battle in the world of racing politics and persuaded the  BHA board to back his plans for a fully independent board of directors.Allen was  announced as BHA chair in November 2024 with a start date of 2 June, but his arrival as the head of racing’s ruling body was postponed in May to allow him to “continue meeting stakeholders to better inform his vision for the sport”.The board  comprises an independent chair, four independent directors and four member-nominated directors, two from racecourses and two to represent the sport’s participants, including owners, trainers, jockeys and stable staff.Allen is believed to have insisted on an end to the member-nominated directors before agreeing to take up his new role, having concluded that the presence of sectional interests at the top of the organisation was a potential barrier to progress and innovation.Following a meeting of the board on Monday, there was agreement that the BHA would start working towards an independent board of directors, allowing Allen to take up his new role in a few weeks’ time.“I am delighted we have agreed to a process towards a new independent BHA board,” Allen said in a statement on Monday, “and I look forward to formally starting in September. Horse racing has a strong future. There is work to do, but I am in no doubt as to the passion and commitment of the many thousands of people who make up our industry.”Greg WoodWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The SMF proposes a tax solution that is mindful of the very different social and economic aspects of different types of gambling, and which seeks to support a sport that means a great deal to the British public.”In his foreword to the SMF report, Ballinger, the Labour member for Halesowen, said that “as the Treasury considers changes [to the tax regime around gambling], it is vital that they reflect the real impact of gambling on people’s lives”, and describes its “practical” proposals as “smart, fair ideas that deserve serious attention”.Ballinger said: “The evidence is clear: some gambling products – like online slots – cause far more harm than others”, adding: “These harms carry huge costs, from personal debt and family breakdown to rising pressure on public services. Our tax system should reflect this.”The British Horseracing Authority released research on Monday which suggests that tax harmonisation at a rate of 21% could lead to an industry-wide revenue loss of “at least £330m in the first five years” and put “2,752 jobs at risk in the first year alone”. The BHA has also launchedan online petitionwhich calls on the government to “rethink” its plans on gambling taxation.The Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), the main body representing the gambling industry in the UK, said on Monday that arguments for a hike in gaming taxes were “naive”.“Some naively argue that tax increases should target gaming while sparing sports betting or carving out horse racing,” a BGC spokesperson said.“But the reality is our members don’t ringfence products in that way, these are integrated businesses. Any tax rise, whether on betting or gaming, affects the whole operation. That means less money available for sponsorship, media rights and support for sports like racing, which is especially vulnerable to changes in the customer offer.”Sun can shine for MenuisierThe Goodwood Cup is the feature event on the opening afternoon of Glorious Goodwood on Tuesday, when the locally trainedSunway(3.05) could prove to be a decent each-way alternative to Aidan O’Brien’s Illinois, the runner-up in last year’s St Leger, in the two-mile Group One contest.Illinois has progressed steadily since his near-miss in the Doncaster Classic and put up a career-best to finish a seven-length runner-up behindTrawlerman in the Gold Cup at Ascotlast time.He is also Ryan Moore’s pick for Tuesday’s race ahead of his three-year-old stable companion, Scandinavia, but he looked a little ill-at-ease on the undulations at Chester in May and does not have as much to spare on ratings as an early price of around 6-4 might suggest.Scandinavia, meanwhile, will be making his third start at a staying trip in the space of six weeks, and at around 14-1, Sunway makes plenty of appeal to spring a surprise.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowGoodwood1.20 Tony Montana (nap) 1.55 Zavateri 2.30 Kinross 3.05 Sunway  3.45 Dream Composer (nb) 4.20 Naval Light 4.55 Dash Of Azure 5.30 Cinque VerdeBeverley2.10 Blue Yonder 2.45 Rosso Levanto 3.20 Jeddaal 4.00 Haberdash 4.35 Believe In Glory 5.10 Catch Cunningham 5.47 Mayberry MoonFfos Las5.42 Neptune Legend 6.15 Shetakesthegold 6.50 Sundiata Keita 7.25 Zilfee 8.00 Fifty Sent 8.30 ZooksRipon6.00 Al Shaham 6.30 A’Ali G 7.05 Silver Chamber 7.40 Canaria Queen 8.10 Ferrari Gold 8.40 HomelandWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.David Menuisier’s colt has not raced beyond 12 furlongs since finishing just a length and a half behind Illinois in the St Leger, and remains unexposed at staying trips.He was also less than a length behind Los Angeles in last year’s Irish Derby during a run of five straight starts at Group One level, and a sharp two miles around Goodwood could be the ideal track and trip for Sunway to register a first success at the highest level since his juvenile campaign.Goodwood 1.20:Tony Montanadid not appreciate the drop back to a mile for the Royal Hunt Cup last month and is better judged on his two-length second behind an unexposed rival over track and trip in May.

Nine clubs voted in favour of that proposal on Monday afternoon; the Guardian understands that Hull FC and Hull KR voted against the idea, while Wigan Warriors abstained from voting.However, the next steps towards expansion are complicated and epitomise the chaos that continues to engulf the sport’s boardrooms following Wood’s controversial return to power.Twelve of the 14 teams that play in Super League next year will be determined bythe IMG gradings systemwhich was introduced last year. That measures clubs in a variety of on- and off‑field metrics, giving them a score out of 20. The 12 clubs which rank the highest in October will be automatically assured of a spot in Super League in 2026.The expectation as things stand would be that the Championship side Toulouse would replace Salford in the top 12. But that will not be the only change, as two more clubs will essentially be handpicked by an independent panel, based on a selection of criteria that is yet to be finalised.That panel will be led by the RFL board member Lord Jonathan Caine but will also include members of Wood’s strategic review committee. Wood was, up until earlier this year, the chair of another side that will now be strong favourites to return to Super League, Bradford Bulls.They are not the only ones who will be hopeful of promotion through this unique and somewhat peculiar method. The Championship leaders York Knights are confident they have a compelling case to become a Super League side for the first time, while London, who would have missed out under the gradings system, now have an increased chance due to support in the boardrooms at certain clubs for the Broncos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Super League is keen to position itself in as strong a position as possible ahead of a new broadcast cycle beginning in 2027.Supporters of the move believe a more simplistic fixture list, with the elimination of loop fixtures where some teams play each other three times, will appeal to all stakeholders. There were also concerns in some quarters about having two French sides, Toulouse and Catalans, in a 12-team competition, which would limit revenue streams.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Vollering also crashed in the Femmes last year, again injuring her back, when leading the race overall.Despite her injuries, she was able to warm down on her bike and ride to the team’s nearby hotel. Her general manager, Stephen Delcourt, appeared to blame others in the peloton, saying: “It’s not normal, the attitude of many teams and many riders. They’re disrespectful. We lose the respect in the last years in men’s and women’s cycling.”Vollering, he said, was “in pain, in her knee, her glutes and her back”. The Dutch rider has also been critical of the attitude of her peers, particularly after her damaging crash in 2024. After Tadej Pogacarcrashed in Toulouseduring the recent men’s race, she posted: “So kind of the bunch not to use this crash to take time on Pogacar. Guess men are a bit more kind.”Delcourt said: “When you crash at this speed, it’s never easy. She’s completely shocked. We need to wait, because we never know if it’s just the shock of the crash, but she will be examined by the team doctor. She’s really positive, she wants to continue, but we need time.”View image in fullscreenLorena Wiebes is known for her sprinting prowess and stayed clear of Marianne Vos to take stage three in Angers.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesMarianne Vos, who took back the overall race lead 48 hoursafter winning the first stage to Plumelec, said: “It’s the Tour de France and everybody wants to be in the front. It was pretty chaotic, especially coming into the city on a descent with high speed. It’s not really about respect, but everybody is fighting for every centimetre and unfortunately things can happen. Of course, it’s the riders fighting for position that makes it dangerous, but it’s not about respect.”The crash, 3.6km from the finish on a wide left-hand bend, was inside the 5km “safe zone”, negating any time losses on the general classification. Already the racing has taken its toll and while the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma, has safely navigated the first three stages, plenty of others, including Vollering, have suffered.Marlen Reusser, winner this year of the Tour of Switzerland, abandoned the race on stage one, while Elisa Longo Borghini, the Giro d’Italia winner, quit before the start of stage three. For Kristen Faulkner, the Olympic road race champion, the opening stages have been a baptism of fire. On stage two the American was caught up in a crash and only just made the daily time cut, although she finished safely in the main peloton in Angers.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingTour de FrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Two gold medals.Summer McIntosh is off to a perfect start at the swimming world championships in her attempt to win five individual gold medals, a feat only achieved by American legend Michael Phelps.The 18-year-old Canadian took the 200-meter individual medley on Monday, clocking 2:06.69. The victory matched the gold she won Sunday in the 400 freestyle. Alex Walsh of the United States claimed the silver in 2:08.58 with bronze going to Mary-Sophie Harvey of Canada in 2:09.15.The winning time trailed McIntosh’s world record of 2:05.70. And she was not content.US swimmers battling outbreak of ‘acute gastroenteritis’ at world championshipsRead more“Going in tonight, my goal was to get my hand on the wall first,” McIntosh said. “So to get that done is good. I’m not super happy with my time. But honestly, at a world championships, my goal is just to go as fast as I can against my competitors. Still happy with the gold and hoping to keep up my streak next time.”Yu Zidi, a Chinese 12-year-old, finished fourth in 2:09.21, just missing a medal as she astounds the swim world with her times. She is also due to compete in the 400 IM and 200 butterfly, probably her strongest events.McIntosh will chase three more golds in the 400 IM, 800 free and the 200 butterfly over the next six days in Singapore.Gretchen Walsh broke through on Monday with the first gold in Singapore for the United States, taking the 100 butterfly in 54.73.The silver medalist a year ago in Paris, Walsh was just off her world-record time of 54.60 set earlier this year. Roos Vanotterdijk of Belgium took silver in 55.84 and Alexandria Perkins of Australia claimed bronze in 56.33.Walsh acknowledged in a post-race interview at poolside that the American team had been hit with a bout of what team officials called “acute gastroenteritis.”It was picked up at a training camp in Thailand prior to arrival in Singapore. U.S. officials have confirmed the outbreak but have given few details and did not name swimmer nor say how many were affected.“With the illness that’s been going on – I faced it back the last couple days – my body has just been fragile, and I think that I’ve needed to give myself grace,” Walsh said. “Luckily, I had the morning to recover and rest, and I used that, and that helped me enormously going into tonight, so I tried to make the most of it.“It was not easy, and I’m just really proud of myself,” Walsh added, thrilled to be under 55 seconds. “It took a lot of guts. I just wanted to go out there and do it for my team, just represent the flag well. It came out of somewhere, but I’m really, really happy.”Walsh’s older sister Alex was almost even with McIntosh after 150 meters, swimming a strong breaststroke leg to make it a race.“I was really excited on the breaststroke leg,” she said. “I could see her and I knew I was kind of gaining on her because breaststroke is my best stroke. I was really excited and, obviously coming home on the freestyle, that’s definitely where my biggest weakness (is).”Summer McIntosh v Katie Ledecky: a generational duel set to define the world championshipsRead moreTwo other finals wrapped up Monday’s schedule.Qin Haiyang, the world champion in 2023, defeated Paris Olympic winner Nicolo Martinenghi of Italy in the 100 breaststroke.

Denis Petrashov of Kyrgyzstan took bronze in 58.88.“I’ve been injured and it’s not been easy to get back to my best,” Haiyang said. “I’m at best at 70%. I’m probably lucky. This definitely helps with my confidence.”In the men’s 50 butterfly, Maxime Grousset of France edged Noe Ponti of Switzerland. Grousset clocked 22.48 with Ponti finishing in 22.51. Thomas Ceccon of Italy took bronze in 22.67.In the four semi-finals, Paris Olympics bronze medalist Luke Hobson of the United States led 200 free qualifying (1:44.80), with Paris champion David Popovici of Romania in fourth (1:45.02).Hubert Kós of Hungary headed a very fast men’s 100 backstroke in 52.21. American Regan Smith led the women’s 100 backstroke (58.21) ahead of two-time Australian Olympic champion Kaylee McKeown (58.44).Kate Douglass of the United States swam a personal best in the 100 breaststroke (1:05.49) and will be the top seed in Tuesday’s final.Explore more on these topicsSwimmingOlympic GamesnewsShareReuse this content"

You cannot have a pop at Stokes for his frustration. Very easy to have a pop at him when you’re sitting in your lounge watching. You’re NOT in the battle. Leave the men in the ring to be emotional.”Pietersen’s comments came after much criticism of Stokes from various quarters. The former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar said Stokes had behaved “like a spoiled kid”. Ravichandran Ashwin, who played 106 Tests for India before he retired last December, called Stokes’s behaviour “scandalous” and “criminal”.Ashwinsaid on his YouTube channel: “You’re questioning the Indian batters about chasing a milestone? They saved the match by batting through two days. They played your bowlers all day, batted you out and suddenly when they’re nearing hundreds, you want to walk off? If I were India captain, I’d have played the entire 15 overs and made them bowl.”The Indian commentator Harsha Bhoglesaid: “I was disappointed by what I saw. It just didn’t look good, what Harry Brook did at the end. I’m sure when he looks back at what he did he’ll realise there was just a hint of petulance. He’s far too good a player to get a reputation as someone who’s petulant.”Quick GuideEngland v India: squads for the fifth and final TestShowEnglandBen Stokes (capt), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook, Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Josh Tongue, Chris WoakesIndiaShubman Gill (capt), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel, Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Kuldeep Yadav, Anshul Kamboj, Arshdeep Singh, Narayan JagadeesanEngland lead the series 2-1First Test, HeadingleyEngland won by five wicketsSecond Test, EdgbastonIndia won by 336 runsThird Test, Lord'sEngland won by 22 runsFourth Test, Emirates Old TraffordMatch drawnFifth Test, The Kia OvalTakes place 31 July-4 AugWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Comment pieces in major Australian media outlets carried headlines such as: “Spare us the whingeing, England, the only thing embarrassing about Old Trafford was your tantrum”, and: “Moral hypocrites England decide tons are anti-cricket”. The West Australian newspaper called the incident an “English dummy spit”.Daniel Brettig wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald: “Increasingly the balance of world opinion favours an Indian win in the final game. Why? Because the posturing that accompanied England’s Bazball revolution has got to the point that even some among their countrymen are beginning to tire of it all … England looked churlish, bad-tempered and even a little brittle. Happy and jovial when things go their way, but sulky and childish when they don’t.”The former Australia coach Justin Langer said he thought Stokes would have made the same decision as the India captain, Shubman Gill. “India were wanting to keep two of their players in to score a Test century and keep England in the dirt for another half hour, knowing there’s another match in a few days’ time,” Langer wrote for the Nightly. “I imagine if it wereBen Stokeswhose young teammates had the chance to score a Test hundred he would have done the exact same thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the time, the then US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said the funding would ensure the country had a “steady stream” of chips essential to AI and national security.In a post on X on Monday, Musk said Samsung had agreed to allowTeslato “assist in maximising manufacturing efficiency” and he would “walk the [manufacturing] line personally to accelerate the pace of progress”.He added that the Samsung plant in Taylor, outside Austin,Texas, was “conveniently located not far from my house”.The deal will help re-energise a project that faced long delays amid Samsung’s difficulties in retaining and attracting big clients. Ryu Young-ho, a senior analyst at Seoul-based NH Investment & Securities, said the Taylor plant “so far had virtually no customers”, making the deal “quite meaningful”.Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at Forrester, a global research and advisory firm, said it was a “good deal for both companies”.He added: “Samsung gets a customer for their semiconductor business and in a US facility that has plenty of capacity. Tesla gets a partner that has the capacity to produce their chips in the US that minimises their supply chain complexity.”In October, Reuters reported that Samsung had postponed taking deliveries of chipmaking equipment fromASML, a Dutch manufacturer, for the Texas site as it had not yet won any significant customers for the project.

At least, not in cinemas. However, for the first time in Bond history, the world will meet a newJames Bondin a video game, before a new 007 makes their debut on film.As developed by Danish studio IO Interactive for next year’s 007 First Light, the new Bond is blandly handsome in a doll-like way. He is fresh-faced, with blue eyes that appear more cocksure than piercing, in contrast to the refined older Bond of most films or Craig’s ruggedness – although he is clearly inspired by Craig’s man-of-action approach. The implication is not that this Bond will eschew these traits but acquire them. First Light is an origin story intended to define one of the most durable protagonists in entertainment for a new generation of game-literate fans.“The way we went about it was to start with the origin. Because then we get to play with questions such as, ‘Who is James Bond the young man, and what does it mean to be a 00 Agent?’” says IO Interactive co-owner and First Light creative director Christian Elverdam. “What does it mean to become 007?”Most James Bond video games to date have been shooters, in the mould of 1997’s wildly popular Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007. Despite the continued success of the first-person shooter genre that GoldenEye helped popularise, subsequent 007 games saw diminishing returns. The tepid reviews and poor sales of 2012’s 007 Legends put Bond’s video-game career on hiatus, until IO approached Eon Productions with a deceptively straightforward pitch: a game that is less about shooting things and more about recreating the experience of a Bond film.“There are great shootouts in the movies – but, if you think about it, it’s not that many, right?” says Elverdam. Correcting this discrepancy between the movies and games became “the nucleus” of IO’s pitch to Eon: to do Bond right in a video game, Elverdam says, meant letting players inhabit a character who is “not always shooting”.This was an easy case for IO to make, because it had done it before. Between 2016 and 2021, the studio released an impressive three-part reboot ofHitman, its series about an elite contract killer. With an admirable lack of self-consciousness, IO kept what worked about older Hitman games (prioritising elegant planning and problem-solving over wanton violence) and jettisoned what didn’t (a sometimes lurid tone and confounding story). The result was remarkable: a series of endlessly replayable puzzles whose solutions involved the untimely deaths of the worst of the global elite with little collateral damage and allowed the assassin to escape entirely unnoticed. Satirical, witty and clever, Hitman: World of Assassination was a compelling calling card for IO to leave in Eon’s hands.“All this stuff [in Hitman] feels like spycraft already,” Elverdam says, “So if we take that, and we take some leaps” – these leaps being the things a Bond game ought to include, such as driving, fisticuffs and, yes, shootouts – “that becomes the pitch for what would eventually be First Light.”View image in fullscreen‘Not always shooting’ … Bond takes to the road in 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveThe title is apt, as this game is the first glimmer of promising news for an entertainment property in a precarious position. Initially announced asProject 007in November 2020, the game has survived a tumultuous period for Bond, which began withthe $8.45bn (£6.3bn) mergerof the character’s studio home MGM with the e-commerce giant Amazon in March 2022. While the newly christened Amazon MGM would control the lucrative existing Bond catalog, the idea was that creative decisions on future films – including who would play the MI6 agent – would remain with Eon, with producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson steering the family business.Then, this February, Broccoli and Wilsonhanded creative control over to Amazonin an undisclosed but allegedly massive deal that ended the Broccoli family’s 63-year tenure as the stewards of James Bond’s cinematic exploits. In the months since, Amazon has begun to announce its plans, and selectedDenis Villeneuve to direct the next film. But everyone with a passing or professional interest in Bond is still waiting with bated breath fora casting decision, and what it may mean for one of the most lucrative film franchises in the world.With the next cinematic Bond in limbo, however, a new video game Bond can make a stronger impression. The firsttrailer for 007 First Lightisn’t terribly specific but it exudes confidence. It’s a montage affirming that everything fans love about 007 will be present. The death traps and gadgets from the Roger Moore era are there, as is the muscular physicality of Craig’s Bond, and the devil-may-care attitude consistent across all onscreen depictions of the character.View image in fullscreenEverything fans love about the series will be present.Photograph: IO Interactive“If you want to really do this with high ambition, you have to look at the different Bond instalments and figure out what each of them tried to do, and then let that inform your own take,” Elverdam says.While the creative director of First Light has much to say about 007 in general, he is not quite ready to talk specifics in relation to his version. The name of the voice actor playing Bond, for example, remains classified. But Elverdam is aware that, for all Bond’s enduring popularity, he is not a character who can just be dropped thoughtlessly into the modern world.“Every Bond is a Bond of their time, no matter how intentional you are. It’s unavoidable,” he says. “There is a zeitgeist in what you perceive as a threat, what you perceive as aspirational qualities – all that changes over time.” Elverdam rattles off some questions that IO’s version of Bond will consequently contemplate: when do you do your duty? When do you improvise? What does it mean to serve King and Country? Why do it in the first place?If Elverdam and IO are clever enough in answering these questions, they may give the next film-star Bond a run for his money.Explore more on these topicsGamesJames BondfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two rounds of golf at his very own course in Turnberry.On the SaturdayDonald Trumphad broken the record with a round of just 18. A hole in one at every hole. Largely because there had been men stationed about the course to pick up the ball and place it in the hole. Then on the Sunday he had gone one better. A round of 17. The ball had gone straight into the cup at the fourth hole, had rested there for a couple of seconds and then had flown out, soaring over the links and straight into the hole at the fifth. Scottie Scheffler could only dream of such a shot.So The Donald was in an expansive mood as he waited forKeir Starmerand his wife, Victoria, to pay him a visit on Monday morning. Which was more than could be said for the small contingent of the British press who had been sent to the South Ayrshire golf course to cover the meeting.On the table of the games room in which they had been penned, there were plates of sandwiches and biscuits. Just not for them. They were only for the US press corps. The Brits had to bring a packed lunch. Clearly, the special relationship still has a way to go.Keir and Victoria arrived at the main entrance, where Trump was waiting to greet them, along with a bagpiper who drowned out the first couple of minutes of conversation. The Donald went into overdrive. His mum was Scottish, he said several times, as if reminding himself. His attention then turned to Victoria. She was a respected person all over the US. “I don’t want to get myself into trouble,” he added, “but she’s very, she’s a great woman.”Victoria looked a little creeped out. Her husband might be a master Trump-wrangler, an expert at sycophancy and genuflection, but she wasn’t. She knew that almost no one in the US had heard of her and that’s the way she liked it. So she just tried to suck it up. She longed to get inside, away from the cameras.The Donald had other ideas, taking question after question from the gaggle of reporters gathered for the arrival. The US president is like a radio presenter on the graveyard night-time slot. Uncomfortable with silence. Filling the dead air with a long rambling stream of unconsciousness. Saying the first thing that comes into his head. Needy – greedy – for any attention he can get. No longer just the most important person in his own life but the most important person on the planet. Life doesn’t get any better than this for the supreme narcissist: he speaks and people have to suck it up and listen.Europe was in a bad place. Almost unrecognisable from the Europe of 10 years ago. Too many foreigners. He didn’t know anything about the small boat crossings, he admitted, but he was still sure they were all rapists and murderers. At this point, Starmer interrupted to say that he was very, very tough on irregular migration. Not that anyone was listening.The Donald hardly drew breath. Yes,he did think people were starving in Gaza and Israel would have to allow more aid in. He seemed to want thanks for sending food, rather than seeing it as a legal and moral obligation. Putin had disappointed him. He was going to have to rethink his 50 days. And it was time to acknowledge the six wars he had stopped. Almost one a month. There was Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Rwanda and the DRC. He couldn’t remember the others. It sounded as if he was nominating himself for the Nobel peace prize.0:54Trump gives Russia ‘10 or 12’ days to move on Ukraine peace deal – videoAn hour later, Trump and Starmer were gathered in the modestly named Donald J Trump Ballroom for the press conference proper. It was billed as a double act but everyone knew it wasn’t going to be that way. Keir was there purely as The Donald’s plus one. This was to be The Donald Show, with just the occasional interruption from Starmer to allow the president to draw breath. A series of rambling, self-congratulatory monologues in which we actually learned very little.We started by going over familiar territory that had already been covered in the 10-minute impromptu press conference earlier. Yes, Gaza was bad. Very bad, Keir added. So much so that he had upgraded it from “appalling but no need to do anything” to “appalling and something needs to be done”.Trump ignored him. Hamas was bad. He had always said so. Israel must do something. He didn’t say what. As for Putin, he would give him 10-12 days. This was said impulsively, on the spur of the moment, rather than as a considered news event.Then an acknowledgment to the British prime minister. He had negotiated a very good trade deal. Though it’s still not entirely clear Agent Orange understands that it’s US consumers who will pay the tariffs. Moving on. He had also just negotiatedthe bigliest deal in the history of the world with the EU. Starmer had just been put on notice that the UK wasn’t as important as all that. The Donald had been doing us a favour all along.The questions came from all quarters. Anything goes. Windfarms? Hate them. Ugly and expensive. What’s wrong with oil? Here, Keir tried to stand up for himself. “Actually, we like them as part of a mixed energy portfolio. Along with oil.” The Donald didn’t seem convinced and started slagging off the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. “He’s a friend of mine,” squeaked Starmer. Trump wasn’t bothered. Speak to the hand. Talking of people he didn’t like, he moved on to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Jeffrey Epstein. “I’m not a drawing kind of guy,” he said.By now, time was beginning to seriously drag. Almost 70 minutes in and no sign of an ending. The Donald moved on to how he had spent £100m on expensive plywood while renovating the golf club. The Scottish tradesmen must have seen him coming. It looks like Trump has been stiffed. So much for the art of the deal.Keir was just willing the presser to come to an end so that the talks and his confused embarrassment could be kept private. Eventually he got his wish.Trump looked as if he could have gone on for another hour and a half. Still, good to get away to his other golf course in Aberdeen. Maybe he’d complete a round in 16 there.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

But even this doesn’t buy an end to the transatlantic trade warPaul TaylorThe US president humiliated Ursula von der Leyen at his Scottish resort – but she still has no certainty on tariffsMon 28 Jul 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 11.09 EDTShareSurrender is always one way to end a war. Thecapitulation of the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to Donald Trump’s demands for a grossly lopsided trade deal in which most EU goods exported to the US will face far higher tariffs than US products face in the EU is not only humiliating; it also does not prevent a transatlantic trade war.Indeed, to paraphrase the Prussian military thinker Carl von Clausewitz, it is merely the pursuit of a trade warby other means. After six months of bullying by Trump, the Europeans have acquiesced to a provisional settlement that penalises their exporters and commits the world’s largest trade bloc to buying hundreds of billions of dollars of US fossil fuels and weapons for the duration of his presidency, rather than risk the blanket 30% tariffs he had threatened from 1 August.This was far from the zero-for-zero tariff deal that the European Commission pitched at the start of the talks. The 15% across-the-board tariff von der Leyen ended up accepting was worse than the 10% rate – similar to theUK’s deal– that Brussels officials thought they had secured only two weeks ago.The deal marks Trump’s second humiliation of his European partners in two months, following a Nato summit at which alliesyielded to his demandsthat they spend 5% of their economic output on defence, with 3.5% on core military expenditure. Both were marked byundignified fawningby European officials to the US president’s outsized ego, and by their unwillingness to challenge or correct even his most blatant falsehoods during excruciating joint media appearances.The commission president declared that the deal creates “certainty in uncertain times” and delivers stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the world’s biggest trading relationship, worth $1.7tn. Yet even that claim seems doubtful, since uncertainty remains around the status of pharmaceuticals, which she insisted were covered by the 15% tariff but Trump said would not be part of the deal.Von der Leyen’s statement that this was “the second building block, reaffirming the transatlantic partnership” put a brave face on the fact that it was the second time Trump had wielded threats and bluster to extort protection money from timorous European countries desperate to avoid a complete US disengagement in the face of Russia’s threat to the continent.Yet aside from the disadvantages that European manufacturers now face in the EU’s biggest export market, it is not clear that the deal will buy an end to transatlantic trade friction, or make Trump take a tougher stance against Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine.Sunday’s meeting at Trump’s golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, was a display of raw power. As one wag described it, the commission chief’s posture should henceforth be known as “von der Lying Down”.The optics could hardly have been more humiliating for the representative of 450 million Europeans. Von der Leyen had to fly to Scotland and wait until the president and his son had finished their round of golf, then endure his boasts about the magnificence of the gilded Donald J Trump ballroom in which they met.She sat in silence as Trump claimed thatonly the USwas providing emergency food assistance to starving Palestinians in Gaza, although the EU is the one of the biggest providers of humanitarian aid. She did not challenge his narrative on Israel’s months-long prevention of UN food deliveries to displaced people in the war-ravaged region.Worse, she felt obliged to parrot Trump’s narrative that EU-US trade was unbalanced and that the objective of the negotiation was to “rebalance” the relationship, without referencing the largeUS surplus in services tradewith Europe. Neither leader mentioned the EU’s digital regulations, which remain a potential landmine in transatlantic relations that could blow up within weeks if the commission slaps fines on US tech giants judged to havebreached the Digital Markets Act.Far from bringing peace in our time, Sunday’s deal leaves some crucial loose ends that have yet to be worked out, including which tariffs on agriculture the EU drops and whether alcoholic drinks are exempted from tariffs. On steel and aluminium, Trump insisted the 50% US tariff would continue to apply globally, whereas von der Leyen said the two sides would revert to historical quotas at lower tariffs.EU-US tariffs: five key takeaways from the trade dealRead moreThis was at most a damage-limitation exercise to avoid a bigger immediate hit to European business. “We should not forget where we would have been on 1 August,” the commission chief said in defence of the agreement. “We would have been at 30% and it would have been much more difficult to get down to 15%.” The deal appears to protect the interests of German carmakers better than those of Mediterranean food and drink producers, although von der Leyen said she had made clear that some EU agricultural tariffs would stay.What would have been the alternative? Some European officials,especially in France, say the EU should have been tougher from the outset, implementing retaliatory measures as soon as higher tariffs clicked under Trump’s “liberation day” announcement in April and invoking its anti-coercion instrument to threaten action against US services companies and investments in Europe.Brussels was unable to make stronger use of its trade powers because of divisions among the 27 member states, with Germany, Italy and Ireland urging restraint to protect their economic interests, while France and Spain supported a more robust EU stance. The result was a deal that will undoubtedly hurt the European economy – the Axa Group chief economist Gilles Moec calculates that it could knock 0.5% off the bloc’s GDP– but averted potential tit-for-tat trade measures that could have exacted a higher price.Europe must now accelerate the conclusion of trade deals with other partners around the world to mitigate the damage from Trump’s policies. At best, this humiliation could stimulate the EU to build an alliance of like-minded, rules-based trading nations and blocs without the US. But that would take more courage and more unity than the bloc has shown in handling Trump.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Where do we go from here?Mon 28 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 08.35 EDTShareWe are living in an age of bullies. Those with power are less constrained today than they have been in my lifetime, since the end of the second world war.The question is: how do we lead moral lives in this era?Vladimir Putin launches a horrendous war on Ukraine. After Hamas’s atrocity, Benjamin Netanyahu bombs Gaza to smithereens and is now starving to death its remaining occupants.Trump abducts thousands of hardworking people within the US and puts them into detention camps – splitting their families, spreading fear. His immigration agents are accused oftargeting peoplewith brown skin.He usurps the powers of Congress, defies the courts, and prosecutes his enemies.He and his Republican lackeys cut Medicaid and food stamps – lifelines for poor people, including millions of children – so the wealthy can get a tax cut.Hate-mongers on rightwing television and social media fuel bigotry against transgender people, immigrants, Muslims, people of color and LGBTQ+ people.Powerful men abuse women. Some of the abused are children.Powerful male politicians make it impossible for women to obtain safe abortions.CEOs rake in record profits and compensation while giving workers meager wages and firing them for unionizing.Billionaires make large campaign donations – legalized bribes – so lawmakers will cut their taxes and repeal regulations.Each such abuse of power encourages other abuses. Each undermines norms of civility.Every time the stronger bully the weaker, the social fabric is tested. If bullying is not contained, the fabric unwinds. Those who are bullied – who feel powerless, vulnerable, bitter and desperate – become fodder for “strongmen”, demagogues who lead them into violence, war and tyranny.This is hardly new. Throughout history, the central struggle of civilization has been against brutality by the powerful. Civilizationis the opposite of brutality. A civil society doesn’t allow the strong to brutally treat the weak.Yet in my lifetime, I’ve witnessed a breakdown. I’ve seen a change occur – from support of decency and constraints on brutality, to tolerance of indecency and support for unconstrained cruelty.Trump is not the cause. He’s the culmination.So how do we lead moral lives in this age of bullies?We do everything we can to stop the brutality, to hold the powerful accountable, and to protect the vulnerable.Putin and Netanyahu are war criminals whose criminality must be stopped. Trump is a dictator who must be deposed.Rightwing politicians who encourage white Christian nationalism must be condemned and voted out of office. Pundits who amplify racism and xenophobia must lose their megaphones.Powerful men who sexually harass or abuse women or children must be prosecuted.Women must have full control over their bodies, including access to safe abortions.Police who kill innocent people of color must be brought to justice. Immigration agents must be prohibited from abducting people off the street or from their homes or court houses or places of work.CEOs who treat their employees like manure must be exposed and penalized. Billionaires who bribe lawmakers to cut their taxes or exempt them from regulations must be sanctioned, as should lawmakers who accept such bribes.This isn’t a matter of “left” or “right”. It’s a matter of what’sright.Living a moral life in an age of bullies requires collective action; it cannot be done alone. Each of us must organize and participate in a vast network of moral resistance.This is what civilization demands. It’s what the struggle for social justice requires. It’s why that struggle is so critical today, and why we all must be part of it.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

It is as good a reason as many of those given over the past week for the fact that the billionaire whoseFox Newschannel has acted as a Trump cheerleader throughout is now, alone among US media titans, preparing to do battle in the courts.Trump’s onslaught on the US media – withdrawing federal funds, banning reporters and launching multi-billion-dollar lawsuits – has led once-renowned defenders of media freedom such as the Washington Post, ABC News and CBS to crumple, either changing their editorial policies or agreeing to apparently frivolous settlements. Yet ranting calls to both the WSJ editor, Emma Tucker, and his old frenemy Rupert failed to prevent the publication of a story suggesting he had senta hand-drawn pictureof a naked woman to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein with the words: “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Last week, helaunched a $10bn lawsuitover this “fake”. After the WSJ doubled down with stories saying Trump had been told he was in the Epstein files,sources close to Murdoch reportthat, at 94, he refuses to be “intimidated”.He is also enhancing his reputation as the most mercurial media titan. Media veteran Tina Brown asked how the world had come to depend on “the Darth Vader of media” to stand up for press freedom, while a thoughtful friend asked: “Suppose Murdoch had a Damascene conversion and sought to atone for his many sins – would we welcome him as an ally?” Can a man whose companies have paid out more than a billion pounds for either knowingly broadcasting lies or for hacking phones be preparing to die as the Severus Snape of the media world, the final protector of press freedom?Two years ago, when Murdoch announced he was standing down (sort of), he told staff to “make the most of this great opportunity to improve the world we live in”, a line that seemedridiculous to meat the time. Is his battle with this madman in the White House really his final chance at leaving the world a better place?Before Murdoch watchers get carried away, there are of course a number of rational and personal reasons for Murdoch’s decision not to kowtow to Trump.Throughout his long career at the nexus of media and power, one thing that has been consistent is Murdoch’s desire to pick the winning side. Trump’s friendship with Epstein is the only issue currently close to dividing him from a Maga power base that also forms the heart of the Fox News audience.And Murdoch’s enthusiasm for the former real estate mogul has never been wholehearted. After the 6 January attack on the US Capitol in 2021 he sent an email to a former executive, saying: “We want to make Trump a nonperson.” Despite this, the support of his Fox News channel helped elect a man he has little respect for.Not only is he spreading his bets on the Epstein fallout, Murdoch is also riding two horses by allowing his respected financial news organisation to defend its reporting, while Fox continues to downplay the story over Trump’s card.A newsman at his core, Murdoch isjust as likely to give his editors stories as ask for them to be spiked. But Murdoch is also known to have kept a particularly respectful distance from the Journal’s editorials since buying it in 2007; one called Trump’s tariff plans “the dumbest trade war in history”. Besides, defending its journalism is good for business in a landscape in which the owners of CBScancel a hit showcritical of Trump andpay millions to his presidential libraryjust days before receiving a government blessing for a huge deal.As always with Murdoch, there is also the psychodrama of an old man whose life is closer to Shakespearean than most. Michael Wolff, responsible for several of the many books on both men, tells me that Murdoch’s support for his journalists is an “old man’s revenge” after the Fox fallout divided his family and promptedan inheritance battlestill playing out in the family courts. Besides, says Wolff, Murdoch wants revenge on Trump simply for winning when Murdoch did “everything to make sure [he] didn’t”.Trump’s behaviour in his second term – using his powers to further any whim or grievance, and approaching absolutism – could also have revealed to Murdoch the end result of a truly free market. What is to stop Emperor Trump from stripping his commercial empire of the protection of the rule of law once the old man is gone, for example?Murdoch is undoubtedly a flawed hero. And there is a chance after all that the drawing is a hoax, as Trump insists, despite the Journal’s robust defence. Murdoch’s papers have been tricked before. But for now, he is the closest thing journalism has to a Trojan horse, invited into the inner sanctum yet still apparently ready to do battle.Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media GroupExplore more on these topicsRupert MurdochOpinionPress freedomDonald TrumpNews CorporationFox NewsNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

The AI-powered account praised Hitler and posted a series of antisemitic comments over X, the digital platform also owned by Musk. The company’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, resigned the next day – though it’sunclearwhether her exit was directly related to the bot’s rant.Posting on X, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said Grok’s behavior was “irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic”. xAI and the Grok account on X apologized for the incident, but days laterreleasedtwo chatbot “companions”, including an NSFW anime avatar available to children and a red panda character built to issue crude insults.Musk, meanwhile,chalkedGrok’s behavior up to it being “too eager to please” and to responding to user-generated prompts. He said that the issue had been fixed. US politicians and platform advertisers said little, unlikepast responsesto similar incidents on X. Their silence and Musk’s downplaying of the event speak louder than if we had heard significant public denunciations of the chatbot’s actions from the powers that be.The relative quiet at the top is illustrative of two things. First, Grok’s behavior is not surprising. At this point, it’s predictable. Second, little about Grok,X, or xAI is likely to change in the short term.Grok sharing hateful content is Grok working precisely as it was designed to. Before the inflammatory chatbot was “born” and launched on X in late 2023, Muskspokeabout the need for AI alternatives to ChatGPT, which he deemed too politically correct. He has consistently referred to his anti-woke AI as “TruthGPT”. Grok was deliberately built to be provocative – and “to tell it like it is”.Grok is a fitting representation of the current culture of X and, more broadly, of social media and those at its reins. In the years since Musk purchased the internet platform, originally named Twitter, many have pointed out that it has devolved into a space rife with “racism, misogyny, and lies”. It’s also full ofspam and scams.Shortly after the platform changed names and hands, most of the people behind content moderation and platform trust and safety wereunceremoniously fired.Extremists and conspiracy theoristswho had been deplatformed from Twitter were reinstated on X. In late 2024, the social media organization’s first transparency report in yearsrevealedserious problems with this new laissez-faire approach, including unsettling new instances of child exploitation.According to Musk, Grok was built to seek and reveal truths beyond the supposedly sanitized content seen on competing generative AI systems or prior social media platforms. But Grok what actually does is tell the “truth” of the current hands-off, malignant, version of X, and of other social media platforms and tech leadership. Since Musk’s acquisition of X – and the deregulation of content that followed – other platforms have followed suit.These shifts follow anexecutive orderand other moves from the Trump administration aimed at curtailing “censorship” through digital content moderation and, seemingly, the collaborative study of social media propaganda. Meanwhile, social media and AI companies are getting more cozy with Washington: xAI justsigneda $200m contract with the Pentagon to provide “Grok for government”.Inpast research, I’ve found that billionaires’ and global political leaders’ claims about striking down digital media censorship and preserving free speech online are often suspect at best. At worst, and closer to what I’ve encountered in my analyses, such claims are self-serving for those in power. These figures not only own a significant stake in the digital information environment; they have also purposefully and steadily cultivated the online space to be favorable to their goals and ideas. They seek to artificially control what trends, or what people see as popular behavior, and to make such statements or actions acceptable.But an online world where hate, spam and scams run rampant is only one version of what the internet and digital media technology can be. The opposite, as Musk and others in Silicon Valley and Washington have rightfully pointed out, is an overtly censored online space. China’s internet and social media platforms, for instance, have been tightly controlled by the government since the outset.We do not have to accept either extreme.Empirical researchand lessons fromrecent historyshow us that we can indeed have healthier, more connective, communication tools. We can have social media platforms that are sensibly and systematically moderated from both the top down and bottom up.But to have such spaces we must demand better, more thoughtful, content moderation and tool design from technologists and policymakers. We must also break big tech’s stranglehold on innovation in the social media space. Too much power online is consolidated in the hands of too few companies and individuals. We need new digital platforms that genuinely center human rights, pluralism and democratic discourse, and better policies that allow for such an experience.Samuel Woolley is the authorManufacturing Consensus: Understanding Propaganda in the Era of Automation and Anonymityand co-author ofBots.

If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.”Over the years, commercial publishers had reliably dampened my enthusiasm by teaching me to ask two questions as soon as even the idea of another book crossed my mind. Who will sell my book? Who will read my book?But my brother’s fireproof confidence in me fuelled me to pen a proposal that successfully wound its way through acquisitions until a contract landed in my inbox.New research shows a blindingly simple new procedure can help save children’s lives in emergency departments | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreOvernight, the dream of writing another book was replaced with the dread of producing said book – a guide to writing engaging opinion and advocacy columns mixed with a personal account of being a physician exposed to a great variety of experiences.Being a columnist had made me more observant, deepened my appreciation of medicine and honed my understanding of why every word we say (or write) matters. When I began to teach writing classes, I wanted to democratise what I knew.Then,George Orwellmade me quail. In his famous essay, he accused writers of being motivated by “sheer egoism”, calling them “more vain and self-centred than journalists, although less interested in money”.Ouch. At least the last bit was true, although not by choice.As I wrangled with the ego issue, the wonderfulAnnie Dillardrescued me with her prescient writing from back when I was a teenager.“The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.”Sheknew my reason to write.High principles aside, it was on to the next two unglamorous years, starting with a blank document and progressing page by page, draft by draft. How I found the time is how every writer I know finds the time – by squeezing it from elsewhere.I still haven’t watched Breaking Bad and only finished Succession when news of the final episode was everywhere.Patient care came first. My notional “writing day” was inevitably taken up by the exigencies of family life, leaving spare nights and weekends to write. Being a writer is heady but doing the writing is painful. This got me wondering about how the writers I admired were so expert and fluent. What innate talent did they possess that I lacked?I loved the act of rearranging the same 26 letters in so many ways and was in no rush to wrap up the bookEnter James Baldwin with his no-nonsense counsel: “I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but most of all, endurance.”Now, there was a word I recognised from 15 years of medical training: endurance. The next two years of conversations went like this: “I thought you said you finished your book.”“That was just the last draft.”Having exhausted the generosity of the people who read my (numerous) drafts and nurtured my spirits, and feeling no more “done”, I ventured to AI for inspiration and distraction. It produced some nice suggestions but when it rewrote my manuscript, I found it stiff, formal and, frankly, dishonest.The truth was I loved the act of rearranging the same 26 letters in so many ways and was in no rush to wrap up the book. On days that I lost a patient or made a patient cry over bad news, I couldn’t wait to escape to my perennially unfinished manuscript to calm my mind.Oliver Sacksknew exactly how I felt when he called the act of writing an indispensable form of talking to himself.Writing Australia: can the new national literature body make a real difference for authors? | Esther AnatolitisRead moreMy explicit permission to dawdle came fromJoan Didion. “Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means.”Maybe, Orwell was right after all.Nearing the end of his life and suffering from oesophageal cancer,Christopher Hitchensremarked that an awareness of mortality was useful for a writer because it helped one avoid the fear of public opinion, sales, critics, or for that matter, friends.What timely words to strengthen my resolve to publish the work I could no longer stand to read!At this point, dare I imagine my ideal reader? As if eavesdropping on my thoughts, Joyce Carol Oates warned against it: “He/she may be reading someone else.”Touché.Then, just after I had hit “send”, Annie Dillard swung back into my life with a vengeance: “Assume you write for an audience consisting solely of terminal patients … What could you say to a dying person that would not enrage by its triviality?”Gulp.I would be the first to say my terminally ill patients have better things to do than read my book. After all, what food for thought could I possibly offer to compete with the contemplation of mortality?My book is out today. In an unexpected gesture, one of my terminally ill patients pre-ordered it so he could tell me in clinic that he looks forward to reading it. But, he added, beaming from ear to ear, if he doesn’t get to finish it, he will leave it to his granddaughter who wants to be a doctor and a writer.This kind of generosity really does feel like sufficient reward.… Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

It’s high time police acted on these red flagsMon 28 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 14.21 EDTShareThe idea that violent men seek out fresh opportunities to attack people and property is hardly news. That one form of violence is a predictor of others, on the other hand, has yet to be fully recognised by the criminal justice system. If that were not the case, domestic abuse would be treated as the red flag it undoubtedly is, requiring much more effective identification, prosecution and management of offenders.The latest example of violence in the home spilling into the streets comes from last summer’s riots. Two out of every five people arrested – 41% of the 899 individuals arrested for taking part in violent disorder, to be exact – had previously been reported to the police for domestic abuse, according todata obtained by the Guardian. The offences they were accused of included actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm, stalking, breach of restraint and non-molestation orders, coercive control and criminal damage. In some areas where violence broke out on the streets, the figure was as high as 68%. In Rotherham, where 75 people were arrested after rioters set fire to an asylum hotel, 35 turned out to have been previously reported to the police for domestic abuse.The irony is unmissable: in some towns, many of the men who claimed to be protesting about the savage murders of three little girls at a dance class in Southport had themselves been accused of attacking women. The profoundly misogynist rampage that killed Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King and Alice da Silva Aguiar was hijacked, in other words, by “protesters” some of whose own record of behaviour towards women doesn’t stand up to a moment’s scrutiny.There are two other statistics that need to be considered here. The 41% figure maps almost exactly on to the proportion of terrorist suspects who were revealed to have a history of domestic abuse byProject Starlight, a joint research project undertaken by counter-terrorism policing and the Home Office in 2021. Initial analysis of 420 individuals considered vulnerable to radicalisation by extremists showed that 39% had a link to a domestic abuse-related incident, either as an offender, victim or witness. This is much higher than the figure for the population at large.It’s also important to remember that domestic abuse is an underreported crime. Victims are afraid to go to the police, fearing further violence from the perpetrator or that they will not be believed. They are right to be pessimistic: in the case of last year’s riots, police reports show that fewer than a quarter of the individuals accused of domestic abuse before the Southport protests had ever been charged.This is nothing short of catastrophic. It’s alarming for victims, who have to live with the threat of a revenge attack by a man who has nothing to fear from the police. But it also creates a sense of impunity among perpetrators who think, correctly, that they have got away with serious offences. Many of the individuals who joined the disorder last summer would already have been familiar with the criminal justice process; they had been interviewed, perhaps even confronted with evidence in the form of statements from wives or girlfriends and photographs of injuries. Yet the bar for prosecution is set so high, and victims are so lacking in support, that most men accused of domestic abuse never see the inside of a courtroom.The impact on their confidence, and propensity to commit further offences, is rarely considered, even though we know thatperpetrators become bolderwhen they are not charged or convicted. It “legitimises” violence as an outlet for their rage and habituates them to the effects of abuse, seriously diminishing their capacity to feel sympathy for the people they hurt. That goes for current and future partners, victims of terrorist attacks and, in the case of last year’s riots, asylum seekers who were an easy target during a national outpouring of rage and grief.There is now an unanswerable case for treating domestic abuse as a “gateway” offence, very much like indecent exposure. For decades, such behaviour was trivialised as “flashing” and received wisdom was that it didn’t lead to anything else. We now know that could not be further from the truth, a reality demonstrated by the rape and murder of Sarah Everard in 2021. Her killer, Wayne Couzens,had been reportedfor exposing himself on a number of occasions, but the offences were not properly investigated. He didn’t even lose his job as a serving police officer.Two in five arrested for last summer’s UK riots had been reported for domestic abuseRead moreAnother man,Abdul Ezedi, was convicted of indecent exposure and sexual assault at Newcastle crown court in 2018. He was sentenced to 36 weeks in prison for the exposure offence and nine weeks for the sex attack, but both sentences were suspended. In 2024, he drove to London where he threw a corrosive substance in the face of a former partner, causing “life-changing” injuries. His body was later found in the Thames.What’s urgently needed is a revolution in the way domestic abuse is understood and handled by the criminal justice system. Allowing abusive men to avoid convictions is a failure of justice for their victims, but it also has terrifying implications for society as a whole. A domestic abuser register, along the lines of the sex offender register, would protect women by allowing monitoring of perpetrators released on licence.But it’s not just the partners of such men who need to be protected. As last summer’s scenes of burning buildings and police cars showed, dangerous men are not choosy about their targets. A year on, the link between private and public violence has never been clearer.Joan Smith is an author, journalist and a former chair of the mayor of London’s VAWG board.

Here are my petty irritations ...Mon 28 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 11.27 EDTShareDo we agree what a bad day looks like? TikTokers have been describing their low-key “days from hell” – and it has made me wonder. Mine would involve getting up before 5am after a sleepless night to find a “morning person” house guest already in the kitchen, drinking the last of the coffee from my special mug and wanting to talk politics. Trying to work, I’d face a soundscape of nearby pneumatic drilling and Capital FM, and be regularly interrupted by spam calls from “HMRC”. After an afternoon at the dentist, dinner would be plain farfalle (the worst pasta). I’d have to go out in the evening by car and parallel park, then get home to realise I’d lost my keys. Would that bother anyone else? Or is the small stuff people sweat – and it is small, truly the definition of first world problems – entirely personal?Conducting a survey (that is, watching many TikToks of dewy young people pointing to bullet-pointed lists in their notes apps) revealed a few commonalities. A very high proportion of their annoying days start with waking up in someone else’s house, hungover, which does, I agree, sound suboptimal. The TikTokers also really hate being hot, which is probably a function of when this trend is emerging (ask them in January and I suspect you’d get a different answer), but relatable. Forgotten or unwelcome social plans that can’t be cancelled without guilt, technological snafus and exercise classes too expensive to skip also recurred regularly.After that, the consensus crumbles. Everyone has their own loathed chores, modes of transport or parts of town: there’s a beautiful specificity to the likes ofgetting into platform 16 at Leeds station, aHinge date booking “Caffè Concerto in Piccadilly Circus”or “shopping for a present for a six-year-old boy in Westfield Stratford”. But one thing seems to unite TikTok and, I suspect, everyone beyond: that there is no mild discomfort like a mobile phone with less than 10% juice and no charger.Explore more on these topicsTikTokOpinionSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

It’s called women’s football and the LionessesAva VidalEven now, some want to downplay last night’s historic win, but the facts are plain. We yearn to be the best: palpably, our women are doing thatMon 28 Jul 2025 05.39 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTShareItfelt like deja vuwhen Chloe Kelly smashed the ball into the back of the net, winning the game for the Lionesses and signalling the end of the Women’s Euro 2025 final.England beat Spainafter a tense penalty shootout. The word of the tournament was “resilience”, declared presenter Gabby Logan after the game. It is hard to argue with that.It was as though the team had written a list of milestones they were ticking off as the tournament progressed. They are the first English senior team to defend their title, and the first to win a major tournament on foreign soil. Their coach, Sarina Wiegman, simply said: “A team is what we really are. We can win by any means.”And that positivity was infectious. They genuinely believed in themselves, and in turn we believed in them. When Lucy Bronze casually revealed she’dplayed the entire tournament with a fractured tibia– “If that’s what it takes to play for England, that’s what I’ll do” – it encapsulated the attitude that surrounds the whole team. Unlike with the men, we never questioned if any of the players even wanted to be there due to a lack of financial incentive given thatinternational matches pay so much less than club games do. I tried to work out what felt so different for me watching them rather than the men’s team. Not once did I give up hope. I never once had to “self-soothe” by cramming sugary snacks down my throat. There was no mental preparation for the inevitable disappointment of yet another loss.Amid the celebrations, a question: why are we continually chasing glory through our men’s teams when the women are the ones delivering? They have reached three major tournament finals in a row and have the level of success that the men’s team can only dream of. There is a disdain we see time and time again across different sports. The women’s rugby team have suffered the same kind of patronising attitude as well as those who compete on the track and field. The men’s 100m final is referred to as “the jewel in the crown” of track and field events: the women don’t get nearly as much attention.It wasn’t easy: it’s never easy. The Lionesses’ tournament was briefly marred by the widespread media coverage of the onlineracial abuse received by Jess Carterafter the admittedly dismal performance in that first game against France. But refusing to let that be the story, the Lionesses acted quickly, condemning the “online poison”, putting out a unified statement and announcing that they were opting to not take the knee before matches, as “we and football need a new way to tackle racism”.After the final, Carter revealed she had been next up to take a penalty had Kelly missed, confessing she hadn’t wanted to take it. Who could blame her? No one needs reminding ofthe racist abuse and death threats received by her male counterpartsMarcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and BukayoSaka during the Men’s Euro 2020 final. She also said she had been “disappointed” at how she had been painted during the tournament, but now “couldn’t give a damn”. The sweet taste of victory had clearly been enough to remove the bitterness left by the abuse.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Jess Carter, who received racist abuse and death threats during the tournament, fends off a challenge from Spain’s Esther González.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APThe 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, who had been a ballgirl at Wembley only four years ago, was named young player of the tournament in recognition of the fact that the goals she scored in the quarter-final against Sweden and the semi-final against Italy saved England from elimination. The fact that, days earlier,she had been left off a photo of the teamattached to a “good luck” message issued by the royal family didn’t seem to be on her mind at all.Today’s joy is infectious: for the nation, for the nation’s women. I can have a different conversation today with my daughter. We can talk about the team and what it is to be tough. We can talk about the naysayers, such as Piers Morgan’s 32-year-old son Spencer, who perhaps wants to be a contrarian just like his dad when he grows up, whoposted on X: “That shootout was the funniest thing I’ve seen since the last one. ‘Why can’t the men win?’ Because they’re playing against people capable of kicking a ball,” he said. The dinosaurs: they live, they tweet.I remember seeing an interview with theopera singer Kiri Te Kanawaafter her retirement, when she was asked what it had been like to live at the height of her glory days. She replied: “I hadn’t realised at the time that’s what they were.” For the Lionesses these are their glory days. Stop singing about “years of hurt” and enjoy their success. It’s everyone’s success.Ava Vidal is a standup comedian based in London and patron of the charity Show Racism the Red CardDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One of the tellings of the legend has it that young Annie Palmer, the “White Witch of Rose Hall”, was a sadistic 19th-century killer and torturer who terrorised enslaved people, murdering the grand-niece of her African lover, Takoo, with a curse, before he killed her. Annie’s spirit now apparently haunts a golf course in Montego Bay.Even as a kid, touring the beautiful island with Jamaican loved ones on holidays, I noticed the British men who had controlled the island’s sugar plantations were largely forgotten.It was the heroes of the 18th- and 19th-century resistance against slavery’s violence who were everywhere, such as the guerrilla commanderQueen Nanny of the Maroons,who was said to have been able to catch bullets. Or Sam Sharpe, a pioneer of liberation theology whose uprising led to abolition, or the political activist Paul Bogle. Their faces were on the banknotes we used to buy pineapple soda.This is one way descendants process the legacies of enslavement: through the memory of ancestors who resisted their oppressors, the worst of whose crimes were so obscenethatthey became spectral, like Annie Palmer, or the pirates ofPort Royal, swallowed by an earthquake.But the legacy of slavery in Jamaica, and across theAmericas, is pervasive in persistent inequality, in generational trauma, and in the elite schools and words plantation owners left behind. Some of those words are Scottish. Scottish surnames, such as Campbell and Gordon, and placenames, including Aberdeen and Dundee, are everywhere in Jamaica. But until fairly recently, in the UK, there was relatively little interrogation of this deep Scottish imprint.Edinburgh University’s report into its history,reported in the Guardianthis week, is the latest research into this legacy. It illuminates the forgotten mechanics of Scotland’s colonial project, exposing the institution’s racial ideologies as algorithms of exploitation, from the 18th century onwards.The 2015 book Recovering Scotland’s Slavery Past, edited by Prof Tom Devine, detailed how, at the height of transatlantic slavery, “a fifth of the ship captains and two-fifths of the surgeons” on ships sailing out of Liverpool, which dominated the trade, were Scots. “Scots owned and managed enslaved people – from Maryland to Trinidad, from St Croix to St Kitts,” comprising, in the late 18th century, a third of Jamaica’s white population.The new report complements these histories, revealing thatEdinburghUniversity was a “haven” for white supremacist thought between 1750 and 1850. It found the institution had an “outsized role in developing racial pseudo-sciences” that “habitually positioned Black people at the bottom and white people at the top” – even hoarding Black people’s skulls.The report charges moral philosophers of the Enlightenment such as Adam Ferguson,David Humeand Dugald Stewart – men long appreciated as intellectual giants – with leaving a “damaging” legacy of ideas used to justify enslavement and colonialism, which in turn fuelled Edinburgh University’s growth.In an era of “anti-woke” backlash, this research is bound to invite accusations that the university is putting dead heroes of their time on trial, excavating their bones to shore up a present-day reputation. But the research undoubtedly matters. Building onEric Williams’s seminal 1944 work Capitalism and Slavery, it fights the false, seductive notion that enslavement, critical to sectors from commodities to finance and philanthropy, was a discrete chapter, separate from the wider story of British national development.It throws down the gauntlet to other institutions reluctant to examine their past. But, most importantly, research of this kind, though unsettling, matters to descendants of the millions of enslaved Africans trafficked to the Americas, as the Caribbean’s determined genealogists seek answers.“New World” slavery societies offered lots of opportunities to Scottish settlers, “sojourners” and landowners. Devine’s book describes Scotland, for centuries, as a country in which “emigration was the norm”. Slaving voyages from Scottish ports were only a fraction of the British total, but “nomadic” Scots went to the West Indies as professionals and adventurers seeking social mobility, as well as indentured workers, pirates, and transplanted Jacobite prisoners, in smaller numbers, leading to a “greater per capita Scottish stake” in slavery than any other UK nation.Scotland’s claimants accounted for 15% of compensation payouts after abolition, with Glasgow’s enslaversrepresenting“one of the largest regional groups of claimants”. The Caribbeanprovided marketsfor Scottish textiles and herring, supplying Scotland in turn with coffee, cotton, rum, sugar and tobacco.Against this backdrop, Edinburgh’s thinkers sustained a racial “ideology that helped to exploit, kill and dominate”, says Prof Tommy J Curry, who co-chaired Edinburgh University’s report, adding that “Scotland has a moral debt to pay”.The Enlightenment had a shadow. In the same climate in which the values that underpin liberal democracy developed, so did “some of the most damaging ideas in human history”, says the university.For Peter Mathieson, the university’s principal, these revelations align with the Enlightenment’s “enormously important” spirit of inquiry, opposing the comfort of “selective memory”.The reasons why Edinburgh University assumed this “outsized” role lie in the modern, unified, secular structure it had by the 18th century, attracting some of Europe’s most curious minds. The city was in the vanguard of medicine, which meant it produced doctors for slavers’ ships and plantations in countries such as Jamaica, which took these theories of race with them, before funnelling back profits from the plantation economy.The “great irony” of this, says the university’s Ian Stewart, was that while their racial ideas were adopted by the enslavers of the American south, Scottish Enlightenment figures such as Ferguson and Dugald Stewart were “lifelong, vocal abolitionists”.“They understood the law of unintended consequences better than anyone,” Ian Stewart says. “They wouldn’t be phased one bit by the fact these ideas took on an awful life of their own.”Edinburgh University didn’t invent racism. What it did was provide a thinktank, codifying ideologies – in the yellowing handwritten books examined for the first time in years for the new research – that aligned with the basest interests of capital.But from the Windrush scandal toracial inequalities on maternity wards, to the UK government’s refusal to formally apologise and pay reparations for slavery, and on to the far right’s “Dark Enlightenment”, the ghosts of Edinburgh’s theories still haunt.Chris Osuh is a community affairs correspondent for the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But they show leaders can’t ignore public opinion for everMon 28 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 03.14 EDTShareThe children die first. In conditions of starvation, their growing bodies’ nutritional needs are higher than those of adults, and so their reserves are depleted faster. Their immune systems, not yet fully developed, become weaker, more susceptible to disease and infection. A bout of diarrhoea is lethal.Their wounds don’t heal. The babies cannot be breastfed as their mothers have not eaten. They die atdouble the rateof adults.Last week, over a period of just 72 hours,21 children diedin Gaza of malnutrition and starvation. The path to death from starvation is a slow and agonising one, especially in a territory suffering shortages of not just food, but medicine, shelter and clean water. The total death toll from hungersurpassed 100 at the weekend; 80 of those were children. Anaid worker reportedthat children are telling their parents that they want to die and go to heaven, because “at least heaven has food”.Every single one of these deaths, and those that will come, is preventable. The World Health Organization described the starvation as “man-made”, but it is more than that. It is foreseeable and thus deliberate. Israel’s siege on Gaza has blocked tonnes of aid from entering, or being distributed to those who need it,according to humanitarian organisationsthere. The “tactical pause” of military operations for a few hours a day in three parts of the Gaza Strip to allow in some aid is a measure that does not ameliorate a crisis accrued over time. The starvation,long warned about, is the latest phase of a campaign almost two years long, for which words are now entirely inadequate.Genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass punishment – all these descriptions still somehow do not capture the lurid and varied ways in which Palestinians in Gaza are being killed: bombed in their homes, and in their tents,burned alivein their hospital beds,shot while queueing for foodand now starved. It almost doesn’t matter what it is called any more, because all you need to see to know that what is happening is a crime that requires immediate action is the bones of a child sticking out of its thin skin, while the food it needs is being blocked by Israeli soldiers.The time for justifications, arguing aboutsemanticsand hand-wringing over the “complexity” of the conflict has long passed. The only question now is, how is it that the world cannot get Israel to allow a morsel of food into a starving civilian’s mouth? How is this a government still not decisively cut off, sanctioned and embargoed? How is this a government, still, that David Lammy thinks he can “urge” to do the right thing? The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen,posted on Xcalling the images from Gaza “unbearable”, and called for more aid to be let in and for Israel to “deliver on its pledges”. This, and other EU social media statements, wasdescribedby an Oxfam official as “hollow” and “baffling”.Benjamin Netanyahu has proved, over and over, that he has no intention of complying with anything. Only last week, aministersaid that “there is no nation that feeds its enemies”, and that the government was “rushing toward Gaza being wiped out” while also “driving out the population that educated its people on the ideas of Mein Kampf”. The truth is that there is no strategic goal for defeating Hamas, only constantly shifting goalposts, under a prime minister who has yoked his political survival to the indefinite extension of an assault on Gaza.0:45Gaza facing man-made mass starvation, WHO chief says – videoAnd in the meantime, the escalating horrors and their relentless continuation unsettle and reconfigure the world. But the more the hard, cold core of support for Israel’s actions is revealed, the more credibility and legitimacy drains away from it. The result is a head-on confrontation between political establishments and the public in a situation that is no longer manageable. The recentescalating rhetoric, for it is only that, from Keir Starmer is an indication that Gaza is now an issue that must be paid lip service to if it is not to further coalesce into a domestic problem for an already embattled government.But still, that rhetoric seems to be part of an elaborate game, in which everyone dances increasingly performatively around what needs to happen. That game is to maintain, no matter the violation, the tenability ofIsraelas a moral player, while pretending that when it transgresses it will be scolded back into compliance. The “when” here is important. The players of this game are constantly inventing new beginnings, new red lines, new watersheds, which mean the necessary point of rupture with Israel is constantly moved to a new point on the horizon. Whether it is the killing of aid workers, the killing of those actually seeking aid, or now the starvation, each escalation of Israel’s campaign seems to trigger a fresh wave of finger wagging.The result is a permanent moment of impending action, as threatened by Lammy. Action that never comes. And while we wait, the status quo is maintained in a holding pattern until the latest horror fades from our screens and front pages. Or Israel applies some temporary measure, such as its “tactical pause” in the fighting, that does not address the fundamental conditions of siege, blockade and civilian killings.Israel announces daily military pauses as fury mounts over starvation in GazaRead moreBut protest, no matter how ostensibly ineffective, remains the only way any pressure can be applied on those who have the power to censure Israel in ways that are meaningful, by ceasing military and trade relations. Protesting might feel like screaming into a void, but even the little change we have seen – the pitifully fewtrucks of aidnow rolling into Gaza – is down to the strain of that confrontation with the political establishment. What else public anger is capable of achieving can only be realised if it does not relent.The way that strain translates into something meaningful can be impossible to divine, because being subjected to these placatory ruses for almost two years has been enough to inflict a sort of cognitive injury. We are told by powerful politicians that things cannot continue as they are, and then, suddenly, it is another few months and things have not only continued but worsened. There is something genuinely mind-bending about it, something exhausting and scattering of resolve when it seems that finally, something seems to be shifting and sanity is prevailing, and then it doesn’t.The purpose is to quieten the public through verbal laudanum, or distract it by the lowest-cost calls for recognising a Palestinian state. These are phantom wins, a grotesque exercise in crowd control, reputation laundering and public opinion management. Innocents are now starving to death.

The New York Times debated running the photo due to its nudity. They ran it on their front page the next day in edited form. It became powerfully attached to the Vietnam war and rippled through global opinion.The memory of this image bolted to my mind’s forefront when I saw last week the images of children starving inGazaplastered across almost every media outlet in the world, including conservative UK outlet the Daily Express, which featured a staggering front page with a gaunt Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq – a one-year-old so starved, he now weighs the same as a three-month-old baby. His spine sticks out like a knotted thread – an image that whipped a headline out of the Daily Express: “For pity’s sake, stop this”, declaring that the suffering “shames us all”.Sanction Israel and recognise Palestine: here are the steps Australia should take next on Gaza | Donald RothwellRead moreMuhammad is not the victim of a drought, or an event beyond the control of people and governments. It’s no accident, this boy – like so many children in Gaza – has barely any energy to lift eyelids. This is a result of deliberate decisions by the Netanyahu government to restrict humanitarian aid into Gaza.The significance of the Daily Express featuring this image should not be overlooked. A publication with a conservative bent has taken a strong stand because the humanitarian cause should not be political.These images have torn through social media. The same week, one of the biggest western nations – and the first member of the G7 – France, announced it would officially recognise the state of Palestine at September’s UN general assembly.About 147 nations already recognise the state of Palestine – but none as large as France. That’s significant.So many nations have lost patience and are unable to stay silent or inert, as the Netanyahu government continually demonstrates its refusal to conduct its pursuit of Hamas in a way that respects the life of innocent civilians, something demanded by international humanitarian law.Our prime minister’s strong statement this week and his recognition over the weekend that “Quite clearly it is a breach of international law to stop food being delivered, which was a decision thatIsraelmade in March”, paves the way for further action.This is the moment for our nation to take a similar stand. I’m proud that our party has twice agreed at its highest decision-making forum – the National Conference of the Australian Labor party – to recognise the state of Palestine.The time to do so is absolutely right now. It would be so close to the declaration of the French, sending a powerful signal, build momentum and likely influence other nations, even though at this moment the UK and German governments appear unmoved.It’s not that the move of its own will point-blank end the suffering experienced by Palestinians in Gaza. There is so much crucial work to be done. But it will cement and back in the stand taken by 28 nations last week – rightly including Australia – to object to any re-partitioning of Gaza into concentration zones, tantamount to ethnic cleansing.While our party position has been straightforward, our government has understandably believed recognition should be part of a peace process. That has been a clear-cut, logical stand for the times. But times change. Just when we think we can’t be shocked further, every month of this 20-month campaign has seemingly proved us wrong and this demands a rethink in our response.It’s also blazingly clear that the Netanyahu government has absolutely no intention of recognising a Palestinian state. Not now, not ever. That’s clearly not a party you can negotiate a peace process with, especially if they’re not even prepared to warm a seat at the negotiating table (frankly that seat will have to be dragged into the room collectively by the actions of the international community).‘Really cautious’: why the ICJ is delaying a Gaza genocide verdictRead moreThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, felt no need to observe conditionality prior to making his announcement. He did set out nearly half a dozen important markers as part of the recognition process, which Australia would not conceivably object to.These included: an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all Israeli hostages, a massive surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the demilitarisation of Hamas. The fact that only over the weekend the Netanyahu government is allowing “minimal” aid into the territory demonstrates that the actions of the French government mattered, they made a difference.The time is right for Australia to recognise Palestine.Last week, I took part in a vigil outside Parliament House. Parliamentarians of different stripes took shifts in reading out the names of the 17,000 teenagers and children killed in Gaza since 7 October. 17,000 names listed in a book whose weight dragged on the heart. The pages formatted into a grid: name, age, gender.I can’t describe to you how confronting it was, as the eye moved left to right, reading a name where the age 0 was listed beside it. I kept thinking to myself: that baby deserved to be raised and nurtured within the love of a family, to laugh and play with other kids, to grow to fulfil their own ambitions, write their own history. Yet their history is starkly recorded as a name subsumed within a thicket of lines and pages captured in a book of casualties.If a conservative outlet such as the Daily Express can summon heart to demand better for children like Muhammad, why can’t Australian conservatives do the same, the ones who champion pro-family values but are silent in the face of families being wiped out. We can and should feel for both Israeli and Palestinian families.

Anthony Albanese told the ABC at the weekend that it wasa breach of international law and a breach of humanity. Evidence of Israel’s violations of international law has been compelling for some time. Examples include the indiscriminate targeting of the Palestinian population, a failure to apply the principle of distinction between Hamas and Gazan residents, and a breach of its Geneva convention obligations to provide food, medical supplies and aid to civilians.It is rare for an Australian prime minister to make such unambiguous statements on international law matters, especially with respect to the conduct of a friend such as Israel. These comments are the latest in a series of observations over the past year, whether they have taken the form of joint prime ministerial statements with Canada and New Zealand, or thestatement issued on Fridaywhich said: “Gaza is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel’s denial of aid and the killing of civilians, including children, seeking access to water and food cannot be defended or ignored.”The time has come for the Albanese government to do more than just issue statements decrying breaches of international law. Ample scope exists under Australian law to impose autonomous sanctions on Israel to make clear its objections to the ongoing Gaza conflict.On 10 June Australia joinedCanada, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom in sanctioning Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for inciting violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.If those two Israeli ministers can be sanctioned for inciting serious abuses of Palestinian human rights, what further steps can be taken against Israeli ministers responsible for directing actions in direct violation of international law?If the horrors unfolding in Gaza are not a red line for Australia to take stronger action then I don’t know what is | David PocockRead moreAustralia has imposed autonomous sanctions in relation to Russia in response to the “Russian threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”. There is no legal reason why similar sanctions cannot be approved with respect to Israel’s threat to Palestine and Palestinians.Israel’s conduct inGazahas also placed the spotlight on Australia’s position on the recognition of a Palestinian state. The prime minister also made clear at the weekend that Australia will not recognise Palestine while Hamas is in power in Gaza, and that Australia will not recognise Palestine as a “gesture”.Nevertheless, President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement thatFrance will recognise Palestineat the September meeting of the United Nations general assembly will continue to place a spotlight on the Albanese government’s response given the momentum towards Palestinian recognition over the past year. About 147 states now recognise Palestine. Those that do not are predominantly from Europe in addition to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.Four traditional criteria are applied to recognition of a new state. First, a defined territory. Palestine comprises the West Bank, Gaza and parts of Jerusalem. While those borders are well known they are contested by Israel. However, contested borders cannot be used as an effective block and many countries have disputed borders, as is evidenced by the conflict between Cambodia and Thailand.Second, there must be a permanent population which is satisfied by the Palestinian peoples who predominantly occupy Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem.Third, there must be a government which is met by the Palestinian Authority. While the PA may have limited capacity to control affairs in Gaza as that territory is under Israeli occupation an allowance can be made for that exceptional situation.What sign is Australia’s government giving on Gaza? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreFinally, there must be evidence of the ability to enter into international relations. That is occurring through the PA’s engagement with UN institutions including the general assembly and the international criminal court, and through the many other states that recognise and engage with Palestine. That Palestine has yet to attain the formal status of a UN member is not determinative of its status. Switzerland onlyjoined the UN in 2002after a long period of remaining distant due to its desire to maintain neutrality.Any decision by the Albanese government to recognise Palestine would only come after cabinet endorsement. Unlike other decisions to recognise new states such as Timor-Leste or South Sudan, Australia’s recognition of Palestine will generate fierce domestic political debate.Albanese has made clear that recognition of Palestine is conditional on Hamas having no ongoing role. Yet in the short term it remains improbable that Hamas will be completely removed from Gaza or as a force in Palestinian politics. Any recognition of Palestine by Australia could include a special condition which made clear it would not politically recognise an Hamas-led Palestinian government. This would be a break from Australian recognition policy towards new states but would acknowledge the exceptional nature of the Palestinian question and that Australia would not tolerate any form of Hamas Palestinian government.Anthony Albanese insists thatAustralian foreign policyis made in Canberra and not overseas. However, with respect to both sanctioning Israel over Gaza and eventually recognising Palestine there is every prospect that Australia will seek to avoid any Trump administration fallout in the form of increased unilateral tariffs on Australian exports.Donald Rothwell is a professor of international law at the Australian National UniversityExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionAustralian politicsMiddle East and north AfricaGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s a scene in the documentary Motherboard in which life as a lone parent is very much going off the rails. While film-maker Victoria Mapplebeck is having treatment for breast cancer, her 14-year-old son Jim is partying hard and refusing to do his homework. After a huge row, he storms out. His mother recorded their subsequent phone call. “When he said he couldn’t wait to be old enough to move out, that was like a dagger through the heart,” she says. “That cancer year was when life’s difficult stuff was happening and I was filming the process all at the same time.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Back in 2004, when Mapplebeck found herself pregnant after a short romance with a man who wasn’t keen on being a father, she was all too aware of the Cyril Connolly quote about there being no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall. “So I trained my camera on that pram in order to find a way to combine life as a film-maker and a mother,” she says. Filmed over 20 years on a succession of phones,Motherboardis a doc that comes with equal amounts of jeopardy, trauma and humour.We first meet Jim as a foetus on an ultrasound screen, giving his mum-to-be the thumbs up. Over the following 90 minutes we see him grow into a warm-hearted young man with a gift for comedy. As a longitudinal project, the film has been compared to Michael Apted’s influential 1964 TV series Seven Up!, which followed the same 14 childrenover the yearsto see how their lives changed. It has also been likened to Richard Linklater’s 2014 coming-of-age feature Boyhood,made over 12 yearswith the same actors. But where those films were made by invisible directors seamlessly stitching together a narrative, Motherboard puts Mapplebeck centre frame with Jim, and shows her toggling between being a parent and a film-maker.Mapplebeck was a 38-year-old freelance TV director when she became pregnant. As this was hardly the most financially stable of jobs, she moved into teaching when she realised she would be bringing up a baby up on her own. As an innovator who had made thefirst C4 webcam series, Smart Hearts, back in 1999, her experience with virtual reality, self-shooting and using iPhones as cameras led to her becoming professor of digital media at Royal Holloway, University of London.Realising she missed film-making, Mapplebeck made the 2015 short 160 Characters,about the relationship that had led to Jim’s conception, using old text messages found on her redundant Nokia phone.160 Characterswas followed by another short,Missed Call,about Jim’s wish when he was 13 to meet his absent father. That film won a Bafta in 2019, but footage of the two of them going up on stage to collect the award doesn’t tell the whole story. Mapplebeck had been undergoing treatment for breast cancer and was worried she wouldn’t live long enough to see Jim grow up.View image in fullscreen‘We can talk honestly’ …a young Jim in Motherboard.Photograph: First Person FilmsShe had already started filming her year-long treatment as aVR projectfor the Guardian: “I’ve always looked at painful experiences through a lens and on the whole it’s helped. With cancer, you’ve got no control over it and you have to lean into that. It’s not about whether you’ve got a positive attitude as to what your outcome is, it’s in the lap of the gods. I wanted some sense of agency and decided to document this whole year of cancer treatment and explore its effect on family life.”Jim wasn’t sure at first: “Even if I was putting myself in her shoes, it still didn’t make sense. But what I slowly learned was that for every person, therapy looks very different. And I realised that putting a camera in front of it was my mum’s way of getting through it. I saw how positive it was for her, so then I was backing it.”Jim is now 21 and studying drama at university. He still lives in the south London flat his mother moved into before he was born. Closely involved with the film-making process throughout, he is credited as creative consultant on Motherboard. Talking alongside his mother, he remembers the 18-month edit: “It was quite a funny time because I’d have my life and you’d have yours. And I’d come back home and it’d be pitch black; you’d just been so busy all the lights would be off except the illuminated screen. And you would go, ‘Oh, could you watch this?’ I was regularly watching cuts and giving feedback about what I did and didn’t like. It was really cool.”Mapplebeck is at pains to stress the care taken to ensure that making the film didn’t add to Jim’s worries about the future: “The bad stuff and the very difficult moments, they’re not recorded live. And that was a very conscious decision. I didn’t come back from the oncologist and say to Jim, ‘OK, this is the diagnosis’, with the camera in his face. All of that is off-camera. But then days, weeks later, we’d record a kind of recap. I always felt it was a myth that it’s only going to be good if it’s live and you’re doorstepping. Having a bit of time to reflect made for really good material.”View image in fullscreen‘That year was when life’s difficult stuff was happening’ … Mapplebeck in hospital.Photograph: First Person FilmsJim comes through as a natural performer, whether singing his made-up songs as a charming toddler or acting in a school play. He admits: “I like being the main character – as an actor that is nice. And I feel lucky we can talk honestly.”Not everything seen on screen was filmed by Mapplebeck. Snatches of Jim’s life outside their flat – wading through muddy music festivals or partying with his friends – come from footage shot on his phone. Jim remembers: “Mum would be like, ‘Oh, could I get this?’ And it was nice including a lot of my friends because they will always be a very big part of my life, especially those years.”Motherboard also weaves in telephone calls and texts between mother and son, even when their relationship is at its most fraught during the cancer treatment and Covid restriction years. At one point Jim texts: “I can’t think straight any more, this year needs to fuck off”. Unlike mom influencers with their “sharenting” videos that stream their children’s antics almost-live online – and too often without their consent – Mapplebeck makes it clear that there were lengthy negotiations between her and Jim: “There were three years of showing Jim cuts. Asking, ‘What do you think? How would you feel about using this?’” She would put the phone in selfie mode and film them talking side by side: “You see us going back and forth about consent. There was the scene where Jim says, ‘Nineteen minutes you’ve been recording. Nineteen minutes gone! You’re a thief!’”View image in fullscreen‘I know I’ve got a dad out there, but I am very, very happy with my current family’ … Jim in Missed Call.Photograph: First Person FilmsThey agree that the toughest discussions were about using that phone call, recorded after their biggest argument: “You had stormed out and I didn’t know where you were and you were supposed to be going to your grandma’s and it was pre-vaccine. I was worried you’d infect her and you were screaming, ‘Shut up, shut up!’ It’s so visceral. Both of us knew it was really powerful. You kept on saying to me, ‘I think that people might hate me when they hear me talk to you like that.’”But at a test screening, Jim was reassured that the scene worked in the way that his mother intended: “It was quite a rite of passage because I think Jim really felt the love in the room. And he realised that people have either been that teenager or they’ve been that parent – or both – and that everybody got it. Nobody was judgmental or down on him, and that was a real turning point. Jim said to me, ‘You can’t make a film about parenting unless you show the shit stuff.’”“People can say I did the film to please my mum,” adds Jim, “but there was no devil on my shoulder saying, ‘Do this for her.’ If I hadn’t wanted to do the film, it wouldn’t have happened.”Mapplebeck received guidance fromOKRE(Opening Knowledge across Research and Entertainment) about protecting Jim, as well as legal advice on ensuring his father’s anonymity on screen. “I would not want internet sleuthery and I’ve never been interested in naming or shaming, or even being judgmental of his decisions. It was a real lightbulb moment for me when I thought, ‘I don’t want to try and get into his head.’View image in fullscreen‘You can’t make a film about parenting unless you show the bad stuff’ …mum and son today.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“I will never understand his own experiences and what led him to these decisions. The advice we’ve always had from lawyers and compliance people has been: ‘Yes, you can tell your story. You’ve got a right to your truth, a truthful and honest account of how this situation affected you.’”A 2013 study found that 13% of fathersreport having no contact with their children. Jim was 14 by the time he met his dad. They saw each other three times that year, and haven’t met since. Jim expresses ambivalence about him: “I don’t hate him at all. Don’t even dislike him. I just have a very neutral view, which is that he did what he did in his life. I’ve done what I’ve done in my life. I don’t want him to watch the film and regret anything. We all make choices, and I think, yeah, he might someday think that wasn’t the best choice, but I wouldn’t want him to feel like he should regret anything he’s done. I know I’ve got a dad out there, but I am very, very happy with my current family and there’s no guarantee that I would be who I was if he was in my life.”Motherboard is in cinemas 15 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And once those algorithms get going, you can’t stop them. It’s the first French-language song to hit more than a billion streams on Spotify’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 28 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 21.31 EDTSharePatrick Watson, singer, songwriter, pianoI’d been commissioned to do the score for a French film, Mères et Filles [released with the English title The Hidden Diary, 2009], starring Catherine Deneuve. I’ve done quite a few scores and usually you talk to the director, then it’s your job to help the storyline do what it needs to. There’s a scene at the end of the film where the main character leaves a letter under the door, which to me suggested the title Je te laisserai des mots, meaning: “I will leave you some words.”In my studio in Montreal, I came up with what I thought was a nice little melody. I’m from Quebec, so although I’m an English-speaking person, I’ve always been surrounded by French. Whenever I have the opportunity to sing or write in French, I do. Although I like singing in French, it’s a very difficult language to sing in because of the vowel structure. There aren’t many words in Je te laisserai des mots and the first verse is entirely wordless. I didn’t think it needed any more words so I just made vocal sounds. Also I probably imagined the song starting to play at the end of the film while there is still dialogue, so didn’t want words to clash. We were kind of half-drunk when we did the strings arrangement. It was a really fun night – but outside the film, I didn’t think anyone would ever listen to the song.I might be renting skis and they’ll see my name and go: “Oh, you have the same name as the singer.” I say: “It’s me!”It initially appeared as a bonus track on my debut album. Then it suddenly took off in the pandemic. Because I couldn’t tour, I was doing lots of live Instagrams, which prompted someone to send me a video they’d made of Je te laisserai des mots. It had a million views and once those algorithms get going, you can’t stop them. Sometimes certain emotions hit at a certain time and a song can become the soundtrack of that moment. Before I knew it, people all over the world were making their own lockdown videos featuring Je te laisserai des mots.When I first came into the music business, execs didn’t take me seriously because I didn’t have “radio songs”, but the advent of syncs and then streaming have made a new kind of hit possible. The song’s now had something like 200,000 TikTok videos featuring it, more than 60bn TikTok plays and it’s the first French language song to hit more than a billion streams on Spotify. I find such huge numbers hard to digest but the song is much more famous than I am. I might be renting skis or something and they’ll see the name and go: “Oh, you have the same name as the singer.” I’m like: “It’s me!” And they don’t believe me.Mélanie Vaugeois, violinOur string quartet played with Patrick for 15 years and we’re still close. When we started touring with him, our kids were quite young so Patrick named us Mommies on the Run. We were his first experiment with a string quartet but after a while on tour we were wilder than him. We’d shout: “No kids!”It was such a great adventure and we all spent a lot of time together. We’d go to Patrick’s place, there would be things everywhere and you’d put your violin case on the ping-pong table. Patrick would play on the piano and we’d improvise around that. One night Patrick said: “I have a French song. What do you think of my accent?” He speaks French very well but had never sung in it and there were a lot of mistakes in the pronunciation, but they were part of the charm so he kept them in.It was a fun session and at one point we had some Jameson whiskey. We tried for a long time to find the right notes and got a little drunk. Everything was starting to slide when suddenly it all just fell into place. There’s almost no rhythm to Je te laisserai des mots, which again is part of the charm. It’s a beautiful song that makes your heart melt, and during the pandemic, when we were all very lonely, it touched a lot of people’s hearts. I first became aware that it was taking off when my kids were on TikTok and I heard the song. I went: “That’s my quartet!” They couldn’t believe it. They told me: “That song’s everywhere.”Although Patrick isn’t obliged to give us songwriting royalties, every year he gives us a symbolic amount to show his gratitude, which is really nice and shows that he respects the fact that people pulling together in that moment created something special.Patrick Watson’s new album, Uh Oh, is released in the UK on 26 September.

Discuss with spoilersThe franchise flat pack has been ditched for something weirder, warmer and more self-contained. So, what did you make of this retro sci-fi bedtime story?This article contains spoilers for The Fantastic Four: First StepsBen ChildMon 28 Jul 2025 08.04 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 08.05 EDTShareThe Fantastic Four: First Steps is a curious hybrid: part Jetsons fever dream, part nuclear family therapy session, part cosmic horror birthing video. It ditches Marvel’s usual franchise flat-pack assembly for something weirder, warmer and vastly more self-contained: a superhero movie that unfolds like a retro sci-fi bedtime story, then ends with a glowing new mum hurling an invasive space god into a binbag full of stars.This is a Fantastic Four movie that finally figures out why the team works – not because they’re the strongest or the smartest, but because they’re messy, human and weirdly functional in the face of total annihilation. Yes, the fate of this gloriously future-retro version of Earth (828) is at stake. Yes, someone gives birth to a child that (at least in the comics) is basically a deity. But the thing you’ll remember is the squabbling, the love, and the actual screen chemistry.It’s not flawless – the midsection wanders like it’s looking for a post-credits tease that never arrives – but for long stretches it plays like the best origins movie Marvel has made in years: a superhero film with heart, smarts, and bonkers space Dada. Here’s what makes it tick.Finally, a Marvel movie that doesn’t feel like homeworkOne of the greatest things about First Steps is how refreshingly normal it feels to watch a Marvel film with a beginning, middle and end. No portals to Phase Seven, no Hulk cameo to remind you that everything’s connected, and that the entire movie might well end up as just emotional scaffolding for a Disney+ series about Ant-Man’s aunt. Just four people, one suspiciously powered infant and retro-futurist weirdness.Would you agree that Marvel’s decision to set the film in an alternate universe where extraterrestrial space travel and flying car technology has somehow been achieved by the 1960s has paid off in spades? It certainly adds Apollo-era colour and chrome-plated optimism to an episode that could easily have been just another murky slab of multiversal franchise soup.Most importantly though, director Matt Shakman delivers a Fantastic Four who actually – finally – deserve the moniker of Marvel’s first family. Reed Richards is a man so pathologically rational he sees parenthood as a physics problem; Johnny Storm is a flame-powered himbo who somehow still nails the movie’s major emotional beats; Sue Storm is the stabilising force of the group; and Benjamin Grimm is a sad slab of sentient gravel who delivers the film’s most moving lines through a mouthful of misery and granite-hard Brooklyn stoicism. All basic stuff, you might think but something that no one has even got close to achieving before with this particular superhero team.Sue Storm finally gets a character arcView image in fullscreenWho run the world? … Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman.Photograph: Marvel Studios/20th Century Studios and Marvel StudiosPrevious attempts to bring Marvel’s first family to the big screen always seemed to give us an Invisible Woman who spent most of the movie reacting to male genius or bickering with her brother. By contrast, Vanessa Kirby’s version announces herself as a major force: a superhero capable of taking on Galactus, tempering Reed’s more unhinged techno-saviour spirals, and holding the emotional centre of the team. She’s not sidelined or fridged while the boys save the world. She’s proactive, pragmatic and crucial to the team’s survival. It’s Storm’s force-fielded stand against the oncoming god-storm that ultimately tips the balance – not Reed’s madcap equations or Ben’s giant rocky fists. For once, the Invisible Woman doesn’t disappear.The Fantastic Four: First Steps review – Marvel regains buoyancy with wacky superhero family sitcomRead moreWith great power comes terrifying childcareView image in fullscreenGurgling god … Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) and Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) with Ada Scott (baby Franklin Richards).Photograph: Marvel Studios/APOne of the strangest – and weirdly most moving – aspects of First Steps is the way it frames the reality of Sue’s pregnancy and baby Franklin Richards’ impending birth not just as a plot device, but as a full-blown meditation on the terror of newfound parental responsibility. Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman are far from the first parents trying to understand the scary implications of raising something they can barely comprehend: all mums and dads know that the universe is about to change forever. The difference this time (as we know from the comics) is that the little bundle of joy in question isn’t just a baby: he’s a cooing, gurgling multiversal reset button in the shape of a very small god.The movie doesn’t oversell this shift with soft-focus sentiment. There are no cheesy monologues about motherhood, no slow-motion cradle shot. But what it does capture – with more resonance than most Marvel films manage – is the panic, awe, and overwhelming love that comes with the arrival of something entirely new.Galactus, the Silver Surfer, and the moment Marvel remembered how to do cosmic horrorView image in fullscreenA chrome-faced angel of annihilation … Julia Garner as the Silver Surfer.Photograph: Marvel Studios/APWould you agree that the studio has seriously upped its supervillain game this time around? Julia Garner’s Shalla-Bal is spellbinding as a chrome-faced angel of annihilation – she glides into view like a brushed-steel omen. And then there’s her gargantuan boss Galactus – less a villain, more a celestial extinction event. How do you counter something so vast, so ancient, and so cosmically indifferent that it makes human fear feel like background noise. While Thanos committed mass murder with the cold, binary efficiency of a guy solving an overcrowded bus schedule, Galactus doesn’t even bother with motive. He isn’t evil – he’s entropy in a helmet, a planetary digestive system with vague opinions on balance.First Steps might be the closest the MCU has come to genuine cosmic horror – not just a threat that’s big and powerful, but something unmistakably Lovecraftian: eerily unknowable, disturbingly inscrutable, and fundamentally indifferent – like being judged by a black hole. It was probably inevitable that the only way to defeat the devourer of worlds was to chuck him through a portal into who-knows-where and make him (at least temporarily) somebody else’s problem. But how long before he comes back hungry to turn Avengers: Doomsday into the comic-book movie equivalent of La Grande Bouffe?Doctor Doom’s fascination with Franklin – and the seeds of Avengers: DoomsdayView image in fullscreenFledgling force … Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman with Ada Scott as Franklin Richards.Photograph: Marvel Studios/20th Century Studios and Marvel StudiosIt’s clear from the way Reed describes his son in First Steps that this baby might be just as powerful on screen as he is in print. If he’s able to bring his mother back to life after her brush with Galactus, might he also be capable of creating entirely new worlds, and breaking down the boundaries between different universes, using just the power of his mind? (He certainly can in the comics.) Is that why Doctor Doom appears to be so interested in the mid-credits scene, set four years after the events of the film? He doesn’t say a word, but the way he watches the child – now a toddler – suggests malevolent intent.Whiteboard warrior: Marvel is priming Mister Fantastic to be the new leader of the AvengersRead moreShakman has already confirmed thatisRobert Downey Jr in the suit inFirst Steps, but we’re still not 100% certain that this version of the supervillain is the same one who will turn up in next year’s Avengers: Doomsday. Is he a Tony Stark variant (explaining the casting) or is it a complete coincidence that he looks exactly like Iron Man? Does this scene directly set up the next film? Or is this just an example of Marvel distraction tactics? It would be uncharacteristically direct for the Disney-owned comic book studio to show its hand so clearly: Doom kidnapping Franklin and inspiring a multiversal rescue mission feels more like fan fiction than Phase 6 strategy. But this would certainly explain the sight at the tail end of Thunderbolts* of a retro-finned rocket, painted conspicuously in what appears to be Baxter Foundation white, heading towards the solar system. And how else are the supervillain (if it is the same version of him) and our heroes supposed to make the jump to Earth-616? Smoke and mirrors, or clear signposting for the next movie? Let us know what you think.Explore more on these topicsFilmNow you've seen itSuperhero moviesMarvelPedro PascalVanessa KirbyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I rip my shirt off’: the exploding career of Hanumankind, India’s hottest rapperCiaran ThaparHe’s a thrilling performer who rails against injustice and ‘mob mentality’ in his homeland – but is he burning himself out? Recovering from an onstage injury, he discusses stereotypes and subversionMon 28 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 06.08 EDTShareTwo weeks ago, halfway through his first ever UK show, Hanumankind instructed the crowd to mimic him by hopping to the right then to the left, back and forth, in unison. But the rapper fromIndiaslipped and fell, limping to the end of the gig in evident pain, kept upright by his DJ and inspired by the audience’s singalong familiarity with his catalogue.“We were ready to have a good time,” he sheepishly grins from an armchair at his record label’s offices three days later. It turns out he has torn a ligament. “It was a battle of internal turmoil. The show was like a fifth of what it was meant to be, but I gave it my all. London has a beautiful energy which gave me strength.”Even without the leg injury, the 32-year-old star, who was born Sooraj Cherukat, has reached a testing threshold in his short, explosive career. His tracks Big Dawgs and Run It Up, helped by action-movie music videos, have made him one of the most talked-about MCs in the world. A$AP Rocky and Fred Again are among his recent collaborators. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi even invited Cherukat to perform at an event in New York last September.But as a rare south Asian face in globally popular rap, he feels a certain responsibility. “The past year has been hard,” he says. “I’m trying to navigate through it.” What’s more, although he expresses a deep pride about life in India, “a lot of things are off. There is a mob mentality. There’s a lot of divisiveness because of religion, background, caste. It doesn’t sit well with me. I’m in a unique space to change the way people can think within my country.”I’m not just trying to speak to people who already agree with meBorn in Malappuram, Kerala, which he remembers as a “green, beautiful environment”, Cherukat spent his childhood following his father’s work abroad, from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia to Britain. “We’d traverse different countries and I’d sing songs in whatever language I was picking up,” he says. “Wherever I went, I had to get involvedandbe ready to leave. I learned to connect with people. That’s why the power of the word is so important to me.”At the age of 10, he landed in Houston, Texas, and found a rare stability. It was the early 2000s and the city was an engine room for rap innovation. Cherukat’s set his accent to a southern drawl. Already a fan of heavy metal – which makes sense given his grungy, rockstar leanings today – he became hooked on the local chopped-and-screwed subgenre pioneered by DJ Screw, Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat. In his teens he was “burning CDs full of beats, riding around smoking blunts and hitting hard freestyles”.He returned to south India just before hitting 20. “The only place I had roots,” he says. He completed a university degree in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, before working a corporate job in the tech hub of Bengaluru. Seeing rap as “a party thing, a way to de-stress and stay connected to the art form”, he performed at open-mic nights, softening his US accent and perfecting his stage show for an Indian audience. “Friends would come to watch and be like, ‘Dude, you’re not bad. You should lock in.’”View image in fullscreen‘There are days when you love the rain’ … artwork for his latest recording.Photograph: Diego BendezuSo he did. At the end of 2019, Cherukat played his first festival: NH7 Weekender in Pune, Maharashtra. The crowd went wild, quickly morphing from a small handful into a packed moshpit. “They’re rowdy and they’re fucking vibing,” he says. “I rip my shirt off. I’m like, ‘OK, I can do this!’” He quit his job and began plotting his next move, filling notebooks with lyrics throughout the pandemic. These are a blend of cheek and grit delivered with a flow that keeps respawning at different speeds and scales. Soon, Cherukat was signed by Def Jam India.Part of a movement to reject the remnants of British colonialism in favour of local expression, the proud, rebellious patchwork of Indian hip-hop encompasses the vast country’s “hundreds of languages, each as deeply rooted as the next”, Cherukat explains. “Someone who speaks Hindi or another regional language will give you a vast amount of depth and detail in what they’re doing.” His decision to rap mostly in English therefore came with risks of being perceived as inauthentic at home, but it has certainly helped his global crossover.Besides, he has found other ways to communicate a homegrown aesthetic.Run It Upmarches to the beat of Keralan chenda drums, while its video features martial artists from disparate corners of India. Cherukat performed it with a band of drummers at Coachella festival, his debut US gig. “Most people don’t know what is going on in my country,” he says. “Maybe I can open up some doors, open up some eyes, break out of these bubbles and stereotypes.” Although not religious, Cherukat has a divine figure woven into his performing name. Over recent years, Hanuman, the simian-headed Hindu god of strength and devotion, has been employed everywhere from the car stickers of hypermasculine Indian nationalism to the bloody, satirical critique ofDev Patel’s 2024 thriller, Monkey Man. Where does Hanumankind fit into this:traditionalist or progressive? “I need to make music for myself first,” he says simply. “But when you have a platform, you can bring about change through your words and actions.”Some fans were disappointed that he accepted the New York invitation from Modi – whose Hindu nationalist government has been accused of democratic backsliding and Islamophobia.Cherukat has defended his appearance, describing it as “nothing political … We were called to represent the nation and we did that.”View image in fullscreenBeautiful energy … performing live.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for CoachellaBut today he claims his “political ideology is pretty clear” to anyone who has been following his career. In one of his earliest singles, 2020’s Catharsis, he rails against systemic corruption, police brutality and armed suppression of protest. “I’m not just trying to speak to people who already agree with me,” he says. “I’m trying to give people who are otherwise not going to be listening a chance to be like, ‘OK, there is some logic to what he’s saying.’”Monsoon Season, his new mixtape, is just out. It features the mellow likes ofHoliday– performed on the massively popular YouTube series Colors – as well as raucous collaborations with US rap luminaries Denzel Curry and Maxo Kream. It is less a narrative album, more a compilation, with songs gathered over the years before the spotlight shone on him.“I have a lot of memories of coming into Kerala during the monsoon,” says Cherukat of the project’s name. “You can have days where things are absolutely reckless, flooded, out of control. There can be days where you get introspective and think about life. There are days where you love the rain: it feels good, there’s that smell in the air when it hits the mud, the soil, the flowers. Your senses are heightened. You can fall in love with that. Or it can ruin all your plans and you hate it.”Cherukat’s knee will take some time to recover before he embarks on a North American tour later this year. It’s clear he needs a break: not just to heal, but to continue processing fame, adapt to its changes and return to the studio. “I’m still adjusting,” he says. “The attention, the conversation, the responsibility, the lifestyle, all this shit. Things have been a little haywire. So I just want to go back to the source – and make music.”Monsoon Season is out now on Capitol Records/Def Jam IndiaExplore more on these topicsRapHip-hopIndiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he’s bringing a new work to the UK, featuring a revolving mirrored door and a pole dancerMon 28 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Jul 2025 06.52 EDTShareYou may have seen a certain video online of a man climbing some stairs. Actually, he’s repeatedly falling from them but then magically bounces back up, weightless as a moon-walker. Out of sight is a trampoline, which gently catapults his looping, twisting body up the staircase each time he falls, turning a would-be simple journey into anepic, poetic odysseythat has caught the internet’s imagination. Pop star Pink saw it and immediately got on the phone to its creator; Martin Short even madehis own versionon Only Murders in the Building.The act is the work of French choreographer-director Yoann Bourgeois, 43, whose live performances have been touring festivals for years. But the popularity of his videos online has propelled him into new realms, working with Harry Styles, Coldplay, Selena Gomez and Louis Vuitton. He continues to create new, live work and brings his latest outdoor piece, Passage, to Greenwich and Docklands festival this summer.Some people run away to the circus; others have it arrive on their doorstep. Bourgeois’ parents separated when he was growing up in Jura, eastern France, and their house was sold to a circus group, Cirque Plume. Bourgeois was already interested in theatre (and later studied dance) and he began to train with the group. “In a way I was looking for a way to get back home,” he says, via a translator. It wasn’t just about returning to the physical building, but the spirit of childhood. “I really wanted to continue to be a child. I’ve searched for a life where I can continue to play; it drives my career even now.”What Bourgeois plays with are the invisible physical forces that surround us – gravity, tension, suspension – and the interaction between those forces, the performers’ bodies and symbolic ideas. For example in Ellipse, the dancers are in costumes like lifesize Weebles with semi-circular bases, rocking and spinning, but never falling. A man and woman “dance” together, swaying past each other but never quite managing to connect. (Missy Elliott wore a version of the same costume in her videoCool Off.) InCelui Qui Tombe (He Who Falls), the performers stand on a wooden platform that rotates, at some speed, then tilts, forcing their bodies to lean at precarious angles to keep their balance, and the group have to navigate this peril together.View image in fullscreenYvonne Smink in Passage.Photograph: Lydie RoureThe short piece Bourgeois is bringing to London is called Passage, and features a revolving mirrored door and pole dancerYvonne Sminkhanging, swinging, balancing and turning the simple act of crossing a threshold into something of infinite possibilities. Much like the way sculptor Antony Gormley hit upon a universal idea in his use of the body, Bourgeois works with the same kind of directness: a seemingly simple setup or visual idea that represents something huge – life, death, time, mortality, struggle, hope – in a way that’s easily readable but can feel profound. Here he is talking about suspension: “In physics, suspension means the absence of weight. But if we speak about time, suspension means absolute presence. And I think this cross between absence of weight and absolute presence is like a small window on eternity. That’s what I search for: to catch the present, to intensify the present.”Even though Bourgeois seeks to be live in the ephemeral moment, you can see why the recorded versions have gone viral. He admits his work looks good on screen. “I feel very lucky because, by chance, my work can be eloquent in this kind of frame, on Instagram for example,” he says. He’s interested in clarity not overcomplication and embraces his wide fanbase. “I didn’t grow up in a family interested in art,” says Bourgeois, and that’s who he imagines making his work for.He’s reaching even more eyeballs now with his pop star collaborations. For the Harry Styles videoAs It Was, Bourgeois designed another revolving platform that saw Styles and his lover being pulled together and apart. “Behind the superficial pop veneer of the song, there’s a great sense of despair,” he says.Bourgeois designs his own stage machines, but the revolving floor is, he points out, a very old theatrical device. The question of what’s truly new in art came to the fore when he was accused of plagiarism in a video posted online comparing scenes from his work with scenes from other artists. There are some striking similarities but Bourgeois is robust in his defence, saying that the works referenced motifs from the history of art, which he considers to be in the public domain. Many circus performers will use the same props. “If you use just a frame of a video, it’s easy to make a comparison,” he says. “What is original is the treatment and the creative process.” We need to look at the whole work rather than an isolated image, he insists. What’s certain is that Bourgeois can turn universal ideas into something eye-catching that connects deeply with audiences – imbued with the wonder of circus and the grace of dance.Greenwich and Docklands international festivalruns from 22 August to 6 September.

At least, not in cinemas. However, for the first time in Bond history, the world will meet a newJames Bondin a video game, before a new 007 makes their debut on film.As developed by Danish studio IO Interactive for next year’s 007 First Light, the new Bond is blandly handsome in a doll-like way. He is fresh-faced, with blue eyes that appear more cocksure than piercing, in contrast to the refined older Bond of most films or Craig’s ruggedness – although he is clearly inspired by Craig’s man-of-action approach. The implication is not that this Bond will eschew these traits but acquire them. First Light is an origin story intended to define one of the most durable protagonists in entertainment for a new generation of game-literate fans.“The way we went about it was to start with the origin. Because then we get to play with questions such as, ‘Who is James Bond the young man, and what does it mean to be a 00 Agent?’” says IO Interactive co-owner and First Light creative director Christian Elverdam. “What does it mean to become 007?”Most James Bond video games to date have been shooters, in the mould of 1997’s wildly popular Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007. Despite the continued success of the first-person shooter genre that GoldenEye helped popularise, subsequent 007 games saw diminishing returns. The tepid reviews and poor sales of 2012’s 007 Legends put Bond’s video-game career on hiatus, until IO approached Eon Productions with a deceptively straightforward pitch: a game that is less about shooting things and more about recreating the experience of a Bond film.“There are great shootouts in the movies – but, if you think about it, it’s not that many, right?” says Elverdam. Correcting this discrepancy between the movies and games became “the nucleus” of IO’s pitch to Eon: to do Bond right in a video game, Elverdam says, meant letting players inhabit a character who is “not always shooting”.This was an easy case for IO to make, because it had done it before. Between 2016 and 2021, the studio released an impressive three-part reboot ofHitman, its series about an elite contract killer. With an admirable lack of self-consciousness, IO kept what worked about older Hitman games (prioritising elegant planning and problem-solving over wanton violence) and jettisoned what didn’t (a sometimes lurid tone and confounding story). The result was remarkable: a series of endlessly replayable puzzles whose solutions involved the untimely deaths of the worst of the global elite with little collateral damage and allowed the assassin to escape entirely unnoticed. Satirical, witty and clever, Hitman: World of Assassination was a compelling calling card for IO to leave in Eon’s hands.“All this stuff [in Hitman] feels like spycraft already,” Elverdam says, “So if we take that, and we take some leaps” – these leaps being the things a Bond game ought to include, such as driving, fisticuffs and, yes, shootouts – “that becomes the pitch for what would eventually be First Light.”View image in fullscreen‘Not always shooting’ … Bond takes to the road in 007 First Light.Photograph: IO InteractiveThe title is apt, as this game is the first glimmer of promising news for an entertainment property in a precarious position. Initially announced asProject 007in November 2020, the game has survived a tumultuous period for Bond, which began withthe $8.45bn (£6.3bn) mergerof the character’s studio home MGM with the e-commerce giant Amazon in March 2022. While the newly christened Amazon MGM would control the lucrative existing Bond catalog, the idea was that creative decisions on future films – including who would play the MI6 agent – would remain with Eon, with producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson steering the family business.Then, this February, Broccoli and Wilsonhanded creative control over to Amazonin an undisclosed but allegedly massive deal that ended the Broccoli family’s 63-year tenure as the stewards of James Bond’s cinematic exploits. In the months since, Amazon has begun to announce its plans, and selectedDenis Villeneuve to direct the next film. But everyone with a passing or professional interest in Bond is still waiting with bated breath fora casting decision, and what it may mean for one of the most lucrative film franchises in the world.With the next cinematic Bond in limbo, however, a new video game Bond can make a stronger impression. The firsttrailer for 007 First Lightisn’t terribly specific but it exudes confidence. It’s a montage affirming that everything fans love about 007 will be present. The death traps and gadgets from the Roger Moore era are there, as is the muscular physicality of Craig’s Bond, and the devil-may-care attitude consistent across all onscreen depictions of the character.View image in fullscreenEverything fans love about the series will be present.Photograph: IO Interactive“If you want to really do this with high ambition, you have to look at the different Bond instalments and figure out what each of them tried to do, and then let that inform your own take,” Elverdam says.While the creative director of First Light has much to say about 007 in general, he is not quite ready to talk specifics in relation to his version. The name of the voice actor playing Bond, for example, remains classified. But Elverdam is aware that, for all Bond’s enduring popularity, he is not a character who can just be dropped thoughtlessly into the modern world.“Every Bond is a Bond of their time, no matter how intentional you are. It’s unavoidable,” he says. “There is a zeitgeist in what you perceive as a threat, what you perceive as aspirational qualities – all that changes over time.” Elverdam rattles off some questions that IO’s version of Bond will consequently contemplate: when do you do your duty? When do you improvise? What does it mean to serve King and Country? Why do it in the first place?If Elverdam and IO are clever enough in answering these questions, they may give the next film-star Bond a run for his money.Explore more on these topicsGamesJames BondfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It seemed faintly ridiculous that Aliens was the chill-out film for this particular moment, but we watched it and, as ever, it hit the spot.‘I am elated each time I watch’: why Rushmore is my feelgood movieRead moreI’ve viewed Aliens at least once a year for the last decade. It is both an excellent and terrible movie. Helmed byJames Cameronin place of the original Alien director Ridley Scott, this pumped-up-on-steroids 1986 sequel retains the grisly design of its predecessor. Its walls and ceilings are covered in wet gloop and fleshy tendrils, like the insides of a giant body. Its monsters bring to life the trailblazing designs of the Swiss “fantastic realist” artist HR Giger. Almost four decades after its release, the film’s world building remains chillingly authentic, as a group of marines – plus a villainous corporate executive, heroic android, feisty lone-survivor child andSigourney Weaver’s gun-toting yet wholesome protagonist Ellen Ripley – discover then attempt to escape a nest of parasitic aliens, their nightmarishly outsized mother and her lethal henchmen.The film’s high stakes are rarely far from the action while it hits just the right balance between absurd terror and genuine emotion. Like many of Cameron’s movies, it simultaneously sends up and fetishizes military power, though ultimately the characters that survive are head-smart first and trigger-happy second. Its cheesy humour stops the violence from descending into cold detachment. The blusterous self-assurance of Bill Paxton’s Pte Hudson is repeatedly undermined by douchebag lines like “We just got our asses kicked, pal!” I’ve watched it so many times, I can picture his exact look of wide-eyed incredulity. Al Matthews’ cigar-loving Sgt Apone satirises the macho marine trope, admonishing his unit with “All right sweethearts, what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?”Aliens is a fast-paced, jump-scare-ridden scramble to violent demise or unlikely escape. Once it’s been rewatched to death, there is a calm relief to its desperate fight for survival. I know who will live and who will perish; that the invasive titular form will ultimately not endure. In place of leaping out of my skin and hiding behind a cushion, viewing this movie now brings something else: the chance to process my own physical and emotional angst. When done well, the horror sci-fi genre functions on multiple levels, creating thrilling entertainment while also inviting its audience to digest real life experiences that are too painful or immediate to look at directly.The culturally deep-rooted terror of women’s bodies and their functions is a central aspect of the movie. The young facehugger aliens attach to their victims’ mouths to plant an embryo inside, which then grows in their hosts’ bodies before bursting out the chest. There are undeniable parallels with the oft-unspoken horrors of pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the unsettlingly sci-fi retrievals and implantations of IVF. The movie revels in a certain revulsion at hyper-fertility and the act of birth, but it also captures the natural fears and frustrations of existing in a body that can grow and explosively eject a living being in a manner that is richly cathartic.Alien designer HR Giger: ‘I am afraid of my visions’Read moreAs a psychotherapist currently in the middle of Kleinian training, I am drawn to embracing the dark side of the body. The British psychoanalyst Melanie Klein addressed the feelings of violence, rage and disgust that can be a normal part of the embodied psyche. I can’t help but see her ideas woven through Aliens, as Ripley relentlessly tears through a grotesque symbol of extreme motherhood. A romcom may distract me temporarily from the bodily dread of IVF needles, speculums and dearly longed for new life, but the visceral sight of exploding eggs and torsos hits something deeper and more real.Aliens, with its invasive, parasitic monsters, finds parallels with other psychological and bodily battles that are often repressed. Over the years, this film has always provided a release, whether working through rage, sexual trauma or long Covid. It strikes the perfect tonal balance that enables momentary relief without further traumatising. After Ripley settles Newt, Hicks and Bishop into their cryo-sleep, her final long rest is well-earned and beautifully peaceful. I, too, always sleep well after watching it, my nightmare-prone mind settled knowing the on-screen and internal big beasts have momentarily been vanquished. I just have to pretend Alien 3 was never made.Aliens is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAlienMy feelgood movieSigourney WeaverJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ina report last year, the UN secretary-general noted that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had not been granted access to the territory since 2015, adding that OHCHR “continued to receive allegations relating to human rights violations, including intimidation, surveillance and discrimination against Sahrawi individuals particularly when advocating for self-determination”.Inits most recent country report, Amnesty International said that the “authorities continued to restrict dissent and the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly in Western Sahara”. Reporters Without Borders has described Western Sahara as a“desert for journalists”and said that “torture, arrests, physical abuse, persecution, intimidation, harassment, slander, defamation, technological sabotage, and lengthy prison sentences are daily fare for Sahrawi journalists”.Last month the UKsuggestedit supported a proposal for Western Sahara to remain under Rabat’s sovereignty but with a degree of self-rule.FiSahara’s organiserssay the recent presence of Nolan’s high-profile cast and crew in Dakhla will help whitewash the Moroccan occupation and normalise the repression.View image in fullscreenAn archway at the entrance to Dakhla carries an image of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APThe festival’s directors said that while Dakhla was “a beautiful location with cinematic sand dunes”, it was, “first and foremost … an occupied and militarised city whose indigenous Sahrawi population is subjected to brutal repression” by Moroccan occupation forces.“By filming part of The Odyssey in an occupied territory … Nolan and his team, perhaps unknowingly and unwittingly, are contributing to Morocco’s repression of the Sahrawi people and to the Moroccan regime’s efforts to normalise its occupation ofWestern Sahara,” said María Carrión, the festival’s executive director.“We are sure that if they understood the full implications of filming a high-profile film in a territory whose Indigenous peoples cannot make their own films about their stories under occupation, Nolan and his team would be horrified.”FiSahara said it was calling on Nolan and his crew and cast to “stand in solidarity with the Sahrawi people who have been under military occupation for 50 years and who are routinely imprisoned and tortured for their peaceful struggle for self-determination”.View image in fullscreenChristopher Nolan winning the best director Oscar for Oppenheimer in 2024.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersCarrión saidMoroccowas keen to control how its occupation was perceived abroad, and used tourism and culture to project a distorted view of life in Western Sahara.“Morocco only allows entry into occupied Western Sahara to those who fit its strategy of selling its occupation to the outside world,” she said. “Tourists who go to Moroccan-built and -owned resorts to practise kitesurfing, companies willing to participate in its plundering of natural resources, journalists willing to toe its line, and high-profile visitors like Nolan and his team who help Morocco sell the narrative that Western Sahara is part of Morocco and that the Sahrawis are content to live under its rule are given the red carpet treatment.”But she said Amnesty International, the UN commissioner for human rights, and “the hundreds of journalists and observers who have been barred or deported from the territory” would tell “a very different story”.The Guardian has contacted Nolan’s representatives for a response, but the director has yet to comment.FiSahara, which was founded in 2004, is held in Sahrawi refugee camps in the Algerian desert. Labelled“the Cannes of the desert”, it aims to use film to “entertain, convey knowledge and empower refugees from the Western Sahara”.Explore more on these topicsWestern SaharaChristopher NolanMoroccoAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaThe OdysseynewsShareReuse this content"

The Cosby Show, which ran between 1985 and 1992, was groundbreaking in featuring an affluent African American family in Brooklyn, New York: Cosby starred as Cliff Huxtable, an obstetrician, and Phylicia Rashad as his wife, Clair, a lawyer, with Warner as their middle child, Theo, and Sabrina Le Beauf, Lisa Bonet, Tempestt Bledsoe and Keishia Knight Pulliam as their daughters.Cliff and Clair were portrayed as loving and nurturing, but strict, parents. When auditioning for the role of Theo during the final round of a nationwide search, Warner was far from what Cosby – who co-created the sitcom – wanted. “They were looking for a 6ft 2in 15-year-old,”he recalled, “and I was 5ft 5in and 13. I played those scenes like you see kids on television, kind of smart-alecky, and when Cliff said something, I got my hand on my hips and [was] rolling my eyes.” Cosby was unimpressed. “Would you really talk to your father like that?” he asked. “No,” said Warner. “Well, I don’t want to see that on this show,” said the star.Warner was given a second chance, and over the sitcom’s eight-year run – during which it won six Emmy awards and a nomination for Warner’s performance – he became a role model for teenagers, sharing his tips on coping with adolescence in a book, Theo and Me: Growing Up Okay (1988). The Cosby Show’s final episode finished with Theo’s graduation from New York University, and Warner left with a sense of pride in the legacy left by the programme for its depiction of both race and class.He later lamented that this was tainted by allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment made against Cosby. “That’s the thing that saddens me the most,” Warner said in 2015, “because in a few generations the Huxtables will have been just a fairy tale. The legacy can’t help but be tarnished.”The son of Pamela (nee McGee) and Robert Warner, who worked in drug intervention programmes, he was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and named after the civil rights activist Malcolm X and the jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal. He and his mother moved to Los Angeles following his parents’ divorce.His first television appearances were in episodes of the private investigator drama Matt Houston (in 1982) and in the performing arts school series Fame (in 1983), before he landed the part of Theo in The Cosby Show. While the series was running, he attended the Professional Children’s school in New York. He also reprised his role as Theo in the spin-off A Different World (in 1988 and 1989) and guest-starred in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (in 1990 and 1991), playing the boyfriend of a cousin of Will Smith’s streetwise teenager.View image in fullscreenIn 2013 Warner shared a Grammy with the Robert Glasper Experiment and Lalah Hathaway for their cover of Stevie Wonder’s song Jesus Children of America.Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/APWarner remained busy on television, popping up in guest roles in many series, but also starring in two sitcoms: with Eddie Griffin as chalk-and-cheese flat-sharers and business partners in Malcolm & Eddie (1996-2000) and as Dr Alex Reed, a professor married to a psychologist in a blended family, in Reed Between the Lines (2011-15).He also played the cynical but compassionate Kurdy Malloy, assistingLuke Perry’s title character, in the post-apocalyptic action series Jeremiah (2002-04); Lieutenant Chuck Cooper in the police procedural Major Crimes (from 2013 to 2016); Julius Rowe, a prison psychologist, in Suits (from 2016 to 2017); and AJ Austin, a gifted but volatile surgeon, in the hospital drama The Resident (2018-23). In films, he appeared as a thug inFool’s Gold(2008), alongside Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.As a director, he went behind the camera for The Resident and other programmes, as well as music videos for New Edition and Five Star.With the band Miles Long, Warner played the bass guitar and recited poetry over the music for several EP and album releases. He shared a 2013 Grammy with the Robert Glasper Experiment and Lalah Hathaway for his spoken-word contribution to a cover of the Stevie Wonder song Jesus Children of America, recorded as a memorial to the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut.Warner was married and had a daughter.

The immigrant melting pot of New York is his stage; the intricate English language his prop. Shteyngart’s characters, typically lightly veiled alter egos, are always getting lost, tripping up and mangling basic social interactions. It’s the missed connections and short circuits that give his fictions their spark.Shteyngart’s sixth novel is a lively, skittish Bildungsroman, shading towards darkness as it tracks the journey – literal, educational, emotional – of 10-year-old Vera Bradford-Shmulkin, an overanxious, over-watchful academic high achiever whose run of straight As has just been blighted by a B. “Being smart is one of the few things I have to be proud of,” laments Vera, who diligently maintains a “Things I Still Need to Know Diary” in which she makes note of difficult words and intriguing figures of speech. The girl is articulate and precocious, bent on self-improvement, and never mind the fact that she confuses “facile” with “futile” and “hollowed” with “hallowed” and is wont to wax lyrical about the “she-she” districts of Manhattan. Her vocabulary is almost – but crucially not quite – sufficient to give us the whole story and explain what it means.Always happy to show his workings, Shteyngart cites Henry James’s 1897 novel What Maisie Knew as the prompt for Vera, or Faith’s child’s-eye account of complicated adult affairs, although his gauche heroine bears a passing resemblance to the author himself as portrayed in his 2014 memoir,Little Failure. Friendless Vera lives with her rackety Russian-Jewish father, Igor (Shteyngart’s name at birth), who edits a floundering liberal arts magazine, her harried Wasp stepmother, Anne (who added the “e” in tribute toAnne Frank), and a boisterous younger half-brother, Dylan, who likes exposing himself to houseguests. But she also has (or possibly had) a Korean-born mother, long since vanished from the scene. Invisible Iris Choi plays the tale’s white whale or MacGuffin; the elusive hidden figure that Vera is determined to locate.Desperate to redeem herself at school, Vera prepares to debate in support of a piece of racist legislationThe eccentric Bradford-Shmulkins are lurching towards crisis, but they seem a model of stability when compared with the rest of the country, which reveals itself in unflattering flashes in the corners of the narrative. Shteyngart’s novel, we come to realise, plays out a decade from now, in a “post-democracy” USA where red state officials monitor menstrual cycles, self-driving cars shop their owners to the feds and the news platforms are abuzz with Russian disinformation. Desperate to redeem herself at school, Vera prepares to debate in support of the proposed “Five-Three Amendment”, a piece of racist legislation that would grant added voting weight to those “exceptional Americans” whose ancestors arrived before the revolutionary war, “but were exceptional enough not to arrive in chains”. In so doing, of course, she’s arguing against her own interests. Blond, blue-eyed Dylan would count as an “exceptional American”. Dark‑haired, brown-eyed Vera would not.Henry James provides the prompt but his involvement begins and ends there, because Vera, or Faith isn’t Jamesian at all. The prose is simple, breezy and conversational, even when it’s stumbling artfully over its words. If Shteyngart’s novel possesses anything so fixed as a north star or a patron saint, it’s surely not James but Vladimir Nabokov. The title references Ada, or Ardor, while its protagonist comes styled in the manner of a pint-sized Timofey Pnin: a dogged innocent caught between cultures and half-lost in translation. In the course of her adventures, Vera learns that she was named after Nabokov’s wife, “a woman who was a genius herself but in the olden days she had to serve her husband”. Vera Nabokov’s 21st-century namesake – driven and decent and at the top of her class – similarly risks being dismissed as a second-class citizen.The novel is busy and ingratiating, almost to a fault, which is to say that it feels distracted, unsettled; a cultural code-switcher itself. Vera, or Faith was reputedly drafted at speed in a little under two months, incorporating elements from a spy novel that the author had recently abandoned. That accounts for its messy vitality and its frequent, perturbing shifts of gear. Shteyngart’s ode to a good American in a bad America conspires to be, by turns, a rueful human comedy and a coming-of-age caper, a dystopian chiller and an espionage yarn. The colourful tale never satisfyingly hangs together; its component pieces tend to jar more than gel. But Shteyngart sets about his material with abundant energy and charm. He sketches a convincing caricature of a near-future USA and provides a stoical heroine that we can uncomplicatedly root for. Even in a degraded, compromised, up-is-down social climate, that has to be deserving of a solid B grade at least.Vera, or Faith by Gary Shteyngart is published by Atlantic (£16.99).

When he stood at the foot of his aircraft steps as he left Iran for the last time in January 1979, tears streaming down his cheeks and killer cancer working away inside him, surely even the stoniest heart must have felt some pity for this fallen autocrat?Not so. The stony heart of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini contained only rage and a desire for vengeance towards the King of Kings (the Iranian monarch’s official designation). “This man has no place in Iran, and no place on Earth,” Khomeini told me in a chilling television interview before leaving Paris for Tehran. On the plane bringing him back from a 15-year exile a few days later to overthrow the shah’s regime, Khomeini muttered that he felt nothing –hichi– on returning home.The fact is, not many of the people close to him really loved the shah. He let his friends down, he dithered, he habitually took the advice of the last person he spoke to. “He was a difficult man to like,” said Sir Anthony Parsons, the British ambassador during the shah’s last days, who was closer to him than any other foreign diplomat. “He was so suspicious, so certain we were all trying to do him down. And yet there was a naked vulnerability about him which made you feel genuinely sorry for him.”King of Kings is a good and worthwhile account of his undoing, even if part of the subtitle – The Unmaking of the Modern Middle East – promises more than it delivers. It amply demonstrates the ways in which the shah was the author of his own downfall, constantly interfering in things he should have stayed away from. Of course there were broader causes of the Islamic revolution, chiefly the tidal wave of corruption that overwhelmed Iran when the oil price quadrupled after 1973; though the shah was partly responsible even for that, urging OPEC to screw more and more money from the battered west. But the revolution’s immediate cause was a single foolish brainwave of his own, at the very start of 1978 – exactly a year before he was dethroned.That was when the shah entertained Jimmy Carter, and his wife, Rosalynn, at the Niavaran Palace in Tehran. There they celebrated the apparent fact that for the first time in years there was no major threat to either of their nations. Peace and stability seemed entrenched. As Anderson notes, it was the last time an American president would set foot on Iranian soil. Days, perhaps hours after the Carters left, the shah called a senior minister and told him to organise a pseudonymous, innuendo-laden newspaper article accusing the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini of being a British agent. The minister, an intelligent and rational man, complained that publishing the article would stir up trouble. But the shah, buoyed up by Carter’s compliments, refused to listen.The article did stir up trouble. Khomeini’s followers in the religious schools of Qom and other centres poured out on to the streets in violent protest, and the army and police shot some of them down. In Shia Islam and Persian custom, each burial is followed 40 days later by another public commemoration, and every time, the police and army killed more demonstrators.Even when the demonstrations were a regular and growing occurrence, the Ayatollah Khomeini, the absentee leader of the demonstrations, had long been a virtual prisoner in the Shia religious centre of Najaf, in neighbouring Iraq, then ruled by Saddam Hussein. It was impossible for outsiders to get to Najaf and speak to Khomeini; but for no good reason the shah put immense pressure on Hussein to get rid of him. Hussein (who had no time for the shah and could see how this would end) duly threw Khomeini out. Khomeini’s more worldly-wise advisers persuaded him to take shelter near Paris, in the village of Neauphle-le-Château, where, as Anderson puts it “the residents [adjusted] to the sight of the old man in his black turban and brown robes given to morning strolls along the surrounding country lanes”. Suddenly, the world’s press could visit him and interview him whenever they wanted, and every word was beamed back to Iran. By November 1978 the shah’s downfall was inescapable.Anderson’s book suffers, in a way so many accounts by American writers seem to do, from concentrating on the Iran-US relationship to the virtual exclusion of any other (his excellent bookLawrence in Arabia’ was naturally free of this limitation). But he has interviewed some of the key people, including the genuinely tragic figure of the shahbanu, Farah Pahlavi, who understood what was happening in Iran but failed to influence her husband sufficiently, and gives a thorough overview of the sweep of events.From the Middle East to the war in Ukraine, the world is still experiencing the aftershocks of the fall of the shah, and it’s not over yet. And all, one is tempted to say, because this latter-day Richard II couldn’t help meddling in things best left alone. It was a tragedy – and not just for him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Hailey Freeman in 40 Acres is the former – it’s in the genes. Her great-great-grandfather was a slave who escaped a plantation and made his way to Canada to farm. Now the land is Hailey’s and helpfully she’s ex-military, which comes in handy fending off cannibalistic marauders in a post-apocalyptic hellscape. Even better, she’s played by Danielle Deadwyler, the actor inexplicably snubbed for an Oscar nomination for Till.Set 14 years after a fungal pandemic wiped out the planet’s animal life, 40 Acres is essentially a home invasion thriller. Unfortunately, not everyone has gone vegan; gnarly cannibals prowl in packs, human body parts dangling from their necks as trophies. On the farm, Hailey (Deadwyler) lives with her partner Galen (Michael Greyeyes), his daughter, their kids, and her teenage son Manny (Kataem O’Connor). Galen is of Indigenous heritage, and is teaching the family Cree. To survive, Hailey rules her household like a general: iron discipline and daily push-ups. Deadwyler plays it with grit and feeling; her beautifully expressive eyes convey Hailey’s strength but at the same time the constant terror.Deadwyler’s performance is the driving force here. Without her, the audience’s attention might drift to the predictability of a plotline that hinges on Manny’s adolescent rebellion against his mum. There’s also the matter of some unnecessary flashbacks filling in backstories, leaking out tension. Which is a shame because first time feature director RT Thorne skilfully executes the cat-and-mouse games between the farm and the invaders, resulting in some uncomfortably suspenseful moments. And there are really interesting ideas, too, about this new horror in the context of Black and Indigenous experiences: displacement, generational trauma and survival.40 Acres is in UK cinemas and on MGM+ from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsThrillersHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Made after he withdrew from directing Howl’s Moving Castle for Studio Ghibli, it flits between a fraught, soap-operaish saga about a family reunion near the city of Ueda and the metaverse of Oz. It isn’t as sophisticated perhaps in its understanding of the online/real-world interface as his2021 film Belle, but the multilayered storytelling still shows plenty of panache, especially on the visual front.Maths boffin Kenji (voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas in the English-language dub) is browbeaten by schoolmate Natsuki (Brina Palencia) into attending her great-grandmother Sanae’s (Pam Dougherty) 90th birthday on her family estate; she needs a willing victim to pose as her boyfriend to impress the matriarch. Fending off his new in-laws, the teenager – also a part-time moderator for Oz – solves an encrypted math problem that opens a backdoor for a malevolent AI called Love Machine to corrupt the network. With much of the world dependent on the services hosted by Oz, much more than the birthday party is at stake.Hosoda shows a novelistic attention to detail that puts Summer Wars a cut above genre anime: from the sense of history underpinning the sprawling Jinnouchi family, always harping on about being descending from famously uncowable samurai, to the baseball game that is a meta-commentary on the unfolding online catastrophe. The deep texturing also extends to the images: not only the translucent and, from a 2025 perspective, somewhat utopian-looking online realm, but also piercing touches of IRL beauty. Sanae’s flowers blooming by night as Kenji solves his maths puzzle is a particularly delicate touch.Insisting, via Sanae, on family solidarity and civic spirit in the face of existential challenges, Hosoda also shows something of a moralistic streak. But in the case of Summer Wars, this conviction dissipates somewhat in a gabbled finale that leans into the film’s frantic tempo and assigns every Jinnouchi a supposedly key role in defeating Love Machine. Battling an apparently motiveless AI – whose link to bad boy prodigal son Wabisuke (J Michael Tatum) is underexploited – it feels increasingly consequenceless, as virtual action often does. But the narrative complexity and bravura imagery still impress.Summer Wars is in UK cinemas from 3 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeThrillersDrama filmsJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Daniel Bye’s adaptation of the L Frank Baum tale, the colourful creatures speak a Latinate amalgam of languages that is almost – but not quite – comprehensible.

The score by Bay Bryan and Claire O’Connor sparkles with vocal harmonies and pretty tunes, momentarily making us forget the evergreen songs from the movie.With the wit of Bye’s script and the energy of Elvi Piper’s staging, the production is a step up from recent promenades around the park. Pitfalls remain – singing to backing tracks, too much waiting around and an unnecessary interval – but Yolonda, with her Scarecrow (Tori Burgess), Tin Man (Gareth Cassidy) and Cowardly Lion (Helen Longworth), keeps us rooting for her as she counters the sleepy spells of the Wicked Witch (Lisa Howard) and exchanges her red shoes for a pair of silvery wellies that, magically, enable her to walk on water.Ostensibly, Dorothy is on a quest to find her dog – and, yes, Toto makes a grand entrance – but her deeper aim, armoured with courage, brains and heart, is to learn the power of love. It is that power that turns the witch into nothing but a pointy red hat bubbling up from the lake and gives Dorothy the capacity to wake up from her reverie, at peace with her adoptive family and ready, like us, for home.AtWilliamson Park, Lancaster, until 24 August.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreChildren's theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The slow movement duly occupied centre stage in Ryan Wigglesworth’s somewhat restrained interpretation with theBBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, its utterances simple, yet profound. This was no funeral oration, however, but a fond farewell, its tender tones occasionally ruffled by the phalanx of Wagner tubas unsettling the harmonies towards the bottom of the orchestra.Wigglesworth’s conducting benefited from his composer’s ear: orchestral balance was spotless; instrumental colours blended with an instinct for detail. Equally effective was his way of always keeping something in reserve, especially important in Bruckner where the slow build is paramount. In the first movement, the architectural framework was clearly defined, the conductor adopting a (mostly) non-interventionist approach to phrasing and rubato. Not that the performance lacked incident, with great wodges of brass giving way to the sound of solitary flutes crying in the wilderness. In contrast, the scherzo was almost jaunty. It was left to the finale to climb one final mountain and end in a blaze of glory.View image in fullscreenMariam Batsashvili plays Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 20, with Ryan Wigglesworth and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.Photograph: Mark AllanA similar grasp of the musical trajectory paid dividends in Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 20. Wigglesworth kept the orchestral sound down, though its sinister presence was always there, lurking beneathMariam Batsashvili’s vital account of the solo line. The Georgian pianist gave an enthralling, controlled performance, notes dropping like liquid pearls. Her choice of Beethoven’s flinty cadenzas upped the dramatic stakes. The central Romance was finessed with a supple grace before a fiery finale in which the conductor finally allowed the orchestra its head. Batsashvili’s encore, Liszt’s La Campanella, was dispatched in a blur of coruscating finger work, proving she can showboat with the best.The concert opened with For Laura, after Bach, composed by the conductor in tribute to the BBCSSO’s former leaderLaura Samuel, who died last year. Inspired by her recording of the Gigue from Bach’s third solo partita, Wigglesworth incorporated its themes into an elaborate 10-minute memorial for strings where wheeling violins soared heavenward in intricate canons and sombre cello lines hinted at heartbeats and lullabies.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Then again, the name, suggestive of a 1970s-style fat farm, is misleading. Based in a rustic farmhouse in the hills north-east of Nikšić, the country’s second largest city, theYoga getawayI’m here to sample may focus on wellness and plant-based food – the antithesis of traditional Montenegrin fare – but its friendly dogs and cats would de-stress many a frazzled urbanite.“We especially want to take care of solo travellers, tailor stays to their needs, and help them reconnect with themselves and nature,” says co-owner Andjela Djokic, as amiable Sivi, part hunting dog, part sheepdog, trots out for a sniff.View image in fullscreenThe retreat is my first stop on a whirlwind trip exploring Central Montenegro. Unlike the overcrowded Adriatic coast (in 2024,94%of overnight stays in the Balkans country were in coastal areas), the interior of Montenegro is virgin territory for nature lovers. Historically a battleground – the Romans and Ottomans lorded over the region – for me it’s love at first sight, a landscape brimming with pristine karst mountains, forests, lakes and rivers.Getting here involved an 80-minute drive from Podgorica, the capital, on a panoramic road, one that on a clear day (alas, it’s gloomy when I arrive) takes you within view ofOstrog Monastery, cut high into a rock face in the Dinaric Alps. (These, I learn, stretch the length of the Balkans.) Still, as the wispy clouds trail across the peaks and ridges, I feel I’m entering a delicious hinterland.At the farm, which Andjela runs with her husband, Matija, I settle into my en suite apartment, one of two available to guests. Once a stone barn, it has a balcony from which to soak up the rippling birdsong and mountain scenery. Over in the shared community space, a homely kitchen-cum-lounge area, I tuck into scrambled eggs and thick Montenegrin coffee. “Every day is a mission to find the eggs,” chuckles my host.View image in fullscreenJini Reddy hiking up to Durkovo Brdo viewpoint.Photograph: Dušan StuparLater, I’ll visit the chicken coop and permaculture garden, and hear about plans to transition to solar power, but right now I’m itching to unfurl my limbs.It’s too wet for yoga, offered on a wooden platform in a meadow on the farm’s 19 acres of land. Instead, sockless, I tread gingerly on the adjacent barefoot walk, an array of beach pebbles, pine cones, moss and sharp stones. The sensory stimulus (nature’s reflexology) awakens me from my post-travel stupor. There’s just time for a snack and a glorious toast withrakija, the local spirit, before Tamara Miljanic, the serene yoga and meditation teacher, offers a pranayama (yogic breathwork) session. As the flute-like call of a cuckoo haunts the skies, I feel the tension seep out of my body. After a salad supper, made by a holistic nutritionist who joins us for the meal, I sleep like a log.A winding road leads us through the beautiful terrain, carpeted with meadows, and dotted with peaks and hobbity holiday homesThe next morning the sun is out and I try the property’s heart trail – another cue to be mindful. Wandering along the kilometre-long wooded path, I step over soft, moss-covered stones and flit from wildflower to wildflower like a butterfly. I spot carmine-hued thistle, elegant mauve lupins, ox-eye daisies and dog roses. The dogs, who have come along, plonk themselves next to me like forest sentinels when I sit quietly for a bit.It’s hard to leave, but Vučje calls. Amountain lodge and tourist centrewithin the wider Nikšić region, 18 miles to the east, Vučje is a ski resort in winter and the perfect spot for hiking, horse-riding and cycling in the warmer months. Nestled in a valley, it lies south of the vaunted alpine jewel that isDurmitornational park.View image in fullscreenFitCamp Montenegro is based in a rustic farmhouse in the hills.Photograph: Jini ReddyA slow-food culture is embraced here. After a stroll in the woods, in the company of the Vučje dogs (owner Andjahas a soft spot for strays) it’s time for a feast. “We cure our own meat,” she says, waving towards the meat-drying room. I do my best with a pork steak steeped in cream and mushrooms,kačamak(a rich, tasty concoction made of wheat and cornflour, potatoes, cheese and cream) and local wine – and silently apologise to my arteries. (Vučje caters to vegetarians too.)The room I’m staying in is a little worn but comfortable. In the morning, afterpriganice(moreish fritters with rosehip jam), more cured meat andpljevaljski(a local cheese), I hike to Durkovo Brdo, a popular viewpoint and, at 1,546 metres, an easy-to-climb peak. Two charming guides, Enisa Djokovic and Dušan Stupar, lead the way. Enisa points out the wild garlic, beloved of the local ursine population, as we emerge from the forest canopy to open pastures ringed by mountains.“We call them ‘bear onions’,” she says. “But don’t worry, we carry pepper spray.”I board a small boat for a ride on the lake, through narrow channels teeming with birdlife. ‘This is our Amazon,’ says the captainLater, the pair drive me eastward to Lukavica, a mountain plateau. A winding road leads us through the beautiful terrain, carpeted with meadows, and dotted with peaks andkatuns, hobbity holiday homes (some still used by sheep herders).Astonishingly, ours is the only vehicle. When I step outside, the silence feels potent. A deer bobs away in the distance, and a lone church, St Ilija, stands framed by the mountains. “There is a 2,000-year-old gravestone here,” says Dušan, before pointing to the looming peak, Mali Žurim (1,962 metres). It looks impossibly steep. “Next time you come we can hike it. It’s easier than it looks,” he says.View image in fullscreenJini on a bike ride to Lake SkadarAfter a coffee stop at Lake Kapetanovo Jezero, where I spot wild horses, we drive back and the heavens open. Enisa tells me she is Muslim, “from a small village near Podgorica”, and that she celebrates Ramadan and Eid. Dušan, who is also her partner, is Bosnian and Orthodox Christian. “During the war, my family fled across the mountains,” he says, quietly. “I was a child and my mother was pregnant at the time.” I wonder if, for him, the mountains represent refuge, a place of sanctuary.Wild east: five Balkn discover for your next holidayRead moreFor my last day, I head south toJablan Winery, in the village of Rvaši, south of Podgorica. Wine tastings are popular here, and you can rent an apartment amid the vines. I’ve spied the e-bikes and I’m off, down euphoria-inducing hairpin bends to Lake Skadar, the largest in southern Europe and anational park. Framed by forest-green slopes, the views of the serpentine Rijeka Crnojevića river and canyon, within the lake system, are ethereal, like a fairytale.At a small resort named after the river, I park the bike and board a smallboatfor a ride on the lake, through narrow channels teeming with birdlife. “This is our Amazon,” says Captain Dusko, at the helm, before telling us the giantDalmatian pelicanis Skadar’s symbol. As we drift past a carpet of water lilies, I spy a jet-black pygmy cormorant diving for fish, and grey herons in flight. Back on shore, the captain whips up a meal of smoked carp, carp paté, fish soup and grilled trout at hislakeside restaurant. Then it’s back on the bike to the vineyard, where a glass of natural wine lulls me into a contented sleep, nursing a yen to return to this enchanted land.The trip was provided by FitCamp Montenegro; its five-nightyogagetawayis available May-November for €900, including breakfast, activities and a day trip.

If the words “halloumi fritters” have your friends and family zooming towards a tray as quickly as mine, you might even want to double up on the quantities below. Unsurprisingly, these are also my children’s preferred way to eat courgettes.Prep20 minCook20 minMakes25+200g courgettes, trimmed and coarsely gratedSalt200g halloumi, coarsely grated200g drained chickpeas(jarred, ideally), mashed with a fork40g plain flour1egg4-5tbsp olive oil50g mayonnaise50g greek yoghurtJuice of ½ lemon10g chopped dillPut the grated courgette in a sieve with a pinch of salt, mix, then leave to sit for 10 minutes while you prep the other ingredients. Tip the courgette into a tea towel or kitchen roll, then squeeze it out to expel all the excess water.In a large bowl, mix the courgette with the halloumi and mashed chickpeas until well incorporated, then stir in the flour and egg to make a thick batter.Put a tablespoon of the oil in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, then, working in batches, scoop scant tablespoons of the fritter mixture into the hot oil, using a second tablespoon to nudge and shape them into neat rounds. Fry the fritters on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through, then transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain. Repeat until you’ve used up all the batter (with my largest frying pan, this usually takes four batches).While the fritters are frying, mix the mayonnaise, yoghurt, lemon juice and dill in a small bowl and set aside. If you’re not eating the fritters straight away, leave to cool, then cover and refrigerate, along with the dip, until needed. Warm through in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for five minutes, then arrange on a platter and serve with the dip in a nice bowl in the middle.Explore more on these topicsSnacksQuick and easyFoodVegetablesCheeseGreek food and drinkBeans, pulses and legumesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Surprisingly for us, visiting from England, that meant he got a driver, a gun, a nice pad to live in and a team of sensational cooks to dish up various delicacies from wherever he was stationed. In the south, his favourite was black pork curry, and at my restaurantRambutanwe now make a marinade from similar spices for pineapple, beef and, my preference, chicken, before we grill it over coals. To lift it a little, the bird is finished with a quick fragrant oil of tempered spices and parsley (similar to the peppery island herb we callvallarai). You can eat it with or without the cool, green coconut rice and tomato sambol, which is my attempt to recreate a very tasty lunch I had at one of my favourite Colombo spots, Taste of Asia.Green coconut rice with tomato and red onion sambolFragrant with spices, cooked in coconut milk and with a grassy, fresh taste from the greens, this rice is very quick and easy, and perfect with the citrussy, tomato sambol that you find all over the island.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4For the rice50g spinach, washed15g fresh coriander, washed2½cm piece fresh root ginger, peeled2 garlic cloves, peeled250g white rice25g salted butter3green cardamom pods, gently crushed5black peppercorns150ml coconut milk2 tsp saltFor the sambol1 large ripe tomato, cut into 10-12 wedges½ large red onion, peeled and finely sliced1-2 green finger chillies, finely sliced, or to taste2 limes1 tsp salt, to taste1 tbsp coconut oil, or neutral oilPut the spinach, coriander, ginger and garlic in a small blender or food processor, and blitz to a smooth paste – you want all the fibres to break down, so you may need to add a splash of water to help things along.Put the rice in a fine-meshed strainer and rinse under cold running water for about a minute, until the water runs mostly clear (this helps remove any surface starch, so the grains will be fluffy and separate when cooked). Leave the rice to drain.Melt the butter in a medium-sized pan on a medium heat, then add the cardamom and black peppercorns and cook on a low heat for a minute or two – the spices should turn fragrant and start to sizzle slightly, but the butter should not be browned.Stir the washed rice and blended greens into the butter, then pour in the coconut milk, salt and 300ml water, and bring to a boil. Turn down to a low simmer, cover and cook for 17-20 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and has absorbed all the liquid; stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and leave covered to keep warm while you make the sambol.In a bowl, combine the tomato, red onion and green chilli. Season with lime juice, salt and oil, then taste and add more salt if need be. Mix well, making sure to break up the onion slices.To assemble the dish, spread the rice over a large platter. Spoon some sambol over some of the rice, put the rest in a bowl to the side and serve.Black chicken with tempered parsleyView image in fullscreenPrep15 minMarinade2 hr+Cook1 hr 15 minServes4For the black spice mix1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp fennel seeds2 tsp black peppercorns1 stick cinnamon1 tsp cardamom seeds1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp cloves seeds2 tsp chilli powderFor the chicken1 large whole chicken(about 1½-2kg)4 tbsp black spice mix(see above and method)1 head garlic, cloves separated and peeled1 handfulcurry leaves, fresh, ideally120ml cider vinegar1 tbsp salt3 large red onions, peeled and cut into wedges3 sticks lemongrassFor the temper100ml coconut oil, or neutral cooking oil½ tbsp mustard seeds½tsp cumin seeds¼tsp fennel seeds4-5 fresh curry leaves½ bunch parsley, finely chopped1shallot, peeled and finely diced2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely diced2tsp cider vinegarSalt, to tasteRoast all the whole spices for the spice mix (ie, everything bar the chilli powder) in a dry frying pan on a low to medium heat, stirring often, for five minutes, until they smell fragrant. Take off the heat, leave to cool, then tip into a spice grinder or mortar and blitz or grind to a fine powder. Put the powder back in the dry pan and toast on a high heat, stirring constantly, for a minute or two, until it turns dark brown and almost black in colour; this will turn them nutty and almost smoky. Take off the heat, leave to cool completely, then stir in the chilli powder. Store in a clean sealed jar and use within two months.Turn the chicken breast side down, use kitchen scissors to cut all the way along each side of the backbone, then lift it out and discard (or save for stock). Flip the bird over so it’s now breast side up, then press down with the palm of your hand to flatten and spatchcock it.For the marinade, mix four tablespoons of the black spice mix in a roasting tray with the peeled garlic, curry leaves, vinegar, salt and red onions. Rub this mixture all over the bird, making sure you get it into all the crevices and under the skin, then cover and put in the fridge to marinade for two hours or overnight.Take the chicken out of the fridge at least half an hour before you want to cook it. Lightly bash the lemongrass stalks, so they smell fragrant.To barbecue the bird, lay it skin side down over medium-heat coals, put the lemongrasson top, then cover with foil. After 20 minutes, uncover and grill for 20 minutes more, until the skin crisps up and the chicken is cooked through yet juicy – if you have a probe, it should have an internal temperature of 70C. Alternatively, cover and roast in an 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for about 40 minutes, again topped with the lemongrass, until the juices run clear.Put the chicken to one side to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the quick tempered oil. Put the oil in a small pan on a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the mustard seeds and cook for 20 seconds,until they start to pop a little (be careful not to burn them, though). Turn down the heat, add the cumin and fennel seeds, and cook for 30 or so seconds, until fragrant. Tip into a bowl, stir in the curry leaves and leave to coolto warm. Stir the parsley, shallot, garlic and vinegar into the cooled temper, then season to taste.Carve the chicken, arrange on a platter, dress with the parsley temper and serve.Cynthia Shanmugalingam is chef/owner ofRambutan, London SE1Explore more on these topicsSri Lankan food and drinkMain courseFoodChickenRiceSide dishesMeatrecipesShareReuse this content"

Now, on one cup a day, I feel so much betterI kicked my habit on a retreat. Now I savour my daily coffee dose, which clears my thoughts and gives me a sense of wellbeingArifa AkbarMon 28 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShare‘Alittle bit of what you fancy” is a call for moderation that has never worked for me. Not for my coffee habit, at least, which slides from the steely resolve to drink just two cups a day, to a wobbly-willed four, five mugs, or more. I’m better at giving it up altogether. Total detox brings the high of self-control and the illusion that I have overcome the caffeine addiction, at least until I fall off the wagon again.But some vices shouldn’t be given up, because they bring pleasure – and coffee is one of those for me. I love its mood-transforming uplift. It revs me up and calms me down. I once gave it up for two months – my longest abstention – hoping to shake off a virulent bout of insomnia, and it seemed as if I had entered the wilderness. Life felt more austere and my sleeplessness wasn’t solved, either. It was lose-lose.So, three months ago, I decided, emphatically, not to kick the habit (and fail again) but to enjoy a single daily dose. This was initially born out of necessity: I went to a retreat where we were limited to a single cup of freshly ground coffee a day, at a time of our choosing, and I took great pains over deciding when I’d have mine, and where. Then I savoured it, desperate to make its effects last.Strangely, when I got back home, I stuck to that single cup.It has turned from an unthinking habit into a treat. You could call it mindful coffee drinkingIt is a change that feels simultaneously small and immense. I haven’t slid back into excess, even in times of stress. I don’t glug it down while scrolling or sitting at my laptop. I sit down and enjoy it, that’s all. It has turned from an unthinking habit into a treat. You could call it mindful coffee drinking, I suppose. Several times a week, I go down to a dinky little cafe called Lilac on my north London high street, where they also sell coffee by the kilo, which they grind freshly. I have found that the nicer the coffee, the less I need of it.A moment that changed me: I stopped drinking – and realised what friendship really meantRead moreIf Idofeel a desire for more, I ask myself why. Am I anxious or tired? In which case, wouldn’t it be better to rest? Or am I thirsty? Is this a physiological craving or a psychological one? Because water perks up the organs and wakes up the mind, too. I have found myself gravitating towards the exotic loose-leaf herbal tea and realised that my apparent craving for a coffee is simply the need for a warm drink and a break from work. A habit is sometimes a displacement activity; once I had become conscious of the underlying reasons for mine, I could address them.Importantly, I feelbetterfor the coffee drinking. It clears my thoughts, and brings a sense of wellbeing. It is a reminder that it is excess that is detrimental, not coffee per se, which has circulatory benefits and is full of antioxidants. It’s amazing how my body has adjusted, too. On the rare occasion that I have had two coffees in one day, I feel uncomfortably wired. The rule of a single cup works, as long as it is actively savoured. A pleasure, not a vice at all.Wolf Moon: A Woman’s Journey Into the Night by Arifa Akbar, is published by Sceptre (£16.99).
