They said this would have a “very bad impact” on the fight against Russia.The White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said Trump would consider restoring aid to Ukraine if peace talks were arranged and confidence-building measures taken. Discussions were ongoing with Ukraine over a date and place for talks, he told Fox News.Speaking on Wednesday in his nightly address Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there had been “positive movement” in cooperation with the US. Results were expected next week involving a future meeting between the two sides, he added. On Thursday, Zelenskyy will join 27 EU leaders as they hold emergency talks in Brussels to agree ways to quickly increase their military budgets.Ukraine’s president is seeking to repair relations with the US after his acrimonious meeting on Friday with Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, during which Trump publicly berated Zelenskyy and accused him of not wanting a deal with Russia.On Tuesday, Zelenskyy wrote a conciliatory letter. It said he was committed to negotiations and ready to work with America under Trump’s “strong leadership”.In a speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump called the letter “important” and said: “I appreciate that he sent this letter … Simultaneously, we’ve had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn’t that be beautiful?”Waltz described the message on Wednesday as a “good, positive first step”. He said: “We’re already talking about confidence-building measures that we’ll then take to the Russians and test that side.” If the negotiations were “nailed down”, Trump would “take a hard look at lifting this pause”, Waltz said.Ukrainian commentators expressed scepticism that a deal could be easily and swiftly reached. They pointed out that the White House had so far asked no concessions of Russia and appeared willing to accept Vladimir Putin’s demands undiluted.Putin has called on Ukraine to give up territory, reduce the size of its military and accept “neutrality” under a new government. Last week Zelenskyy said Ukraine needed security guarantees before it could sign a deal – something an infuriated Trump categorically ruled out.Speaking to Fox, the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, confirmed the intelligence freeze. He expressed confidence that the “pause” on the “intelligence and military front” was temporary and would “go away”. He added: “I think we’ll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have, to push back on the aggression that’s there.”Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said they could not comment on intelligence matters. They said the UK had been clear it would do everything it could to put Ukraine in the strongest position.Experts said the impact of US restrictions on intelligence sharing would depend partly on what precisely had been stopped, and they emphasised that Kyiv was already more capable than Washington appreciated.One western expert familiar with Ukraine’s conduct of the war said Kyiv already made heavy use of open-source and human intelligence to identify Russian targets and was not particularly dependent on the US for targeting information.Giving an example, the person said “oil refineries don’t move”, citing a frequent target of Ukrainian long range-drone attacks. “Donald Trump might be surprised to find that when he pulls the levers they have little impact,” they added.The restrictions would not prevent the UK and other countries from carrying on as before. Wider restrictions on intelligence sharing, such as refusing to share intercepts that provide clues as to Russian strategic intentions or military plans, would have a greater effect.In February 2022, US intelligence told Ukraine that Russia was trying to seizure Hostomel airport north-west of Kyiv. The location’s defences were reinforced. Russia was never able to securely capture the airstrip, which it had intended to use to fly in large numbers of troops to take control of the Ukrainian capital.A Ukrainian defence official acknowledged that a cut-off would be damaging. “We need satellite data to carry out deep strikes. It enables us to identify [Russian] targets and to guide our drones,” he said.As part of his attempt to move on from the Oval Office row, Zelenskyy has offered to sign a minerals deal with the US. Trump has described the agreement as an economic backstop. The presence of US workers on the ground in Ukraine would deter Russia from attack, he argues.A senior official in Kyiv said Ukraine was aware of its precarious position and doing everything it could to fix relations with the US. However, some Ukrainian observers believe Ukrainian concessions will not work and think Washington has definitively swapped sides in the war and is actively helping the Kremlin.The journalistKristina Berdynskykhwrote that Trump’s team was humiliating and threatening Ukraine while not applying any pressure to Putin. “Now every day there is some bad news for Ukraine from the US. And so far, there is no bad news for Russia, but the opposite,” she said.Since US and Russian negotiators began peace talks in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin has stepped up its attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid and civilian infrastructure. It sent a record 267 drones on the third anniversary last month of its full-scale invasion. Another 181 were launched on Wednesday, together with three missiles. A 73-year-old man was killed in the Odesa region and 20 private houses were damaged.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyTrump administrationRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He filmed most of his rapes, and the videos provided key evidence leading to him being convicted and facing years in jail.Most of his victims, who in the videos are unconscious or stupefied because of the drugs he gave them, are as yet unidentified. He ignored their pleas to stop his attacks as they lost consciousness after being drugged, videos played in court showed.1:22Footage shows Zhenhao Zou's arrest and his questioning – videoSome victims may not even know they were attacked because of the effect of the drugs Zou slipped them. Some jurors were left in tears as they watched videos of his attacks.The Guardian understands that 32 of the videos Zou made of rapes were carried out in Britain. Detectives who investigated him believe he may have had about 100 victims in Britain and China. One new potential victim came forward in the last week, with more expected as news of his convictions and method of offending spreads.In all police recovered 58 videos of rapes filmed by Zou, his victims being young women of Chinese heritage.Detectives are still examining mountains of evidence, including millions of social media messages in Mandarin.View image in fullscreenPhotograph issued by the Metropolitan police of a living room shown in the court case of Zhenhao Zou.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PA MediaZou told the jury at Inner London crown court he was a user of extreme pornography who was aroused most by watching videos of sex with unconscious women, as well as by rape role play.He is the subject of what is believed to be the biggest rape investigation in Britain. The Metropolitan police have appealed for anyone who fears they may have been a victim of the seemingly charming well-off student to contact them.Zou, who was studying engineering at University College London, bragged in court of having “five new sexual partners every month”.The Met commander Kevin Southworth said Zou was “predatory and cowardly” and one of the worst offenders police had investigated in recent times. The effect of the date-rape drugs he used could mean victims may not know Zou attacked them.Southworth said: “This man may well turn out to be one of the most prolific sexual offenders we have ever seen in this country.“Some women may not know they were victims.”Zou, a Chinese national, was convicted of 28 counts, including 11 rapes on 10 women and one count of false imprisonment.He was also found guilty of 10 counts of possessing extreme pornography, three of voyeurism and three of committing an offence, namely of possessing butanediol, to commit rape. Once in the human body it is metabolised into the date rape drug GHB.Victims gave harrowing accounts of their ordeal.The prosecutor, Catherine Farrelly KC, said Zou appeared respectable and a gentleman, but the reality was different. “He was a wolf in sheep’s clothing and every woman’s nightmare,” she said.“He was a man who was sexually excited by having sex with a sleeping woman … and sexually excited by the idea of rape. He is a serial rapist, he is a predator. He would use drink or drugs to incapacitate women.”During one video, a woman said: “I really don’t want … I beg you, don’t do this …” and Zou replied: “Don’t push me, it’s pointless … The sound insulation here is very good.”His tactic was to invite women to his home in Woburn Place, central London, or a flat in south London, for drinks or to study.One victim went to Zou’s home for drinks, which were drugged, and later felt tired. Zou had sex with her. She told police: “I can’t fight back, I have no strength,” and was raped while unconscious, the court heard. Video of the incident shot by a camera on a bedside table confirmed her account.The woman’s speech was slurred, and she complained of feeling unwell and wanting to go home, later telling Zou not to restrain her. She screamed and tried to get up from the bed on several occasions, but Zou pushed her back down.The first woman went to the Met on 18 November 2023. Zou was not arrested, and two days later flew to China. He was arrested on his return to the UK in January 2024.Police found designer clothing at Zou’s London home, some of which still had tags on, and a box believed to contain “souvenirs” of his victims.View image in fullscreenImage from a body-worn camera of the arrest of Zhenhao Zou.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PA MediaZou gave evidence during the trial across five days, changing his evidence as he went along.In a police interview, he claimed he had one date-rape drug for use as a moisturiser, but then changed his story before the jury to claim he had used it to get high when he went out clubbing.The jury was told that searches of Zou’s London home had found a cache of drugs.He was acquitted of seven counts, including of possessing MDMA, ketamine and alprazolam so he could commit rape, and two counts of possessing an extreme pornographic image.Zou said he was “in the habit” of filming himself having sex. He first came to Britain to study in 2017 at Queen’s University Belfast. He began his studyies at UCL two years later.The judge, Rosina Cottage KC, warned Zou she was considering a life sentence and told his barrister: “I find your client is a dangerous and predatory sexual offender.“He need be in no doubt that the sentence will be very long.”He will be sentenced on 19 June.Anyone who believes they may have been a victim of Zou can contact police onthis portal.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

I think in the future, can we expect that to continue?“It’s much more difficult to be confident about that. It seems to me there has been a seismic change. We seem to have a president who is willing to bully, cajole the Ukrainian forces into doing things they don’t feel is in their interests.“This is not a blip in the relationship, something fundamental is going on, and we need to look very closely about what we now do about Europe.”He said it was even possible that Trump would end the nuclear cooperation deal with the UK or that the US commitment became so equivocal that Nato’s article 5 mutual defence clause no longer looked plausible.He said such thoughts had been inconceivable until six weeks ago. “I think we now have to conceive of them and address them because they are on the table.”Nigel Sheinwald, the ambassador from 2007 to 2012, said: “America is genuinely changing and the American leadership has changed.”He added: “It’s difficult to find either a conceptual area in international relations or a particular geographical area where our interests are really converging at the moment.“It’s more divergence than convergence. The President [William]McKinley worldview of land grabs … might is right, and all that, that isn’t our view. It won’t be our view, whatever government we have here, given that we are a middle power that uses international institutions for our own advancement as well as because that is morally right.“So at the macro level, there is a huge divergence. On more or less any big foreign policy issue that we’re dealing with today, we don’t agree with the United States and have more alignment with our European partners – whether that is the Middle East, whether it’s Iran, whether it’s climate change, China, but above all on Europe itself.”Sir Peter Westmacott, the UK ambassador from 2012 to 2016, said respectable voices were warning that the US was giving up on Europe in favour of Russia. He said: “That’s pretty alarming. We haven’t had that for decades, and we have to deal with that current reality, and that is the biggest strategic problem.”He said: “Even if we are now back in the business of trying to find a way forward with a combination of a ceasefire plan and security guarantees that Ukraine needs, we still have got that fundamental problem of a very different approach to Russia.”He added that it was unclear if the US had a grand strategy to split off Russia from China, or if instead it was seeking to divide up the world into three big beasts in the jungle – China, Russia and America – with the rest to be told to go hang.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance,” he wrote. “Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!”Trump also made clear there could be repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel’s relentless offensive response to the Hamas 7 October 2023 attacks.“To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!”Trump’s comments came hours after Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said that officials had held “ongoing talks and discussions” with Hamas officials amida shaky ceasefire deal.Leavitt told reporters that Israel had been consulted on the talks and that the US special envoy Adam Boehler “does have the authority to talk to anyone” when “American lives are at stake”.Hamas members confirmed the talks, saying there had been two direct meetings between US officials and Hamas in Doha, the Qatari capital, in recent days.“Several communications took place between Hamas and various American communication channels, the latest being with a US envoy and discussed the issue of Israeli prisoners who hold American citizenship, both the living and the deceased,” a Hamas official told AFP.Israel said it had conveyed its position on direct talks with Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said late on Wednesday, offering no further details.“Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas,” the statement from the prime minister’s office said.“Dialogue and talking to people around the world to do the best interests of the American people is something that the president has proven, is what he believes is good-faith effort to do what’s right for the American people,” Leavitt said.Axios first reported the “secret talks” with Hamas, citing two sources with direct knowledge of meetings held in Doha, Qatar, in recent weeks.The outlet called the talks “unprecedented”, noting that the US had never before engaged with Hamas and that it had declared the group a terrorist organisation in 1997.Under the terms of the hostages-for-ceasefire deal, which went into effect on 19 January, Hamas was expected to release hostages weekly in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.After six weeks, Israel and Hamas were expected to enter a second stage of the negotiations, which would make the ceasefire permanent and secure the release of the remaining hostages.But those talks have not progressed and the White House’s decision to engage directly with Hamas appears to be targeted to meet Trump’s goals of securing the release of all hostages held in Gaza.Trump has previously warned that unless they are released,there will be “hell to pay” in the region, in what appeared to be a threat directed specifically at Hamas.Israel prepares Gaza ‘hell plan’ to pile pressure on Hamas – reportsRead moreBut Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has also pressured Netanyahu to push forward with the negotiations, and was crucial in convincing the Israeli prime minister to sign the original ceasefire deal that went into effect in January.Boehler is tasked with securing the release of Americans who have been “wrongfully detained” by governments or other groups around the world. But it remains unclear whether he is discussing the release of these hostages as part of a longer-term truce, which would mark a significant increase in his authority and indicate that the US could be going around Israel to negotiate an end to the war.Witkoff, the Trump envoywho negotiated the earlier ceasefireand has now been tasked with negotiations with Russia as well, was set to travel to Doha earlier this week to meet the Qatari prime minister about the ceasefire negotiations but “canceled the trip on Tuesday night after he saw there was no progress from Hamas’ side”, a US official told Axios.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the return of his 15bn toman bail, paid by a third party, was dependent on his flogging, which was carried out this week.At the time, Yarrahi wrote on X: “I am ready to receive the sentence of 74 lashes, and while I condemn this inhuman torture, I make no request to cancel it.”The news of the lashes was shared on Wednesday by Zahra Minouei, the singer’s lawyer.Minouei wrote on X on Wednesday that the last part of the sentences issued by the Tehran revolutionary court had been administered.Yarahi wrote on Instagram: “You have brought glass to break our stone. Thank you for your constant support, dear ones, and the sincere companionship of the respected lawyers Mustafa Nili and Zahra Minoui. He who is not willing to pay the price of freedom does not deserve freedom. Wishing you freedom.”News of the medieval-style flogging caused widespread outrage on Iranian social media.Nobel peace prize laureate Narges Mohammadi wrote on Instagram: “The execution of Mehdi Yarrahi’s flogging sentence is revenge for his support for the women of Iran. The flogging on Mehdi’s body is a whip on the proud, resistant women of Iran and the flourishing and powerful soul of the ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ movement.”Masih Alinejad,a well-known US-based human rights campaigner, said: “For every lash they strike, more women will take off their scarves. More voices will rise. And nothing will stop this revolution. To the west: negotiating human rights with barbarians won’t save you. This regime is a virus, it will spread if you let it.”In 2024 at least 131 individuals were sentenced to a combined 9,957 lashes by the Iranian judiciary, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, an Iranian NGO.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It has also been associated with an increased risk of infertility.Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers in Australia report how they studied two groups of monogamous, heterosexual couples in which the women had BV. In one group of 81 couples, the women and their male partners were given oral and topical antimicrobial treatment. In the other group of 83 couples, only women received the tablets and cream. The results were stark.“The trial was stopped by the data and safety monitoring board after 150 couples had completed the 12-week follow-up period because treatment of the woman only was inferior to treatment of both the woman and her male partner,” the researchers write.Overall, 24 of 69 women (35%) in the group where both partners were treated had BV return, compared with 43 of the 68 women in the group where only women were treated. In addition, the team found the average time until an infection returned was longer when both partners were treated.While sex has long been known to be a trigger for BV, experts previously thought it did not meet the criteria for a sexually transmitted infection, partly because earlier research found no improvement in cure rates in women with BV when male partners were given oral antimicrobials alone.Dr Janet Wilson, a consultant in sexual health at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust who was not involved with the work, said the study, while small, supported the view BV was an STI. But she added that many people with BV became “celibate” and found the condition could still be difficult to clear–meaning treating partners did not provide a full solution for preventing infections recurring.“This is a great paper and it will change how we manage BV in those in long-term monogamous relationships,” she said, adding it was a “big step forward”.Of the NHS website’s current page on BV, she said: “Much of the information is outdated and misleading. It should be updated in line with current evidence.”Explore more on these topicsSexual healthWomenHealthWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Handwriting on an order of commitment document filed on Monday said “outside medical”, suggesting he was at a medical facility.The 32-year-old man from Texas is accused of forcibly stealing the earrings from an upscale Orlando shopping center last Wednesday.An Orlando police spokesperson, Kaylee Bishop, said on Wednesday she was checking with the lead detective on whether the earrings had been recovered yet. The earrings’ status also was not known to a deputy who answered the phone but would not give his name in the rural Panhandle county where the suspect was arrested near Chipley, Florida.During the theft, the man allegedly told Tiffany sales associates he was interested in purchasing diamond earrings and a diamond ring on behalf of an Orlando Magic basketball player. Sales associates escorted the man to a VIP room where he could view the jewelry. A short time later, he jumped out of his chair, grabbed the jewelry and tried to force his way out of the door.One of the sales associates was injured trying to block him but managed to knock the diamond ring, valued at $587,000, out of his hands.Detectives obtained the license plate of the suspect’s car through shopping mall security footage and believe he was driving back to Texas. State troopers tracked the car from tag readers on the Florida Turnpike and Interstate 10 until he was pulled over for driving without rear lights in Washington county, almost 340 miles (550km) away, the Orlando police report said.As he was being taken into custody, he swallowed several items troopers believed were the earrings.The suspect was charged with first-degree felony grand theft and robbery with a mask, a third-degree felony. Court records showed no attorney for him, and he was listed as being in police custody in Orange county, Florida, which is home to Orlando, as of Wednesday morning.Explore more on these topicsFloridaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Tidball has physical impairments affecting all four of her limbs and had major surgeries on both her hips and legs as a child.She is speaking publicly about her experiences for the first time to highlight a report showing that disabled mothers and their children have significantly worse neonatal and postnatal NHS care than others.Speaking about the doctor’s request to open her legs, Tidball told the Guardian: “I was shocked, really, that that was their approach, rather than actually looking properly at some of my medical history and the notes around my hips.“They didn’t think about how that orthopaedic surgery might interact with birth, but also [about] carrying the baby and the way the baby was lying in uterus. They just hadn’t really thought those intersections through.”The review, authored by the academics Hannah Kuper and Danae Rodríguez Gatta, looked at 11 different studies to collate data on the health outcomes experienced by disabled mothers and their children in the UK.The authors found that disabled mothers had a 44% higher chance of having a stillbirth than others; that they were up to 69% more likely to have a caesarean section; they had up to 70% lower rates of breastfeeding; and they could have more than double the chance of having to stay in hospital longer after the birth. The findings broadly correlated with what they found in literature from across the world.The report said: “Few policies, guidance documents, or programmes appear to be in place to close the gap in maternity care for disabled women in the UK. Indeed, there is a general lack of attention on this topic in the UK.”Tidball said the findings tallied with her own experiences during pregnancy and childbirth. Though her daughter was born healthy without major complications, there were several moments at which the MP found healthcare professionals had not taken her physical disability needs into account.Every time she had blood taken, Tidball had to visit an anaesthetist to find a vein because it is difficult to find hers. She said that a mobile scanning unit, which are now being rolled out to places such as GPs’ surgeries, would have prevented this.At no point, Tidball said, did a doctor discuss with her whether she would be able to continue wearing her prosthetic leg even as her body changed during pregnancy – nor what might happen should she develop an issue such as varicose veins.Having waited weeks to see a consultant midwife, Tidball said her lowest moment during the pregnancy was when she received a call about her pregnancy from the genetic counselling service to discuss whether her child might inherit her disabilities.“I was absolutely devastated,” she said. “I wasn’t interested in talking about whether or not my baby had my disability, and so the whole tenor of having had that contact really made me feel really upset.”Then during the birth, Tidball was over-anaesthetised because the procedure to test her pain sensitivity did not account for the fact the ends of her limbs are more sensitive than the rest of her body and she has a high pain threshold. As a result, she found herself unable to use her arms during the birth and for several hours afterwards.After the birth itself, Tidball struggled to get advice on how to breastfeed given she could not hold her baby in the traditional position. “Having to be reliant on other people really took me back to being a child in body plaster, from your chest to your ankle, where you are reliant on everybody else,” she said. “That was a pretty upsetting time.”Like the report’s authors, Tidball said she wanted to see new NHS guidelines on how to care for disabled mothers and their children. These would include advice on pain management and clear pathways for expectant and new mothers to see specialists who understand their condition. They would also include providing adapted equipment to make it easier for disabled mothers to use, such as mobility aids or easy-to-fasten baby clothes.As part of her lobbying campaign, she has met the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and is hoping some of her recommended changes make it into a forthcoming report into the way the NHS works. “My vision is that we get to a situation where disabled women in this country can have adequate and high quality, inclusive maternity care,” she said.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityPregnancyChildbirthHealthLabourWomenReproductionnewsShareReuse this content"

What you need to knowHelena HortonEnvironment reporterWed 5 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 17.56 ESTShareThe sun was shining, people were gingerly paddling in the sea and dogs were being walked up and down the coast – a typical day on the beautifulDorsetcoast. But the beachgoers probably didn’t know that just a few minutes inland, history was being made.On Wednesday, at the National Trust’s Purbeck Heath nature reserve, four beavers were released from crates and crawled into Little Sea, a 33-hectare lake. They are the first beavers to be legally released inEngland, after 400 years of absence and a fight to return them to the landscape.The trust says this is the perfect habitat for the creatures to roam free, with no fenced enclosures, because it is full of lakes and watercourses for the beavers to make their home. They have permission to release 25 on the peninsula but are starting with four and then making more releases in coming years if this one goes well.Why it’s boom time for beavers in England - podcastRead more“I feel real hope,” said David Brown, the National Trust’s nature director at Purbeck, shortly before the beavers were released. “I’ve worked as an ecologist for 40 years, and this is the most optimistic time in my career without a doubt. We are visibly, measurably recovering nature and that is so exciting, it is a real buzz. That hope is so precious.”Until about 20 years ago, the rodent had been extinct in Britain for 400 years, having been hunted for their fur, meat and scent oil. But in recent years, beavers have been returning to our waterways via licensed releases into enclosures and some illegal releases. There are estimated to be about 500 living in the wild in England. Last week, thegovernment announced that, with a licence, it is now legalfor conservationists to release beavers into the wild, with no enclosures necessary.View image in fullscreenA beaver swims in the water after being released.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PANext, they hope to release the beavers they have in enclosures at the Holnicote Estate on Exmoor, as well as on the South Downs, and Wallington. Northumberland.“The problem with enclosures is they are only really a short-term solution, as after a couple of years the kits the beavers have need to make their own territories, and there’s no space for them to go,” Brown said.Conservationists have been campaigning for thereturn of the beaverfor decades, because they are what is known as a keystone species whose presence allows other creatures including birds, fish and invertebrates, to thrive. This is because they create complex wetland habitats by digging channels and pools and constructing leaky dams. The dams they create also filter pollution, helping to clean up rivers, and they canprevent floodingas well as drought.The beavers released on Wednesday were carefully transported in crates in the back of a van from the River Tay in Scotland, down to Dorset, by the Beaver Trust. They were on the road from 4am and arrived at Purbeck in the afternoon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If needed, they will dig holes under dammed areas called “beaver deceivers” to confuse the beavers and cause them to go and dam elsewhere.Purbeck hopes it will lead to year-round nature tourism as people come to see the beavers and the habitat they create. “We have been seeing a shift away from bucket-and-spade tourism to nature tourism, and that is more sustainable,” Brown said.The nature minister, Mary Creagh, was there to watch the release. She said: “I am thrilled that, after being hunted to extinction centuries ago, wild beavers are finally here to stay. Today is an important milestone for national nature recovery.”More beaver releases are expected to occur in the coming months. Other nature groups, including theWildlifeTrusts, have submitted plans to the government in the hope of being granted a licence. The Wildlife Trusts have sites in Devon and Cornwall where they hope to release beavers, and the Knepp Estate in Sussex has four kits it wants to release.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeConservationEnglandBiodiversityDorsetMammalsRiversfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The trial ran from April 2019 through November 2023 across two sexual health services and three family-planning services in three states.The couples were randomly assigned to two groups – one where both the male and female partner were treated, and one control group where only the female partner received treatment.The researchers ensured there was equal representation in each group of women using an intrauterine device (IUD) and uncircumcised males – both of which have been linked with an increased risk of BV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s proven sexual transmission of BV.”Bradshaw acknowledges that while reinfection with BV bacteria from male partners may be responsible for recurrence in many women, there were some women who weren’t cured.Antibiotics might not have worked for women with adense biofilm – the biological tissue of the vaginal microbiome– or with an IUD, which the bacteria coats, making it harder for antibiotics to clear, Bradshaw said.Further strategies need to be developed for these women, such as a longer course of antibiotics, she said.The editorial also noted that 14% of the men in the intervention group reported taking less than 70% of their prescribed doses of medication, “an early signal that male partner buy-in could be challenging in some situations”.Bradshaw said that the cure rates in women whose male partners were 100% adherent to the tablets and the cream were far higher.The authors acknowledged a limitation of the study was that the participants largely included people attending sexual health centres, which may reflect a higher-risk population.Prof Rebecca Guy from the Kirby Institute’s Sexual Health Program said this was the “first study to show sustained and substantial benefit for a common and debilitating vaginal infection”.“It also provides evidence for sexual transmission of the bacteria that causes bacterial vaginosis.”Guy said the findings will inform clinical guidelines and new clinical protocols on treatment of the condition. “Success will rely on strategies to ensure high treatment cooperation rates among male partners, as achieved in the trial.”Explore more on these topicsHealthMedical researchWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

In A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story, Lucy Boynton brings it to the small screen once again, playing the woman sentenced to death for shooting her lover, David Blakely, outside the Magdala pub in Hampstead, north-west London. It is a sad and complex story, and while the performances are excellent, this solid four-parter can only march them grimly towards their inevitable conclusion.It begins on the day of Ellis’s execution, in 1955, as she refuses an offer of drugs to “calm” her. It skips back several months to the night of her arrest – the night of the shooting – and then back again a few years, to where it all began for the purposes of this interpretation. Ellis, who was just 28 when she was hanged, is being interviewed for a job as the manager of a high-end(ish) London nightclub. The proprietor asks her to prioritise the final seat left vacant in the establishment: should it go to the aristocrat, the businessman or the actor? Boynton delivers the first of many wonderfully theatrical monologues in reply, establishing the framework of a fragile and shifting class system in postwar Britain.Here is where A Cruel Love is most effective. Ellis has adopted a cut-glass accent, but she wears it like a costume. She has become, as she likes to remind people, the manageress of the nightclub, but she is also a sex worker under the thumb of her grotesque boss and landlord. She is presented as street smart, tough and eloquent, but is clearly vulnerable as the single mother of two small children. When she meets racing driver Blakely (Laurie Davidson), she is drawn into his wealthier world, and that of his friends, the Findlaters, “those malicious snobs” who look down on Ellis. Blakely and Ellis begin a toxic and violent relationship. His friends only see sport in his relentless philandering and appear to encourage his growing cruelty towards Ellis.Ellis is a perpetual outsider. In court, she must attempt to convince a jury of 12 men that she is not a bad mother, not immoral, that there were mitigating circumstances (the concept of diminished responsibility came into law two years after Ellis’s execution, we are told, in a telling note at the very end) and that Blakely was abusive. There is a claustrophobia to the cinematography, which is simultaneously beautiful and suffocatingly close. The camera does not shy away from Blakely’s acts of violence, and I wonder if it lingers on them a touch too long.The performances, though, are outstanding. Boynton really is fantastic as Ellis, driven to breaking point by the awful obsessions of privileged men, who are, ironically, the only ones who might be able to save her life in the end.Toby Jonesis predictably great as her conflicted lawyer John Bickford, who seems entirely out of his depth with a woman who readily admits her guilt – “I took David’s life. I don’t expect you to save mine” – while she is silently pleading for an empathy that seems out of reach for almost everyone. A Cruel Love is as well acted as it is handsome. The supporting cast is so strong that actors like Juliet Stevenson and Nigel Havers just drop in, briefly. Havers plays his real-life grandfather Justice Havers, the judge who sentenced Ellis to death.It is not always the case, but it can be difficult to sustain a true-crime drama when you know what happens at the end. Here, there is no hope of a reprieve, only a smouldering sense of impending doom. It pours in from all sides. Ellis has another man in her life, Desmond Cussen (a wonderfully slippery Mark Stanley), who is obsessive and sinister; his role in the murder went ignored and unpunished. Bickford cannot – and later will not – deliver what Ellis needs in order for her to live. “Oh, for God’s sake, Ruth, make these people understand what you’ve been through,” he tells her, in a moment of exasperation.At times, A Cruel Love seems similarly hamstrung and never quite feels as if it gets to know Ellis. Perhaps that is the point. There are no clean lines. As she famously said after her arrest: “I am guilty. I am rather confused.” It picks up pace towards the end and the final episode is much more cohesive, laying out Ellis’s account, Cussens’ involvement and the many stages at which her death sentence might have been commuted. But it wades through a lot of murk before it gets there.A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionToby JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But real-life sex workers have said the film portrays an optimistic view of the industry.“If this had been made by a sex worker, not just consulted on, if it had actually been made by a sex worker, or had a sex worker starring in the lead role, I don’t think it would have done so well,” said Maddie, from the East London Strippers Collective.The dazzling underdog with amazing legs: how Anora swept the OscarsRead more“I was looking forward to seeing it,” Maddie said. However, she added that she had gone in with “a slight scepticism” and had anticipated a sanitised view of sex work.She said: “We didn’t see any of, like, who she is really as a person. We only saw her in a work context.“Some more information about her sister, I think it was, that she was living with, would have been interesting. Or who her friends are, what her hobbies and dreams are. I think it’s really important that we have representation of sex workers as a whole person, and not just as their job.”Sam, also from the East London Strippers Collective, said that the film represented only a “really small sliver of sex work”.“For a young, white, privileged sex worker who speaks English and probably has an American passport, [so has] many levels of privilege, it’s possibly very accurate,” she said.She also said that, partly for economic reasons, with more people entering sex work, “we are already in a culture where I think we are quite destigmatised, in the sense where culturally, we have Cardi B, OnlyFans is a household name, Julia Fox made a whole career off of the compelling intrigue of being a dominatrix at 16. These things are mainstream now.”However, she added: “I don’t care for a culture that is really happy to continue to make the stories and make the movies, and win theOscarsabout sex work, if it doesn’t also relate to policy-level reform.”Both added that while societal attitudes had shifted, particularly in the past five years, policy change had been much slower.“I think that in general, the industry is much more accepted than it was even five years ago, and I think Covid and OnlyFans had a big part to play in that,” said Maddie. “I think it’s much more overexposed, and it’s almost cool to be a sex worker now.”View image in fullscreenMadison accepting the best actress Oscar.Photograph: NEWSPIX INTERNATIONALIn her acceptance speechfor the best actress Oscar, Madison thanked the sex worker community, saying: “I just want to say that I see you. You deserve respect and human decency. I will always be a friend and an ally, and I implore others to do the same.”Anora has swept the Oscars. I can’t help feeling that shouldn’t have happened | Catherine ShoardRead moreBut sex workers said they felt that Madison and the film’s director,Sean Baker, had both missed an opportunity to advocate for real change.“Yes, having celebrities back [sex workers] on a huge platform is amazing; that’s a great step in the right direction,” Maddie said. “But if they had gone just a little bit further and said: ‘We need full decriminalisation now,’ that could have actually had a much bigger impact.”Stacey Clare, author of The Ethical Stripper, said: “Celebrities naming sex workers in their awards acceptance speeches is a nice step in the right direction, helping to humanise and destigmatise us in the public imagination.“But real progress is when sex workers can live without fear of criminalisation, having their children removed by social services, having their income confiscated by police or banking services, being disallowed from accessing future social support, housing, or employment opportunities because being a sex worker is not something we can put on a CV.”While sex work has become more accepted in society, she said that existing laws meant the most vulnerable and marginalised sex workers were not benefiting.Sam said: “It means that the people who are most vulnerable, who are most affected by these laws – we’re talking not people you see inAnora, we’re talking people who are drug-using, homeless … who do survival sex work on the streets – will continue to suffer worse and worse working conditions.”Explore more on these topicsAnoraSex workMikey MadisonSean BakerOscarsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pole dancers spun in crystal leotards by photocopiers, and through lace tights we even got a bare bottom. “I wanted to bring the sexy back,” said McCartney backstage. “It’s all legal!”Another Paris brand inadvertently capitalising on the Oscars success of Anora – Dior hit the front pages after dressing two Oscar winners – the British designer’s show was bluntly titled “from laptop to lapdance”.The idea, said McCartney, “was a bold day-to-night wardrobe for the working woman – and our company is 90% women”. However, apart from the broad-shouldered suits and hooded coats, the emphasis was on skin-tight gowns and lipstick-red partywear.View image in fullscreenKate Moss and Cameron Diaz at the Stella McCartney show.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesTapping into the buzzy new aesthetic known as “boom boom”, coined by the trend forecaster Sean Monahan of normcore-fame, it refers to the conspicuous consumerism of the 1980s. Think power shoulders, sunglasses worn inside, and Pretty Woman boots. Think this collection.In the label’s almost 25 years, McCartney has never used leather, feathers, fur or skins. Instead, she has built her career on trying to show that ethical choices don’t mean compromising on glamour – and has been preaching the merits of upcycling long before hotels were telling us to reuse our towels.Her latest collection was, she said, 96% sustainable. Nepo baby or not, she has been pioneering in this respect – the first designer to use vegan leather, it is now rare to see a show that doesn’t nod in some ways towards sustainability.Such is her ability to turn grapes, apples and mushrooms into totes and chain-handle bags, her nickname on the front row is “the grocer”. Other brands have followed suit. Sequins dripping from dresses were made from plants here, and on Tuesday the Danish brand Ganni showed sequins made from seaweed. The boots and bags were made from mushroom (or mycelium), while Ganni showed bags made from olive oil “leather” (or Oleatex).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though she remains an ambassador on sustainability there, it was the first time she has been an independent designer since graduating.Show days are tense for any designer – it’s not simply about balancing the eco-books, it’s about selling clothes. But judging by the front row, the party isn’t over – it just looks a little greener.Earlier that day, The Row won over the fashion crowd, not with a trend but a tuck. A blue shirt half-tucked and slightly to one side, it demonstrated that fashion is as much about how you wear the clothes as the clothes themselves.Founded in 2006 by the former child actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, this brand is as well known for its interpretations of everyday items – shirts, scarves, ballet flats – as it is for its four-figure price tags. The pair rarely give interviews and for the second year running attenders were asked to “refrain from capturing or sharing any content during your experience” – borderline sacrilege for the TikTok generation.The clothes were chic and monastic. Coats came cocoon-shaped. Forked scarves hung from six types of trenchcoat. None of the models wore shoes, just tights. A quieter more rarefied type of luxury, but one that still appeals to an awful lot of women.Explore more on these topicsStella McCartneyParis fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

I have become an avid reader of labels and have adopted an ‘anywhere but the US’ policy when shopping. I will not visit the States while Trump remains in office, and most of the people I know have adopted the same policy.”Acquaintances, Allardice added, were selling US holiday properties they had owned for many years.View image in fullscreenA sign calls for a boycott of US wine at a liquor store in Montreal, Canada.Photograph: Andrej Ivanov/AFP/GettyMany Canadians have responded to Trump’s economic tariffs and political messaging with aconsumer boycott of US products and services– no more California wines or American Bourbon; local shopping instead of Amazon Prime; analogue entertainment and cable TV instead of Netflix and Spotify; holidays in the Kootenays instead of Disney World.Hundreds of people from acrossCanadashared with the Guardian their reactions to Washington’s political and economic gear change, and how they may be affected personally.Many expressed defiance and anger over what they saw as a hostile new US administration that was no longer an ally and, voicing economic fears and a sense of permanent loss, said they would no longer buy US goods nor cross the border again – at least while Trump was in office.Trump could water down tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead morePam, a 64-year-old retired woman from British Columbia, said she and her husband had cancelled a five-week trip to Palm Springs, losing their $5,000 (£3,900) deposit. They were planning, she said, to buy a Honda truck now instead of a Ford.Many said their local supermarkets had displayed labels marking Canadian products and that they were happy to pay significantly more for non-US goods, for example 50% more for Mexican lemons; others said they hoped Canadian companies would expand offerings and services after cancelling Amazon Prime and streaming platform subscriptions.One woman from British Columbia who lives a 10-minute drive from the US border and is participating in the boycott pointed to the irony of having joined several Facebook groups promoting Buy Canadian campaigns – one of which had now ballooned to 1.2 million members.View image in fullscreenA ‘product of Canada’ sign is displayed on salad leaves in a supermarket in Toronto, Ontario.Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/ShutterstockAmid fiery pledges to stand up to the US government, hundreds of Canadians shared grave concerns about the impact of the trade tariffs on their personal finances.Many said they were anxious about their retirement savings amid the market turmoil and economic uncertainty that have followed what they referred to as Trump’s “economic warfare”.Scores said hiring and budget freezes were already happening in the companies they worked for, while a number of business owners highlighted a loss of sales since Trump’s election that was likely to worsen.I may have to reduce my work force … this will have a domino effectPeople working in sectors including hospitality, tourism, retail, entertainment, the wider service industry, manufacturing, the auto industry, aviation, property and construction, agriculture, marketing and financial services, among others, shared concerns about their business or line of work being negatively affected by the tariffs and resulting economic uncertainty.Ian Hallett, the owner of an architectural bureau, from Seaforth, Ontario, said: “With steel, wood and aluminum tariffs, the construction industry will be hit hard and fast, which means a slowdown in building. We will likely have to lay off staff.”The owner of a landscaping business in Calgary, Alberta, said his sector would be “highly impacted” by the tariffs. “People won’t spend money to maintain or redesign their lawn. I may have to reduce my workforce and potentially shut down the season early. This will have a domino effect,” he said.View image in fullscreenFinished plywood products ready for shipping sit at Richmond Plywood’s manufacturing facility in Richmond, British Columbia.Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/ReutersAdrian, a business owner from Northern Ontario, said: “The tariffs have created chaos, anxiety and depression, a loss of hope. My US sales have dropped and if the tariffs [stay in place], I will have to close my business, as American customers are half my sales.”A 65-year-old support worker at an elementary school from Toronto said: “I’m worried my husband may lose his manufacturing job because the company he works for has a lot of American customers. Tariffs may make the building materials products his company makes too expensive.”Various business owners who were expecting a collapse in North American sales predicted that it would be impossible to make up the difference by increased exports to Europe or other parts of the world, where the markets were either saturated or shipping was too expensive.“I’m stressed about my investments and the financial markets, and I’m concerned about prices going up,” said Susan, an accountant from Toronto, mirroring the fears of many.I’m stressed about my investments and the financial markets and about prices going upWhile most of those who got in touch were outraged by Trump’s America First protectionism, scores of Canadians signalled an appetite for an isolationist approach for Canada, too.“I think that we should take a tip from Trump and build our own wall to keep the USA out,” said a 56-year-old single mother from Montreal. Scores of Canadians said they felt Canadaneeded to strengthen its military.Sarah from Nova Scotia said the Trump administration’s tactics and “threats against sovereignty, water, resources and territory” had “fired people up to be less dependent and integrated economically”.Antoine Delorme, a 43-year-old self-employed heavy machinery mechanic from Montreal, who has to order parts and material from the US every week, appeared to blame globalisation for Canada’s perceived vulnerability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who can we turn to for help and protection? Nato? The UK? Don’t make me laugh, it hurts too much.”Hundreds of people expressed fury over a perceived lack of solidarity from allied nations and were particularly critical of the British prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, and King Charles.“Canada’s relationship with the rest of the world has changed for ever,” said Katy, a finance professional from Toronto. “We just came to the stark realisation that allies are an illusion. As we endure the Maga onslaught, our supposed ‘allies’, including Britain, remain silent. Our ‘head of state’, King Charles, remains silent. Nato countries remain silent. We will weather the economic storm, but [I am] not so sure about our relationships with other nations.”Our ‘allies’, including Britain, remain silent. Our ‘head of state’, King Charles, remains silentCanada, Katy added, could leave international partnerships as it was “blessed with innumerable natural resources”. “If things don’t change, then Canada needs to extricate itself and consider becoming a neutral country. Dismantling the constitutional monarchy is now a must. The Commonwealth is dead.”Hundreds of Canadians reported a palpable, freshly ignited rise of patriotism, as well as a kind of nationalism usually frowned upon in Canada.“Canadians have become much more nationalistic,” said a woman from Ontario. “Some of us have been booing at the US national anthem at hockey games, which is not typical Canadian behaviour. We are furious about the tariffs that will deeply hurt Canadian businesses and quite likely see other companies move their operations south of our border.”View image in fullscreenA Canadian flag towers over the stars and stripes in a Canadian home.Photograph: Adrian/Guardian CommunityDonna, a retired woman living in a small city in British Columbia, said: “We have lost our trust in the USA as a friendly country. Patriotism was never something that Canadians celebrated enthusiastically. Today I see more Canadian flags than I have ever seen – in front yards, hanging from porches and hedges, and adorning cars. Both sides of the political spectrum and a majority of citizens are much more united than before.”A woman in her 40s from British Columbia who works in tech agreed: “There’s a huge sense of national unity around the country, and a lot of focused action to build our nation up.” She said she had “quit the US cold turkey”.How can you remain on good terms with a neighbour who threatens your economy?“This is a shift unlike any I have seen in my lifetime, and unlike anything my parents have seen either. Canada is turning away from the US – if not forever, at least for a long time. Goodbye America, we’ll miss what we had, but not what you have become.”While some people said they were differentiating between the Trump administration and their American neighbours, others shared feelings of personal hostility towards the American population, saying they wanted to “stick it to” their “poorly educated neighbours to the south”, as one woman from British Columbia put it, echoing the remarks of many.Scores of Canadians said they had fallen out with American friends and even family members over the political tensions between the two countries and ideological disagreements over American and Canadian democracy, freedoms and Trump himself.View image in fullscreenWorkers install a large Canadian flag on the front of the Manitoba legislative building in Winnipeg.Photograph: Steve Lambert/APA silver lining to the economic upheaval, various people pointed out, were renewed efforts to improve intra-Canadian trade between provinces.Matt, 41, a university employee from Vancouver Island, said: “Having a common opponent in the USA is drawing many people of my vast country together in ways that were seemingly impossible just a year ago. The work being done to dismantle inter-provincial trade barriers, with the potential to add tens to hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy, would never have had the political backing without Canada facing a significant external threat.”Most Canadians who got in touch felt that ties between Canada and the US had been permanently damaged.“The relationship is broken,” said Allardice, the pensioner from New Brunswick. “A great many Canadians hate the USA now.

You have to hang onto your own worth, she saysWed 5 Mar 2025 11.44 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.41 ESTShareFor at least half her life, the Belize-born British composer Errollyn Wallen, appointed last year to the title ofMaster of the King’s Music, has steered herself through a web of invisible rules. Classical composers, dead or alive, were male and white. Their Black and female counterparts were derided or ignored, excised from history. Then, slowly but definitively, things changed, and the institutions that used to give her the cold shoulder started to open up to the music they had dismissed. “People always want to put labels on things, on people,” Wallen says, without rancour. “Let them. You have to hang on to your own worth, see what needs doing. I was written off young, but then found a way through. There’s still so much work to be done.”Wallen’s musical range is ambitious, eclectic, often immediately appealing and expressive. Her huge catalogue includes works for ballet, brass bands, orchestras, choirs, solo singers, duos, pianists, chamber ensembles; her 22 operas make her almost as prolific as Verdi and nearly twice as productive as Puccini. She was the first Black woman to have music performed in the Proms, in 1998. Now among the most performed of living composers, she can’t quite remember how many world premieres she has in the next few weeks (after a recount, she decides it’s five), including two on the same night in different venues. She also has a new album out later this month:Errollyn Wallen Orchestral Works, played by the BBC Concert Orchestra. By any measure this is an achievement.Living in Orkney is a constant relief. I have to be able to bash away at the piano late at night – you can’t do that in a London flatBelying the glorious flamboyance of her appearance: pink statement glasses, a long waistcoat studded with felt flowers “from a charity shop”, black satin shirt trimmed with lace, fiery hair streaked with highlights (“thank goodness I’m going to the hairdresser this week”), Wallen’s conversation is quiet, thoughtful, poised. A can-do determination marks her out. The prompt for our conversation, over scrambled eggs and coffee in a grand London club where she greets the staff and they greet her, is her new choral work, Reign. She has been down in London from her home in Orkney, excited to hear the first rehearsals.View image in fullscreenWomen of the World preparations … rehearsal with full choir at the Mulberry School for Girls.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianFor high voices and organ, with her own hymn-like lyrics, it was commissioned by the feminist arts festivalWomen of the World(WOW), and will be performed on Saturday, International Women’s Day, at the Royal Albert Hall. The singers are 150 women, girls and non-binary people aged between eight and 80 years drawn from three London-based choirs: Mulberry School for Girls, St Boniface School andLips. Wallen was part of the original WOW team, founded by Jude Kelly in 2010. Is this festival focused on women still vital?“I think it is,” says Wallen, 66. “The world has always been in turmoil but recently it has taken a step back. Women in all parts of the world have faced a backlash. Girls and young women are still forbidden to have education. Misogyny abounds. If I hadn’t had access to free education, I’d never have had the chance to succeed.”A child of the Commonwealth, as she considers herself, Wallen grew up in Tottenham, north London. Singing has always been part of her life. She loves the English Hymnal, the definitive book of Anglican church music, and sees it as part of her cultural heritage. A talented pianist, Wallen frequently led her fellow pupils at her all-girls’ boarding school in Sussex in rousing accounts of Jerusalem, one of her favourite hymns. When the BBC commissioned a new version from her, for the Last Night of the Proms 2020 – the year of Covid – she combined a homage to Hubert Parry’s original with a sensitive new creation. The Proms played to an empty Albert Hall, but aired on TV and radio. Afterwards, she received hundreds of messages of abuse, essentially attacking her for daring to tamper with this national icon. Speaking to Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs in July last year, she said: “I spent the next day deleting abusive messages thinking, ‘Well, actually, when was the last time somebody really talked about a new piece of music in the national press? So yeah, I’ll take it.’”Wallen’s own astonishing life reads likes a set of disturbing short stories, set out in her 2023 memoir, Becoming a Composer. Soon after arriving in Britain, when she was two, her parents decided they would rather live in New York. She and her siblings were left with a childless aunt and uncle, Belize-born Arthur and Renee, a white EastEnder. Wallen expected her parents to send for her to join them. They never did, though later the children spent summers in New York. She loved her aunt and uncle, and accepted their hopes and anxieties as her own. Home life offered a culinary mix of pie and mash, jellied eels and, a nod to Belize cuisine, rice with everything.View image in fullscreenControversial … Golda Schultz performing Wallen’s new version of Jerusalem at the Last Night of the Proms in 2020.Photograph: Mark Allan/BBCLater, the young Wallen, who for many years wanted to be a ballerina, put herself on a diet of cake, strictly limited, and became very thin, one of many uneasy incidents that, today, might sound alarm bells. Her ambition to dance was abandoned when she was told there were no Black ballerinas. Uncle Arthur, perceptive as well as authoritarian, was the first to suggest the constant sounds in Wallen’s head might indicate she was a composer. He also helped her see wider horizons, introducing her to poetry, literature and concerts at London’s Wigmore Hall. “I never thought it was strange that we were the only Black people there,” she says. “I felt I could go anywhere. I will always thank Uncle Arthur for that. It must have been very difficult for him at that time.”Obstacles and educational diversions aside – she ran away from school and, in her late teens, made a suicide attempt nobody talked about – she went to Goldsmiths College to study music. She was steeped in the music of Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, JS Bach and, one of her all-time musical gods, Stevie Wonder. She became a session musician, which included an appearance on Top of the Pops, to her chagrin miming to a pre-recorded backing track with girl group Eternal (but she got to meet Cher, who admired her leopard-print waistcoat). She also set up her own ensemble. Somehow, and it is hard to imagine quite how, Wallen always hung on to an innate sense of worth, even as she was being crushed. “Show me your scores and we can have a good laugh” one influential concert director told her, in the 1980s, when her male contemporaries were securing performances of their works by elite groups such at the London Sinfonietta.From mini Mars bars to matters of life or death: Errollyn Wallen on becoming a composerRead moreWere her aunt and uncle alive now, or her distant but proud parents, would they countenance her appointment by King Charles? It came as a surprise to Wallen herself. She assumed the call from a palace official was an invitation to a reception. “I heard myself say ‘yes’. I had friends with me who cushioned the shock.” She is beginning to think how to direct her energies to the role – a post in the royal household, not dissimilar to that of poet laureate, whose loosely specified duties include composing music for important royal events. One of her imminent premieres is a work for solo soprano to be sung at the Commonwealth 2025 service in Westminster Abbey next Monday.Our wide-ranging conversation is over, with many brightly coloured strands left hanging. Later that day, Wallen will return home to solitude, composition, the sea at the bottom of the garden. (She used to live in a lighthouse near Thurso. She has since moved even farther north, close to where one of her predecessors, Master of the Queen’s Music, Peter Maxwell Davies, lived.) She will drive back to the sound, a current obsession, of the Jackson Five’s I Want You Back – “not very modern I know!” – thinking about how their clever bass line could fit with one of her own pieces. The relief of being there is constant, she says.“I’m a Londoner but I have to be able to go to the piano when I feel like it and bash away late at night. You can’t do that in a London flat.” Before she went there, three Black friends said, ‘Won’t you feel scared, being a in a place with so few Black people?’ Orcadians, she says, are like the people of Belize: gentle, welcoming, accepting. “If I want to go somewhere, nothing’s ever really stopped me. I just go ahead and do it.”Errollyn Wallen’s Reign has its world premiere atWOW at 15– an event featuring music and conversation at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 8 March.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

They’re telling Margot, Gordon’s mum, that they’re about to appear in a Valentine’s Day issue of the local newspaper’Interview byLydia FigesWed 5 Mar 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.17 ESTShareItook this shot in 1987, when I was living in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the middle of the Aids crisis, and there was an atmosphere of fear as more people fell victim to the virus. The year before, I had decided to createAt Home With Themselves,a series in which I captured the lives of same-sex couples in photographs and interviews. That’s how I met Gordon and Jim, the couple shown here next to Gordon’s mother Margot in their home in San Diego.By the mid-1980s, and with the advent of Aids, there was a backlash against the growing openness towards homosexuality. There were all sorts of misconceptions about how you could contract the disease: from toilet seats, or sharing an ice-cream cone. The press played into stereotypes, particularly the idea that gay men were very sexually promiscuous. But that period got me thinking about the prevalence, variety and longevity of gay and lesbian relationships. My ambition was to make pictures that gave dignity to gay love. I wanted to create images that moved people in a visual and psychological sense.So I started approaching friends, and friends of friends. I put ads in local gay newspapers and met couples in gay bars. I went to LGBTQ parades and the following year I attended the 1987Second National March on Washington. It was surprisingly easy to find couples who were willing to be photographed, even though many people were still not openly homosexual. I had heard a lot about the tea dances in Provincetown – afternoon gatherings that brought people from the community together, which was where I found many of my sitters.Gordon’s dad was homophobic and would forbid the subject of homosexuality in the houseI met Gordon and Jim because they responded to one of my newspaper ads. We talked several times on the phone before I finally went to their house. They had been together for 21 years, and had lived next to Gordon’s parents for a long time. Although they cohabited, Gordon’s parents didn’t realise, or simply ignored the fact, that they were a couple. The four of them regularly ate meals together and lived as one family. Jim felt accepted by Gordon’s parents, like he was another son. But they also told me that Gordon’s dad was homophobic, that he would forbid the subject of homosexuality in the house, and turned off the television or radio if it came up. Margot, Gordon’s mom, apparently always had suspicions about their relationship, though it was never openly discussed with her before.I took this shot two weeks after Gordon and Jim finally came out to Margot. It was a few years after the death of Gordon’s father, and they were about to be interviewed by a local newspaper for a special Valentine’s Day issue. When I was at their house, they were telling Margot about the project – giving her advance warning about the coverage. I think the photograph captures the tension and raw emotion in the room. But there is also a sense of Margot’s slow acceptance of the situation. There is warmth and familiarity in this shot, even if you can detect the discomfort.Several months into making the At Home with Themselves series, I realised I had turned to this subject for another reason. My curiosity about the gay community also stemmed from my father – who was gay. He was a second world war veteran and had left my mother when my sister and I were very young. It was not until my early 20s that I realised he was gay, partly because every time I’d visit, he was accompanied by much younger men. He never came out to me.‘Time moved more slowly then’: Sage Sohier’s vintage America – in picturesRead moreWhen the project was completed, I visited my father in New York. We looked at the photographs together. He didn’t say much, but he teared up. I could tell he was moved by the portraits. In that moment there was a mutual understanding. I could sense his gratitude and relief. It was my way of telling him I saw him – and that he was accepted.Looking back at these pictures now, I can fully comprehend the courage it took to stand up and be photographed as a same-sex couple in the 1980s. The portraits gave couples an opportunity to declare themselves and be seen. I have received emails from people around the world saying how much the project has meant to them. As a photographer, one always hopes that one’s pictures will have an impact, and in a small way, make the world a better place.Sage Sohier’s CVView image in fullscreenSage Sohier.Born:Washington DC, 1954Trained:Photographyat the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts while getting a BA at Harvard University.Influences:Helen Levitt, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Chauncey Hare.Low point:“A hand injury in my 40s that kept me from photographing for a couple of years.”Top tip:“Start by photographing what you know and have access to (your family, etc).

We had sent men to the moon, and women still hadn’t stood on the highest points on Earth, which made Hoeman’s bold idea all the more audacious.Quick GuideA note on the name DenaliShowFrom 1917 to 2015, North America’s tallest mountain was officially named Mount McKinley. But over that century, Alaska Natives, climbers and many others still called it by the name it had held for millennia: Denali, Koyukon Athabascan for “the great one.” President Barack Obama restored the peak’s Indigenous name in 2015. President Donald Trump ordered the mountain be re-named Mount McKinley in January 2025. ButAlaska Nativesandclimbershave already come forward in droves to affirm they will continue calling it Denali.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.When expedition leader Hoeman dreamed up the idea of the first all-women’s ascent of Denali, she was hardly the first female adventurer of her genre.Womenhad been scaling mountains and exploring polar regions for decades.View image in fullscreenMargaret Clark resting on a ledge.Photograph: Courtesy of Abrams PressBefore the turn of the 20th century, American Josephine Peary wandered the cold Arctic in the company of her husband, North Pole explorer Robert Peary. Around the same time, Elizabeth Le Blond, an Irish alpinist, climbed in the Alps – without a husband. She was an anomaly who scandalized prim English society in the 1880s and 90s by staying in the mountains overnight with her male guides. Le Blond wrote that the main reason so few women climbed in that era “was that unless they had the companionship of a father, brother, or sister, it was looked at as most shocking for a ‘female’ to sleep in a hut or bivouac”.Another reason might have been the total lack of acceptable mountaineering clothing. Women were expected to climb in skirts, an outrageous norm that left them struggling with heavy fabric, often wet with snow, encumbering their legs and feet.Le Blond often shucked her skirt once out of sight of towns, villages or huts, and hiked in her knickers, loose-fitting trousers gathered at the calf that served as underthings for women, and would retrieve her skirt at the end of the climb. Once, an avalanche carried away her skirt from its hiding place. Back in town, she had to hide behind a tree while her guide fetched another from her hotel room. He returned carrying an evening gown.During the women’s suffrage movement, American adventurer Fanny Bullock Workman smashed female altitude records in the Himalayas (again, with her husband) and used her success as a platform for women’s equality; in 1912, she was famously photographed on a high pass on the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram holding up a newspaper with the headline “Votes for Women”.As for Denali, only two women had stood on that windswept summit by the time Hoeman and her team aimed for it. In 1947, Barbara Washburn climbed the mountain alongside her husband, Bradford Washburn, a pioneering cartographer, photographer, and explorer who was the first to fully map the enormity of Denali.View image in fullscreen‘Male explorers often failed to mention women in their expedition diaries.’Photograph: Courtesy of Abrams PressBarbara didn’t attempt the summit for the glory or distinction of being the first woman, although she called it “the thrill of her life”. She actually had to be persuaded to make the ascent; she had three small children at the time whom she was reluctant to leave. But RKO Radio Pictures, making a documentary on mountain climbing and intrigued by the idea of a female climber, offered to pay for a nanny to enable her to join the expedition.She wrote later of the feat: “Reporters expected me to come up with some deep psychological reason why I needed to be the first woman on the summit of Mount McKinley, why I felt I needed to excel like this. They were always disappointed when I said I simply wanted to be with my husband.”Fifteen years after that, a climber named Anore Bucknell ascended the mountain’s north flank with a team of five other men to stand on the summit as well.Even if they’re not well-known, these early women’s accomplishments have at least lasted in the historical record. There are many more whose names never even made it into our collective history, as male explorers often failed to mention women in their expedition diaries – if women were along at all.View image in fullscreenMargaret Young and the team during the Denali ascent.Photograph: Courtesy of Abrams PressWomen were shunted to the background, left largely unrecorded, and often discouraged from participating in the first place. Like many outdoor spheres, the male-dominated pursuits of mountaineering and climbing were (and still are, in many senses) overwhelmingly masculine in participants, approach and culture. It’s why a beginner-level climb was dubbed in slang, “an easy day for a lady”.When a woman did achieve success in the mountains, it was never due to her own strength or skill; cultural narrative often attributed her success to a man who carried her pack, held her hand on scary heights, or helped her over plunging crevasses. When women did achieve summits or climbing routes alone, those mountains were deemed “too easy” for men to attempt ever again – as when Miriam Underhill and Alice Damesme climbed The Grépon in 1929.A steep granite spire in the Mont Blanc massif, the Grépon was a famously difficult climb. A tight, 60ft (18 meters) vertical crevice called the Mummery Crack, beneath which is nothing but empty air, required the lead climber to squeeze up it while belayed from below; but the belay here was almost superfluous, as no leader who’d fallen from the top of the Mummery had survived. A crowd of male climbers on the route gathered to watch the two women navigate it. They did, successfully, and went on to climb the rest of the route. But the day had not even ended before French climber Étienne Bruhl declared: “The Grépon has disappeared. Now that it has been done by two women alone, no self-respecting man can undertake it. A pity, too, because it used to be a very good climb.”But when women failed in the mountains, it was only validation of the climbing community’s certainty of their inferiority. In 1959, French alpinist Claude Kogan led a team of 12 women on the first all-female ascent, albeit with male guides and Sherpas, of Cho Oyu, which reaches to 26,867ft – the sixth highest peak in the world. When Kogan, one of her expedition mates, and two Sherpas were killed by an avalanche at their high camp at 23,000ft before reaching the summit, British reporter Stephen Harper called it “a verdict that even the toughest and most courageous of women are still the ‘weaker sex’ in the white hell of a blizzard and avalanche-torn mountain, that in the face of violent death and peril, men go out in front and women accept it”.And there was the not-so-small matter of motherhood with which to contend. In 1970, the Roe v Wade decision and the social and economic liberation for women that came with reproductive choice was still three years in the future. The idea of women transcending the narrow confines of motherhood and domesticity was gaining steam – but the idea of women rejecting cultural norms and putting off having children to pursue such an outlandish and traditionally masculine passion as mountaineering was still way off the map.Eighteen years after the Denali expedition, famed New Zealand climber Lydia Bradey would undergo sterilization to pursue her mountaineering career. Bradey grew up the only child of a single mother. From a young age, it was impressed upon her that being a good parent required a lot of time and attention. With her climbing career gaining momentum, she recognized she didn’t have those things to give to a child, didn’t want to risk being a sub-par parent as a result, and wanted to prioritize mountains.View image in fullscreenThe late Alison Hargreaves days after returning from her ascent of Everest seen in the Cairngorms where she lived with her children, Tom and Katie.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianAs she first began raising the topic of sterilization with doctors in her early 20s, she was constantly advised that she was too young. It wasn’t until she found a female doctor that she finally got the operation. A year later in 1988, at the age of 27, Bradey became the first woman to summit Everest without supplemental oxygen.In her memoir, Going Up is Easy,Bradey recalled: “When I started mountaineering, I would see men who were fathers pushing themselves and taking risks. And it seemed to me that their wives and girlfriends back home were in the dark about what was going on. So men got away with what they were doing and it was only when women who were mothers started climbing that the spotlight fell on the subject.”The spotlight hit hard in 1995 when Alison Hargreaves died on K2 in a violent storm. Hargreaves was one of the best mountaineers of her generation, also summiting Everest without supplemental oxygen and soloing all six of the classic north faces of the Alps in a single season.But rather than eulogized for her skill, she was attacked after her death as irresponsible and selfish for being a mother of two and taking the risks inherent in any mountaineering career. The idea that women could be both mothers and mountaineers wouldn’t start gaining acceptance until well into the 2000s, although even now, female big-mountain skiers, avalanche experts, climbers and mountaineers still worry about how pregnancies will impact their careers and whether sponsors will pull contracts.Some among the 1970 Denali expedition members – perhaps all of them – felt an enormous pressure to succeed, and not just to put to rest the demeaning jabs from the climbing community about weakness, emotional instability, and catfights breaking down the ranks of an all-female team. They aimed to prove that women definitively had a place in the world of high-altitude mountaineering.If anyone could meet that pressure, it was these six women, already accustomed to navigating men’s worlds. Grace Hoeman, Arlene Blum, Margaret Clark, Margaret Young, Faye Kerr and Dana Smith were doctors, chemists, physicists, pilots and geologists. Between them, they had already scaled both literal and figurative mountains across the globe. They had but to summit this next one.And survive it.An excerpt fromThirty Below: The Harrowing and Heroic Story of the First All-Women’s Ascent of Denaliby Cassidy Randall, which is out now.Explore more on these topicsWomenAlaskaMountaineeringMountainsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She had come to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016 as part of an influx of young people arriving to study the dangers that artificial intelligence could pose to humanity.In one of the most expensive regions of the United States, however, it is difficult to save the world when you can’t make rent. So she bought a boat for $600 and moored it next to a friend’s vessel in a marina. For five years, she used it as an occasional, cramped bunk.In her waking hours, she worked on a blog of provocative and increasingly extreme ideas about confrontation and retaliation. At night, she fell asleep as the boat rocked back and forth, drifting with the flotsam of greaterSilicon Valley.Then, on the night of 19 August 2022, her sister and a friend reported that they saw her fall overboard. The US Coast Guard and local authorities scrambled boats and aircraft. After a nearly 30-hour search, neither Ziz nor her body could be found.View image in fullscreenZiz was reported to have fallen overboard, and her body could not be found.A newspaper in Alaska, where she was born, published a short obituary referring to her by her birth name: “Jack Amadeus LaSota left our lives but not our hearts on Aug 19 after a boating accident. Loving adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals, you are missed.” She was 31.Ziz’s ideas did not die in the waters of the California coast. Nor did Ziz. She had faked her drowning and gone underground, before beingarrestedlast month in western Maryland and charged with trespassing and illegal transportation of a firearm.The targets of Ziz’s ire, who include some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent intellectuals, have taken security precautions. “Ziz is not stupid,” someone familiar with her, who asked to remain anonymous, told me. “This is a very smart person – both smart and crazy.”Ziz’s writing had polarized members of a niche but influential movement of AI theorists and tech bloggers who call themselves the “rationalists”. The movement is less about specific ideas than it is about an ethos – applying rigorous, mathematically informed thinking to AI, philosophy, psychology and the big questions of our time.Rationalists are odd, though often charming, people. They tend to be fantasy and sci-fi geeks, use lots of jargon and think intensely about things other people barely think about at all. They debate with earnest and deadly seriousness, and their preferred arena of intellectual combat is dense blogposts, often with footnotes.View image in fullscreenAn illustration of Ziz’s mug shot after her arrest.Illustration: Matt Rota/The GuardianSome in the rationalist community saw Ziz as a kook, even dangerous. But she had enough detractors and admirers to earn a school, of sorts, that an opponent dubbed the “Zizians”.Very few people had ever heard of Zizians until this January, when a US border patrol agent pulled over two young people, dressed in black, driving a Prius hybrid near the Vermont-Canada border. The ensuing shootout killed a federal officer. It also left one of the alleged shooters in custody and the other, a math prodigy who had formerly worked as a quant trader in New York, dead.From there, the story grew stranger. Reporting byOpen Vallejoandother outletsfound that the Vermont pair had ties to a group of leftwing anarchists in California – including one who won an $11,000 prize for AI research in 2023 and was also arrested this January for allegedly murdering a landlord.A few things drew those people together: all were militant vegans with a worldview that could be described as far-left. All were highly educated – or impressive autodidacts. Most were also, like Ziz, transgender. But what they had in common, above all, was a kinship with a philosophy, which Ziz largely promulgated, that takes abstract questions from AI research to extreme and selective conclusions.In reporting this story, I obtained exclusive chatroom logs that chart the Zizians’ radicalization and ultimate acceleration into violence. I examined thousands of words of blogposts, court filings and other documents, and spent weeks interviewing people familiar with Ziz and her circle.Ziz has not been charged in any killings. Yet acquaintances are unsettled, and former teachers frightened of their apostate pupil. Many sources requested anonymity due to safety concerns – “it’s just, you know …murder cult,” one person said – or a desire to speak freely about the rationalist and AI-risk communities.How, exactly, did hyper-intelligent young altruists – who studied at Oxford, Waterloo and Rice, won academic prizes and research grants, and spoke sincerely of bettering the world – enter a trajectory that has ended with at least six people dead? What would cause a former spelling bee finalist to write in a chatroom discussion of having “dramatic fantasies about becoming a knife murderer” – and then, a year later, allegedly participate in an attempt to stab someone to death?The answers lie in a strange saga of idealism and disenchantment:a violent collision of internet culture and the real world – and perhaps a harbinger of more uncanny tidings to come.Decades before Ziz was born, some philosophers and computer scientists began to predict a day when computers become truly and irreversibly smarter than humans. They called this event the “singularity”.Because computing power generally improves at an exponential rate, and because a true AI would also learn and improve, some AI theorists thought that the singularity might arrive sooner than most people understood. In their view – which not all AI researchers share – the arrival of superintelligence would be like a tsunami: a ripple that rapidly builds, before anyone notices, into a towering wall of water.‘Humanity’s remaining timeline? It looks more like five years than 50’: meet the neo-luddites warning of an AI apocalypseRead moreEliezer Yudkowsky, a burly man with a dark, bristly beard, grew up in a Modern Orthodox family in Chicago. As a precocious child in the 1990s, he became a voracious sci-fi reader. At a time when computers were still running on dial-up internet, he was particularly interested in the future of AI. An atheist who permanentlyrejectedhis family’s Judaism, he also wanted to flesh out a philosophy that could provide ethical frameworks without religion.In the 2000s, Yudkowsky began building on the work of earlier AI theorists. In a series of blogposts, he argued that the tsunami was coming – and would remake everything in its tidal path. By the time he was 20, his writing won the attention of AI academics, who accepted him into their ranks despite the fact that Yudkowsky had never attended high school.Today Yudkowsky is regarded as a leader of the “doomers”, a faction whose members believe that superintelligent AI will be unambiguously bad for humanity and perhaps even cause our extinction. That wasn’t always the case.At first, Yudkowsky believed that the singularity had the potential to be the best thing that ever happened to humanity. In the world he hoped to bring about, a benevolent, centralized, god-like AI, sometimes called a “singleton”, could end hunger and poverty and protect the human species for eternity. But that AI, unless designed carefully, could also prove to be disastrous to humanity.Researchers call it the “alignment problem”: would a superintelligent AI be hostile or benevolent? And is there any guarantee that its understanding of benevolence aligns with ours?Nick Bostrom: ‘We are like small children playing with a bomb’Read moreIn 2003, Nick Bostrom, a Swedish philosopher,illustratedthe risk of unintended consequences in a classic example. Say you program an AI to make paperclips. The AI is smart enough to not only make paperclips but learn new, better ways to make them. It consumes more and more resources to flood the world with paperclips. The AI resists efforts to switch it off, since that would conflict with making paperclips. Perhaps it even decides that humans, who are made of carbon, would be good raw material for more paperclips.Bostrom’s point was that there is no reason to assume that artificial superintelligence, even if designed by humans for human ends, would think at all like a human; its thinking might beeven morealien to ours than that of an actual extraterrestrial alien. In the worst nightmares of people like Yudkowsky and Bostrom, AI doom looks like an omnipotent version of Hal, the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey that starts jettisoning humans from a spaceship’s airlock when they conflict with its sense of mission.As he tried to proselytize the benefits and threats of AI, Yudkowsky was frustrated to encounter disagreements that leaned on what he viewed as fallacies. So he started writing blogposts explaining logic and decision-making with a statistical method calledBayesian inference. These essays were edited into a corpus – 2,100 pages in one version – that rationalists refer to, somewhat reverentially, as the “Sequences”.Yudkowsky was trying to teach people how to think better – by guarding against their cognitive biases, being rigorous in their assumptions and being willing to change their thinking. Although rationalists tend to be polite enough, some, including Yudkowsky,holdthat it is in effect impossible to “agree to disagree”: that if two “rational agents” whosharethe same assumptions come to different conclusions, one of themmustbe wrong.An online community, including many people who work in tech, gathered around the blog Yudkowsky founded in 2009,LessWrong. Soon, contributors began writing their own essays. The rationalist movement was born.Yudkowsky felt that there was still a larger, untapped audience. In 2010 he started publishing Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, a 662,000-wordfan fictionthat turned the original books on their head. In it, instead of a childhood as a miserable orphan, Harry was raised by an Oxford professor of biochemistry and knows science as well as magic; at Hogwarts he is assigned to the smart kids’ house, Ravenclaw, instead of the jocks’ Gryffindor; and he saves the world by embracing a manipulative, dark streak that might shock JK Rowling’s Potter.Yudkowsky wrote the series in part torecruittalentfor the alignment problem, and he succeeded wildly. The series was so popular that it birthed fan fiction of its own. Thousands of people around the world read it, including a young geek, interested in atheism, veganism and utilitarianism, who later took the name Ziz.Two organizations would shape Ziz’s thinking – then become bedrocks of her rage. In 2000, Yudkowsky founded a thinktank that would later be called the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, or Miri. And in 2012, a group of rationalists founded a daughter organization of sorts, the Center for Applied Rationality, or CFar. Both are based in Berkeley, near Silicon Valley.While AI theorists at Miri worked to bring to life a beautiful and safe singularity, CFar wouldpromoterationalist thinking, build a social scene and perhaps help to feed bright research minds to Miri.The rise of those two organizations also coincided with the emergence of the “effective altruism” movement. As a school of thought, effective altruism has now become tainted byassociationwith its most famous poster child, the crypto entrepreneur and convicted fraudsterSam Bankman-Fried, but at the time it was catching fire among earnest techies.Founded by some young philosophers at Oxford in the 2000s, effective altruism revitalized interest in the moral philosophy of consequentialism – the idea that endsdo, to some extent, justify means – and its stepchild, utilitarianism, which holds that the goal of human endeavor should be to do the most good for the most people.Soon, those movements began to build a pipeline of money toward research on existential risks to humanity’s future. Billionaires such as Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal, and Dustin Moskovitz, of Facebook,gave fundingfor non-profit AI research.Like many tech mavens, Yudkowsky is an advocate of “transhumanism”, the theory that technology will one day enable humanity to transcend the limitations of our bodies. He was deeply shaken by the death of hisbrother, in 2004, and his work reflects a cosmic horror at any sapient brain ever being extinguished.Transhumanists believe that scientific breakthroughs will not only eventually allow us to live longer, but perhaps also give us a kind of immortality, by creating digital versions of our minds that live on after we’re dead. Some also believe that computer power will eventually become so strong and cheap that those digital minds can each live in their own fully realized virtual-reality worlds.In this cosmology, an AI machine-god could give each of those minds utopias of their own choosing. But it could also choose not to – or, worse, subject people to eternal torment. A movement of atheists had found a new vision of heaven, and of hell.Ziz’s writing would come to be consumed by visions of damnation. But when she emailed a CFar listserv back in May 2015 to ask for leads on programming jobs in the Bay Area, she had a chipper tone that would be unrecognizable a few years later.“I think it’s about 50% likely I’ll be wanting one, starting in early August,” she wrote. “What’s the best way to find one? Preferably in Berkeley so I can not-inter-city-commute to alumni dojos and Berkeley meetups?”She sketched a CV of sorts, with positive reviews of coding projects she’d done and work experience (internships at Nasa and Oracle), and noted that she was currently a master’s student in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois.Ziz was exactly the sort of person who would be attracted to the rationalist scene. She was a computer wonk who’d grown up in Alaska with a father who was an AI researcher and instructor and a mother who was a school counselor. While still in middle school, Ziz and some friends hacked their school’s payroll system to award money to their favorite teachers, a former teacher recentlytoldthe Boston Globe, and cut the salaries of ones they disliked. The teacher also said that Ziz had problems with emotional regulation.(I contacted email accounts associated with Ziz but did not receive a response.)Ziz’s writing recounts, with anger, what she describes as her mother’s reluctance to accept her trans identity, and speaks of going through pubertyfeelingthat her genitals were an “alien parasite” on her body. She also had a visceral aversion to eating animals, and became a vegetarian by 2010 before coming to regard vegetarianism as an unacceptable compromise to veganism.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Ziz moved to Illinois with the apparent intent of pursuing a PhD in computer science or physics. But the lure of the Bay Area was stronger. A rationalist scene had flourished there, and people were flocking to the area to take workshops at CFar and apply for jobs at Miri and other AI organizations.It was an exciting time to be in Berkeley, Rachel Wolford, a startup founder who used to consider herself a rationalist, told me – “a place filled with people like me, who shared my desire for skeptical interpretations of the world. I felt welcome, partly because it was a place where people tended to be non-neurotypical in the same way I was, and partly because they had similar ideologies about the way you should approach figuring out what you believe.”At an early CFar workshop, Ziz described the “comparative advantage” she could offer the world, according to someone present, as a willingness to do good through means other people might consider bad.“She’s just very intense,” Octavia Nouzen, an acquaintance of Ziz’s, told me. “I mean, the word that comes to mind is just ‘intense’ – just, like, a super-penetrating gaze.” A rationalist who met Ziz during this period found her “nice enough but pretty quiet. They [Ziz] didn’t tend to come out for social events very much. They kind of just holed up in their room.”Ziz was also cognizant of her own challenges, and her writing reflects some anxiety about being able to communicate well with others; at one point she took a seminar in “Authentic Relating”. Yet if Ziz was unusual, she did not, at first, necessarily stand out to her peers. Eccentricity was common in the Berkeley scene, even expected, and a core tenet was that people needed to feel free to discuss strange ideas, in good faith, without judgment.There had been unintended consequences, however, to Miri and CFar’s efforts to gather the best and brightest to solve the alignment problem.A lot of eager young idealists were showing up who fit a certain mold. They were hyper-intelligent but not always wise, and had spent dizzying amounts of time on the internet. They were information sponges with a tendency to get sucked into rabbit holes, people with ambition but not always execution.These were people who had grown up reading Harry Potter fan fiction about rationalism by the glow of a computer screen, then quit families who didn’t understand them – or were in some cases abusive – to come to a mecca where they hoped to find intellectual parent figures and stimulating work. They’d spent lonely, sometimes traumatized, childhoods reading about the heroism of others; now they could finally be protagonists.But not everyone made the cut. Miri, CFar and other organizations could not give jobs or research grants to everyone interested, and the Bay Area is hideously expensive.Ziz’s money worries started almost immediately. Coding jobs she’d been promised fell through or didn’t work out. She did several rounds of interviews at Google that never went anywhere and had to ask for financial help from her parents. She stayed at some expensive short-term rentals, and one sublet where, shewrote, the landlord was abusive.Around this time, she also had a traumatic experience. A man saw her walking at night and offered her a ride. The encounter turned into what shedescribedas a sexual assault.Rationalists in the Bay Area often encountered financial problems. A common fix was a “rat house” with anywhere from four to nine roommates, often in violation of tenancy laws. Even then, some people struggled to make rent, and tense social or power dynamics could develop if one person with a well-paid tech job was fronting rent for everyone else.At their best, rat houses were fun places to be an intellectually minded idealist. At worst, rationalists told me, they were like halfway houses of smart but dysfunctional people, too fired up solving the alignment problem to do dishes, unaware that they may have been, in some sense, in the discard pile of AI-risk research.So when Ziz met Gwen Danielson, a 23-year-old fellow rationalist, she was intrigued to learn of her offbeat solution to high rent: living in a sailboat, for just the cost of mooring. Danielson offered to let Ziz join her on the boat.Like Ziz, Danielson had abandoned formal schooling – a full ride at Rice to study ethical AI,accordingto the San Francisco Chronicle – and, like Ziz, was trans and avoided eating meat. They even looked so similar, Ziz later wrote, that “strangers assumed we were siblings”.During their long exchanges of ideas, Danielson said she was an otherkin (someone who identifies as nonhuman), Ziz wrote, specifically a dragon:They [Danielson] showed me a dragon-shaped necklace, and said it was a reminder of how they would turn into a dragon after the singularity. And eat their human body, since that seemed like the most fitting way to dispose of it. I said I’d want mine burned once I could escape it.Danielson was shy, people told me, and gradually became so deferential to Ziz that others were concerned.Ziz found living on Danielson’s boat less than ideal, however: Danielson talked to herself constantly.So Ziz bought her own sailboat and moored it nearby. She decided tonameit the Black Cygnet. A cygnet is a baby swan; in popular theories of knowledge, a “black swan” is an unexpected, tectonic event that seems obvious only in retrospect.In her blog, Ziz later attributed her radicalization in part to her housing problems. “I came to see … artificially high housing prices as something that was crucial to escape for anyone who wanted to actually try to save the world. Who wouldn’t accept a 90% probability of [AI] doom.”Ziz’s willingness to talk bluntly about these frustrations – high rents, bad landlords, trouble finding a job – earned her blog a following. In an insular community in which many people believed that airing dirty laundry could harm the cause, sheattractedcredibility among other young, leftwing rationalists.Despite her unhappiness, Ziz’s worldview hadn’t yet hardened into cynicism. She could be kind, too. In an essay online, Zack M Davis, a rationalist who later drew Ziz’s anger in an intellectual disagreementabout gender identity,mentionsin passing that when he had a stress-induced psychotic break, in 2017, she dropped off chocolates – “allegedly good against dementors”.Around this time, Ziz and Danielson dreamed up a project they called “the rationalist fleet”. It would be a radical expansion of their experimental life on the water, with a floating hostel as a mothership. They raised some money for the project. On 1 July 2017, Ziz sent an email to a CFar listserv:We need a total of 5 people who are willing to serve as crew moving a 94’ tugboat (currently named Caleb) from Ketchikan, AK, to the Bay Area…For crew members with no nautical experience, all direct expenses including transportation to Ketchikan, from the Bay back to their place of residence, food, and direct incidentals would be covered.They found some crew members, including one, Dan Powell, who had nautical experience from a stint in the US navy. On 20 July, they set out from Alaska. It went mostly without incident, though one crew member who found Ziz’s assertiveness off-putting debarked early.The ship successfully made it to San Francisco, but a leaky second world war-era tugboat wasn’t the brilliant investment Ziz and Danielson had believed. The US Coast Guard declared the ship a “threat to the public health” and demanded an improvement plan. Powelllosttens of thousands of dollars on the project.Ziz continued blogging. She made friends in the rationalist scene, especially among a group of technically minded trans women. They included Alex Leatham, known as “Somni”, and Emma Borhanian.Leatham had studied math at UCLA and UC Berkeley and seemed to be a vagabond. Someone who went to high school with Leatham, in an upper-middle-class suburb of LA, recalled her to me as “really smart, beyond genius”, conspicuously bored in most classes and “extremely socially awkward”, but part of a group of math-geek friends. Her yearbook quote wasIch aufsteigen: “I rise.”Unlike Leatham, Borhanian had a conventional day job, for a time. She was a software engineer at Google and made good money. In 2017, shedonated$12,000 to Miri.Jessica Taylor, a former AI alignment researcher at Miri, told me she was loosely part of that group for a while. In late 2017, she had a nervous breakdown. “I went kind of psychotic,” sheelaboratedin a recent YouTube interview. Afterward, “Ziz offered to, like, help repair my mind, in exchange for information,” she said. “I’m in retrospect glad I declined.”Taylor may have been lucky. Leatham and Borhanian would become two of the most extreme apostles of Zizian ideas. Today, one is incarcerated, and the other is dead.One of the traits that distinguishes humans from machines is our ability to live with contradiction. Arguably, we need nuance – even if that flexibility also allows a certain amount of moral hypocrisy. Many of us would consider it murder if someone harmed our cat or dog, yet eat meat. We raise money for a neighbor with cancer, and blithely scroll past a news article about a cholera outbreak in Sudan that sickens hundreds of people.But Ziz, according to her writing and to people who know her, has an engineer’s obsession with taxonomy and consistency – albeit “consistency” that often involves leaps of logic. Once she comes to a particular conclusion, she applies it literally, maximally, and with confidence impervious to restraint. Her writing is contemptuous of the idea that actions should bejudgedright or wrong merely because laws or social norms say so.Her personal philosophy also draws heavily on a branch of thought called “decision theory”, which forms the intellectual spine of Miri’s research on AI risk.Decision theory studies how “rational agents” behave in situations of uncertainty. In trying to guess how a superintelligent AI in the future might act, we might try to predict that AI’s thinking with decision theory. Or an AI in the distant future, trying to guess what its human creators would have wanted it to do in a situation, might run a similar prediction to “ask” us.Because we and the future will be effectively communicating with each other through these predictions, some rationalists do not believe that our relationship with the future is linear. To a certain sort of person, such as Ziz, the schools of thought thatgrapplewith these hypotheticals pose exciting questions. Or frightening ones.In 2010, a writer on LessWrong published a notorious thought experiment that became known as “Roko’s basilisk”. The gist of the convoluted hypothetical was that, in the distant future, a superintelligent AI might decide to punish people who had been able to bring it into existence sooner, but didn’t – rich people or, say, AI researchers. Roko was suggesting that the future could blackmail the present.Some readers supposedly reacted with panic, believing that merely by having become aware of the hypothetical, they had been condemned to an eternal, AI-administered hell. Yudkowsky was furious that Roko had even posted the theory, in part, he pointed out, because blackmail only works if the person being blackmailed is aware of it. He deleted the post, and banned discussion of it for several years.The essay is sometimes cited as an example of what Bostrom, the Swedish philosopher, has called an “infohazard” – information that is innately dangerous. Today, rationalists tend to react with embarrassment if Roko’s basilisk is brought up, anddismissit as a silly thought experiment thatshould nothave been taken seriously.Yet Ziz did. She mentions it often in her writing, in a way that suggests intrusive thoughts. Similarly, she seems preoccupied with moral purity, to a point verging on obsessive scrupulosity. She describes her veganism in misanthropic terms – Zizians call meat-eating “carnism”, and non-vegans “flesh-eating monsters” – and in one essay recounts her anxiety at discovering ants in a shower. She weighs the costs of being late to work, thereby risking her job, against the moral cost of killing theinsects.Ziz became increasingly convinced that the AI-risk community had lost its way: Miri, in its early years, had started as a project to accelerate AI, before pivoting to focus on AI safety; shebelieved it wasn’t doing enough to prevent a hostile AI – that its leaders were self-interested people who would sacrifice others to an AI hell to save themselves, and that their considerations of the future did not account for the wellbeing of other sentient animals.She began to believe that it was not only probable but virtually certain that a future AI would subject her, personally, to some kind of damnation. Her writing also treated abstract ideas with increasing, and alarming, literality. Decision theory became, in her hands, justification for confrontation, escalation and retaliation.“Ziz didn’t do the things she did because of decision theory,” a prominent rationalist told me. She used it “as a prop and a pretext, to justify a bunch of extreme conclusions she was reaching for regardless”.Ziz also felt that naturally altruistic people were easily victimized by others because of their goodness. She wondered if good people should learn to act evil – that perhaps the only way the world could be saved was by a cadre of intelligent people whoadoptedthe methods of sociopaths.Some rationalists were surprised, and a bit put off, when Ziz announced that she would now be known as Ziz. The name comes from Worm, aroughly7,000-page serial fantasy story that many rationalists have read. Ziz is analiasused by a monster called the Simurgh, part of a group of villains called the Endbringers.The Simurgh has an unsettling power, a reader of Worm told me. She’s an infohazard: anyone “who has encountered the Simurgh for too long, listened to the Simurgh for too long, becomes a liability. Because at some point in the future they will go crazy and cause a bunch of destruction.”A couple years ago, Oliver Habryka, the CEO of Lightcone, a company affiliated with LessWrong, published an essay asking why people in the rationalism, effective altruism and AI communities “sometimes go crazy”.Habryka waswritingnot long after Sam Bankman-Fried, a major funder of AI research, had begun a spectacular downfall that would end in his conviction for $10bn of fraud. Habryka speculated that when a community is defined by a specific, high-stakes goal (such as making sure humanity isn’t destroyed by AI), members feel pressure to conspicuously live up to the “demanding standard” of that goal.Habryka used the word “crazy” in the non-clinical sense, to mean extreme or questionable behavior. Yet during the period when Ziz was making her way toward what she would call “the dark side”, the Berkeley AI scene seemed to have a lot of mental health crises.“This community was rife with nervous breakdown,” a rationalist told me, in a sentiment others echoed, “and it wasn’t random.” People working on the alignment problem “were having these psychological breakdownsbecausethey were in this environment”. There were even suicides, including of two people who were part of the Zizians’ circle.Wolford, the startup founder and former rationalist, described a chicken-and-egg situation: “If you take the earnestness that defines this community, and you look at civilization-ending risks of a scale that are not particularly implausible at this point, and you are somebody with poor emotional regulation, which also happens to be pretty common among the people that we’re talking about – yeah, why wouldn’t you freak the hell out? It keepsmeup at night, and I have stuff to distract me.”A high rate of pre-existing mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental disorders was probably also a factor, she and others told me. (Respondents to a 2016 survey of users of LessWrongreportedrates of ADHD significantly higherthanthe average for the adult US population.) The community also attracted people eager for hacks and shortcuts (“speedruns”, “munchkining”) for self-improvement or “optimization”.Rationalists had considerable openness to new experiences, but sometimes poordisciplineor judgment, and could embody the old joke about being so open-minded that one’s brain falls out – trying Buddhist meditation, polyamory, LSD and a radical diet in the same week, without considering why that might be a bad idea.Some people were fond of the idea that there is a thin line between genius and psychosis, rationalists told me, and were eager to find it. Ziz is “actually straight edge [and] super paranoid about drugs”, Nouzen hassaid, but many rationalists weren’t, and psychedelics use was common.To the extent that the community around Miri had always had a tinge of cultishness, some cliques took that tendency further, adopting the language of secret societies, experimenting with ritual magic or trying to give themselves alternate personalitiescalled“tulpas”. People would speak of “mental subprocesses” beingwieldedalmost like sorcery, or of a particular idea infecting them like a contagious virus.In 2021, a former employee of Leverage Research, an organization that hired heavily from the LessWrong blogosphere, published an essayaccusingthe group of behavior including two- to six-hour “group debugging sessions in which we as a sub-faction … would attempt to articulate a ‘demon’ which had infiltrated our psyches from one of the rival groups”.(Leverage’s CEO, Geoff Anders,respondedat the time by saying that the essay “took incredible courage to write”;a representative told me that Leverage disagrees with the essay’s characterizations, and that aninquiryfound them overblown.)There could also be a tendency to treat people like gurus. One such person was Alice Monday, a rationalist who was eventually banned from CFar events for confrontational behavior. (I was unable to contact Monday.)Ziz treated her as a mentor. She also became close with Monday’s roommate, Michelle “Jamie” Zajko, a bioinformatician who had grown up in an affluent suburb of Philadelphia.Soon, Ziz “started writing stuff that sounded a lot like Alice”, a rationalist told me, and acting “a bit more like Alice, more aggressive, more argue-y”. By then, Ziz had adopted long black robes as her signature look. She called her aesthetic “vegan Sith lord”.She had, she later elaborated in a Discord chatroom, “constructed an idiosyncratic religion where I’m religiously required to do whatever I want”.Ziz was still blogging regularly. She and Danielson were toying with some unusual theories about the brain. They speculated that every person is in fact “two” people, because the two hemispheres of the brain could have different personalities, genders, and good or bad moralities. They alsoexperimentedwith “unihemispheric sleep”, a method of trying to make half of your body sleep while half remains awake.To someone who is not a rationalist or AI-risk thinker, let alone a Zizian, much of Ziz’s writing would look like gibberish, perhaps even written by someone suffering from hallucinations. Here is one passagefrom2019:I think vampires are people who have made the choices long ago of a zombie or lich, who have been exposed to the shade to such a degree that it left pain that cannot be ignored by allowing their mind to dissolve. The world has forced them to be able to think. They do not have the life-orientation that revenants have to incorporate the pain and find a new form of wholeness.Yet Ziz’s writing was, at least in some sense, coherent, which was part of what made it seductive. It was cipher targeted to an extraordinarily specific reader – someone who knows computer jargon, has mathematical ability, has read hundreds of pages of Yudkowsky’s canonical work, understands decision theory, and is familiar with an array of niche fantasy and sci-fi references.Even then, she often coined her own concepts or gave new meanings to phrases from elsewhere. The vocabulary is so confusing that Nouzen helped to compile a glossary. When I saved the glossary as a Word document, it came to 78 pages.The only way to understand Ziz’s writing was to learn her language and theories; the problem was that this had a tendency to turn people into Zizians.By 2019, fissures were creeping into the rationalist community. A few years earlier, a former employee of Miri had created a salacious webpage that accused people affiliated with the organization of statutory rape. The president of Miri responded at the time,accordingto Wired, by saying that he had investigated “some of the most serious allegations” and “found them to be straightforwardly false”.Miri eventually reached an unspecified agreement with the ex-employee, who signed a document retracting his claims.Ziz came to believe that Miri had paid a monetary settlement to make the website’s author go away. She was enraged. A core principle of Miri’s understanding of decision theory is that a rational actor should never pay blackmail, because it encourages blackmailers. She seemed as angry about what she saw as that hypocrisy as about the allegations themselves. Her entire worldview had been built on the credibility of decision theory; now the scaffolding threatened to topple.At the same time, Ziz, Danielson and Leatham, who were having trouble finding employment, were considering suing CFar because, they argued, it discriminated against transgender women in hiring.(CFar disagrees with that characterization.)On 15 November 2019, the day of CFar’s annual retreat, Ziz sent an email to hundreds of people accusing Miri and CFar of “institutional betrayal”. She, Borhanian, Leatham and Danielson, dressed in black and wearing Guy Fawkes masks, attempted to disrupt the retreat. They handed out ramblingfliersaccusing Yudkowsky of contributing to an AI “arms race”, and blocked a road with a truck.Someone called the police and said, wrongly, that they were armed. A Swat teammobilizedand arrested all four. They were booked, subjected to what they later said were humiliating strip searches, and spent several days in jail. They were charged with four misdemeanors, as well as felony conspiracy, though the cases were never resolved.Ziz was consumed with revenge. Before she was arrested, she had alsosentan email to Yudkowsky:There is one crime in my religion thought to be punishable by hell. And that is lifting an evil god to heaven, feeding your fellow sentient beings to it in order to reach heaven yourself…I will burn down all evil gods on their thrones; see them in hell if I must. And I stake my soul, and much more importantly the multiverse, on justice without compromise or concession …If you want to make it out of this universe alive, I suggest you do the same.While living at the marina, Ziz and Danielson had met Curtis Lind, a friendly older man who docked his 117ft boat there. Lind was kind, his friendtoldOpen Vallejo; he once tried to convince city officials to use cruise ships as housing for homeless people. Heletducks and geese live on his boat.“He tended to not have very good judgment in his choice of people,” his friend Thomas Young said. “That’s partly how these people got into his life.”The rationalist fleet hadn’t worked out, so the Zizians had moved to a new strategy: “slackmobiles” made from covertly converted box trucks. The theory was that a commercial truck provided the mobile and cheap living of an RV, but more inconspicuously, to avoid camping permits and the attention of cops.Ziz and her friends acquired trucks and parked them near the docks while they retrofitted the interiors with beds and cooking equipment. They cut holes in the bottom of the trucks’ holds, toaccessthem without opening the cargo doors, and wriggled in and out to the raised eyebrows of people at the marina.View image in fullscreen‘At their best, rat houses were fun places to be an intellectually minded idealist.’Illustration: Matt Rota/The GuardianLind had decided to sell his boat and move to a trailer lot he owned in Vallejo. He was thinking of letting artists and craftspeople live on the lot in exchange for cheap rent. The Zizians loved the idea.Danielsonmadean agreement with Lind to use some trailers on the property as well as park up to half a dozen trucks there. She and Ziz abandoned their tugboat to sink slowly into the harbor, leaking oil.By early 2020, Ziz, Danielson, Borhanian and Leatham had moved their trucks to the Vallejo lot. The Zizians were increasingly isolated from the larger rationalist scene. Vallejo is about 30 minutes from Berkeley, and they’d been banned from CFar functions. They were outcasts of outcasts, too weird even for a community that prided itself on weirdness. Yet new people continued to trickle into the circle.One was Maximilian Snyder, known as “Audere”. He’d graduated from a prestigious private school in Seattle, then done academic work in philosophy and computer science at Oxford. He visited the Vallejo lot, along with someone who later told police she was named Suri Dao.According to people familiar with the group, prosecutors andreportingby the San Francisco Chronicle, Dao was almost certainly a recent high-school graduate from Denver named Tessa “Elizah” Berns, and almost certainly also the author of an account on Tumblr and Discord called Silver-and-Ivory.The Tumblr account contains dense discussions of leftwing political ethics, and expresses anger at parents (“almost all parents are evil in intent”), schooling and psychiatry. The author describesdealingwith “scrupulosity”anda “tendency to freak out and assign myself terrible painful punishments hyperbolically when I think I’ve screwed up”. The author also says she identifies as “bigender” anduseseither masculine or feminine pronouns.Berns was adopted from China, a childhood friend told the Chronicle, and had been bullied as a child. She’d been a spelling bee finalist in middle school andfinishedhigh school as a National Merit Scholar. She was thinking of running away from her first year of college, an idea which found sympathetic ears on a rationalist Discord chatroom that the Zizians frequented.Like the other Zizians, Berns welled with an anger at the world that seemed to braid genuine, visceral despair at moral injustice with adolescent self-absorption.Discord conversations would sometimes turn into speculations about the psychologies of famous killers such as Ted Kaczynski; during one such discussion, Berns offered a strange aside:silver-and-ivory:it’s really awkward talking about this because I’ve had very dramatic fantasies about becoming a knife murdererand I wrote this whole fake news article about it (…I’m not going to share here)A common theme of the chatroom discussions was resentment of authority – the government, the AI establishment, and especially parents and schooling.Here are Borhanian and a user who has been identified as Leatham:𒀭 💮 [Leatham]:not only do public schools function like public hospitals function like public courthouses function like public jails, they are also made out of the same materials. the same plastic chairs with cold aluminum legs, the same pinboards on the walls, the same clocks, the same “administrators” walking around. they all blur together. id microsleep during school too. it was so boring. i knew more math than the teachers and was forced to be thereemma.:i remember in like, second grade, a bunch of teachers standing around my desk saying i was hopeless and i’d never be able to do anything because when they told me to practice drawing cursive L’s and I’s I couldn’t get consistent sizes, and started drawing a border around my page insteadlater I was diagnosed with dyspraxia, learning disability affecting fine motor tasks …𒀭 💮 [Leatham]:they confiscated my katana [samurai sword], tried to make me sit in chairs a certain way, gave me an F for turning in a 10-page poem when they asked for a 1-page poem. i carved out some space such that i would just have chinese tea ceremonies at the back of class and talk with someone about math and [LessWrong] and would sit in my chair weird and refuse to pay attention and they stopped trying to stop me.…also i threw desks around because i was bored. not at anyone, i just wanted to throw desks. i did refuse to go to school my last year of highschool.emma.:…when i went to private school my parents would threaten to send me to public school insteadeveryone said i was so weird the kids there would super bully me and i’d get beat up or somethingwe must get revenge someday. for all of this.There was a similar discussion about the ethics of obligation to family:emma.:umm i’m curious what other ppl would do [with regards to] spending large amounts of money to save the life of a birth-family memberZiz:I would not…My family’s stance on the cosmos and [mine] are fundamentally misaligned. They chose to give their souls to the gods of the easy path, including evolution, as they commit suicide. My parents did not choose to create me in some timeless contract, some considered decision, they rolled the dice because their programming told them to.Adopting vocabulary from the multiplayer video game Among Us, some of the Zizians had started to speak of foes as “impostors” and of “airlocking” people they didn’t trust.Chatroom conversations sometimes spiraled into violent fantasies:emma.:like imagine getting tons and tons of revenge for JUSTICE!! isn’t that cool?silver-and-ivory:are you sure? do you get to hold bloody knives?as you plunge the knife into someone’s bared throatam unclear on how much i actually want to stab my mothers [her parents were gay women] but probably a lotemma.:Yesi mean if you wantthose can totally be good thingsemma.:like there’s totally a different way to do good vengeance vs evil vengeance, like, the shape of the poetry is different butbrutally plunging a knife into [a person’s] throat sounds like a clean killthey have to be actually bad thoughlike forcing you to go to school or somethingon pain of deathwhich is totally a thing parents door any of the other really bad things they do“kill your parents” is a very good memesilver-and-ivory:so much of my revenge imagery is about bleeding people dry, hanging the white women on my wall like beautiful dead butterflies, etc etc etcout of resentment for the false ideal they claimed to be and the reality of their imperfect selvesso that they can be perfect again in deathAfter two years of internal feuds, scandals and a pandemic, the rationalist community was under severe strain. Advances in machine learning had also called into question many of Miri’s technical assumptions about AI. Then the research organization OpenAI began investing in AI development at a scale that doomers found disturbing.In April 2022, Yudkowskypublisheda bleak essay of defeat: “It’s obvious at this point that humanity isn’t going to solve the alignment problem, or even try very hard, or even go out with much of a fight. Since survival is unattainable, we should shift the focus of our efforts to helping humanity die [with] slightly more dignity.”Confusion and disillusion slowly set in. Many people had paid dearly, personally and financially, to come to northern California to solve the alignment problem. They’d devoted years to the mission, often at great opportunity cost to their careers. They’d made the best friends they’d ever had, and then – in an environment where some people believed it was literally impossible to agree to disagree – lost them to bitter intellectual schisms, exhaustion and nervous collapse. They’d sacrificed to be present at the birth of the future, and now discovered that the future was already being born elsewhere.At the Vallejo lot, the Zizians embraced this burnout. Once upon a time they’d been National Merit Scholars, math-club types. Now, free from the constraints of external authorities and structures, they returned to a state of nature. They walked around naked, carried katanas, kept their own hours. They were feral,and relished it.Despite their peculiarities, the Zizians’ time at the lot had started well enough. Within a few months of their arrival, however, they’d stopped paying rent, citing a state Covid moratorium. Borhanian was probably the only one with any savings, and she had quit her Google job. The Zizians’ rent strike went on for two years, in an account Lind latergaveto a documentary filmmaker, and “got to the point where if they saw me they’d run away”.After the Covid law ended, in 2022, Lind decided to evict them.The Zizians requested a meeting to ask to stay for another two months for free. At the meeting, “I said, no, I can’t do that,” he recalled. “So one of them took out a … fairly large folding knife. And started patting the blade in his hand like this and looking at me and smiling.”Lind turned around and left. The next day he bought a gun.View image in fullscreenCurtis Lind was kind, he’d once tried to convince city officials to use cruise ships for homeless people.Illustration: Matt Rota/The GuardianTwo days before the sheriff’s office was scheduled to evict the Zizians, Berns approached Lind at the lot, according to Lind, and asked for his help turning off a tap leaking water into a trailer.As he bent to look, something hit him on the head and he blacked out. When he woke up, at least three of the Zizians were allegedly standing around him with knives.“[T]he right side of my skull was shattered,” Lind later said. “And I was bleeding from numerous puncture wounds … The back of my neck had some severe cuts. Like somebody was trying to cut my head off.” His torso was impaled with a samurai sword.Lind drew his gun, which was concealed in a pocket, and started shooting. He wounded Leatham and killed Borhanian. He stumbled away with the sword still in him. He survived, but lost an eye.Some friends of the Zizians have argued that the eruption of violence wasn’t so one-sided – or even that the Zizians, not Lind, were the ones acting in self-defense.The authorities did not agree. Leatham and Berns were arrested and charged with attempted murder. They were also charged with responsibility for Borhanian’s death, under a California felony murder law. At the lot after the attack, police also tried to interrogate a tall blond person there whose description matches that of Ziz. That person suddenly began having an apparent medical emergency. At a hospital, they vanished.When Lind’s friends and family latersearchedthe Zizians’ trucks, theyfoundmore than a dozen encrypted computers and an array of surgical equipment. They also found containers of lye, which they believed the Zizians intended to use to dissolve Lind’s body.Once the tipping point was reached, events seemed to accelerate by their own logic.In February, 2022, according to police, Michelle Zajko bought a 9mm pistol, ammunition and a holster in Vermont. She was now living there with Monday, as well as with a third acquaintance, Daniel Blank, a Berkeley bioengineering and computer science grad whose parents reported him missing.Zajko published a blogpostalludingto a power struggle of sorts. She claimed that Ziz had recently told her that the only way to regain her trust would be to murder Monday (“Ziz helpfully suggested I use a gun with a potato as a makeshift suppressor, and that I might destroy the body with lye”), and that if she didn’t, Ziz would come to Vermont and kill her.That never happened. Later that year, for unclear reasons, she and Ziz reconciled.Then, on the night of 31 December 2022, according to police documents, a neighbor’s doorbell camera captured a car arriving at Zajko’s parents’ house, in a suburb of Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter there was a flurry of movement at the Zajkos’ door. A higher-pitched voice appeared to be saying “Mom!” Two people later left the house.A few days later, Rita and Richard Zajko were found dead at home. They had been shot to death, with what police believed were 9mm bullets, during an apparent home invasion.Not long after that, Zajko went to Pennsylvania to identify her parents’ bodies and make funeral arrangements. She was their only heir. State troopers executed a search warrant at the hotel where she was staying, detained her, and found $40,000 in cash in her Subaru.The police also found Ziz in an adjoining hotel room, along with Blank. When they arrested them, Ziz lay down on the ground, shut her eyes and refused to move. She had to be carried out. Her booking photo shows her eyes closed, as if catatonic.Ziz was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Police continued investigating Zajko as a possible murder suspect, but did not charge her.Ziz spent five months in jail. On 22 June 2023, a judge agreed to reduce her bail. She was released on an unsecured bond, and never showed up to her court date.Within a year, two people thousands of miles away, who had never met Ziz, began acting strangely.The first was Felix Bauckholt, known as Ophelia, an earnest math prodigy from Germany who was working in New York as a quantitative trader. She was alreadymakinghalf a million dollars a year at the age of 26, but “was kind of a nonconformist”, Jessica Taylor told me, and extremely interested in political ethics. Bauckholt was online friends with some of the Zizians, and in one conversation she seemed to defend the Zizians’ alleged attack on Lind, Taylor said.The other person was Teresa Youngblut, a young computer science student at the University of Washington. Youngblut, who sometimes went as “Milo”, had attended the same private high school as Maximilian Snyder, and they’d reconnected online. Snyder had recentlywonhis AI research prize, and they had a lot to discuss.Around June and July, Bauckholt started taking secret phone calls,accordingto people who knew her. She cut contact with friends. In November she got on a flight and did not return. Not long after, Youngblut’s parents contacted police to report her missing, too, and in the grips of what they believed was a controlling romantic relationship.After disappearing, Bauckholt and Youngblut both went to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they lived at a rental property with Ziz and Zajko.Then, this January, Bauckholt and Youngblut went to Vermont. They wanted to see a property for sale – a remote, completely off-the-grid house, on 11 acres near the Quebec border.An employee at the hotel where they were staying contacted authorities about two guests who dressed in black, carried guns and acted strangely; the US border patrol began monitoring them.On 16 January 2025, back in Vallejo, prosecutors asked a judge to expedite Berns and Leatham’s trial for allegedly attacking Lind. The judge agreed. The next day, while Lind was at his lot, a man who prosecutors say was Snyder approached Lind, grabbed him and stabbed him to death.Three days later, Agent David Maland of the US border patrol pulled over Youngblut and Bauckholt as they were driving a Prius southbound near the Canadian border. Other officers arrived behind Maland.Youngblut, knowing Snyder had recently been arrested, may have panicked. She allegedly drew a gun and started shooting. Bauckholt also allegedly drew a gun. The officers returned fire, wounding Youngblut and killing Bauckholt.Maland died a short time later at the hospital.On 16 February, Ziz, Zajko and Blank were arrested in a rural area of western Maryland, not far from Pennsylvania, where they were living in two box trucks that they’d parked on a stranger’s land. They had handguns and a rifle, according to authorities, but surrendered nonviolently.According to a police report, Zajko pleaded with officers not to kill her.Snyder has now been arrested for Lind’s murder in California, joining Berns and Leatham. (All three deny the charges against them.) Berns and Leatham have both made escape attempts, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors also believe that “Suri Dao” was an alias Berns made up while being arrested;her lawyer hassaidthat is irrelevant.Berns and Leatham are both being held in mental health facilities, according to Wired, and are in significant distress. Berns has engaged in self-mutilation.Youngblut has been charged with attacking a federal officer. (She pleaded not guilty.) According to court filings, the car she and Bauckholt were in contained hollow-point ammunition, a night-vision monocular, a ballistic helmet, shooting targets, full-face respirator masks, handheld radios, cellphoneswrappedin tin foil, a dozen unspecified electronic devices, and a diary with references to doing LSD and passages of “apparent cypher text”.Ziz, Zajko and Blank are being held in a county jail in Maryland. They’ve been charged with trespassing and obstructing an officer; Ziz and Zajko have also been charged with firearms offenses. All three deny the charges against them, and at this time none have been charged in relation to any of the deaths that have occurred.During a recent hearing, Ziz pleaded for vegan food in jail and suggested she may be suffering from malnutrition. “I haven’t done anything wrong,” she told the judge. “I shouldn’t be here.”Theattorneyrepresenting Ziz in Pennsylvania, Daniel McGarrigle, told me that she is “wholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case”, and “has been vilified mercilessly” despite the fact that “only low-level misdemeanor charges” are pending in both the Pennsylvania and Maryland cases.Maland was recentlyburiedwith military honors. He was engaged to be married.The exact whereabouts of Alice Monday and Gwen Danielson are unknown, though both appear to be alive. They seem to have cut ties with the Zizians, and may bescaredthemselves.It goes without saying that the AI-risk and rationalist communities are not morally responsible for the Zizians any more than any movement isaccountablefor a deranged fringe. Yet there is a sense that Ziz acted, well, not unlike a runaway AI – taking ideas and applying them with zealous literality, pushing her mission to its most bizarre, final extremes.Although self-serving and grandiose, Ziz is probably to some extent sincere – “a true believer”, one person told me. It is unclear, however, what the Zizians’ long-term objectives were, if any. The murders they allegedly committed were less calculated acts of political violence than the flailing of a paranoid clique plunging out of society with no plan for how to get back.All they had left, in the end, was Oedipal rage, certainty in their conclusions and guns. Their alleged victims were an elderly landlord who liked to feed ducks, two suburbanite parents, a cop doing his job and themselves.Rachel Wolford, the startup founder, asked for anyone reading this to know that “there are a lot of weird nerds who are doing a lot of really good things. They are meaningfully trying to make the world better. It’s not that weird nerds are bad; it’s that weird nerds have specific failure modes that specific branches of Silicon Valley have done a very poor job of checking.”While expressing a range of views about AI safety, she and others believe it is still an important problem worth humanity’s time. They emphasized that AI does not need to become the distant basilisk of doomers’ waking nightmares to create seriouseconomic,surveillance,environmentalandsocialdilemmas in our near future.That message is increasingly unpopular in Silicon Valley, where the doomers have, by and large, lost to the accelerationists.Similarly, the rationalists’ influence has waned. “Post-rationalism” – a schoolemphasizingthe self-help aspects of the scene, and trading hard-headed rationality for new age-y spirituality – is ascendent, though splinters and remnants live on in freewheeling Discord chats and officious Reddit forums.So far, Snyder is the only one of the Zizians who has made any real public statement about his beliefs. Hedictateda 1,500-word letter to the San Francisco Chronicle to give to Yudkowsky, “from one student among many, to his old teacher”. The letter called on him to think of animals as “brothers and sisters”, and lamented that Yudkowsky “could have been much more pessimistic about humanity much sooner and avoided starting the AI arms race”.Yudkowsky refused to read it. To do so would be to surrender to blackmail and incentivize more alleged violence. Snyder, as a student of decision theory, ought to have known."

Vengeful nihilism is a big part of the Maga projectWed 5 Mar 2025 07.04 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 11.55 ESTShareIn thinking about the war being waged against life on Earth byDonald Trump, Elon Musk and their minions, I keep bumping into a horrible suspicion. Could it be that this is not just about delivering the world to oligarchs and corporations – not just about wringing as much profit from living systems as they can? Could it be that theywantto see the destruction of the habitable planet?We know that Trump’s overriding purpose is power. We have seen that no amount of power appears to satisfy his craving. So let’s consider power’s ultimate destination. It is to become not only an emperor, but the last of the emperors: to close the chapter on civilisation. It is to scratch your name indelibly upon a geological epoch. Look on my works, ye vermin, and despair.It’s true, of course, that many of his actions amount to standardcapitalist looting, released from the feeble regulatory restraints of previous administrations. This week Trump ordered themass destructionof national forests and other protected lands by the timber industry, to be overseen by the US Forest Service, whose new boss was previously vice-president of atimber company. The results will include heartbreaking losses of wildlife and rare ecosystems, and a heightenedrisk of wildfires. Trump justified his order with that classic dictator’s gambit: a purported “emergency”.He has used the same excuse to trigger a new wave of fossil-fuel projects, granting them “emergency” permits to override environmental protections. This is likely to cause the poisoning of wetlands and water supplies. Overseeing the assault is the new energy secretary, Chris Wright, previously CEO of afracking company.If the US were really suffering an “energy emergency”, you would expect the government also to accelerate the deployment of renewable power. Instead, Trump hasfrozen it. You might also expect it to insist that energy is used more sparingly; instead, his team is deletingfuel economy standards. This looks like payback to the fossil-fuel industry that helpedelect him.But other policies look more like gleeful vandalism. Thedevastating staffing cutsat national parks and forests won’t help any of his corporate backers. But they will degrade the experience of visitors, while jeopardising wildlife and habitats.The same goes for the mass destruction of jobs at theUS Fish and Wildlife Serviceandthe freezingof all the international conservation grants it offered, many of which are crucial to the protection of wildlife overseas. There’s not much to be gained here by any corporate lobby, and a great deal to be lost by the rest of us. Trump’s stated aim of “getting rid” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency would put corporate profits at severe risk, especially among insurers and investment funds, while intensifying the suffering of people hit by environmental crisis. He has alsoeliminated the helpoffered to communities suffering from heavy pollution. Again, there’s no obvious gain for capital, just plenty more human misery.Vengeful nihilism, the destruction of what they do not love, know or understand, is a major theme inMaga politics. It is applied as viciously to culture and science as it is to the natural world. It is hard to avoid the thought that environmental destruction is not just a means by which Trump serves his corporate backers, but an end in itself.At the same time, Trump enthusiastically (albeit vaguely) boosts Musk’s plans to send people to Mars, a planet incapable of supporting human life. These men, who claim without evidence that unless they cut $1tn from the federal budget, causing innumerable harms, “America will go bankrupt”, are pressing for a programme likely to cost hundreds of billions while delivering no benefit to humanity. For all its grandiosity, the plan amounts to nothing more than anelaborate meansof sending people to their deaths.One of the most persuasive explanations of our times I’ve read isan essayby the author Jay Griffiths, published in 2017. She connects today’s planetary vandals with the Italian futurists of the early 20th century. The futurists, who created much of the iconography and ideology of fascism, fetishised the machine, fantasising about “the technological triumph of humanity over nature”. They were obsessed by flight. “Hurrah! No more contact with the vile earth!”, the author of their manifesto, Filippo Marinetti, exulted. “Life on earth is a creeping, crawling business,” the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio claimed. “It is in the air that one feels the glory of being a man and of conquering the elements.”First Trump threatened to nuke hurricanes. Now he’s waging war on weather forecasters | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThrough flight, Griffiths notes, they believed they could achieve their ideal, purified state, characterised by the notion of Deus Invictus: the unbound, totalitarian god, no longer restrained by such earthy, humdrum matters as honesty, kindness, sympathy, respect or even gravity.I believe, like her, that the revival of this belief system might offer a key to understanding Elon Musk and his remarkable hold over theTrump administration. What Musk presents is the definitive fantasy of escape: from decency, care, love and the living planet itself. They can leave it all behind, leap off the vile Earth, and ascend into heaven.On Mars,Musk dreamsof building private cities under the exclusive control of his companySpaceX. Never mind thetechnical impossibilities; it’s the fantasy that counts: the definitive release from social and biological constraint. His subterranean prison cities, in which survival would depend on extreme technological intervention – the slightest interruption of which would mean instant death – would make the worst terrestrial dictatorship in history look like a yoga retreat. Deus Invictus would reign supreme.Where there is no love, there can be only destruction. Smash the planet then transcend it; leave your indelible mark on Earth while reigning triumphant in the heavens: this, I believe, is a deep, unspoken urge that helps explain Trump’s programmes. But even if, through some grim miracle, the planet wreckers succeeded, they would soon discover that no technological wonderland, no space station or Martian city, compares to what we have.This is the only planet in the universe to which we are adapted. Things we seldom think about – 1 bar of atmospheric pressure at the Earth’s surface; themagnetosphere, which, with the atmosphere, shields us from cosmic radiation and solar proton bombardment; ambient oxygen; 9.8 m/s2of gravity; an average surface temperature of 15C – create, alongside the living systems that feed, water and shelter us, a place that would sound like paradise to anyone removed from it. This is our heaven, and there can be no other.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionClimate crisisDonald TrumpFossil fuelsEnergyElon MuskMarscommentShareReuse this content"

Britain should facilitate thatWed 5 Mar 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.49 ESTShareThere are only so many times Donald Trumpcan be offered a state and royal visitto temper his political tantrums. With his latest attacks on Volodymyr Zelenskyy andthe halting of aid to Ukraine, it’s already clear that not even the offer of a bed for the night at Balmoral has worked.The silver lining of the Trump experience over the past fortnight is hopefully that it leads to a more realistic appraisal not just of the implications of the re-election of this narcissistic, bullying, corporate thug, but an understanding of the role the US has played over generations. Trump and his gang members JD Vance and Elon Musk are just the ugliest of faces of the US global policy pursued for a century at least.In 1992 Noam Chomsky published a bestselling booklet,What Uncle Sam Really Wants. A read of Chomsky may help Labour’s policymakers overcome their apparent naivety so worryingly displayed in the constant references to the special relationship between the UK and US.Trump’s “America First” policy is simply a more blatant articulation of the role the US has pursued globally since at least the second world war. The US has had no qualms in supporting, dealing with and sometimes installing authoritarian regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s across the globe for decades. Dividing up Ukraine and its natural resources with Putin is little different from what US administrations have done in Latin America and Africa by using their economic and military might.What has surprised European political leaders and commentators is that this is the first time a US president has done so on European soil since Franklin D Roosevelt carved up Europe with Stalinat Yaltain 1945 and that, unlike then, now there is no Churchill figure even to be invited to sit in the chair for the post-conference-deal photograph.Our political leaders can continue to try to exploit the fiction of the special relationship and seek to avoid direct diplomatic conflict with the US and to fawn over Trump to extract what concessions they can, but this is at best buying time. That time needs to be used wisely.In the short term, of course, there is a fundamental role to be played by European leaders to prevent a peace being imposed by Trump and Putin against the wishes of Ukraine. Standing up to the bullying behaviour of Trump and Vance to secure a place forEuropeand Zelenskyy at the negotiating table is essential if Ukraine is not to be betrayed and a stable peace is to be secured.During last Friday’spre-planned muggingin the Oval Office Trump told Zelenskyy that he had no cards to play in these negotiations. That might have played well with the Trump base for now, but Vance, in particular, knows that pictures of Russian tanks rolling into Kyiv as a result of a US withdrawal of support for Ukraine would more than match the opprobrium poured on Joe Biden (even though Trump signed the deal) as a result of thewithdrawal from Afghanistan. It would have the potential of dismembering the Trump cult Vance would rely upon four years from now in a post-Trump election.But in the longer term, it is clear that Trump’s behaviour since re-election – extolled in his nauseatingly arrogant, error-strewnspeech to Congresson Tuesday night – is forcing on to the political agenda across Europe and the global south a discussion of what alternatives there are to a politics and economics dominated by the whims of US presidents and the aggressive self-interest of China.There is an opening now for a much greater and more longer-sighted “coalition of the willing” capable of bringing together those in Europe and the global south to create the alliances and institutions needed to pursue the political and economic agenda that the US now resiles from.This includes an economic cooperation agenda not based upon tariffs and protectionism for the wealthy, but one that is mutually beneficial and tackles both the grotesque inequalities between north and south and the common threat of the climate emergency.The US, with its slashing of aid and punitive tariffs, is increasingly alienating countries and continents, and this presents an immense diplomatic opportunity for Keir Starmer’s government. Some say it’s the PM’s chance to make his mark on history.Unwise and immoral plans to cut British overseas aid, undermining soft power, are a legacy of a sort, but how much better it would be to see our prime minister using our influence and heft to bring together all those who want to discuss and construct a world reordered without the malign influences of Trump and China. That really would be a place in history worth having.John McDonnell is MP for Hayes and Harlington.

So important that I can no longer remember what it was. Whatever it was, the commissioner stayed alert for a minute or two but soon clouded over and demanded: “What is it you’re trying to say?”“Say? I’m just saying it’s really interesting.”“And it is,” she conceded. “But you can’t just do a general …” She groped for the right word. “Grope,” she said eventually, firmly. “You can’t just do a general grope around a subject.” She made a kind of rummaging motion with her hands as she said this.The thing is, what I crave as a listener and viewer is exactly that: a general – basic, simple, idiot’s guide, call it what you will – examination of a story or issue.I was listening to You Do Not Have to Say Anything onRadio 4. It’s a series of 10 15-minute programmes explaining the workings – also not workings – of the criminal justice system, presented by a defence barrister called Joanna Hardy Susskind. I enjoyed it so much that I found myself wondering how on earth it got commissioned because it amounted to, as my commissioner might have put it, a general grope. And I have no greater compliment to pay any piece of broadcasting.In it, we are walked through the process of criminal justice, from arrest through to conviction or acquittal. This is important stuff, which frankly we all ought to know anyway and doubtless kid ourselves we do, when we really don’t. There are many reasons for this, not least among them the absence of programmes like this one. Credit is due to those who resisted – or perhaps never made – demands to innovate, say something new or say something old but in a new, imaginative way, with whatever bells, whistles, tricks, conceits or freaky formats can be drummed up. Even the sound design on this one is just right – unusual, but subtle and nonintrusive.It’s so rare to come across anyone in documentary-making playing a straight bat. To be fair, the problem is often someone like me, a presenter, getting in the way. I crave beginning-to-end histories of things. Ken Burns is the master, with his series on Vietnam, the civil war, prohibition, baseball and so on. And I’ve embarrassed myself several times upon meeting Norma Percy, falling at the feet of the extraordinary woman behind The Death of Yugoslavia, Putin, Russia and the West and many others. Her latest film,Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7thOctober, is out now. Given the subject, I’m sure people will find in it fuel for their fury, but there’s no fancy footwork getting in the way of the story she is trying to get across.Tellingly, some of the most successful podcasts tend to be the most basic in structure. The Rest Is History features two adults speaking knowledgeably to each other in order to get an in-depth story told. No innovation necessary. Although it’s so simple a format that probably in itself counts as radical. It works.Yet the innovators, the reimaginers and the revolutionaries march on, and not just in media. And to some extent that’s healthy and necessary, as long as it’s clear that not everything must improve, not everything must be changed. Otherwise, I end up with 30 functions on my tumble dryer when I only need two – namely how long and how hot. And my mum has to choose between 92 buttons on two remote controls to operate her telly. And my electric car gives me not physical buttons, switches or sliders to grasp, but a touchscreen that would be amazing if I could keep my (nondominant) left hand steady enough to actually use it.All this fulmination may of course merely be a sign that I’m now the old fart I swore I’d never become, thinking everything used to be better in the old days. But I don’t think so. Good question for a documentary, that.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But such was the case when Jacqui Heinrich, a senior political correspondent at Fox, responded to the news that Trump’s White House would now handpick the reporters who get to cover the president in small settings, with the post: “This move does not give the power back to the people – it gives power to the White House.” Heinrich was specifically responding to press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s Orwellian claim that lettingDonald Trumpchoose who would cover him was designed to restore power “back to the American people”.The fruits of the new policy were richly on display during the sickening scene that unfolded in the Oval Office last week. If the president and JD Vance’s disgraceful treatment ofVolodymyr Zelenskyywasn’t bad enough, there was the unprecedented role that the “press” played in the unseemly drama.Here I’m not simply referring to Brian Glenn’s pugnacious demand that the leader of a war-torn nation justify his sartorial decisions – less a question than a provocation that served as a prelude to the pile-on that followed. Trump appeared to wink at Glenn, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, a far-right cable channel freshly included in the press pool, leading to speculation that Glenn’s question had been scripted in advance, a speculation that is both plausible – I mean, why not? – and irrelevant.These are the kinds of questions we should expect when serious journalists are replaced with puppets who perform the role of state propagandistsFor whether scripted or not, these are the kinds of questions we should expect when serious journalists are replaced with mouthpieces of the regime, puppets who perform the role of state propagandists in the guise of reportage. Glenn, who dates Majorie Taylor Greene and describes himself as “100% behind President Trump”, claims not to truck in far-right conspiracy theories – while insisting that January 6t was anantifa-instigated inside joband that a vast mechanism of fraud cost Trump the 2020 election.But before Glenn turned on the Ukrainian president, he had directed an earlier question to Trump: “Mr President, [do] you think ultimately your legacy will be the peacemaker and not the president that led this country into another war … ?” This puffball in the guise of a query gave Trump the opportunity to wax poetic: “I hope I’m going to be remembered as a peacemaker … I’m doing this to save lives more than anything else … Thank you, Brian, for that question. It was a nice question.”But we weren’t done with paeans to the great peacemaker. No sooner had Zelenskyy tersely assured Glenn that he would wear a suit once the war had ended, we were greeted with this question: “Keir Starmer … praised your courage and conviction to lead … What gave you the moral courage and conviction to step forward and lead?”Three billionaires: America’s oligarchy is now fully exposed | Robert ReichRead moreIn a properly functioning press corps, we might have expected that the question was directed to Zelenskyy, who, with exceptional fortitude and resolve, has led his countryin a war against a ruthless aggressor. But no. The question was directed to Trump, who responded: “Boy, I love this guy. Who are you with?” The answer was One America News, another network that operates to the far right of Fox, trafficking in conspiracy theories and committed to an unwavering support of Maga politics – and also a beneficiary of the White House’s commandeering of its own press pool.Once again, Trump grew almost wistful – “I like the question … it’s a very good question” – before blaming Russia’s invasion ofUkraineand Hamas’s attack on Israel on Joe Biden. From there, as we witnessed, things grew more acrimonious, but lost in the belligerent and belittling treatment of Zelenskyy, particularly at the hands of Vance (“Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting?”) was the Pyongyang-esque quality of Trump’s hand-picked pool reporters using their questions not to challenge or examine, but to burnish and bolster the Great Leader with ever fluffier valentines of adoration.Meanwhile, the Associated Press remained barred from the historic meeting, because it continues to call a body of water that lies almost entirely outside of US jurisdiction by the name it has carried since the 16th century.Lawrence Douglas is a professor of law at Amherst College in MassachusettsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingTrump administrationUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS politicsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

We may be random, chum, but we’ve definitely fought in a bunch of wars, which – wait, let me check my notes –you started.Kemi Badenoch’s approach needs a bit of background. She’d been asked about our randomness by a reporter the day before, when she was on the farmer’s march, with Victoria Atkins standing behind her puzzlingly dressed in a union flag jacket, like Geri Halliwell trying to get into a golf club. Put a pin in that, because it will come up again later. “Well, I know JD Vance quite well,” Badenoch said. “I’ve looked at the comments, I don’t think he actually said that. A lot of people are getting carried away, they’re saying loads of things.”The unfortunate thing is, hedidsay that; if you wanted to deny it, your best possible bet would be “he didn’t mean us, he meant France”, which wouldn’t be very comradely. The opposition leader’s course, to deny a thing we saw and heard, then cover it in the meaningless mouth-noises of “a lot of people” saying “loads of things”, looks like dimwittery but is actually systematically corroding observable reality.But never mind, in the Commons she took a new tack: a series of statements with which no reasonable person could disagree. She joined the prime minister in gratitude for our troops, and asked him to join her in hoping we wouldn’t end up in a war against Russia. “That’s the last thing anybody wants to see,” Starmer agreed, and I don’t want to say it’s the weirdest exchange that’s ever happened inPMQs, but it’s certainly a new way to use time, agreeing that nobody wants that thing nobody wants.“The surest risk is if Putin feels that he can breach a deal,” Starmer continued, as if he was just one big thought away from the killer clause, that he could insert into a deal and make it watertight, and this satisfied Badenoch, who went on to be satisfied by a bunch of other optimistic, bordering on magical, assertions.Could the prime minister “update the house on the steps he is taking to persuade America it’s in their national interest to provide a security guarantee”? Sure he can: Trump already made it “absolutely clear”, in Washington, “that he would have our backs”, and Starmer has spoken to him three times since on the phone. We’re into teenagers-who’ve-been-on-a-date territory. When he said he’d call but immediately before that said he was going to be very busy for the next three years, that means he’ll call, right? What if I call him, three times, and he picks up? This is great news, right?Badenoch pushed Starmer a little on his certainties, raising the tiny matter of the US suspending intelligence-sharing with Ukraine, which could conceivably be a bad sign, and was again placated by the bafflingly bland response: “We need to ensure that the US, the UK, Europe and Ukraine are working together.”It’s hard to see how these questions could have been handled differently. Nobody, not even Nigel Farage, would ever want to side with the US and agree that we’re random. Likewise, nobody – OK, apart from Ed Davey – wants to pick a fight with America, at this delicate time, when their gloves are off but their fists are still considered so vital that other world leaders are reduced to watching and hoping that they’ll sometimes punch in the right direction.There really couldn’t be a worse time for the government and the opposition to be openly disagreeing, particularly given that neither would find it tactically useful to say what they think in the first place. The only question is, did they agree all that in advance? Or is there some bat signal they give off, to park the rancour, like divorcees at a parents’ evening?This is where Victoria Atkins came in, in a supporting role: do something, anything, to make it clear we’re all still at each other’s throats, do it loud, and do it in a lively outfit – Michael Jackson-style marching-band attire – so that no one can miss it. She overshot, shouted “lie” and then had to apologise. But she played her part in creating the impression that it was all still fighty, shouty business as usual, and the nation should thank her; otherwise we’d really start to panic.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerKemi BadenochHouse of CommonsForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

And Democrats are nowhere to be seenWed 5 Mar 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.03 ESTShareWhat was the point ofDonald Trump’saddress to Congresson Tuesday night? The annual speech – called the “State of the Union” address in every year except the one just after the president’s ascent to office – has long been a somewhat outdated bit of political theater, an event light on policy specifics and heavy on messaging in an era in which political messaging’s most effective venues have long since moved online.It’s perhaps even less clear what a speech toCongressis supposed to mean for this president, who has proven himself so indifferent to constitutional limits on his power – or for this Congress, which has shown itself so willing to abdicate its own constitutional responsibilities. It seems, like so many of the formalities of American politics do now, a bit like a phantom limb: something that Americans keep feeling for long after it has been excised. How long will it be, one wonders, until everyone stops bothering to go through the motions?As Republicans thunderously applauded and Democrats walked out in droves, Trump’s Congress speech showcased the US divide | Lloyd GreenRead moreBut Trump, for one, seems to delight in any opportunity to make a spectacle of himself. On Tuesday, with a captive audience of all of Congress, many military leaders, about half of the US supreme court, and large swaths of the American public, he set about indulging all of hisworst whims and lowest impulses. He repeatedly and extensively insulted his predecessor, the former president Joe Biden, by name and in strong terms. He relitigated old grievances, from his many prosecutions to his annoyance that not everyone likes him. He threatened the sovereignty of Panama and Greenland, went into extended discussions of the careers of various transgender athletes, boasted of ending “the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion” and removing “the poison of critical race theory”, and reminded his audience that he had renamed the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”. Occasionally, the gathered Republicans in the crowd would burst into grunting chants of “USA! USA!” It was worse than merely vulgar. It was stupid.Trump boasted of the rapid pursuit of his agenda in the weeks since he returned to power, declaring that the US was entering its “greatest, most successful era” and that “our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never seen, perhaps never will see”. In fact, the country is on the verge of an economic recession. Thousands of federal workers have been laid off, and Trump’s hefty tariffs on theUS’s largest trading partners– namely Canada, Mexico and China – sent the stock market into a freefall earlier that day. In the past, Trump has got cold feet, and backed off his tariff threats. On stage in the House chamber, he doubled down on them, declaring that he would pursue his trade wars, and acknowledging: “There will be a little disturbance.”Democrats, who have told their voters that Trump represents a threat to democracy, sat silently, holding up ping-pong paddles printed with the word ‘false’Trump spoke intensely and at length about his culture war grievances, touting his executive orders declaringEnglish to be the United States’ official languageand that the federal government would recognize “only two genders”. “Our country will be woke no longer,” he said.He also touted his record on immigration, boasting of his administration’s mass deportation plans and the decreased number of migrants and asylum seekers at the southern border. He dwelt at length on stories of violence by undocumented immigrants, pointing to the families of murdered Americans in the crowd and describing undocumented people as “savages”. Alluding to a fringe legal theory that could be deployed to support his unconstitutional effort to end birthright citizenship, he referred to the immigrant population as an “occupation”, and cast his own mass deportation effort as something like the expulsion of an invading army – which sounds a lot more noble than the chaoticand brutal humiliationsandhuman rights abusesthat have actually taken place as a part of Trump’s deportation effort.In a section on economic issues, he blamed Biden, specifically, for theprice of eggs, which have soared in some places to nearly $20 a dozen. (According to reporting from NPR, some of Trump’s advisers have asked him to talk more about egg prices, which were a repeated talking point during his campaign but which he has mentioned rarely since taking office, though prices continue to climb.) He also repeatedfalse claimsby Elon Musk’s extra-constitutional government-slashing group, the “department of government efficiency”, that Musk’s band of sycophantic teenagers who are leading the decimation of government services have found “hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud and waste” in Musk-targeted programs, such as social security.They have not.In fact, he talked about Biden a lot. At times, when he seemed to get distracted or lose his place in the speech, Trump appeared to insert insults towards Biden almost as filler. “And think of where we were withJoe Biden,” he said, in one such non-sequitur. “Biden took us very low, the lowest we have ever been.” Other digressions included complaints about his own various grievances and mistreatment. “Nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody,” he said once, after a brief discussion of a bill to combat revenge porn.Where were the Democrats during all this? Mostly, they were quiet. A few high-profile Democratic leaders, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the senator Patty Murray, skipped the speech. Others stayed and sat, sedate. Reportedly, word had gone outfrom Democratic leadershipthat party members should have a “dignified” presence at the speech, neither seizing the spotlight nor protesting against Trump out loud. The result was underwhelming.Democrats, who have told their voters that Trump represents a threat to democracy, sat silently, holding up ping-pong paddles printed with the word “false”. In an apparent nod to women’s eroded rights, some of them wore pink. Trump, for his part, used their silent presence to his advantage, turning them into props. Even if he cured a terrible disease, he jeered at the Democrats: “They will not stand, they will not jeer, they will not clap.” In fact, Trump has frozen virtually all federal funding of research into those terrible diseases, like cancer and Alzheimer’s, that American scientists were once working to cure. An opposition worth the name could have pointed that out; the one we have raised their ping-pong paddles a little higher.Trump is not the figure he used to be. He no longer seems to be quite in control of his own administration: he has delegated most spending policy to Musk, and has busied himself instead merely with turning the federal law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI and the broader justice department, into instruments of his petty revenge. He’s not funny any more. But he is also more comfortable in power: even less deferential to formality, even less reverent towards his office, even more inclined to turn the presidency into what was always his greatest passion, a TV show.In Trump’s hands, an old State of the Union convention – pointing out citizens who had been brought to Congress as special guests – was given a new twist: Trump set the people up for surprises. One child, a 13-year-old aspiring police officer with cancer, was gifted with an honorary membership in the Secret Service; the cameras on him, his sunken eyes widened with surprise. A teenager who aspired to go to West Point stood up to wave to the crowd, and was told by Trump himself that he’d gotten in; his jaw momentarily hung open. The genre was the gameshow, the carnivalesque kind where nobodies see if they can catch some luck amid the random dispensation of gifts by the glamorous and benevolent host. Think of Oprah, in her decadent generosity, yelling: “You get a car!” In these moments, Trump seemed to be having fun. At least somebody is.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsUS CongressTrump administrationDemocratsUS immigrationJoe BidencommentShareReuse this content"

But for some, we can beofEngland, we just cannot beEnglish. Capisce? Because, as they see it and say it, the main ingredient of Englishness is whiteness.For wisdom on this, as in all things, we turn to the former home secretary, would-be once-upon-a-time Conservative party leaderSuella Braverman. Referring to non-white, largely non-Christian communities in England, of which she appears to disapprove, Braverman said: “Some in these communities may hold British passports and be born here. But does that make them English?”According to most people, it does. WhenYouGov asked English adultsa few years back, 81% of those canvassed said being born in England pretty much does it. Fifty-seven per cent said growing up in England was enough, 29% thought just “considering themselves English” was enough. Which rules out Braverman. All good.“Remember that you are an Englishman and have consequently won first prize in the lottery of life,”quippedthe genocidal coloniserCecil Rhodes. You doubt he had Maro Itoje, captain of the England rugby team or young Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, mixed-heritage son of an English prince, or any of their ilk in mind when he proclaimed this.The belonging-driven desire to prove yourself “worthy” of Englishness is part of why we’re having this debate today. It is probably why the likes of Braverman contort themselves to project a questionable image of who they are and who and what they think other minorities are – or should be.Poor Rishi Sunak, his English “lottery winnings” were questioned on the rightwing Triggernometry podcast by the host, who cited the disqualifying fact that the former PM, former champion of the English Tory right, is a “Brown Hindu”. Of course, Sunak won the lottery beforeby marrying an heiress, but money isn’t everything. In this regard, it isn’t anything. Poor Sunak. So, quick pop quiz: what does a Black boy born in London to Nigerian parents and raised in an English village by a (white-appearing) German mother and a (white) Scottish father consider his nationality? The correct answer is, of course, English, though Braverman might wag that finger.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Maro Itoje with the Calcutta Cup, 22 February 2025.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/Rex/ShutterstockI am that boy. I was born in London, in the same hospital as Prince William (guess he’s English), and spent much of the first decade of my life raised in England, in a small Oxfordshire village called Benson. A place that I often joke is “so white (and cold) that white people don’t know it exists” (most don’t). Even though my father was Scottish, and my mother was German, I was raised an English boy by my foster parents (which passes the YouGov test). Understandably, by the time I came into consciousness of nationality there was no question about it: I was English. Beyond that, I was English to the point that I harboured what would today be considered nationalist tendencies (the Conservative party or Reform would have loved me).I didn’t become at all “British”, let alone British Nigerian, until I was much older and had been subject to a series of “stay-in-your-place-ism” moments, as well as travelling the world a bit. What happens abroad is interesting. When I open my mouth, I’m considered either English or British (or “oyinbo” in Nigeria).Yet despite pollssaying that skin colour and Englishness aren’t inextricably linked, I find I am considered English practically everywhere but in Braverman’s corner of England. Poor little me.Perhaps there are valid debates to be had about who is English and who is not. What makes an Englishman and what makes a bloody foreigner. What defines Englishness: blood and soil, birth and culture, heritage and ethnicity, who you support during a cricket match or the ability to score a World Cup-winning penalty? Is Englishness a fluid or a stationary concept? Who gets to decide: those who have been English for centuries, those who had Englishness imposed upon them and/or those who chose to embrace the concept?Can a brown Hindu be English? English people say yes. Why do so many on the right say no? | Kenan MalikRead moreBut be under no illusion why we are discussing this now. It’s not about who to embrace, it’s about who to exclude. It’s part of the erosion of the firewall between mainstream conservativism and ethno-supremacism. There is a disturbing racist effort to delegitimise the place and position of non-white people in Europe, with the hard-right dream of “remigration” as the ultimate end result.If you can delegitimise Rishi Sunak and mark his card for “remigration”, then everyone else is fair game. Some don’t even need delegitimising: they’re ready to do it to themselves. Imagine Braverman, from her first-class seat on the one-way Remigration Airways flight: “I see nothing wrong with this: I’m not even English. Anyway, the Islamists run Britain now, so what’s to stay for? Steward, when’s dinner? I’ll have anything but tofu.”The news is bad for blowhard podcasters, desperate politicians and assorted racists, for Englishness is becoming more brown and more beautiful. Englishness is today as much Bukayo Saka, just as Japaneseness is Naomi Osaka, as Yorubaness isAshleigh Plumptreand South Africaness is Charlize Theron. The world is evolving, and the labels?

As the occupying power, Israel is legally bound to allow relief into Gaza under the Geneva convention. Denying it isn’t just inhumane – it’s awar crime. But Benjamin Netanyahu already faces an international criminal courtarrestwarrant for “starvation as a method of warfare” and “crimes against humanity”.Mr Netanyahu’s ability to flout international law is thanks to Donald Trump, who remains firmly in his corner. Washington now appears to accept starvation as an Israeli bargaining chip to pressure Hamas into accepting aUS-devisedtruce extension – one that secures hostage exchanges while ensuring Israeli forces remain in Gaza. Hamas, which sparked the war with its 2023massacreof Israeli civilians, insists Israel honour its commitment to a second phase of Gazaceasefirenegotiations – ending the fighting and withdrawing troops.Palestinians in Gaza are on the brink. Food isrunningout, hospitals are unable to function and families scavenge for clean water. Any further aid restrictions will turn desperation into catastrophe. It would be far better for a negotiated peace to be worked out that would see the Palestinians stay to rebuild their lives and for the remaining Israeli hostages to return home.After 15 months of war, and having achieved many of its declared objectives, Israel is no closer to peace in Gaza. That view is echoed byScott Atranof Paris’s Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, who polled civilians in Gaza in January, shortly before the ceasefire came into effect. Prof Atran correctly argues that Israel lacks a political strategy for Palestine’s future and is only fuelling Palestinian anger.From the outset, the Trump administration has pursued an aggressive, unilateral approach to Gaza, aligning firmly with Israeli interests while disregarding Palestinian concerns. According toNabeel Khoury, a former US state department official, the Abraham accords – Mr Trump’s flagship Middle East initiative – remain central to Washington’s evolving strategy, one that envisions Israeli territorial consolidation and unchallenged regional dominance.Mr Khoury has noted the US’s immediate priority is the wholesale removal of Palestinians from Gaza, followed, if conditions permit, by a gradual takeover of the West Bank. That vision coincides with the Washington visit of Israel’s far-right finance minister,Bezalel Smotrich, a pro-annexationist who has warned Mr Netanyahu that he would collapse the government if Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza under a truce.AnArab-led planfor Gaza’s post-war reconstruction – allowing its 2 million residents to remain – was rebuffed by the US and Israel. Yet it marked an important show of force: a pan-Arab coalition pushing back against the visible Netanyahu-Trump effort to erase Palestinian self-determination. In contrast, reports suggest the Trump administration is indirect talkswith Hamas.If true, this would be a striking reversal of US policy. Engaging Hamas – once deemed untouchable – as a US negotiating partner might be pragmatic realism, an example of Trumpian transactional diplomacy or both. The UNestimatedin 2019 that oil and natural gas resources in the occupied Palestinian territories could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for development. But Palestinian national aspirations are impossible under occupation.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Vladimir Putin’s aggression, hetolda stunned Bundestag in explanation, meant that Europe was living through aZeitenwende, or turning point.Mr Scholz was right. But it has taken the return ofDonald Trumpto the White House to lay bare the full scale of the emerging threat to European values, security and economic interests. For leaders across the continent, the dawning realisation of what Trump 2.0 means for the transatlantic alliance constitutes a second historic moment of jeopardy and decision.Crucially, Mr Scholz’s centre-right successor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, appears ready to act accordingly. Mr Merz won February’s snapelectionon a manifesto that would have boxed in state spending on both defence and a stagnating economy. But on Tuesday heU-turnedto quite spectacular effect, unveiling a proposal to change Germany’s Basic Law to permit huge debt-financed investment in the military and the economy.In a famously cautious political culture, Mr Merz’s bid to bypass legal restrictions on government debt represents aseismic shift. It would permit a step-change in defence spending for years to come, putting Germany in a leadership position as Europe seeks strategic autonomy from the United States.This would not, however, come at the expense of vital investment in other areas. The proposed deal, if passed by the outgoing Bundestag next week, would also incorporate Social Democratic party (SPD) demands for spending on economic and social infrastructure. This would be channelled through a €500bn special fund, also to be financed by borrowing.Mr Merz, a former investment banker, has been a deficit hawk and economic liberal throughout his career. It is an irony of fate that it should fall to him to challenge the debt-aversion that has hobbled Germany’s ability to react to new geopolitical realities. But the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader should be congratulated for having the political courage to read the signs of the times.Across Europe,poorly performingeconomies and a lack of investment have fuelled distrust in mainstream politics, and contributed to the dangerous rise of the Trumpian far right. In Germany, the constitutional “debt brake” – in effect a legal requirement to balance budgets – was originally conceived as a means of protecting younger generations from the consequences of risky borrowing. In these tumultuous times, amid multiple costly challenges, it has instead become an obstacle to investing in their future.Other leaders should take note – not least in Britain, where the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,appears likelyto double down on her self-imposed fiscal rules in this month’s spring statement. Thursday’s EU summit in Brussels is expected to license greater national spending on defence. But for a new era characterised by threats at home and abroad, a sea change in the EU’s overall approach to debt and deficits, similar to that agreed by Mr Merz with the SPD, is needed.Echoing the words of the former European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi, during the eurozone crisis, Mr Merzpledgedon Tuesday to do “whatever it takes” to protect freedom and peace. He will need the support of the Greens, as well as the SPD, to push his gamechanging proposals through. It is in the overwhelming interests of Germany and Europe that he gets it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus, a letter byFrancis HanlyWed 5 Mar 2025 12.53 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.56 ESTShareAsh Sarkar is right to point out that the left’s sanctimony has alienated sections of the working class (The left keeps getting identity politics wrong – and the right is benefiting from that, 3 March). The young adults I teach include white working- and middle-class boys, and also girls, who struggle to find purpose, place and pride in their identity.In this increasingly atomised society, many of us have lost our allegiances to broad groups and seek to define our identities in ever-shrinking niches. And in unsafe times, belonging becomes so high-stakes that to be cast from the group for some perceived infringement is terrifying. The need we all have to feel a sense of belonging battles with the desire to be seen for “who you really are”. But the truth is that knowing “who you really are” is your life’s work, and to solidify that in your young adult phase is restrictive and damaging.We have lost the broad and safe spaces in which we can explore, listen, grow, play with ideas and change our minds. Now, with the well-meant support of our peers and carers, we declare our team, nail our colours to the mast and unfortunately paint ourselves into corners. When a question can lead to expulsion from the group, we lose our own viewpoints. The only way to counter disagreement is to ridicule and shut down others.How do we form broad, inclusive and safe alliances to replicate those we have lost? We need alliances where we share values but can tolerate a range of views that we may sometimes find uncomfortable, where we can explore challenging ideas and develop true resilience, rather than groups that exclude, cancel, reduce and alienate – ironically and tragically in the name of inclusion.Deborah O’ConnorLondonThank you, Ash Sarkar, for such a timely analysis. Focusing on identity politics only benefits the right, as all it does is set us against each other. Rather than help us discover our shared interests and concerns, it atomises us into competing groups. Identity politics is a trap set by the right, and the left walked straight into it. It’s time to focus on what we have in common and forge a new class politics.Francis HanlyLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The long-term cost is far more, with £59.7bn already allocated inoperational subsidies.However, it is also about the technology. Thepublic accounts committee recently warnedof “a high risk that CCUS [carbon capture, utilisation and storage] will not deliver to the timescales or the level of carbon reductions needed”, jeopardising UK carbon targets. MPs also criticised the government’s overreliance on CCUS, neglecting alternatives like renewable energy, saying it risks keeping energy bills high and tied to the volatile gas market, while offering no guarantee of meaningful progress toward net zero.A major flaw in CCUS, especially for gas-fired plants and blue hydrogen, is its failure to address upstream emissions, including methane leakage, which formsthe bulk of a plant’s carbon footprint. Methane accelerates climate breakdown faster than CO2. The Climate Change Committee’s recentseventh carbon budget reportignored this issue, as its methodology only accounts for UK carbon budgets, excluding emissions from global gas supply chains, such as liquefied natural gas from Texas or Qatar.This week, I have beenchallenging the government at the appeal courtover CCUS’s climate risks, because its use in gas plants results in significantly more CO2and methane leaking into the atmosphere than is captured.Dr Andrew BoswellNorwichAny short-term savings from green cuts will be dwarfed by the costs of delaying the push for net zero. However, cutting carbon capture use and storage would not be a bad thing – if the money were moved from this expensive technology, which does not yet work at any meaningful scale, to cheaper things that do work: renewables and storage, insulation, and public information campaigns.CCUS is being used by fossil fuel interests to suggest that continued extraction is acceptable, but the truth is that none of the six operational CCUS projects worldwide has met its targets, and some have failed altogether despite billions in public investment.Even if they all met their targets, the total carbon removal would be a tiny percentage of current global emissions. It would be far more effective to focus short-term efforts on known technologies for emissions reduction.David StokesHertfordIt is a mistake to advocate for investment in carbon capture and storage as a key part of the drive towards net zero. The energy inventory of this technology shows it to be a poor investment for the foreseeable future as it requires a heavy electrical input for a modest return in CO2removal. The one country where a viable scheme is running is Iceland, as it has unlimited geothermal energy resources.A much better return on investment would be the extension of the electrical grid, particularly north-south close to our western seaboard. Marine tidal energy generation is now a mature technology, held in check by the absence of grid connections.In the UK we have globally unrivalled energy generation potential around our coasts. The lunar gravitational pull is a totally predictable and reliable energy source, which would provide for the base load. This would remove all justification for further investment in nuclear power, which – contrary to Keir Starmer’s assertions – would not make us energy-independent, as the UK has no uranium mines.Kate MacintoshWinchester, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

One night in Paris changed that. The Liverpool goalkeeper gave the performance of a lifetime, by his own admission, to ensure Paris Saint-Germain’s dominance came to nothing. Harvey Elliott applied theécraser et attraper. That’s smash and grab, to you and me.Liverpool could have been buried in the first half of the first leg alone. Luis Enrique’s young, fast and vibrant team squandered several clear chances and bemoaned the decision not to dismiss Ibrahima Konaté for denying Bradley Barcola a clear goalscoring opportunity. Even Slot admitted that was a close call.‘The best goalkeeper in the world’: Arne Slot hails Alisson’s Paris masterclassRead moreBut Alisson stood tall throughout. The 32-year-old has been well protected by his defence this season. Not here. How Liverpool needed their world-class keeper, the man whose latesave against Napolikept Jürgen Klopp’s team on course to become European champions in 2019.Alisson produced nine saves to drive PSG to despair, a record for a Liverpool goalkeeper in aChampions Leaguefixture and the most the Brazil international has made in any game for the club. He was even involved in the grand larceny of Elliott’s late winner, struck 47 seconds after the substitute had entered the pitch. Alisson’s long ball was gathered well by another impressive substitute, Darwin Núñez, who laid the ball into the path of Elliott to strike a clinical finish past Gianluigi Donnarumma. It was the only time the PSG crowd fell silent all night. A goalless draw would have felt scant reward for their team’s efforts.Parc des Princes provided a spectacular backdrop to the meeting of the free-scoring French champions and runaway Premier League leaders. The home crowd were in fine voice long before the teams entered a cauldron of noise and pyrotechnics. After the fire came the fury for PSG of two big calls going against them in the first half, laced with widespread disbelief at the absence of a comprehensive lead. Alisson, semi-automated VAR and PSG profligacy were the reasons why.Liverpool were dominated for almost the entirety of the opening period as Luis Enrique’s team dictated play and stretched the visiting defence time and again. Slot had predicted PSG’s front three of Barcola, Ousmane Dembélé and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia would pose a similar test to Manchester City with their speed and movement. Unlike therecent win at the Etihad Stadium, however, his team struggled in its collective attempts to contain them. Nor did Liverpool combine containment with a cutting edge. Donnarumma was a virtual spectator in the PSG goal throughout a first half in which Liverpool had no attempts on target. His opposite number was overworked by comparison but produced an unforgettable shift.PSG went man-to-man in midfield with Vitinha sitting deep on Dominik Szoboszlai, Fabián Ruiz denying Ryan Gravenberch space to break the lines and João Neves stifling Alexis Mac Allister’s influence. They spent more time toying with Liverpool in possession.Neves should have opened the scoring when Dembélé turned on the afterburners to leave Andy Robinson and Mac Allister in his rearview mirror. The revitalised forward picked out the unmarked Neves from the byline but the midfielder scuffed his shot into the ground and over.View image in fullscreenAlisson makes one of a number of saves that earned him the player of the match award.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersAnother brilliant run from Dembélé resulted in a corner when his shot looped off Virgil van Dijk and over Alisson. The Liverpool keeper clawed away the set piece only for Neves to pick out Kvaratskhelia on the right of the penalty area. The January signing from Napoli curled an exquisite finish inside Alisson’s far corner. It was a fabulous finish, but disallowed for a tight offside against the goalscorer’s calf.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Contact occurred outside the area but VAR checked a possible red-card offence by Konaté. It eventually stuck with the on-field referee’s decision not to penalise Liverpool’s last man.The let-offs did not spark a reaction from Liverpool. The visitors remained encamped on the back foot, struggling to match PSG’s sharpness on the ball or energy off it. Alisson denied Dembélé with an outstretched foot when he was played through by Barcola’s cute ball. He then made a superb reaction save, adjusting his feet and getting down low to his left to tip away a Kvaratskhelia effort that was destined for the bottom corner.Slot’s half-time instructions did little to turn the tide either. Waves of PSG attacks kept coming. Alisson kept repelling them, the Brazil international making another vital intervention when the mesmerising Kvaratskhelia swept a free-kick from 25 yards towards the far corner.Liverpool managed to restrict PSG to shots from distance in the closing stages but Désiré Doué almost punctured their resistance. The substitute’s strike arced towards the far corner only for the Brazilian to brilliantly thwart PSG with his fingertips yet again. He also scooped away a Dembélé attempt before delivering one final blow to the disbelieving French champions with his part in Elliott’s winner. Anfield awaits the return with bated breath.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

For Vincent Kompany’s side are cruising to the Bundesliga title and now they are cruising to the Champions League quarter-finals too. They may well sign Bayer Leverkusen’s best player in the summer, but here they played him off the park. It smells like game over, and in more senses than one.This week the Bayern director of sport, Max Eberl, made an eye-catching comparison. He compared Alonso and Kompany to Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp, the coaching duopoly that shaped modern football for almost a decade. Bit soon for all that, most people reckoned, but it feels just a little less fanciful now. The bloke who got Burnley relegated to the Championship may just be the next big thing in European coaching.Raphinha strike and Szczesny saves help 10-man Barcelona edge BenficaRead moreAlonso himself may well be on his way to more moneyed pastures soon, and so perhaps this is the end of a golden chapter in Germany’s great new rivalry, its new superclasico. After three inconclusive instalments of this epic duel already this season, the fourth was utterly unequivocal; the fifth next week will probably end up being an afterthought. And while Alonso’s Leverkusen have been rattled before, while they have been beaten before, not since theEuropa League final in Mayhave they been outmanoeuvred like this, frustrated to the point of genuine head-loss.And Bayern were good value for this too, throttling Leverkusen’s strikerless threat well before the raw Matej Kovar dropped a simple cross and the wretched Nordi Mukiele was dismissed for a second yellow card. Harry Kane – subjected to a little local criticism of late for his attacking work rate – offered the perfect response by brilliantly heading in the first goal and smashing in the last. A defence well protected by Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka gave up just three shots.Above all Bayern were just smarter, positionally disciplined and physically dominant, well prepared for Leverkusen’s game of organised chaos. There is of course a danger in explaining away everything through tactics. You can lose with a great tactical plan and win with a bad one. But as Bayern slowly turned the screw, you could see how far Kompany has already developed as a coach, even in the nine months he has been here.There was a clear Guardiola influence in the way the full-backs tapered inwards to snuff out the counter, in the way Kompany opted for the pure straight-line speed of Kingsley Coman over Leroy Sané or Serge Gnabry on the left. On the other wing, he has in Michael Olise a player currently reaching at the limits of his talents and grasping only fresh air. There are times during this stunning breakthrough season when Olise has touched Arjen Robben levels. That is not hyperbole.“It was our fault,” Alonso said afterwards. “Today everything went against us. We were ready for a hard game, but we did not control the small details and so our pain was self-inflicted.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane outjumps the Leverkusen defence to put Munich ahead.Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty ImagesDid Bayern score a little psychological blow by so publicly stepping up their pursuit of Florian Wirtz this week? Certainly Wirtz cut a subdued figure this evening : aggressively man-marked by Kimmich, his lines of supply cut off, Leverkusen simply not getting enough of the ball to allow him an influence. Amine Adli, deployed up front alongside Wirtz, has started just five times this season through injury and looked unsuited to a game of this intensity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alonso has been rotating him and Lukas Hradecky in and out of the starting lineup all season, with a clear view to Kovar taking over at some point. But throwing him into aChampions Leagueknockout at the Allianz was a huge gamble, and as Jamal Musiala pounced gleefully on his fumbled cross, it was a gamble that had clearly failed.Leverkusen pretty much self-destructed after that. A pointless petty challenge on Coman by Mukiele gave Michael Oliver no choice but to show a red; Edmond Tapsoba came on and immediately grappled Kane to the ground to give away a penalty.And yet. In the dying seconds João Palhinha missed an open goal to make it 4-0 after a sublime piece of skill by Musiala. Was that the moment that left the door open? “It’s not over until it’s over,” Alonso said defiantly. And despite everything, you would rather a tiny sliver of hope than none at all.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichBayer Leverkusenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The kind of afternoon made for chucking a ball around and contemplating a calculated risk or two. Slightly firmer pitches, the sun shining, a licence to thrill … if ever there was a week made for a player like Marcus Smith to go out and express himself from the start against an apprehensive Italy this was probably it.So let’s just say theEngland teamsheet will have landedwith a heavy thump in the Smith household and the offices of his agents, Roc Nation. It is only a few weeks since Netflix was projecting the 26-year-old as the poster boy – “the best hair in world rugby” – for their latest fly-on-the-wall documentary, with a shiny new Mercedes G-Wagon to reinforce his profile.England are kicking more than any team in the Six Nations. Is it working?Read moreHow swiftly the wheel of fortune turns. Because, in common with that other rising star Icarus, Smith is now discovering the flip side of the fame game.This week’s descent, admittedly, has only landed him as far as the replacements’ bench but the impact will be painful nonetheless. One minute he was England’s most eye-catching player, a shaft of golden light in an often monochrome autumn. Now he finds himself staring at a jersey with the number 23 on it, the victim of the management’s latest recalibrations.As they squinted into the Bagshot sunshine, it felt like a moment, both for the player and his head coach. Of course Smith still has a role to play, potentially an important one. In the last half hour, against a tiring defence, he could easily rip it up. But is that going to help secure the British & Irish Lions fly-half jersey or boost the brand?Then again, it was probably bound to happen sooner rather than later. Once Fin Smith was picked to start at 10, the writing was effectively on the dressing-room whiteboard. Smith M is not a natural all-round full-back; maybe his mercurial talent is better suited to the final quarter of games than standing beneath swirling high balls with foam-flecked hounds of hell charging at him. There is obvious logic to surrounding Smith F with as many Northampton teammates as possible, with Italy’s excellent midfield combination also partly explaining Fraser Dingwall’s inclusion as a defensive organiser.Not for the first time, though, it also begs a few questions. Nothing against the seasoned Elliot Daly, picked in the 15 jersey for England for the first time in four years, or Dingwall, so often a squad bridesmaid. But their selections feel like further examples of reactive thinking in the wake of a stunted performance –in this case against Scotland– rather than anything particularly proactive.Without Henry Slade, who could not train fully earlier this week, England clearly felt they needed another kicking option, which aided Daly’s cause. The latter’ssharp late try against Francewas also England’s champagne moment of the championship to date but he will turn 35 during the next World Cup. If this is Steve Borthwick throwing off the tactical straitjacket, as England supporters would love to see, he has not tossed it far.View image in fullscreenBen Curry, Joe Heyes, Jamie George, Elliot Daly and Jack van Poortvliet huddle up.Photograph: Dan Mullan/RFU/Getty ImagesWill Carling’sobservations this weekabout the relative Test inexperience of the England coaching panel have also upped the ante, to the point where another stilted outing against theAzzurriwill test the public’s patience. Borthwick rightly points out that England scored four tries against the Frenchand three in Dublinbut a maximum of three completed phases and a skyfall of box kicks in perfect conditions against Scotland were scarcely proof of a team comfortable in its attacking skin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It might have been six had George Furbank been fit, a real credit to Sam Vesty, Phil Dowson and everyone else involved at Franklin’s Gardens. All Saints’ Day has come early, to the point where it might be less hassle for England simply to run out in black, green and gold.But what if the quintet don’t exhibit the freedom they so often display at club level? What if a clunky attack is not instantly transformed in the absence of Smith and Slade? What if more fundamental problems are holding England back? If the first half is a tough watch you know which tracksuited reserve the TV director will be demanding to see in closeup.So, no pressure. The first objective is clearly to win the game and to win it sufficiently well to keep England in with a mathematical shout of the title. But this weekend, to a large extent, will be as much about the performance as the outcome. It is time for the real England to stand up, regardless of who is wielding the baton.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Rugby unionSix NationsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The home nations believe that collaboration and a strong track record will give them a fighting chance of securing the UK its first major global football tournament since 1966.Mark Bullingham, the CEO of the English FA, said the success of the women’s Euros in England in 2022 had proven Britain’s credentials.“Hosting the Fifa Women’s World Cup in 2035 would be an honour,” he said. “We strongly believe that we could organise a fantastic tournament, building on the success of the Uefa Women’s Euro in 2022 and the subsequent rapid growth of the women’s game in England.“We’re excited about the opportunity to welcome the world, and hosting participating nations and fans in sold-out stadiums. There is outstanding support for the women’s game in this country and we want to maximise this, not only for women’s and girls’ football here but also for the benefit of the global game.”View image in fullscreenWales, who qualified for their first major women’s tournament by reaching Euro 2025, are one of four home nations in the bid.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesThe prime minister gave his full support to the bid in a statement, arguing football was a key part of British identity. “Whether we watch on TV, play at the weekends like I do, or simply enjoy soaking up the atmosphere in the pub, it brings communities together like little else,” he said.“That pride was on full display when England hosted Uefa Women’s Euro 2022. It not only showed the best of our nation to the world but inspired a generation of girls into the game, all whilst boosting the economy. The Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035 on home turf would be another monumental moment in our sporting history, driving growth and leaving a lasting legacy. The FA’s intention to bid has my government’s full support.”The Scottish, Welsh and Irish FAs said that the goal of driving continued growth in the women’s game was behind their 2035 ambitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

European teams will form the largest contingent at the Club World Cup with 12 sides set to take part.Fifa are committed to keeping all revenues from the tournament inside the club game. Operational costs are included as part of the expenditure, but solidarity payments to clubs who did not earn an invitation to the tournament will also be part of the picture. The final sum of any solidarity fund is to be determined later once the revenues generated by the tournament have been confirmed, but the target is to share a quarter of a billion dollars.A statement from Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, read: “The Fifa Club World Cup will not only be the pinnacle of club football, but also a vivid demonstration of solidarity that will benefit clubs at large to a scale that no other competition has ever done. All revenue generated by the tournament will be distributed to the participating clubs and via club solidarity across the world as Fifa will not keep a single dollar.

Eilish McColgan was subject toa wave of body shaming abusethis week with people posting that she “looks like a skeleton” and had anorexia, and Hunter Bell called for more to be done to protect sportswomen.The 31-year-old was one of the feelgood stories of 2024 as she went from her full-time job in cybersecurity to the podium in Paris, smashing the British 1500m record by running 3min 52.61sec along the way. But she said her success has led to her being targeted more.‘Stop the abuse’: Liz McColgan hits back at online criticism of daughter EilishRead moreAsked whether social media could be a quite a nasty place, Hunter Bell said: “It definitely is. I have had to get quite a thick skin quite quickly, ever since last summer. The majority of people are really supportive but there is a really dark side of social media where people write things about you, about your body, about how you look, about what they think of you, your performance. It’s hard when they’re directed to you.“Sometimes I’ll have people direct messaging me things and it is something that does need to stop. I know Eilish has spoken about it. It is a really tough one, because it drains a lot of your energy. You only have so much and when you’re trying to focus on winning races, it’s tough to respond to every comment and look at them.”Asked about whether athletics needed to adopt the AI threat matrix used by the Women’s Tennis Association to stop harassment on social media and in public, Hunter Bell said abuse is “definitely something that needs to stop”.“I try to just see it as a compliment almost. That’s what my husband, George, tells me to do. Because, when you get to a certain level, people think they can say what they want, that you’re fair game. It’s not nice, but it just proves people have got something to be angry about.“I might do a post in the morning if I’ve got a race and then I won’t go on social media all day. Because you can see something and it can just really affect you and hit you in a strange spot.”Hunter Bell is the headline name in the British team for the European Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn, which start on Thursday evening. After quitting her day job to become a professional athlete – having initially taken a sabbatical in May to train full-time for the Olympics – she believes she is in shape to win her first gold medal.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell is hugely grateful for the guidance of her training partner Keely Hodgkinson.Photograph: J Kruger/British Athletics/Getty Images“After Paris, I thought, ‘I owe it to myself just to see what I’m capable of over these next four years in the run up to LA,’” she said. “Luckily, work was very understanding. They had a sweepstake, apparently, about whether I would come back or not.“When I left in May, they said, ‘Oh, well, you know, even if you get a medal, we’ll still want you back.’ I didn’t think at that point I would get a medal, so I said, ‘I’ll definitely be back.’ And then they were tuning in with everyone. They did watch parties and stuff together and they were just super supportive. They understood that it was very much a following-a-dream thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she knows that there is now a target on her back, starting this week in the Netherlands.She said: “It’s quite fun being the underdog, but now I’m going into it with the new challenge of being expected to win. That is different, so I’m adjusting to it. Every athlete, once they have their breakthrough, it’s almost the second year which is more telling of your capability, physically, but also mentally, whether you can back it up.”Hunter Bell also credits her training partner, Keely Hodgkinson, who will miss these championships through injury, for helping her with the transition.“She is such a good person to discuss it with. It’s mainly a mindset shift, and she worked with a sports psychologist to change that mindset from seeing yourself as a medallist to seeing yourself as a winner.“It’s something that I’m going to explore this year as well. You have to think like a gold medallist to make it happen when the margins are so small.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Awaiting them on Sunday is a rerun of the 2000 final, which they won by four wickets.Santner opted to bat first on a fine-looking pitch that promised plenty of runs and his batters delivered in style. Lungi Ngidi removed Will Young for 21 in the powerplay, but that breakthrough merely brought together Ravindra and Williamson for a 164-run partnership that built their side a formidable foundation.Both men maintained a strike rate of better than a run per ball as the Proteas failed to find a way through. Ravindra hit 13 fours and a six and his experienced partner cleared the ropes twice alongside hitting 10 boundaries. Heinrich Klaasen dropped Williamson on 56, and the pair were not parted until the 34th over when Kagiso Rabada finally drew an edge from Ravindra.Williamson carried on the momentum as he brought up his 15th one-day international hundred with a cheeky ramp off Wiaan Mulder, who exacted revenge four balls later when Ngidi held on at short leg. Any hopes South Africa had for a strong finish disappeared as they leaked 110 from the last 10 overs, Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips both hitting rapid-fire knocks of 49.Charged with producing the biggest chase in Champions Trophy history, Temba Bavuma’s side stumbled to 312 for nine. At 125 for one, the innings looked to have legs but Santner’s left-arm spin turned things decisively for his team when he dismissed Bavuma (56), Rassie van der Dussen (69) and the in-form Klaasen for only three.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nearly a century later, the majority of its customers still perceive it as essentially a bookie-free process in which punters bet among themselves.During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, however, when racing continued for many months behind closed doors, the Tote launched what it described as aPool Guarantee Service (PGS), in which it “seeded” its pools with automated bets up to four hours before the start of a race with the aim of ensuring “greater predictability for customers about what the pools will pay on any winning bet”.The Gambling Commission accepts that some licensed operators participate in their own products, in order to “make products more attractive to the wider customer base by providing more gambling opportunities and/or making prizes larger”. This includes the practice of seeding markets, which is commonplace in many pool betting systems around the world, to encourage liquidity in pools.At the same time, though, the regulator also requires operators to communicate the nature and extent of its involvement to customers “in plain language … as part of providing fair and open gambling”.The Tote’s terms and conditions acknowledge that it is involved in seeding, and also that its PGS process “also seeds some multi-leg pools such as the Placepot”.It does not detail the extent of its involvement, however, while the analysis sent to the Commission last month, which has been seen by the Guardian, suggests that the overwhelming majority of the Tote’s betting in Placepots takes places around three minutes before the start of the first race in the bet, rather than an hour or more in advance.Rather than “seeding” the markets, last-minute injections of significant cash into the pool are more typically associated with syndicates employing high-frequency automated betting strategies to identify overpriced permutations in multi-leg bets.The Placepot bet is available every day, at every UK and Irish meeting. Covering the first six races of the day, the bet requires punters to select a horse in each race to be placed.In practical terms, if a significant percentage of the Placepot pool is actually the Tote’s own money there is likely to be an inevitable impact on the payouts that winning punters receive.View image in fullscreenThe Tote sponsors a number of races throughout the jumps and Flat season.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAAt next week’s ultra-competitive Cheltenham festival, for instance, if a backer found a winning Placepot line on a day when several short-priced favourites finished out of the frame, a monster payout might well be declared with only a handful of winning tickets. There will be no way for the winning customer to know, however, if one or more successful tickets were placed into the pool by the Tote itself, thereby denying them an even bigger slice of the pool.As the analysis sent to the Gambling Commission also points out, the Tote enjoys a “significant information advantage” over its customers when betting into its pools, which could create “an inherent conflict of interest” in which the operator’s “profit or loss is dependent upon, and inversely correlated with, their customer’s loss.”When contacted on Wednesday, the Gambling Commission declined to either confirm or deny that it is reviewing the Tote’s activity in its pools as it has a policy of refusing to comment on individual cases. The Tote has also been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsThe ToteHorse racingGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

Previous versions of the annual report have been used in legal cases against companies and investors.The report found that the 36 major fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco,CoalIndia, ExxonMobil, Shell and numerous Chinese companies, produced coal, oil and gas responsible for more than 20bn tonnes of CO2emissions in 2023.If Saudi Aramco was a country, it would be the fourth biggest polluter in the world after China, the US and India, while ExxonMobil is responsible for about the same emissions as Germany, the world’s ninth biggest polluter, according to the data.Biggest fossil fuel emitting companies in 2023Global emissions must fall by45% by 2030if the world is to have a good chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C, the internationally agreed target. However, emissions are still rising,supercharging the extreme weatherthat is taking lives and livelihoods across the planet.The International Energy Agency has saidnew fossil fuel projectsstarted after 2021 are incompatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Most of the 169 companies in the Carbon Majors database increased their emissions in 2023, which was thehottest year on recordat the time.“These companies are keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels with no plans to slow production,” said Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the landmark 2015 Paris agreement was delivered. “The science is clear: we cannot move backwards to more fossil fuels and more extraction. Instead, we must move forward to the many possibilities of a decarbonised economic system that works for people and the planet.”Emmett Connaire, at InfluenceMap, the thinktank that produced the Carbon Majors report, said: “Despite global climate commitments, a small group of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers are significantly increasing production and emissions. The research highlights the disproportionate impact these companies have on the climate crisis and supports efforts to enforce corporate responsibility.”A spokesperson for Shell said: “Shell is committed to becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers.” Saudi Aramco declined to comment. Coal India, ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalEnergies and BP did not respond to requests for comment.The Carbon Majors data has been used as evidence supporting laws passed inNew YorkandVermontstates in the US, which seek compensation from fossil fuel companies for climate damages. The data has also been cited by legal groups as support for potentialcriminal chargesagainst fossil fuel executives and referenced in regulatory actions, such as ClientEarth’scomplaintagainst BlackRock for misleading investors.Half a century of dither and denial – a climate crisis timelineRead moreTheCarbon Majors reportcalculates the emissions released by the burning of the coal, oil and gas produced by 169 major companies in 2023. The database also includes emissions from the production of cement, which rose by 6.5% in 2023.The 36 companies responsible for half of global emissions in 2023 includes state-owned companies such as China Energy, the National IranianOilCompany, Russia’s Gazprom and the UAE’s Adnoc. Shareholder-owned companies in that group include Petrobras, headquartered in Brazil, and Eni, from Italy.The 36 companies are dominated by state-owned enterprises, of which there are 25. Ten of these are in China, the world’s biggest polluting country. Coal was the source of 41% of the emissions counted in 2023, oil 32%, gas 23% and cement 4%.The Carbon Majors dataset also includes historical emission from 1854 to 2023. It shows that two-thirds of carbon emissions from fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution are from 180 companies, 11 of which no longer exist.Kumi Naidoo, the president of theFossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: “We are living at a critical moment in human history. It is essential that governments step up and use their authority to end the root cause of the crisis we find ourselves in: the expansion of fossil fuels.”Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsGreenhouse gas emissionsCoalOil (Environment)Oil and gas companiesOil (Business)Gas (Business)newsShareReuse this content"

However, a 19km-long chunk broke off in January.There had been concerns for wildlife on the crucial breeding ground of South Georgia if the iceberg came too close. This would have forced animals such as penguins and seals to travel much farther to get around the colossal block of ice.“This could reduce the amount of food coming back to pups and chicks on the island, and so increase mortality,” Meijers said.However in its current location, the iceberg could offer benefits to wildlife.“Nutrients stirred up by the grounding [of the iceberg] and from its melt may boost food availability for the whole regional ecosystem, including for charismatic penguins and seals, Meijers said.Along with the nearby South Sandwich islands, South Georgia is home to around 5m seals and 65m breeding birds from 30 different species.The island’s seals and penguins have already had a “bad season” due to a bird flu outbreak, Meijers told AFP in January.The iceberg poses no threat to shipping. It is so huge that vessels can easily avoid it.Earth’s strongest ocean current could slow down by 20% by 2050 in a high emissions futureRead moreHowever, as it breaks up into smaller pieces, certain areas could become off limits to commercial fishing ships “due to the number of smaller – yet often more dangerous – bergy bits”, Meijers said.There is no permanent human population on South Georgia, which the UK administers as a British overseas territory.Argentina also claims the island – along with the Falklands to the west which it calls Las Malvinas.Icebergs of this size are rare but not unheard of. There have been two of similar sizes in the same area over the last five years, Meijers said.Such huge icebergs are a “completely normal part of the lifecycle” of the Antarctic ice sheets, Meijers said.But ice shelves have lost 6,000bn tonnes of mass since 2000, which is matched by accelerating ice loss attributed to climate change, he added.Researchers warned last month that arise in the planet’s average temperatureto between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels could melt enough frozen water to lift oceans by a dozen metres – and beyond the point of no return.Last year – which smashed previous heat records as the world was battered by fires, floods and storms – was the first calendar year above 1.5C.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

In the September warmth, clumps of grass cling to the smooth, grey peaks shaped over centuries by an enormous ice cap that lurks behind the fjords on the horizon.Brightly coloured homes are scattered around the shoreline below, home to a community of just over 1,300 people. Were it not for a mining outhouse on the edge of town, there would be little indication of the potential riches in the rock.The range is home to one of the largest undeveloped deposits of rare-earth minerals and uranium in the world: the Kvanefjeld site, or Kuannersuit in Greenlandic. It contains high concentrations of metals such as terbium and neodymium, which are used to manufacture permanent magnets in wind turbines and electric cars. Every major power in the world is scrambling to get access to these minerals for carbon-free energy and transport.A proposed open-pit mine would be worth about $7.5bn (£6bn) if it went ahead,according to the site operator, generating income for the island’s economy.View image in fullscreenNarsaq in south-west Greenland is home to about 1,300 people – and huge deposits of rare-earth minerals.Photograph: Partrick Greenfield/The GuardianBut when the mining company acquired the site in 2007,the impact of potentially radioactive waste contaminating drinking water and nearby sheep farms alarmed local people. They feared that the “tailings” – a slurry of ground-up waste from mining – would be laced with radioactive waste and could contaminate waterways or spread as dust in the air.Greenland has a troubled history with mining pollution: the sites of lead and zinc mines developed in the 1970sremain polluted more than 50 years later, with fish, mussels and seaweed still testing positive for toxins.The ecosystem surrounding Narsaq is rich with seals, whales and other marine life, which Inuit hunter-gatherers rely on for their livelihoods.In 2021, Greenland went to the polls, in a contest to which uranium was so central, international media dubbed it “the mining election”. The people voted in a green, leftwing government, led by the Inuit Ataqatigiit party, which campaigned against uranium mining due to the potential pollution.The claim is not so far-fetched, given that some tribunals have awarded astronomically high damages for mining and similar projectsMalcolm Langford, University of OsloWhen it took power, the new government kept its campaign promise,passing legislation to ban uranium mining. While not primarily a uranium mine, the Kvanefjeld project would require unearthing the radioactive substance to extract its rare earth oxides, putting it in violation of the law.Many Greenlanders celebrated the vote as a victory for health and the environment. But three years later, the company is suing Greenland for stopping its plans, demanding theright to exploit the depositor receive compensation of up to $11.5bn: nearly 10 times the country’s 8.5bn krone (£950m) annual budget.Kvanefjeld’s operator,Energy Transition Minerals(ETM), the Australian-listed company formerly known as Greenland Minerals, argues that the decision to ban mining amounts to expropriation by Greenland’s government and any environmental concerns would be addressed with the “best environmental practice, where this was technically, practically and financially possible”.View image in fullscreenThe potential mine site near Narsaq. Locals fear that mine waste could contaminate the land and water.Photograph: Patrick Greenfield/The GuardianIt has taken the case to arbitration through the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), a once-obscure provision in trade agreements that has become a lucrative area of international law, alongside cases in Greenland and Denmark.ISDS was designed to protect foreign businesses from state corruption and theft, but it is increasingly being used to sue governments that bring in environmental laws to meet climate targets or protect biodiversity and the environment. A Guardian investigation into ISDS, which analysed more than 1,400 cases, has revealed $84bn in payouts from governments to fossil fuel companies. More than $120bn of public money has been awarded to private investors across all industries since 1976.Quick GuideWhat is ISDS and how does it work?ShowWhat is it?Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) was created to help companies protect investments abroad. It allows companies to sue countries for lost profits caused by government action including corruption, seizure of assets or the introduction of health and environmental policies.The system wascreated in the 1960sby the World Bank. It was intended to give companies confidence to invest in poorer countries with weak political systems where they might not get a fair hearing in domestic courts.How does it work?The foreign company must put forward a case showing that the state has damaged its profits. Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals include ISDS clauses. Cases are heard by a private arbitration tribunal, and typically decided by a panel of three arbitrators – one chosen by the company, one chosen by the state and the third selected jointly.How much are the cases worth?Awards regularly amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, and some are in the billions. In 2024 the average amount awarded was$385m(£304m).  The average sum awardedis increasingand these payouts can make up a sizeable chunk of poorer countries' annual budgets.Who is involved?The fossil fuel and mining industries are the most litigious in the ISDS system, accounting formore than 30%of known cases.Most claims are brought by companies based in rich countries against the governments of developing countries. Companies registered in developed countries file81% of ISDS lawsuits, according to UN data, while developing countries have faced 62% of cases.How common is it?ISDS began as an obscure legal mechanism, averaging aboutone case a yearfor its first decade. Now, dozens are brought every year, with Guardian analysis finding more than 900 since 2013.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Often, companies in such cases sue for vast sums – claiming not only the costs of planning or exploration, but also for all the future profits they expected to make from a cancelled project. In the Greenland case, ETM, which is partly owned by the Chinese government-backed Shenghe Resources, said it hadspent more than $100m developing the sitein the expectation it would be allowed to operate it as a mine. Its $11.5bn claim isbased on the $7.5bn value of the mineplus $4bn in interest.‘They try to bully us and make us feel small’View image in fullscreenNaaja Nathanielsen, mining and trade minister. ‘We are going to fight until the end,’ she says.Photograph: Patrick Greenfield/The Guardian“For us, it’s a principle of governments deciding power,” says Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s mining minister, who also has business, trade, justice and gender equality in her portfolio. “We were elected democratically. We had a public hearing process with the law. It offends me that they are trying the case in this way.“It really challenges the democratic institutions,” Nathanielsen says. “We are going to fight until the end because it’s a matter of principle.” She refuses to say what losing the case might mean for Greenland.Daniel Mamadou-Blanco, managing director of ETM, says his company understands how democracies work. “We were asked to apply for a mining licence, which we did. In the process, we raised the necessary capital to move to the next step,” he says.“Then there is a change of government – which is democratically elected – which has made a promise to specifically stop this project for political reasons. That’s absolutely fine but, in this case, that’s an expropriation. If it’s an expropriation, we are entitled to compensation,” he says.Greenland’s government is keen to develop a mining industry that will sustain its future independence without critically damaging its environment. Currently, the country relies on Denmark for about half of its annual budget.While there is just one active mine, the island is being prospected by many of the world’s largest companies, includingone linked to Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Southern Greenland has become a new frontier of global mining, with at least124 projectsat various stages of development across the island. It has also become the latest site of the growing economic confrontation between the US and China, with DonaldTrump repeatedly threatening to annex Greenland.View image in fullscreenSodalite deposits near the Kvanefjeld site. The mineral, a gemstone also used in making ceramics, glass and steel, glows orange when exposed to UV light.Photograph: Jan Richard HeinickeDespite the intense global interest, Greenland’s government says it will not be moved in the case of the Narsaq deposit.“They try to bully us and make us feel small. That’s not going to happen,” Nathanielsen says. “Energy Transition Minerals don’t have that kind of money [to bring the case themselves]. They would not have been able to succeed without [outside] support, which makes their argument even more pitiful.”Mamadou-Blanco disagrees. “We are just a small company. I would argue that here, the bullies are the government and not us,” he says.The mining company is not paying its own legal fees, although it insists it would have been capable of bringing the case on its own. Burford Capital, a London- and New York-listed litigation finance specialist, has invested in the case, covering the cost of the arbitration proceedings in exchange for a share of the financial benefits if it is successful.It is among 75 cases found by the Guardian that have been financed by litigation finance investors – a trend that has grown dramatically since the system began. Other examples include a US-based deep-sea exploration company called Odyssey Marine Exploration, whichwon a payout of $37.1mfrom the Mexican state after it was denied an environmental permit to mine a large area of seabed off the coast.View image in fullscreenAn iceberg and a seal hunter near Narsaq.

Rockhopper, a UK-based oil and gas company,had to dismantleoperations on its Ombrina Mare oilfield and was awarded €190m (£159m), plus interest, of Italian public money in compensation for lost future profits. Italy is still trying to get the decision annulled. No payment has yet been made.Revealed: how Wall Street is making millions betting against green lawsRead moreFor proponents of the system, the rise of no-win, no-fee investment in arbitration helps more companies access justice than would do otherwise, protecting them from bad behaviour by states. But others fear that a new asset class has been created which profits from laws designed to mitigate the climate crisis and environmental damage.Malcolm Langford, a professor of public law at the University of Oslo, says it pits two wings of the environmental movement against each other: investors eager to extract rare earths for the green transition vying with traditional concerns about hazardous industries.“The amount of potential damages is a wild card,” he says. “The claim by the investors [ETM] is not so far-fetched, given that some tribunals have awarded astronomically high damages for mining and similar projects. It is clear though that the billion-dollar claim in this case is designed to push Greenlanders to change their mind and allow mining to start.”View image in fullscreenProtesters from the environmental groupUrani? Naamik(Uranium? No thanks) wait for ETM executives to arrive in Narsaq.Photograph: Jan Richard HeinickeKyla Tienhaara, an associate professor at Queen’s University in Canada, says that although a rapid transition to clean energy is needed, local communities and governments should still have the right to reject mining projects that threaten ecosystems or create unacceptable risks to human health and wellbeing.“Time and time again, what we see around the world is that when extractive projects are rejected on these grounds, investors turn to arbitration with exorbitant compensation claims,” she says. “Even the threat of such a claim can cause governments to reverse course.”A high-stakes businessIn February, representatives from the Perth-based ETM travelled to Greenland to visit the island once again. The arbitration case, launched in 2022, has proceeded slowly due to lengthy disagreements about procedure. This summer, arbitrators will decide whether they should accept the case. If they do, the issue is likely to be resolved later this year.View image in fullscreenA helicopter flies from the mine. Since Donald Trump’s comments about annexing Greenland, investors are more optimistic that mining will go ahead.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyAfter the 2021 general election, the value of the mining company collapsed. But now, investor optimism is changing. After Trump’s comments about Greenland, the company’s share price has surged – more than quadrupling since November. Greenlanders go to the polls again this month, and a new government could allow mining to go ahead. The company has raised more capital, following the bounce in its share price.Outside a slaughterhouse in Narsaq, a group of men dressed in blue overalls smoke as they wait for the first seasonal shipment of Greenlandic sheep to arrive. The bay is largely silent after a day of drizzle, which caused loud booms all night as icebergs broke apart. Finally, a boat comes into view in the fjord and everyone scrambles to unload the shipment.There is a range of opinion about the mine in Narsaq, says Kitdlak Lynge, a production management assistant at the slaughterhouse, as we wait.“People are divided into two different groups because of the uranium,” he says. “I am not worried about whether the mine happens, I am worried about how. The plans I have seen are not acceptable. It’s going to destroy the water.”View image in fullscreenSheep being herded on to a boat to be taken to the abattoir. Many Greenlanders are deeply concerned by what an open-pit mine could do to the environment.Photograph: Bradley SeckerDozens of thick-coated sheep scramble towards the abattoir from the harbour. Within weeks, the bay behind them will fill with pack ice as the cold sets in, sometimes cutting Narsaq off from the world for days. The arrival of fat seal pups lying on the ice will signal the start of spring and the return of the light. Farther around the coast, polar bears will feast on the seals as the region bursts into life once again. Nobody knows what an open-pit mine would mean for any of that.“The chemicals and the tailings that they’re going to use, I do not want them to be left here,” says Lynge. “If they could ship them outside of Greenland, I wouldn’t mind. [But] it will affect the whole area if mining starts – the chemicals, the industry and the changes in the environment will affect the whole area.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsInvestor-state dispute settlementThe age of extinctionMining (Business)Mining (Environment)GreenlandFossil fuelsEnergyGreen economyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They underline the range of ages, backgrounds and family circumstances of the victims and perpetrators, and some key factors – most strikingly, mental health problems – that led to the killings.Thedata, from the Femicide Census, comes after the Guardian launchedkilled women countlast year, a project reporting on every UK woman whose death led to a man being charged.Mayawati Bracken, 56View image in fullscreenPhotograph: FacebookMayawati Bracken was driving her 18-year-old son Julian Bracken to the boarding school he attended when he fatally stabbed her on 4 January 2024. She lost control of the car and was found inside it by members of the public, with stab wounds to the chest.She died at the scene from blood loss and shock. Her son had left the vehicle and was killed by a train minutes later.An inquest into Mayawati’s death heard that paramedics had been called to the family home on Christmas Day in 2023 when Julian had a panic attack, and that there was “a lot of built-up anger” between the mother and son.Giving evidence, one paramedic claimed Mayawati had been “overly affectionate” and said her coming into a room and trying to kiss Julian led to him becoming “riled up”.Kelly Pitt, 44View image in fullscreenAt the time of Kelly Pitt’s murder, her son Lewis Bush, then 26, was subject to bail conditions for assaulting her, and he had been banned from contacting her.He had multiple previous convictions, including for battery against his mother and sister, and Pitt had repeatedly reported him for coming to her house and acting aggressively.In May 2023, Pitt called her daughter, and Bush could be heard in the background verbally abusing her. Two days later she was found on a blood-soaked bed, covered in a duvet, having died from severe blunt-force trauma to the head, neck and trunk, with internal bleeding and 41 rib fractures.Bush was sentenced to life in prison for murder with a minimum term of 16 years.Bhajan Kaur, 76Sundeep Singh, 48, was living in his car on the driveway of his elderly mother’s home, and had been arrested on suspicion of controlling and coercive behaviour before he murdered her in May 2024.He wrongly believed the family home in Leicester had been left to him by his late father, and this had caused many arguments with his mother, Bhajan Kaur, and the wider family.On the day of her killing, Kaur let her son in to the home. Singh was later seen on CCTV buying a trolley and spade from a nearby shop. When Kaur was found dead with significant head and face injuries, her son had dug a large hole in the garden. He was jailed for at least 31 years after being convicted of murder.Mary Haley, 75In the weeks before she was murdered in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Mary Haley’s son Craig Haley had been aggressive and demanding money from her.Then, in February 2020, he launched a brutal attack in which he kicked, dragged, strangled and bludgeoned his mother with an ashtray. She was found by her other son the following day with at least 55 injuries.The other son sobbed in court as he described the moment he found his mother lying on the living-room floor. Craig had left her there, and later the same night had bought alcohol and crisps.Sentencing Craig to a minimum of 20 years in jail for murder, the judge said: “Your crime defies the comprehension of any decent person. She was a loving and loved mother. You entered the house and took the life of someone who had given you life.”Christine Bauld, 55View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Social mediaIn March 2024, 23-year-old Gregor Bauld chased his mother, known as Tina, out of their house in Leicester and repeatedly stabbed her with a kitchen knife. After her death, Tina was described by a neighbour as the “smiley, loveliest woman that you could wish to meet”.Gregor had been experiencing delusions that his mother was the leader of a war tribe, an “alien” and a “paedophile”. He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia.On the day of the killing, he got into an argument with his parents over his persistent use of illegal drugs, which were known to affect his mental health. He was found to have LSD, ketamine and cannabis in his system.The court heard that Gregor, an only child, had “two loving parents who lived in a comfortable and relatively affluent home environment”. The judge described the killing as “awful beyond imagination”. Gregor was given a life sentence subject to a hospital order.Suzanne Henry, 54View image in fullscreenSuzanne Henry was filming her son Finn Henry’s bizarre behaviour in May 2024 when he violently attacked her, punching her in the face and strangling her. She died in hospital from a traumatic brain injury two days later.Finn’s girlfriend had called an ambulance earlier that day after finding him falling in and out of consciousness outside a Morrisons store. He told paramedics he had taken ketamine, which he had been addicted to since the age of 16, but he refused to go to hospital.The footage captured by Suzanne at their home in Newcastle-under-Lyme showed Finn, then 20, throwing two punches to the phone camera before it fell to the ground, and he picked it up six minutes later covered in blood.He was jailed for seven years after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Finn’s defence lawyer told the court: “His mother was described as someone he loved and his number one. He loved her more than words can describe. When released he wants to help others avoid any position like this and highlight the risks of drug misuse.”Lynette Nash, 64Stuart Nash was on the phone to his wife, Lynette, when she was attacked and killed by their son, Gavin Nash, who had been diagnosed with acute psychosis.The day before the killing in June 2023, Gavin’s family had dialled 999 due to the 39-year-old’s deteriorating state and an emergency response mental health team was sent to see him. The family were urged to call police if his condition worsened.The next day, after first fleeing the family home in Portishead, Somerset, Gavin returned and attacked his mother with a kitchen knife while she was alone. Audio from CCTV captured him telling her no one was coming to save her and to “die you bitch, fucking die”.Stuart Nash told the court: “Whilst I try not to blame anyone in particular, I can’t help but going over and over, again and again, the … opportunities that we all missed to save Lynette and Gavin from the horrific outcome.”Michele Romano, 68View image in fullscreenPhotograph: East Anglia News ServiceNeighbours called the police on 9 February 2024 over concern for 47-year-old Sebastian Compton – they had thought he was wearing red gloves, before realising it was blood and thinking he was injured.When emergency workers arrived at his flat near Chelmsford, Essex, they found his mother, Michele Romano, had been stabbed 20 times. Compton told them: “It was not me, it was psychosis, it was an act of God. I don’t know why I did it.”He was “undergoing acute psychosis at the time of the killing”, according to the judge, who sentenced him to a hospital order. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2008 and had been taking the antipsychotic drug clozapine until the end of 2023, when he stopped because he said he felt well.Bernadette Rosario, 61Michael Rowe, 36, stabbed his mother, Bernadette Rosario, 100 times during a psychotic episode shortly after being discharged from hospital when he became dangerous and racially abusive towards staff.He had started having psychotic episodes at the age of 16 and tried to self-medicate with illegal drugs. His condition deteriorated in 2023 and he described feeling as if he had holes in his head. He was known to be violent and had been detained under the Mental Health Act on several occasions.Five days before killing his mother, Rowe went to her home and tried to punch her. The court heard that Rosario had continued to support him over the years, paying his drug debts and encouraging him to get support.Rowe admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained in a psychiatric unit.Sally Poynton, 44Photograph: LinkedinSally Poynton’s death could have been avoided if her son’s mental health condition had been diagnosed sooner, an inquest found.Jacob Poynton-Whiting, then 22, was briefly detained at a mental health unit but was discharged after 10 days without a diagnosis or support plan, and was later completely discharged from mental health services when he failed to respond to follow-up letters.Sally had tried at least 20 times to get help for her son, while at least 10 other attempts were made by family members.He was having a severe psychotic episode when he stabbed his mother in the neck, stomach and leg in June 2021.

The move will undermine the UK’s soft power and have “dire consequences” for the world’s poorest, it claims.It comes as backbenchers prepare to use a debate on the Foreign Office budget to highlight their opposition to Starmer’s decision, which he announced last week as a way to pay forhigher defence spending.Champion said: “I’m writing to you to express my committee’s deep concern regarding the government’s decision to reduce Official Development Assistance (ODA) … our development spend protects not only the most vulnerable across the world but also the UK’s security, not least by helping to prevent conflict in the first place.“Cutting ODA further to fund increased defence spending is a false economy that makes us less safe.”She added: “This brutal further cut to ODA risks undermining our soft power, as well as years of progress in areas such as healthcare, education, clean water and sustainable development. It will have dire consequences for millions of marginalised people across the world.”Last week Starmer announced that Britain would “fight for peace in Europe” with a generational increase in defence spending paid for by slashing the foreign aid budget.The defence budget will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – three years earlier than planned – and an ambition to reach 3%. To accommodate the move, the international aid budget will be cut from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2027, Starmer said.Champion has been one of the most vocal opponents of the aid cut, which promptedthe resignation of Anneliese Doddsas international development minister.But Champion’s letter was written on behalf of the committee, which includes two Conservative and two Liberal Democrat MPs, suggesting opposition to the move is building across the Commons.Wednesday’s debate will not entail MPs voting on the aid cuts, but a series of speeches from the backbenches are expected to give a sense of the angst being felt about the decision, especially on the Labour benches.Champion asked the prime minister to answer a series of questions about the decision, which was taken so quickly that Dodds was given just a few days’ notice before it was announced to the Commons.In her letter, Champion asks whether the cut will be implemented all at once or staggered over several years; whetherhotel costs for asylum seekers in Britainwill continue to count as international aid; what the impact will be for staff numbers at the Foreign Office; and what will happen to frozen Russian assets in the UK.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerAidDefence policyEconomic policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The organisation’s chief executive, Sarah Cardell, has also said the CMA does not want to create a “chilling effect” on business confidence, amid pressure from the UK government on regulators toproduce pro-growth proposals.Competition watchdog to speed up decisions after UK government pressureRead moreThe CMA’s executive director for mergers, Joel Bamford, said: “We have found that there has not been a change of control by Microsoft from material influence to de facto control overOpenAI. Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK’s merger control regime.”However, Bamford added that the decision should “not be read as the partnership being given a clean bill of health on competition concerns”.The CMA started investigating the OpenAI relationship after the dramatic sacking and reinstatement of Sam Altman as OpenAI’s chief executive – over a hectic few days in November 2023, Microsoft announced it hadhired Altman, only for him torejoin the startup.The CMA highlighted a recent reduction in OpenAI’s reliance on Microsoft for computer power – a key factor in operating an AI business – as an influence over its decision.A Microsoft spokesperson said the partnership with OpenAI and its continued evolution “promote competition, innovation, and responsible AI development … We welcome the CMA’s conclusion, after careful and prudent consideration of the commercial realities, to close its investigation.”Last year, the CMA decided not to investigate Amazon’s investment in the AI firm Anthropic and further Microsoft partnerships with the AI firms Mistral and Inflection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I will never bet with them ever again, and I advise others to be very careful, too.”She added that Paddy Power had “tried their very best to deny me my rightful winnings”.“What’s the point in betting if betting companies like Paddy Power won’t pay up when someone wins a big jackpot?”Durber had been playing the Wild Hatter game in October 2020, which was described as a combination of a fruit machine and a wheel of fortune-style game with two parts. After moving to the second part and spinning the jackpot wheel, her iPad screen displayed she had won the “monster jackpot”, which was stated as £1,097,132.71 on the day she played.However, she was paid only £20,265.14 and told she had won the smaller daily jackpot, with the difference attributed to an error with the game’s display as it had been malprogrammed and pointed to the wrong prize.Durber sued PPB Entertainment Limited, which trades as Paddy Power and Betfair, for breach of contract and the rest of her winnings, based on what she was shown on screen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lathaniel died while being treated at the scene by paramedics. Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses and information.A witness told the BBC the teenager was shot dead by a man dressed as a food delivery driver on a moped, who took out a gun and fired when two boys came down the stairs of a block of flats.A man, who said he was the boy’s uncle, told the PA Media news agency: “They came on a moped dressed as Deliveroo drivers.”No arrests have yet been made and detectives are keeping an open mind about the possible motive for the attack.Relatives of Lathaniel described the teenager as a Manchester United fan who enjoyed playing PlayStation 5 and had one sibling, a sister.A woman who said she knew the family described the teenager as “very bright at school”. Another told the BBC: “It’s very sad; we know the family. The dad, who is very well known round here, brought up our kids in youth clubs. It is awful, really sad, and really horrible.”Florence Eshalomi, the Labour MP for Vauxhall and Camberwell Green, said: “Stockwell is a vibrant, diverse, close-knit community. We are going to make sure that there is a visible police presence to reassure people.”The MP added: “This is a sad, wasted life; this boy could have had so much potential. His future has been robbed. The family and community will continue to grieve; you can never get over this shock.”DCI Sarah Lee said: “This is a horrendous crime which has shocked the local community and beyond. Our thoughts are with Lathaniel’s family and friends at this devastating time.“Our investigation is continuing at pace, examining CCTV and collecting witnesses statements. We have deployed officers to the area on reassurance patrol, and have officers on the ground engaging with the local schools.”The killing is the first fatal shooting in London this year. There were 13 in 2024 out of a total of 105 homicides recorded by the Metropolitan police.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has a lot of education charities that would contribute towards this. I do not understand why they should not pay for their own memorial.”Ian Austin, a former Labour MP who now sits as a crossbench peer, intervened to say the memorial was not one for the Jewish community but “for everybody”.Hamilton replied: “I take that point, but the driving forces behind putting up this memorial are the Jewish people in this country. They are people who have property everywhere. I do not see why they should not fund it.”The peer added that he had “plenty of Jewish blood, and I am a member of the Conservative Friends of Israel”.Austin said afterwards that Hamilton’s comments were “completely unacceptable” and that the Conservatives should take action.He said: “How many antisemitic caricatures is it possible to get in one speech? It is shocking to hear comments like this in a debate about the Holocaust. It shows that antisemitism remains a real problem – even in parliament – but it does show why a memorial that focuses on anti-Jewish racism is still necessary.”Danny Stone, the chief executive of theAntisemitismPolicy Trust, which works with parliamentarians and others, said: “Not only were Lord Hamilton’s comments ill-judged, racist and false, they betrayed a lack of knowledge and understanding about the Jewish community and what the Holocaust memorial is for.“It is shocking that his slur was not challenged by those leading the debate. We will be working with parliamentarians to ensure this appalling rhetoric does not remain unchallenged.”Hamilton issued a statement on Wednesday evening saying he wished to withdraw his comments during the debate and apologise.“My remarks were not intended to be antisemitic and I apologise unreservedly,” he said. “With hindsight, having read my comments , I realise that my remarks were insensitive and I apologise. I intend to meet with groups from the Jewish community in order to understand how to communicate about issues affecting British Jews.”The site for the memorial and education centrewas approvedin 2021 after a public inquiry, eight years after David Cameron’s government announced the idea.While the decision was backed by many Jewish groups, some people said the decision to use a relatively small green space was mistaken. Among the opponents was the crossbench peer Ruth Deech, whose father fled the Nazis.Speaking in the same Lords debate as Hamilton, Deech said she wanted to bring some “fiscal discipline” to a project she said could now cost more than £190m.The Conservative party were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

Research by the anti-poverty charity Oxfam found that in the 25 years between 1990 and 2015, the richest 10% accounted for more than half the carbon dioxide emitted.Even within the UK, where the wealth disparity is comparatively smaller, research shows the household emissions of the richest 10% are three times that of the poorest 10%, and wealthier sections of society are hugely overrepresented in consumption of air travel and other luxuries.But this disproportionate impact also means changes among the wealthiest sections of society can also have outsized positive effects, and so researchers from the University of Bath investigated wealthier individuals’ relationship to carbon emissions-related behaviours to investigate their capacity for change.“What we found was that although wealthy people do have higher carbon emissions than the general population, they also are in a particularly powerful position to reduce not only their own but other people’s,” Hettie Moorcroft, lead author of the study, told the Guardian.Moorcroft and her colleagues surveyed evermore than 1,000 people, including a targeted group of 43 wealthy individuals, defined as those with an income of more than £150,000 a year, putting them in the top 10% income bracket in the UK. They then followed up by conducting in-depth interviews with a subset of wealthier participants.Wealthier people, they found, not only had greater access to low-carbon technologies with high upfront costs, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles, but they were also more relaxed about making those kinds of greener choices. As one interviewee told the team: “If you invest £10,000 in solar panels, and it goes wrong? Well, it’s only £10,000.”Wealthier individuals were also more informed and concerned about climate change, with 81% of the wealthy group saying urgent action was needed compared with 68% of others. They were also more likely to support government regulation in this area.But the team also found a number of barriers to increased uptake of lower carbon behaviours among wealthy people. “The first one is that they are less carbon capable because they tend to have higher carbon emissions as a kind of entry level – clearly that hinders the point to which they’re positively contributing,” Moorcroft said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And with travel, carbon footprint is especially extreme because basically flying represents such a big proportion.”Wealthier people were also more likely to link increased consumption to their wellbeing. “So one example is [an interviewee who told them]: ‘I don’t enjoybuying second hand. It doesn’t give me a dopamine of having made an expensive purchase’,” Moorcroft said.The research also found that wealthier people were likely to badly underestimate their carbon footprints. One interviewee told the team: “Besides my business travel [estimated 200-300 hours annually], I think our footprint is relatively small … we recycle.” Or, as another put it: “Most people we know will travel abroad at least three times a year … so I wouldn’t be looking to us to reduce our travel because our footprint is relatively small”Despite these apparent inconsistencies, the researchers resisted descriptions of wealthier people as hypocritical, warning that such pejorative language could be counterproductive – particularly in persuading wealthier people to take the leadership roles their influence could enable.“I‘m not sure it’s … particularly helpful … when we’re talking about empowering and accelerating positive change because I think lots of us are hypocrites to an extent,” Moorcroft said.“It’s very hard. And I don’t think that that’s an empowering term. I think it’s a really disengaging one where if we feel like we might be called a hypocrite, we might not take an action, a positive action, because we can’t do 100% of the time.”The study is published in Plos Climate.Explore more on these topicsEthical and green livingClimate crisisRenewable energyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergyTravel and transportShareReuse this content"

It had heavyweight cross-party backing from MPs and a string of child protection charities but will now commit the government to researching the issue further rather than immediate change.The government will accept the new proposal, the Guardian understands. Government sources suggested that MacAlister’s original bill would not have received ministers’ backing – and would probably have been talked out or whipped against.They said more time was needed to research the impact of phones on teenagers and assess the evolving technologies that could restrict content developed by the phone companies themselves.Kyle is understood to be opposed to any major bill which would be the equivalent of a second Online Safety Act, which some campaigners want.A source close to Kyle said he was not in principle opposed to further government intervention on this specific issue but that work was at an early stage.The original proposal would have forced social media companies to exclude young teens from algorithms to make content less addictive for under-16s – raising the age of internet adulthood from 13 to 16.It would also have committed the government to a review of the sale of phones to teens and whether additional technological safeguards should be on phones sold to under-16s. Both measures have been removed from the final bill.Another measure to ban mobile phones in schools had already been dropped after opposition by Phillipson, who is understood to believe schools should police themselves. One government source said they did not believe there should be criminal or civil penalties for phones being brought into school and it was unclear who would be liable for any breaches.One MP who had backed MacAlister’s bill said there was frustration at the lack of government will on the issue. “It’s effectively seen as a side issue,” the MP said.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is seen as an outlier in cabinet on the need to do more on addictive smartphone use – and had publicly backed MacAlister’s bill.The new version of the private member’s bill will instruct the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, to look at the health impact of smartphone use – giving Streeting’s department some new oversight on the issue. Last year the then US surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, said social media should have smoking-style health warning labels.MacAlister, the MP for Whitehaven and Workington, told the Guardian the bill was a first step in government taking the issue of addictive smartphone use seriously, rather than focusing just on harmful or illegal content.“It will be the first meaningful step from a UK government to engage with the widespread impacts of excessive smartphone and social media use by children,” he said.Violence on social media making teenagers afraid to go out, study findsRead moreMacAlister will present his bill to the Commons on Friday, where MPs will debate it. If ministers then commit to take the new measures forward, as expected, MacAlister will not push the bill to a vote.It will now say that the government must “publish a plan for research into the impact of use of social media on children” and ask the UK’s chief medical officers to prepare advice for parents on the use of smartphones and social media by children.Polling suggests measures to limit their use by young people are extremely popular. More in Common found last month 74% wanted social media banned for under-16s.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaInternet safetyYoung peopleMobile phonesSmartphonesnewsShareReuse this content"

This would make the UK the first major G7 oil producer to take such a step. However, the Guardian understands that oil companies could be allowed to increase the size of their fields with “bolt-ons” to existing licences.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said the consultation would avert job losses in the North Sea oil industry during the transition to hydrogen, renewable energy and technologies such as carbon capture and storage.“The North Sea will be at the heart of Britain’s energy future,” Miliband said. “For decades, its workers, businesses and communities have helped power our country and our world.“Oil and gas production will continue to play an important role and, as the world embraces the drive to clean energy, the North Sea can power our plan for change and clean energy future in the decades ahead.”The GMB and Unite trade unions have previously joined the Conservatives in opposing an end to new drilling licences, warning about the potential impact on jobs and energy security.Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB, said: “In the new geopolitical reality – it’s madness. If the North Sea is being prematurely closed down and we are increasing import dependence – that’s bad for jobs, economic growth and national security.”Unite has previously warned of a repeat of the devastation visited on coalmining communities if no plan is put in place to protect workers. On Wednesday, it called for more concrete information on the government’s plans.“Until that happens, we need to resist any calls that amount to offshoring our carbon responsibilities for the sake of virtue signalling,” said the union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham. “We must not let go of one rope before we have hold of another.”But the oil industry issued a cautious welcome to the government’s blueprint for reforming taxation.North Sea drillers currently pay a 40% tax on their profits, as well as the 38% energy profits levy brought in by the previous government in response to energy companies recording bumper profits as oil and gas prices surged in response to war in Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It outlines a raft of new measures to stop criminals who are pregnant or mothers of children under one year old being imprisoned.According to thelatest official datathere were 215 pregnant women in English prisons between April 2023 and March 2024. Fifty-three children were born to mothers in custody during the same period, and all but one of these births took place in hospitals.The new guidance, which comes into force on 1 April, says courts “should avoid the possibility of an offender navigating the risks associated with pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period in custody unless the imposition of a custodial sentence is unavoidable”.Pregnant women and new mothers shouldn’t be sent to jail, UK public saysRead moreIt also lists pregnancy as an appropriate reason to suspend a sentence. While the guidance will not endimprisonment of pregnant womencompletely, it is likely to make a significant difference to the number placed behind bars.TheSentencingCouncil said: “The guideline … includes some significant new areas of guidance, including new subsections on sentencing young adult offenders, female offenders, mothers and pregnant and postnatal offenders.”It said that even offences that carry a mandatory minimum custodial sentence may now not result in a custodial sentence if the offender is pregnant or has a baby.It added that pregnancy and the postnatal period may contribute to “exceptional circumstances” that could justify not imposing this sentence.Janey Starling, of the campaign group Level Up, which advocates for an end to the jailing of pregnant women and those with babies, welcomed the changes. “This guidance includes a host of landmark measures affecting the sentencing of pregnant women and mothers of infants,” she said. “These changes are a huge milestone in our campaign and clear the path for statutory sentencing reform.”The new Sentencing Council information acknowledges that prison is a high-risk environment for pregnant offenders, likely to be harmful to the physical and mental health of the mother and the child. The prisons and probation ombudsman and the NHS classify all pregnancies in prison as “high-risk”.View image in fullscreenLouise Powell did not know she was pregnant when she went into labour at HMP Styal, Cheshire, in 2020.Photograph: BBCAt least two babies areknown to have diedin women’s prisons in the past three years, when their mothers, Rianna Cleary and Louise Powell, gave birth without medical assistance, at HMP Bronzefield in September 2019, and at HMP Styal in June 2020.The Royal College of Midwives has said prison “is no place for pregnant women”, and it was one of several high-profile signatories to an open letter to the Sentencing Council in 2022 that asked for a review of sentencing practices for pregnant women.Eleven countries, including Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, have laws against sending pregnant women to prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As someone that has lived experience of being pregnant in prison and having my child in custody and understanding the risks this carries, it brings me immense joy to know that this guidance should mean far less women endure what others before them have.”Liz Forrester, a lawyer who campaigns with the organisation No Births Behind Bars, said: “This is a seismic change we have been campaigning for, finally recognising the deadly impact of prison on babies and pregnant women.”Ministry of Justice sources said they could not comment on decisions made by the independent Sentencing Council but that the newWomen’s Justice Boardlaunched in January was focusing on reducing the number of vulnerable women sent to prison.The ministry also said the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, had been described as “incandescent” about another part of the guidelines that asks judges to consider the background of minority ethnic offenders before passing sentence.Magistrates and judges have been told they should normally consider ordering a pre-sentence report on an offender if they come from “an ethnic minority, cultural minority, and/or faith minority community”.The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the guidance was “completely outrageous” and enshrined a “double-standard, two-tier approach to sentencing”.Mahmood has written to the Sentencing Council urging it to reverse its changes to the guidance and registering her displeasure.“Today’s updated guidelines do not represent my views or the views of this government,” she said. “As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law, for anyone of any kind. There will never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationSentencingWomenUK criminal justiceEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The order haltedUSAidoperations around the world, jeopardizing delivery of life-saving food and medical aid, and throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos.“The freeze on life-saving aid has already caused irreparable harm and suffering to millions of people around the world,” the letter said, adding that despite statements on waivers being issued for life-saving programs, the funding remained shut.The president tasked billionaire and adviser Elon Musk with dismantlingUSAidas part of an unprecedented push to shrink the federal government over what both say is wasteful spending and abuse of funds.“Foreign assistance is not charity. Instead, it is a strategic tool that stabilizes regions, prevents conflict, and advances US interests,” the letter said.A state department spokesperson, when asked about the cable, said: “We do not comment on leaked internal communication.”Trump ally Peter Marocco behind evisceration of USAid: ‘He’s a destroyer’Read moreIn fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed $72bn of aid worldwide, on everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean water,HIV/Aids treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work.Upon evaluating 6,200 multiyear awards, the administration decided to eliminate nearly 5,800 of them worth $54bn in value, a 92% reduction, according to a state department spokesperson. USAid fired or put on administrative leave thousands of staff and contractors.The cable said the government’s failure to pay outstanding invoices to contractors and implementing partners has severe economic repercussions.“The resulting financial strain not only undermines confidence in the US government as a reliable partner, it also weakens domestic economic growth at a time of mounting global competition,” the cable said.Organizations and companies that contract with USAid last month sued the administration, calling the dismantling of the agency unlawful and saying funding had been cut off for existing contracts, including hundreds of millions of dollars for work that was already done.The US supreme court declined on Wednesday to let the administration withhold payments to foreign aid organizations for work they had already performed for the government, upholding a district judge’s order that called on the administration to promptly release payments to contractors.Explore more on these topicsUSAidUS foreign policyTrump administrationMarco RubioUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool. We reiterate that the civilians of Gaza who have suffered so much must be allowed to return to their homes and rebuild their lives.”During the 15 months of theIsrael-Gaza war, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government repeatedly denied aid agencies’ claims that it was blocking humanitarian deliveries, blaming the very limited flow on other factors.UN officials said before the ceasefire that widespread famine was imminent. In the six weeks of the first phase of the truce, deliveries returned to the prewar levels of about 600 trucks a day, mostly carrying food.Aid officials said that even with the restoration of food deliveries, the lack of drinkable water, the near-complete destruction of Gaza’s hospitals and clinics, the lack of shelter in winter and the buildup of untreated sewage among the rubble could all be lethal to the surviving population of 2.2 million.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warForeign policyIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesFranceGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

But this is the first time I’ve seen a bald eagle go in for something as big as a goose,” he said.Despite multiple attacks by the eagle, the goose remained unbowed. The raptor, defeated, flew off.View image in fullscreenMervyn Sequeira: ‘Not often does one see our apex raptor, the American bald eagle attempting to take down a Canada goose.’Photograph: Mervyn SequeiraAt a time whenCanada’s sovereignty has come under unprecedented threat fromDonald Trump’s US, the battle between the two birds closely associated with each country has emerged as the latest symbol of tensions between the two countries.‘The relationship is broken’: Canadians respond to Trump’s tariffsRead moreThis week, Trump put a 25% tax on most Canadian goods and has further aggravated his northern neighbour, derisively calling it the 51st state and pledging to annex the world’s second largest country.Three days earlier, Canada’s national hockey team had stepped on to the ice in Boston for a match heralded as a showdown between the sport’s most powerful nations.An overtime Canadian goal, heavily laden with symbolism, finished the game and both electrified and soothed an anxious nation.“You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, posted on social media.For Canadians, such encounters have been impossible to untangle from a trade war brought on by the country’s closest ally and largest trading partner.View image in fullscreenAfter a 20-minute confrontation the defeated raptor flew off.Photograph: Mervyn Sequeira“We’ve been in tough spots before … but we have not only survived, we have emerged stronger than ever, because when it comes to defending our great nation, there is no price we all aren’t willing to pay, and today is no different,” Trudeau told Canadians.Sequeira, a retired airline pilot and avid bird photographer, is hesitant to impress symbolism on to the pictures.“It’s quite a coincidence that it should have happened at this time. And I’m not entirely surprised. I like to look at things from the naturalist point of view and from the wildlife photographer’s point of view and not put a spin on it. But it’s quite natural for people to look at it in the context of what’s happening,” he said.Certainly others see the fight as representing Canada’s scrappy nature and its unwillingness to back away when threatened.“Nature has its way of taking out the weak and the not so well and the injured. The eagle likely thought it would be able to take it out quite easily,” Sequeira said. “But, it wasn’t.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaBirdsAmericasWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Dafir said one of his friends was among those hurt.“I lost my voice, I was so scared,” said Dafir. “We’re being forced to be silent; it seems like no wants to listen to us.”A group of young refugees based in the camp, Youth Voices in Kakuma, said protesters had spent hours outside the UNHCR offices but when no one came out to listen to their concerns some began trying to climb the fence, prompting the police to step in.A Kakuma resident named Blax Von, who uploaded videos of the protest on to TikTok, said the tensions had been building for several months, with water supplies being reduced, cash support payments slashed, and refugees required to pay their children’s school fees.Many of the protesters carried empty pots, while others held signs questioning whether 3kg of cereals was enough. “This is the container they are now using to measure beans and oil and the other one for rice. And this is equivalent for one month for your food,” a South Sudanese refugee, holding an empty cooking pot, told the Associated Press.“Assume you don’t have another income, it’s only this. Is this enough for you?”Deaths predicted amid the chaos of Elon Musk’s shutdown of USAidRead moreUNHCR said in a statement that it was “deeply concerned” about the impact of the cuts. It said “government security personnel in Kakuma intervened to contain the situation. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.“However, at least four refugees and one local government official sustained injuries. UNHCR cannot confirm the use of live rounds during the demonstrations.”TheSocial Justice Centre Working Group, a Kenyan civil society organisation, said: “Brutalising those who flee war, persecution and hunger instead of addressing their cries for food and water is the height of state-sponsored cruelty.”Kipchumba Murkomen, the cabinet secretaryat Kenya’s interior ministry,said on Tuesdaythat the recent aid cuts had had a “sudden and severe” impact on Kenya’s ability to host 800,000 refugees and asylum seekers.“With the cut in funding for humanitarian assistance programmes by the developed world, the socioeconomic impact on our country will be unbearable. And yet to turn our backs on the most vulnerable people runs counter to our belief in shared humanity. It’s therefore incumbent on developed countries to shoulder the financial burden as we do our bit,” said Murkomen.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentKenyaRefugeesHungerUnited NationsAfricaAidnewsShareReuse this content"

It said that after the Ash Wednesday rites, Francis had set to work and made his usual call to the parish priest of Gaza.“Given the complexity of the clinical picture, the prognosis remains reserved,” the statement added. It also said Francis would once again sleep with a non-invasive mechanical mask for the night.The pope has been seriously ill since he was admitted to hospital on 14 February. TheVaticansaid thetwo episodes of acute respiratory failure on Mondaywere caused by “significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and a consequent bronchospasm”.Francis also suffered a bronchospasm on Friday that caused him to vomit and inhale vomit. That episode followeda prolonged breathing crisis on 22 February, which required blood transfusions for a low platelet count.Cardinal Angelo De Donatis stood in for the pontiff at the Ash Wednesday mass at Rome’s Santa Sabina Basilica and read a homily on Francis’s behalf.“We feel deeply united with him in this moment,” De Donatis said before he began the address. “And we thank him for the offering of his prayer and his suffering for the good of the entire church in all the world.”Inthe homily, the pope reflected on the fragility of life – as represented by the ashes – on death, on ideological and environmental pollution, but also on the hope symbolised by Christ’s resurrection.“Made of ashes and earth, we experience fragility through illness, poverty, and the hardships that can suddenly befall us and our families,” he wrote.“We also experience it when, in the social and political realities of our time, we find ourselves exposed to the ‘fine dust’ that pollutes our world: ideological opposition, the abuse of power, the re-emergence of old ideologies based on identity that advocate exclusion, the exploitation of the earth’s resources, violence in all its forms and war between peoples.”Fragility, he added, reminds us of the inescapable “tragedy of death”. No matter how much we try to banish it from our societies, Francis said, “death imposes itself as a reality with which we have to reckon, a sign of the precariousness and brevity of our lives”.The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless, our commitment is to dismantle whatever may be left from it, to put an end to this painful legacy and ensure Syria becomes a nation aligned with international norms.”Earlier on Wednesday, the OPCW chief, Fernando Arias, called Syria’s political shift “a new and historic opportunity to obtain clarifications on the full extent and scope of the Syrian chemical weapons programme”.Shaibani said planning had begun, but that the help of the international community would be critical. Syria would require technical assistance, logistical assistance, capacity building, resources and expertise on the ground, he said.“Although the Assad regime stalled for many years, we understand the need to act quickly, but we also understand that this needs to be done thoroughly. For that, we cannot succeed alone,” he said.Syria’s declared stockpile has never accurately reflected the situation on the ground, OPCW inspectors have concluded. They now want to visit roughly 100 sites that may have been tied to Assad’s decades-old chemical weapons programme.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaChemical weaponsBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

He himself has called them vital “in light of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent”.Merz is expected to be the next chancellor after his party came in first in national elections on 23 February, and he is in coalition negotiations to form the new government, a process expected to run until Easter.He will seek parliament’s approval next week for the plans, which would give the go-ahead to the relaxation of tight constraints on defence spending currently governed by a constitutionally protected “debt brake” according to which outgoings cannot exceed 1% of GDP – currently €45bn.This would allowGermanyto raise a potentially unlimited level of debt in order to finance its military and to continue to provide the necessary assistance to Ukraine.Under his proposals, an additional €500bn, decade-long fund for infrastructure would also be introduced.Merz’s efforts to squeeze the plans through the existing parliament, where the conservatives and SPD currently have the necessary two-thirds majority together with the Greens – but which they will lose once the new parliament is in place at the end of March – have been described as a race against time.He has been confronted with myriad accusations from opposition parties, everything from committing voter fraud to endangering the democratic process by rushing his plans through parliament.The Greens, not part of negotiations for a new government but keen supporters of Ukraine as well as for a spending increase on Germany’s ailing infrastructure, have indicated their support. However, their joint parliamentary leader Britta Haßelmann accused Merz of breaking his promise to not take on more debt.“You promised the citizens of this country that there would be no more debt,” she said, lamenting also Merz’s lack of commitment to fiscal reform. “From one day to the next you’ve broken this election promise.”Die Linke, which has 64 seats in the new parliament, questioned the legality of the financial plans, and accused Merz of circumnavigating the distribution of seats in the new parliament. “We question whether the decision on several hundreds of billions of euros by an old parliament that has just been voted out is at all constitutional,” it said in a statement.The party said it was in favour of relaxing the debt brake to finance investments in infrastructure, but not of a “blank cheque” for defence spending. Merz, it added, had “flouted the will of voters”.The AfD, which will have 152 seats in the new parliament, having come second in the election, said Merz had “shown the middle finger” to voters. Its parliamentary leader, Bernd Baumann, said the party was taking legal advice over whether it was possible to block the legislation.The pro-business FDP, which will have no seats in the new parliament, but whose opposition to the outgoing government’s wish to boost spending by taking on more debt led to the administration’s collapse last November, accused Merz of participating in a “debt orgy”. The party’s parliamentary group leader, Christian Dürr, criticised Merz for “already shying away from real reforms before he’s even chancellor”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The intention was to protect future generations from the burden of excessive debt, but in more recent years, especially after crises such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, it has increasingly been seen as too much an impediment and an obstacle to economic growth.Announcing his plans on Tuesday evening, Merz said he would do “whatever it takes”. He said the urgency of the situation Europe found itself in had changed even in the less than two weeks since his conservatives came first at the general election, afterthe collision betweenthe US president, Donald Trump, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Washington’s blockingof military aid to Kyiv.Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg bank, called the plans “a really big bazooka”, a nod to when the phrase was used to describe unprecedented interventions made by the European Central Bank to contend with the sovereign debt crisis 13 years ago.The Dax, Germany’s stock market index on the performance of major companies, soared on the news on Wednesday, cancelling losses triggered the previous day over fears that Europe would imminently be hit by US tariffs.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was chosen for the Gold prize over Lost in the Garden by Adam S Leslie, which won the fiction category; Wild Houses by Colin Barrett, which won the debut fiction category; and The Twelve by Liz Hyder, illustrated by Tom de Freston, which won the children’s fiction category. Each of the four category winners received £5,000.This year marks the second iteration of the Nero prizes, which were launched after Costa Coffeeabruptly endedits book awards in 2022. The Bee Sting by Paul Murray was chosen as theinaugural Gold prize winner.Maurice and Maralyn tells the story of a couple who, bored with suburban life in Derby, decide to sell their house, build a boat and set sail for New Zealand. However, 250 miles north of Ecuador, a sperm whale smashes into the boat, and they are cast adrift for nearly four months in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat.Elmhirst marshals their story into an “electrifying narrative full of atmosphere and humanity and with the lightest dusting of romance,” wrote Fiona Sturges in aGuardian reviewof the book. “Maurice and Maralyn is about a shipwreck, yes, but it’s also a tender portrait of two unconventional souls blithely defying the conventions of their era and making a break for freedom.”As well as being a story about survival at sea and physical endurance, the book chronicles a marriage under immense stress. “For what else is a marriage, really, if not being stuck on a small raft with someone and trying to survive?”, Elmhirst writes.“Shining through is the heroine’s courage and fortitude”, said Bryson. “As Maurice flounders, it is Maralyn’s strength that allows them to survive at sea”, adding that the book “is a tribute to Maralyn’s grit”. Researching the book, Elmhirst studied the diaries Maralyn wrote on the raft, interviews with the couple after their rescue and the memoirs they wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She described winning the Nero nonfiction category award as like “being given a lovely confidence transfusion”.Alongside Bryson, the Gold prize judging panel included Booker-winning author and Royal Society of Literature president Bernardine Evaristo and journalist Emily Maitlis.“Elmhirst’s writing is understated but powerful, immersing the reader intimately in the unfolding drama and the horror of struggling to survive against the odds with very few resources,” said Bryson. “We unanimously agreed that Maurice and Maralyn is a nonfiction work that reaches the highest literary eminence”.Wednesday’s ceremony also saw the announcement of a new award, the Nero new writers prize, to be run in association with Brunel University.

During that prolonged period of isolation and uncertainty, he comforted himself by devouring shelves full ofbooks, including memoirs penned by other musicians. “After a while all those memoirs started to seem the same,” he said. “And I came to the realization that, unless you were a huge fan of that musician, the details of their story wouldn’t seem particularly captivating.”Grace Slick on sex, drugs and Jefferson Airplane: ‘I was sober in the 80s. That was a mistake’Read moreSuch thoughts had a major impact on Wolf when he was approached to tell his own story. As a result, his new book, titled Waiting on the Moon, threads the outlines of a memoir – highlighted by his years fronting the hit group J Geils Band – through a host of colorful anecdotes about what he describes as the “artists, poets, drifters, grifters and goddesses” he met along the way.One such goddess happened to beFaye Dunaway, to whom he was married for five tumultuous years in the 70s. Initially, Wolf was so reluctant to include any details of his personal story that he didn’t even want to mention his band, which topped the charts in the 80s with songs like Freeze-Frame and Centerfold, or his marriage to one of Hollywood’s biggest and most controversial stars. It took the combined force of his editor and agent to throw cold water in his face. “They told me it would seem odd if I left those things out,” he said. “It would only wind up bringing more attention to them.”The balance Wolf eventually struck makes much of his book read less like the work of a memoirist than that of a raconteur, eager to revel in the quirks of the characters in his orbit. “In writing the book I found that people reveal themselves best in the little details,” he said. “That’s where you see what they’re really like.”The more unexpected the detail, the better – like discovering upon meeting Fred Astaire that he was utterly entranced by the dancers on Soul Train. Or observing thatAretha Franklin, with whom Wolf cut a duet in the 80s, would only speak to him in a British accent due to her love at the time of the delicious bitchery of Joan Collins on Dynasty.The book begins as conventional memoirs must, with Wolf’s childhood. But unlike the legion of rockers who rebelled against their square parents, Wolf echoed their love of the arts as well as their countercultural politics. During his childhood, his parents’ leftist affiliations were pronounced enough to put them under surveillance by the US government.“When we got a TV, which was a really exciting thing for a kid in the 50s, it wasn’t for entertainment,” he said. “It was so my parents could watch the McCarthy hearings.”View image in fullscreenA young Peter Wolf and his family.Photograph: Peter WolfAs a child, Wolf was so hyper-active his mother used to tie a leash around him to stop him from running wild. “I remember how horrified the neighbors were by that,” he said with a laugh.His parents encouraged his interests in both music and painting, which soon attracted interesting company. As a teen, Wolf took his paintings to Washington Square Park, where he wound up meeting Edward Hopper, who would stop by to chat. “Here was this great artist,” Wolf said, “but at the time he was considered passé because it was the age of the abstract impressionists.”Wolf’s parallel obsession with music led him to early shows byBob Dylansoon after he arrived in the Village in the early 60s. The visionary scope of Dylan’s work convinced Wolf that this wasn’t just a great artist but a seer. He was so convinced that one day he cornered Dylan with a demand to know “what is truth?” The question elicited from Dylan a pitched screed about the unknowability of all things, which Wolf recounts in two burning pages in the book. “I think I got what I deserved,” the author said with a laugh.To develop his painting skills, Wolf attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where his first roommate turned out to be a youngDavid Lynch, who also aspired to an art career. “There was no talk of cinema whatsoever then,” Wolf said. “We were truly the odd couple. David came from the preppie world and was into the Beach Boys and the Four Seasons while I was this debauched person from Greenwich Village who listened to Thelonious Monk.”Despite Lynch’s buttoned-up demeanor, elements of his future feel for surrealism poked through one day when he was brushing his teeth. Unfortunately, Lynch had failed to notice that a dead cockroach had become entangled on the brush, resulting in a rash of insect remains strewn across his teeth.During his time in Boston, Wolf began to perform with an R&B band called the Hallucinations, who opened shows for idols of his like Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters. Wolf and Waters became especially close. “Muddy came from a totally different culture, but here he was sitting on my futon telling me that as a young man he sang the songs of [country legend] Gene Autry,” he said. “To me, that was mind-blowing.”Besides Howlin’ Wolf’s genius, Peter Wolf was drawn to his determination to sustain a career with little financial reward. “He stayed in these cheap hotels with yellow window shades and beds that sagged like you see in noir films,” he said. “But he still kept going.”Wolf was with Waters that horrible night in 1968 when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated, a night that also happened to be the blues legend’s birthday. “While Muddy was blowing out his candles, sirens blared in the background,” Wolf said. “The whole country was on edge.”View image in fullscreenPeter Wolf in Bayside, New York.Photograph: Peter WolfBy that time, Wolf had begun working as a DJ at WBCN, which became the city’s best champion for cutting-edge music. In that capacity, he began to receive a steady stream of anonymous notes that begged him to “play more Van Morrison”. Only after befriending the Irish singer a while later did he discover that the notes were written by Morrison’s girlfriend and sometimes by the man himself. “He signed them Mongo Bongo,” Wolf said. “I still have them.”That was during a fraught time in Morrison’s life when he was hiding out in Boston to escape a rash of legal issues with his record company in New York. “Van had absolutely no money and was feeling so lost,” Wolf said. “I provided a shelter for him.”At the same time, Morrison was developing the revolutionary sound of Astral Weeks, an album that would become a gamechanger not just for him but for music itself. As much affection as Wolf brings to his descriptions of Morrison, he also captures the famously difficult side of him, replete with random outbursts and last-minute refusals to go on stage. Rather than label him difficult, however, Wolf sees him as “moody”. “Van doesn’t deal with bullshit,” he said.The tolerance Wolf had for such things would come in handy when he met his future wife, Faye Dunaway, another artist known for her fast-moving moods. A mutual friend introduced them after a J Geils show in 1972. By that time, she’d become a gigantic star, having broken through five years earlier with her role in Bonnie and Clyde. By contrast, Wolf’s band then drew a cultish crowd. As stark as the power imbalance was between them, Wolf recalled the 70s as an era “when all movie stars wanted to be rockers, and all rockers wanted to be movie stars”.Moreover, Dunaway was a huge Otis Redding fan and she adored hanging out with the band and crew, regardless of their sometimes ratty circumstances. It helped that she could drink them all under the table. “She really was two people,” Wolf said. “There was Dorothy Faye [her birth name], who was this sweet southern girl, and Faye Dunaway, this very cultured actress.”View image in fullscreenFaye Dunaway.Photograph: Peter WolfThe book chronicles her moods without judgment but, ina new documentaryabout the star, she herself ponders on camera the possibility that she might be bipolar. “That term didn’t exist when we were married,” Wolf said. “But when people are graced with an artistic gift, there are things that come along with that. Maybe I just have a gift for being able to deal with those things.”However, even he could reach a breaking point, like the moment during the filming of Chinatown in 1974 when Dunaway and co-star Jack Nicholson met to talk about the film, with Wolf in tow. At one point, the movie stars excused themselves to go upstairs for what Wolf eventually realized was an impromptu assignation. Though that made him far from happy at the time, he now advises readers to consider “the era in which this was happening. The climate was ripe for that.”Soon after the ensuing blow-up, the two reconciled and, out of nowhere, Dunaway proposed to him. As exciting as their subsequent marriage was, it was far from stable. Several years into it Dunaway left him for photographer Terry O’Neill.Meanwhile, Wolf’s band continued to coast commercially, despite the mountain of critical respect they’d amassed. The songs J Geils cut in the 70s, captured most searingly on their live album Full House, forged an entirely new brand of R&B, fired by hard rock power and delivered at the speed of a runaway train. However, their contract with Atlantic Records was so onerous that profits were nearly impossible to realize. Their turnaround didn’t occur until they moved to EMI Records in the early 80s, resulting in a No 1 album for Freeze-Frame. With that win came an invitation to open a Stones tour that also featured the first stadium appearances by a young Prince. Shockingly, the purple one often got booed off the stage. “It wasn’t a racial thing,” Wolf said. “It was just that seeing Prince sing songs like Jerk U Off in a trenchcoat was just too outlandish for the generic AOR rock fan of the day.”Though J Geils went down well with that crowd, their success caused most of the band members to want to lean further into the slick, synth-driven sound that gave them hits. By contrast, Wolf wanted to use their new exposure to lead the audience back to their core R&B sound. At an impasse, the band unceremoniously fired him in 1983.In the years since, Wolf has released eight solo albums, all of which finely balance his root R&B style with more mature and poignant lyrics. (He’s in the process of recording a new solo album now.) He brought that same mature perspective to his book. If the anecdotes he offers along the way often outweigh the personal details he reveals, the end result makes a powerful point: sometimes the story of who we are can best be told by the things we love.“The work of all those people I’ve admired so much has defined a lot of my life,” Wolf said. “Because I was lucky enough to spend so many private moments with them, my mission was to be an observer and to share all that I got to see.”Waiting on the Moon is out on 11 MarchExplore more on these topicsMusicMusic booksFaye DunawayPop and rockDavid LynchBob DylanAretha FranklininterviewsShareReuse this content"

He will play at the MTS Live Hall on 18 April after completing a solo tour last year in the US.The site calls him “one of the most influential, Grammy-nominated rap icons to emerge from the Southern United States”.The rapper is signed to Motown Records, which is owned by Universal Music Group. The parent company had previously announced a boycott ofRussiaafter the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It was one of many labels suspending operations in the area.“We urge an end to the violence in Ukraine as soon as possible,” a statement read in 2022. “We are adhering to international sanctions and, along with our employees and artists, have been working with groups from a range of countries to support humanitarian relief efforts to bring urgent aid to refugees in the region.”No official statement has been made by UMG yet on the concert.DaBaby, another rapper who is signed to a label existing within the Universal umbrella, also recently performed in Russia. He has previously shown his support for Donald Trump,referringto him as “a gangster”.Offset, who had been married to Cardi B until their divorce in 2024, has experienced a number of legal troubles in his career. Charges include burglary, theft, battery and possession of a concealed weapon.In 2020, he wasdetainednear aDonald Trumprally yet his publicist later said there had been an “attack by aggressive Trump supporters”.The statement added: “Offset’s current focus is encouraging younger voters to get to the polls in order to keep incidents like this from continuously happening.”Offset’s former Migos group member Takeoff wasshot dead in 2022.Last year, OffsetendorsedKamala Harris for president and this week alsocalledElon Musk a “racist bitch” on social media after the South African tech mogul promoted a pardon of Derek Chauvin who killed George Floyd in 2020.Cardi B has alsopreviouslyspoken out about the war in Ukraine on social media in 2022. “Wish these world leaders stop tripping about power and really think about whose really getting affected (citizens) besides the whole world is in a crisis,” she tweeted. “War, sanctions, invasions should be the last thing these leaders worry about.”The announcement followsnewsthat the White House is steering toward lifting sanctions on Russia.Explore more on these topicsMusicRussiaRapHip-hopnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also a sharp look at how the ruling classes survive social upheavalRachel AroestiWed 5 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 08.06 ESTShareFirst the Americans came for British period drama. Now the Brits are getting their mitts on Italy’s heritage. In 2020, the US producer Shonda Rhimes sexed-up Regency England with lusty intrigue, soapy storylines and orchestral covers of pop hits to create Netflix’s smash-hit Bridgerton. This year, British screenwriters Benji Walters and Richard Warlow (The Serpent) and director Tom Shankland (SAS Rogue Heroes) are collaborating with the streamer on a bit of pop cultural colonisation of their own.You can see why they would want to: The Leopard – the trio’s adaptation of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s seminal 1860s novel, set in Sicily – is sumptuous, sensuous, emotionally tempestuous and full of nice food; all qualities our homegrown costume drama tends to lack. But this sweaty, steamy series is far more than a treat for the senses. Behind the frills and the romantic thrills – at the centre of the action is a captivating young love triangle – is a socio-historically insightful tale of an elite clan’s descent into obsolescence.The eponymous Leopard is Don Fabrizio, the Prince of Salina, who got his nickname from the big cat on his family crest. Played by a whiskered Kim Rossi Stuart (the cast is Italian and the show is subtitled), the prince must reluctantly adapt to survive after Garibaldi’s redshirt army wrests control of Sicily from the House of Bourbon (try not to think about biscuits) as part of their quest to unify Italy. Fabrizio is – obviously – against the revolution; he fears for the safety of his family and the erosion of his wealth and influence. Yet his beloved nephew Tancredi isn’t so shortsighted. He joins the redshirts, not just because he’s a daredevil – he can see which way the wind is blowing. “If we want everything to stay as it is,” he tells his baffled uncle, “then everything must change.”View image in fullscreenFrills and thrills … Deva Cassel as Angelica in The Leopard.Photograph: Lucia Iuorio/APThe Leopard is a meditation on mortality. Fabrizio realises he is ageing out of relevance just as his way of life is becoming a thing of the past. The regime change does not spell annihilation for the nobility, but does require them to learn a different kind of dance: collaboration with the new proletarian overlords and the burgeoning middle class. Until now, our protagonist has been the last word in male, moneyed privilege. His entitlement means he thinks little of having his priest accompany him on a trip to visit his lover (challenged on his infidelity, his excuse is that he has never seen his pious wife’s navel) but all of a sudden he has to sweet talk some upstart colonel in order to visit his country pile. The crumbling of status and power is one of fiction’s most compelling archetypes, and The Leopard elicits its hypnotic combination of schadenfreude and sympathy.That country pile is the site of the show’s other major storyline. Tancredi has been kind-of courting his cousin Concetta, Fabrizio’s wholesome and besotted daughter. But soon there is a rival for his affections in the form of the newly wealthy mayor’s daughter, Angelica (Deva Cassel, daughter of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), who seems to have been bred for the task of seducing him.Before The Leopard was a six-part Netflix show, it was a three-hour film starring Burt Lancaster, released five years after the novel was posthumously published in 1958. On paper, the two are not that different; there are many overlaps between dialogue and scenes. Rossi Stuart’s prince is colder but less cruel, funny and pervy than Lancaster’s, while Saul Nanni’s Tancredi somehow rivals Alain Delon for renegade heart-throb status. In fact, this cast has a notable advantage: Rossi Stuart and Nanni are both Italian; in what must have been a confusing shoot, Lancaster spoke his lines in English while Delon spoke French, then both were dubbed in Italian.Yet Luchino Visconti’s movie was also steeped in a magical strangeness: a gothic gloom, a frenzy to the family’s Catholicism and a dangerously febrile feeling courses through every scene. The film’s stunning arrangement of bodies is a sight to behold, whether on Palermo’s city centre turned battlefield or the dancefloor in its famous 45-minute ballroom scene. Despite all its aesthetic loveliness, this new Leopard feels visually prosaic in comparison; a pretty streaming series rather than a veritable work of art.The advantage is that this version is more coherent and watchable, without ever being sugary or simplistic. The great story is intact, posing its evergreen questions – when it comes to tradition, where is the line between evolution and extinction? When it comes to power, where does pragmatism bleed into surrender? – for a new audience. The Leopard’s sultry good looks will make you swoon, but this beady-eyed examination of how the ruling classes navigate regime change has plenty of substance too.The Leopard is on Netflix now.This article was amended on 5 March 2025 to correct the spelling of Richard Warlow’s surname.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDramaDrama filmsNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it struggles to match the seamless gaming experience I yearn forKeza MacDonaldWed 5 Mar 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 10.03 ESTShareHappy Monster Hunter Wilds week to all who celebrate: Capcom’s thrilling action game has sold8m unitsin three days, which means that quite a lot of you are likely to be playing it. I’m a huge fan of this series and amdelighted by the latest entry, but after filing the review last week, I’ve barely had a minute to play it since it came out. Regular readers will know that this is a familiar problem for me: I have two kids, so my gaming time is tight, and the living room TV is very often in use.I anticipated this, so in the run-up to Monster Hunter Wilds’ release, I spent £200 on aPlayStation Portal– essentially a screen sandwiched between two halves of a PlayStation 5 controller. I can’t decide whether it’s one of the most unwieldy things that Sony has ever come out with, or one of the most elegant. It lets me stream games from my PS5, so the console can be whirring away under the TV and I can be on the sofa with my little screen, swinging a transforming axe at adreadful octopus.Here’s how the Portal works: you turn it on, and it makes pleasing futuristic noises. A circular portal appears, pulsing soothingly, as it tries to connect to your home console. Then, if it works (sometimes it took a few attempts for me), your PlayStation 5 homepage appears through that portal, and expands to fill the whole of the screen in your hands. Then you can play everything just as you would on your TV, with controller rumble and haptic feedback and everything. When the internet connection falters, the device downgrades the game’s appearance rather than booting you out; it’ll let the game become a soup of pixels and weird messy visual artefacts rather than forcing you to reconnect.View image in fullscreenMonster Hunter Wilds looks perfect on the PS Portal … when the device works.Photograph: CapcomI have played with a whole bunch of game-streaming “solutions” over the years (the first wasGaikai, way back in 2009, which offered games like World of Warcraft streamed from the cloud, still very novel at the time), and they have always been, well, suboptimal. No matter how good your internet connection was, there was always just that bit too much lag. Streamed games always looked noticeably worse. Wifi was neverquitereliable enough. But the Portal works stunningly well on my home wifi. Monster Hunter looks perfect. It’s a demanding action game, so any lag quickly makes it feel unplayable, yet I have been able to play it on the Portal for many hours without feeling too frustrated.You can also use the Portal to play PS5 games away from home, using the device to turn your console on remotely in your empty house (tip: yank the HDMI cable out the back before you leave so it won’t turn your TV on). I took the Portal on a wee half-term holiday with my family – certainly more convenient than packing up an entire console and all its gubbins – and had a go at connecting to my home PlayStation 5 from my hotel room. It took a few tries, but itdidwork even on hotel wifi, which I found near-miraculous. Unfortunately, under these circumstances, the streaming quality was sometimes so bad that the game looked worse than it did 15 years ago on the PSP, and the lag was unbearable. It was not the on-the-go PlayStation gaming experience I was hoping for.The Portal is a useful little gadget – at home, when it works. And that is the case with any kind of internet-reliant game streaming: it’s goodwhen it works. One day I would love to be able to play my games wherever I am, without sacrificing the quality of the experience, but streaming technology hasn’t gotten there yet and I’m starting to wonder if it ever will. It’s certainly gotten better: I’ve streamed games from theXbox’s Game Passlibrary on my home console with only the occasional problem. But what I really want is to be able to stream games to a handheld when I’m in my office or travelling.TheNintendo Switchwas released eight years ago, and it remains the gold standard of at home/on-the-go hybrid gaming – because it doesn’t rely on an internet connection. It just works, seamlessly: you pick it up and take it with you, put it in the dock and it instantly appears on the TV. The Switch changed my life, by letting me fit my game time around my job, friends, travel and family. TheSteam Deckhas also been transformative, letting me take a game I’m reviewing (or enjoying) from my office to my house, or play it on a long-haul flight. We’re used to this now, after almost a decade, but it was truly one of the most revolutionary technical things any console has achieved.It’s only a few weeks until the bigNintendo Switch 2event on 2 April, when we’ll learn more about what this next console can actually do. Given that this is Nintendo, I’d be surprised if internet-based game streaming was a part of the new console’s offering; Nintendo tends to favour older, proven technology over risky bets. Eight years is a long time for Nintendo’s competitors to have perfected an alternative untethered gaming solution, and nobody has yet done it. Perhaps it’s just not possible; no wonder the Switch 2 is sticking to what works.What to playView image in fullscreenAmbitious and gently silly … Split FictionPhotograph: Electronic ArtsFrom the makers ofco-op divorce platformerIt Takes Two – which unexpectedly, sold 23m copies, a figure that publishers would do well to remember in this age of safe bets –Split Fictionis an ambitious and gently silly game about two authors who are forced to inhabit each other’s stories. Sci-fi writer Mio and fantasy writer Zoe turn up at a meeting at a big publishing house, only for its sinister CEO to imprison them in a futuristic idea-stealing machine.You need two players for this game, as it’s entirely dependent on working together for both the puzzley and actiony bits. (Don’t worry if there’s a skill differential between you and your prospective co-op partner – one player can do most of the heavy lifting if required.) It’s full of ideas, this, and wonderfully designed around co-operative play, whether you’re playing with a friend, a partner or an older child.Available on:PC, Xbox, PlayStation 5Estimated playtime:15 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenBetter skate than never … Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4.Photograph: SteamTony Hawk’s Pro Skateris back, again.

I’m sure we can all immediately think of a TV show we enjoyed as teenagers that we find deeply embarrassing now (*cough* Family Guy *cough*) – but we tend to make excuses for the games we adored when we were young, even if our tastes have changed massively since then. I would have talked your ear off about how greatShenmuewas as a teenager, because everything it did was new at the time. Now, even if you ignore the technological advances that have made realistic-looking game worlds standards, the sheer cringeworthy thinness of the plot and characters make it harder to love. I adored a lot of JRPGs, fromSkies of ArcadiatoDragon Quest, that I simply wouldn’t be able to enjoy now due to their slow pace (and the interminable repetitive random battles).Also, in the 00s we all gave a lot of games a pass for being technically interesting or ambitious, when they were also juvenile and/or sexist. I’m thinking especially of 2005’sIndigo Prophecyhere (Fahrenheit in the US), a game that was certainly interesting but also rife with racial and gender stereotyping that made me want to cringe myself inside out when I replayed it a few years later. I remember defending an obscure Japanese horror-ish game that put all the female characters into a strip-club room as a reward for finishing the game, because it was otherwise novel. These days, with the benefit of age and experience, my tolerance for casual sexism is basically zero – and quite a few games in my PS2-era collection would now be more difficult to enjoy.If you’ve got a question for Question Blockemail us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Scott Mills, who fronts BBC Radio’s Eurovision coverage, said last month on his breakfast show, “we can’t talk aboutMalta’s one, at all” owing to the BBC’s rules on the use of strong language. “We definitely can’t play a clip of it … ever.”Broadcasters participating in the world’s largest live music event have until 10 March to formally submit their entries and are usually given a further deadline to modify their entry if a song is considered in breach of the EBU’s code of conduct.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then my father wrote to the Guardian …Britain in the 90s seemed to see homosexuality as something shameful. My father told the world how proud he was of meSam DickWed 5 Mar 2025 01.55 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 04.22 ESTShareGrowing up gay in the 90s was incredibly difficult. In 1998, I was 16 and living in east London, only out to my parents, my sister and a few friends I had made online. I’d already been the target of homophobic bullying and didn’t feel safe coming out to the rest of the world.I was lucky to live in a loving and supportive home. It was also a political household;my dad, in particular, was always active in expressing his beliefs and principles. Both my parents stood for things, cared about others – and they cared about me.At school, however, jokes about Aids were a daily occurrence and I felt deeply alone. One so-called friend told me: ‘If you turn out to be gay, I will beat it out of you.’ Like many victims of bullying, I sometimes assumed that I was the problem.When I came out to my parents, it was at a time when, in Britain, gay men were still discussed as a threat to the concept of family. Politicians and others openly viewed being gay as shameful, wrong or dangerous. While I knew my parents loved and supported me, I still believed I could not have as good a life as other people. I could be turned away from shops, targeted with violence, orlegally sacked from my job. And even when I tried to balance this with the idea of finding someone to love, I knew that any relationship I had would not be seen asworthy of legal equalityby the state or much of society. Amid all the love and support my mum showed me when I came out, she also said, sadly: “Your life will be hard.”It was in this context that a feature was published in the Guardian about parents who expressed their sadness, regret, disappointment or shame about having gay kids. It wasn’t malicious – it was just real people sharing their stories – but it felt like yet another example of the shame associated with people like me. And it clearly hit a nerve with my dad.About a week later, on 13 July 1998, my dad placed a copy of the paper in front of me and asked me to turn to the letters page. I saw an anonymous letterheaded “Our gay son” and, with a lump in my throat, I read: “The reaction of the parents in your article in no way reflects that of my wife and I when our son came out to us earlier this year. Our reaction was one of pride and respect. He came out to us in an intelligent, mature and sensitive way and demonstrated an understanding of his sexuality way beyond that of many heterosexual men and women of his age … his parents have no expectations of him other than he is the person he is, and that happens to be a gay young man.”View image in fullscreenAlec Dick’s letter to the Guardian, July 1998.Photograph: Courtesy of Sam DickI knew it was my dad who had written it and, while I already knew my parents loved and supported me, it showed that they cared deeply about other people’s children too. I felt immense pride – and also a sense of possibility. It was the first time I had seen someone close to me take action on behalf of lesbian, gay and bisexual people, and it was inspiring.Until that point, my number one subject at school had been geography. I took great reassurance in seeing the world as rocks and rivers, devoid of morality, social pressures and people. But, after reading the letter, my perspective quickly began to shift. I started thinking about politics, which I went on to study at university, and how I could make a difference in society.My dad taught me to present a the case for a better, different world. It became the driving force behind my career, kicking off two decades of campaigning for social change. In that time, I’ve tackled important and controversial social issues, from equal marriage and assisted dying to loneliness and wealth inequality.Today, I work as the codirector of campaigns for the NGOGlobal Witness, helping to uncover the systems of power and exploitation that drive the climate catastrophe. My job is to push for the real and lasting change our planet urgently needs.The fight to protect LGBTQ+ rights from Trump – podcastRead moreMy career has not always been easy. Fighting for justice takes its toll, and success isn’t guaranteed. In my more hopeless moments, I still call my dad for advice. More than 25 years after he wrote that letter, his principled, pragmatic and compassionate approach continues to encourage me.My personal life has not been easy either, but it is nowhere near as hard as we all feared, not least because of my wonderful parents. Recently, my dad told me that the letter was written to me, and it just happened to be published in a newspaper. I don’t think he imagined it would change the course of my life – but he still keeps it safely in his desk drawer.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Tell me everything.Well, arecent piece in the Cutdetailed the rise in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy – a treatment where balding men can have their blood centrifuged and injected into their scalps.Amazing! And it works?Again, for the sake of argument …This sounds ominous.Sure,according to Harvard Healththe treatment is painful and expensive. And you usually need to supplement it with a daily regimen of pills. And you need to be injected every six months. And if you stop either the injections or the pills, your hair will fall out again. But still …So you have to enter into an expensive lifetime contract to get your hair back?Well, about that. PRP doesn’t so much make your hair grow back as stop you from balding any further. Anyway …This sounds awful.Hey, there are always transplants.Are they better?That depends on your definition of cure. A transplant doesn’t make your hair grow back either, but instead painstakingly moves follicles from the part of your head that does have hair to the part of your hair that doesn’t. Again, it’s very expensive, but this time there’s the added risk of you ending up on a TikTok compilation of bald men with bleeding heads stumbling around Turkish airports.I thought you said they’d cured baldness.Oh please, you must be wise to this by now. Every few years we say that we’re on the brink of curing baldness with some madcap new technology, and every few years insecure men hand over the entire contents of their bank accounts to try it out.Every few years?Sure. This publication alone heralded upcoming baldness cures in2023and2018and2016and2011and2007and1999and …OK, OK, I get it. But why are men so keen on finding a cure?Because nobody wants to be bald, do they? If you have hair you’re still young and virile, but if you’re bald you look like an old, angry potato. Plus, study after study points out the negative impact that baldness has on men, from their self-confidence to their romantic and career prospects. Wouldn’t you do something about it if you could?Not if it was painful and expensive.Shh, there’s money to be made here. As one PRP provider put it: “The hair-growth industry is almost like where skincare was 10 to 15 years ago.”You mean they’ve figured out how to panic people into overspending on products that don’t actually work very well?Now you’re getting it.

It’s a dish that originates from the royal kitchens of the Begum of Bhopal in the 19th century and, as such, has always been a bit of a culinary statement – both a creative experiment and a showcase of refined taste, though, despite its unusual spice profile, the method is simple and unpretentious. The moreish crunch of the cabbage side, meanwhile, lifted by crisp cashews and warming spices, balances the chicken’s tangy richness beautifully.Acharimurgh, or north Indian chicken curry (pictured top)Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minServes66 tbsp vegetable oil1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced¼ tsp each fennel, black mustard, nigella and cumin seeds⅛ tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp garlic paste1 tbsp ginger paste1kg skinless chicken thighs on the bone½ tsp ground turmeric1 tsp ground coriander½ tsp kashmiri red chilli powder1kg plain yoghurt1 tsp salt(or to taste)1 fresh green chilli, slit lengthways down the middle, plus a little extra green chilli, chopped, to garnish1 handful chopped coriander leavesPut the oil in a deep saucepan on a high heat. Test it’s hot enough by dropping in a piece of onion – if it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. Add all the onion, fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until golden brown, then lift out with a slotted spoon and spread on a plate to cool.Add all the spice seeds to the hot oil in the pan, then, once the mustard seeds pop, stir in garlic and ginger pastes, and cook for 30 seconds or so, until they smell fragrant – if they start to stick to the pan, deglaze and loosen by adding a few splashes of cold water. Add the chicken thighs, fry for a few minutes on all sides, just to sear, then stir in the three ground spices.Crush the cooled caramelised onions, stir them into the yoghurt, then add to the chicken pan. Add the salt, bring to a boil, then cover and leave to simmer for 30 minutes. Uncover, add the whole slit chilli and cook, stirring, for another 30 minutes, until the sauce is really clinging to the meat.Adjust the seasoning to taste, garnish with the chopped chilli and coriander, and serve with riceor rotis, salad and the following cabbage stir-fry.Cabbage with tomatoes and cashewsView image in fullscreenAsma Khan’s cabbage with tomatoes and cashews.This versatile dish pairs beautifully with rice or flatbreads, adds a satisfying texture to all kinds of wraps and works very well as an all vegetable side, too.Prep10 minCook40 minServes64 tbsp vegetable oil150g raw cashews2 dried red chillies1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp ground turmeric400g tinned chopped tomatoes, or 3–4 fresh tomatoes, chopped½ tsp chilli powder1½ tsp salt750g white cabbage,trimmed and shredded2 tbsp fresh dill, or other fresh herbs, chopped, to garnishPut the oil in a wok or deep pan over a medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the cashews, stir-fry until lightly browned all over, then lift out with a slotted spoon (discard any burnt nuts, because they’ll be unpleasantly bitter).Reheat the oil in the pan over a medium heat, then add the dried chillies and cumin seeds, and stir until the chillies darken. Add the turmeric, then stir in the tomatoes, chilli powder and salt. Turn down the heat to medium-low and leave to cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the oil separates at the edges of the tomato mixture.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Add the shredded cabbage, mixing it in so it gets coated with the spiced tomatoes, then turn up the heat to medium-high, cover the pan and cook for four to five minutes if the cabbage is finely shredded, and for six to eight minutes for thicker slices. Take off the lid, then stir-fry for two minutes more.Check the seasoning, then stir in the roasted cashews, garnish with the chopped dill and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Monsoon: Delicious Indian Recipes for Every Day and Season, by Asma Khan, published on 6 March by DK RED at £26.

There’s a flintlock pistol in his belt and he’s dressed in tattered rags. Is it a tribute to locals who survived a night out in Kirkcaldy? No, there is a weathered plaque that I can just read: “In memory of Alexander Selkirk, mariner, the original of Robinson Crusoe …”Fife walkThis is the site of a cottage where Selkirk was born in 1676. And suddenly a long-forgotten melody starts to play in my head, asweeping lyrical tunethat I haven’t heard in half a century. It’s shocking to discover what treasure lies forgotten between my ears, this being the theme from The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, a German television series that was aired in the UK at the time of the Apollo 11 moon landings (and repeatedly until 1982). From the moment I saw it, I gave up plans to be an astronaut and decided to travel the world instead.And now here I am back where it all began for Selkirk/Crusoe in Lower Largo in Fife. What is he looking at across the Firth of Forth? Perhaps it’s the Isle of May, now a national nature reserve, or Bass Rock lighthouse where I went aged five on my first ever sea voyage, little suspecting that my hero was staring across the waves towards me.View image in fullscreenThe home in Lower Largo of Alexander Selkirk, inspiration for Robinson Crusoe.Photograph: Stephen Bridger/AlamyI am about to start out on a four-day section of theFife coastal path, a 116-mile route that connects the firths of Forth and Tay and takes in some of Scotland’s finest seaside villages. It is also one part of theBeach of Dreams, a UK-wide coastal arts festival taking place from 1 May- June.Leaving Mr Selkirk behind, I set out around a broad bay where the tide is retreating, bringing vast numbers of wading birds to feed on the exposed patches of sand. One of the joys of this walk, I am about to discover, is how the marine life subtly shifts and changes with each day. Here I’ve got great piles of razor clam shells and limpets, tomorrow will be yellow periwinkles, cockles and mussels.Past the wooded point and a fine field of kale perched on a cliff, I come to one of the highlights: theElie Chain Walkat Kincraig Point. No one seems quite sure how this unusual, and adventurous, coastal feature started, but now there are eight shiny steel chains to help any nimble person clamber down, across and up the jagged coastal cliffs. It should only be done around low tide and, be warned, one chain is rather short and attached to a wobbly bolt. The reward is access to a secret world of crashing waves, sea arches and mysterious caves.Beyond lies the village of Elie, a beguiling mix of ancient stone houses and fun: there are foil surfers out on the water and abeachside saunawith a curl of wood smoke emerging from the chimney. I book myself in. There is also an excellent pub, theShip Inn, famed for hosting cricket matches on the sands.At the sauna, I meet Judith Dunlop who kickstarted the hot box (portable sauna) on the beach idea around here, siting a converted horse trailer in her home town of Elie. Now she has two further locations up the coast andcompetitorstoo. It is possible, I calculate, to walk most days and finish, or start, with a dip in the sea and a sauna.View image in fullscreenWalkers tackle the Elie Chain Walk.Photograph: Richard Newton/AlamyNext day, I press on through the fishing villages of St Monans and Pittenweem (good cafe stops available atBowhouseandCocoa Tree) to meet artistJulie Brookat Anstruther. Julie wants to take me to see the location of an artwork called Tide Line that she is soon to begin building. Along with several other commissioned artworks around the UK, it will be a feature of the Beach of Dreams festival.Anstruther itself is a hive of activity and well worth exploring. By the recently refurbishedDreel Halls, a historic church and town hall, there are two shell houses, buildings rendered with millions of sea shells.Anstruther connects to another fishing village, Cellardyke, where there is a fine tidalswimming pool(and a sauna), and about a mile further along Julie points across the rocky inter-tidal zone, now being exposed by the retreating sea. “We’ll build it in there, a pathway that leads out into an area that is normally too slippery and hazardous for most people.”I can imagine a youthful Alexander Selkirk, dabbling his bare toes in the waves and dreaming of escapeWork will be carefully timed, ending each day with the arrival of the sea. We wander out and Julie is immediately assessing certain rocks for their possibilities. “It’s amazing what can be done with levers and human strength – I think I might build a causeway across that pool and skirt that outcrop.”Her enthusiasm and vision are infectious. I want to get started immediately. “Will you bring the path back to land over there?” I ask, ever practical. A path must lead somewhere.But Julie shakes her head. “No. It will end in the sea.” That’s the artist. A path can go nowhere, and still mean something. I can imagine a youthful Alexander Selkirk standing on the last stone, dabbling his bare toes in the waves and dreaming of escape.View image in fullscreenIt’s possible to finish each day’s walk with a sauna, like the one at Elie beach, made from a converted horse box.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyEventually, I say goodbye to Julie and head along the coast, reaching the pretty harbour of Crail and a hot bowl of soup in the Harbour gallery and tearoom. After an uninspiring yomp through a holiday park, I’m soon back to wild rugged rocks and the mournful keening of curlews. There are some great tidal pool dips to be had, but now I’m sauna-adapted, I can’t face it. Around the point of Fife Ness, the coastal scenery changes subtly again. The drifts of sea shells are covered in kelp, testament to the power of the north-easterly gales.At Kingsbarns I enjoy dinner at theInn, a short walk up from Cambo Sands beach – where there is yet another lovely sauna. The Inn is a successful example of a community-enterprise, well-run and friendly with good food and rooms.My final walk takes me into St Andrews for a last sauna at East Sands with a sociable crowd of locals. A British sauna culture seems to be emerging: chattier than the Germans, hotter than the Scandinavians, and definitely not naked. I wonder what Selkirk would have made of it. In 1709, when he was finally rescued from his Pacific island after over four years, his rescuer, Captain Woodes Rogers, noted: “How much a plain and temperate way of living conduces to the Health of the Body and the Vigour of the Mind … one may see that Solitude and Retirement from the World is not such an insufferable state of life.” Once back in Scotland, Selkirk missed his lonely island, but found a spot that reminded him of it: at Kincraig Point where the Elie Chain Walk now exists.Further information atVisit Scotland.Sawdaysoffers accommodation along the route of the walk atThe Crusoe in Lower Largo(from£123),the Ship Innin Elie (from£100) andMaybell Cottagein Pittenweem (from£175).Inn at Kingsbarnshas doubles from £175.

They’re sweet like scallops, but harder to overcook, and have no clammy shell grit to purge. They’re a mollusc with plenty of shell-confidence! And, with a mirepoix (a French-style base of sauteed onion, carrot and celery) under your belt,you’llhave a confidence boost too, with a classic flavour builder for midweek.You can usually pick up a kilo of mussels for under $10, which is great bang-for-buck. A good rule of thumb is 500g of mussels per eater, as much of the weight is in the shell. They’re super sustainable, earning a “better choice” nod fromAustralia’s Good Fish guide, since their farming process requires no additional inputs, and can even help cleanse coastlines and waterways. They’re speedy too; you can bang out a mussel meal in as long as it takes to prepare the rest of the ingredients.View image in fullscreenIngredients at the ready. A good rule of thumb is to use 500g of mussels per person.Photograph: Eugene HylandTo prep a mussel, grab on to the overhanging beard and pull it around the shell towards the hinge. The beard should snap right off. You shouldn’t need to rinse too heavily in preparation for the pot, as most commercially farmed mussels are kept relatively tidy for sale, but if you do need to scrape off any stubborn barnacles you can use a vegetable scrubbing brush on them under a running tap.View image in fullscreenScrub up! Scrape off stubborn barnacles with a veggie brush.Photograph: Eugene HylandSome people say “never eat a mussel that doesn’t open” but I’d use your senses before chucking – if it smells OK and looks right, give it a whirl. Mussels are sold live, so to check if they are fresh before cooking press the semi-shut shell between thumb and forefinger; if it continues to move like a soft-close drawer, you know it’s good to go.The base in this dish is an exercise in building flavour using veg and time in the pan, as you’d expect for any soup or stew. But another advantage of mussels is that they cook so fast and release such a flavoursome broth that even if youdouse water over stock, or use alternative vegetables, you’re guaranteed a good time – in next to no time. You’ll have dinner on the table as quickly as you can dice. If you have a local grocer who makes up their own raw soup veg, you’re welcome to pick up a mix to hurry things along even further. Though, I should add that a good meditative brunoise (the French word for a fine dice) is a welcome panacea for a busy head.View image in fullscreenFlex your mussels. Add them to the pan when the veggies are tender but not falling apart.Photograph: Eugene HylandView image in fullscreenRip and dip: Serve with crusty bread and lemon wedges.Photograph: Eugene HylandAlice Zaslavsky’s mirepoix mussels – recipeServes42 tbsp extra virgin olive oil(plus extra for drizzling)25g butter1 brown onion, finely diced1 celery rib, finely diced½ fennel, finely diced (with fennel fronds for garnish)1 medium carrot, finely diced2 large kipfler potatoes, finely diced3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely sliced2 bay leavesPinch of sugar1/2 cup white wine1 cup (250ml) good quality vegetable stock(or water)1 cup water2kg mussels, cleaned and debearded1⁄2 cup fresh parsley, roughly choppedCrusty bread, to serve1 lemon, cut into wedgesHeat extra virgin olive oil and butter in a large, lidded heavy-based pan on medium heat until they’re foamy and friendly.Midweek mashup: Alice Zaslavsky’s recipe for smashed green falafel flatbreadsRead moreAdd in the onion, celery and fennel, pop the lid on and let the veg cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.While cooking, dice the carrot and potato, then add these along with the sliced garlic, bay leaves and sugar to the pan and cook until you can smell the garlic, about three to four minutes. You want all of the vegetables to soften and smell heavenly (if they’re starting to brown, splash in a tablespoon of water and drop the heat a little).Once everything is sufficiently softened, take off the lid, splosh in the white wine and crank the heat to cook off the alcohol and reduce the liquid by half. Add the stock and one cup of water. Cook down the liquid on a medium-high heat until the carrots and potatoes are tender but not falling apart – about 10 more minutes.Drain the mussels of any excess juice, crank the heat, and tip the lot into the hot pan. They will instantly release more juice to make a deliciously deep and briny broth. Place the lid back on and shake the pan occasionally for four to five minutes or until all of the mussels open.Taste the broth for seasoning and then scatter in the fresh parsley and fennel fronds and finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Place into deep serving bowls and serve with crusty bread and lemon wedges.Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkYou've got thisAustralian lifestyleFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Priorities include dismantling government, targeting “culture war” issues – particularly abortion – and advancing school privatisation.In Virginia, for example, donors Thomas Peterffy and Jeff Yass contributed significantly to Governor Glenn Youngkin’s political action committee (Pac)Spirit of Virginia. Peterffy gave $3m while Yass added $2m. Spirit of Virginia spent more than $8m supporting Republican candidates in the 2023 Virginia general assembly elections.Democratic state house leader Don Scott wasquoted by the Axios websiteas saying that Republicans were relying on “nameless, faceless, out-of-state mega-donors who have been pouring millions into the Commonwealth to push right-wing policies with no regard to what Virginians actually want”.In Michigan, the DeVos family, including former education secretaryBetsy DeVos, donated more than $4.4m to state Republican candidates and causes in 2024. More than $1m combined went to the Michigan house and senate Republican Pacs.The DeVos family is known for promoting “school-choice policies”, specifically the expansion of charter schools. TheBridge Michigannews site reported “no individual has shaped school policy as much as Betsy DeVos”, contributing to Michigan having “some of the nation’s highest concentrations of charter schools run by for-profit companies”.InWisconsin, Diane Hendricks and Elizabeth Uihlein contributed a combined $7m to Republican legislative campaign committees in 2024. Hendricks has a long history of influencing Wisconsin politics, including pushing for “right-to-work” legislation. The Uihleins have backed efforts to make it harder to receive unemployment benefits, oppose Medicaid expansion and create barriers to voting.InPennsylvania,Yass, who is the state’s wealthiest billionaire, funded Pacs that reportedly spent nearly $4.4m to unseat Pennsylvania house Democrats. Yass-affiliated Pacs supported candidates who sponsored a near-total abortion ban. Since the 2018 cycle, these Pacs gave “$370,000 to bill sponsors and cosponsors” of such legislation.Yass also prioritises spending public funds on private education and is Pennsylvania’s biggest “school choice” donor. Hetold Philadelphia Magazinelast year that it would be a “good thing” if public schools “shut down”, adding: “There is no possible way a government monopoly could be a better approach to schools than market competition.”Republicans in Pennsylvania pushed a constitutional amendment to ban abortion in 2021 and 2022 but without success.In Arizona,Earl “Ken” Kendrick(owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team) and his family contributed more than $200,000 to Republican legislative candidates and Pacs during the 2024 cycle. The Kendrick family supported the retention of far-right, anti-choice judges on the state’s supreme court. Legislative Republicans referred a proposal to the ballot to attempt to make these positions lifetime appointments.‘Partisan politics’: how efforts to overturn the Johnson amendment could upend campaign financeRead moreState legislative chambers, once regarded as sleepy backwaters, have become partisan battlegrounds in recent years as they have a huge impact on issues ranging from book banks to transgender rights to voting laws.On an otherwise disastrous election night last November, Democratsheld their own at state level, emerging with more legislative majorities than they managed in 2016 or 2020. In Pennsylvania, for example, they held off a red wave to defend a one-seat majority in the state house.But that appears to be spurring on a small group of super-rich donors aiming to reshape state-level politics with a focus on issues including abortion, education and labour rights. Critics say such contributions raise questions about the role of money in politics and the influence of billionaires on the democratic process.Bernie Sanders, an independent senator currently on a “Fighting Oligarchy Tour” across the country,told last year’sDemocratic national convention in Chicago: “Billionaires in both parties should not be able to buy elections, including primary elections. For the sake of our democracy we must overturn the disastrous Citizens United supreme court decision and move toward public funding of elections.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsUS political financingRepublicansSuper PacsVirginiaWisconsinMichiganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about her battle for survivors’ rights, and the ambition that is taking her into spaceWed 5 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 10.17 ESTShareBehind a hospital curtain, under strip lighting, with a specialist nurse and a rape crisis volunteer at her side, Amanda Nguyen lay dazed and bruised. Her body and soul hurt in places she didn’t know could hurt. She felt icy cold but at the same time burning hot – she was, she said, a cold slab of meat while her insides were liquid magma. Yet from her hospital bed, she was expected to process information and make decisions that could change her life.Just hours earlier, Nguyen, then 22, had been living her dream. “I was a student at Harvard, three months from graduation with the rest of my life in front of me,” she says. Her head was buzzing with two possible futures: her lifelong ambition of becoming an astronaut – astrophysics was her subject and she’d interned at Nasa aged 18 – or a career with the CIA, as a spy. She had been approached by a recruiter and started the process of onboarding. Then, a frat party had ended in rape – one so planned and precise that she is convinced her rapist had done it before – and here she was in the early hours, at a Harvard teaching hospital, her body suddenly a crime scene.The nurse wanted to know if she would be pressing charges. Did Nguyen want evidence to be collected, a rape kit completed, did she feel able to undergo further intrusive procedures? And if so, would it be done in her name (how might this affect her future with Nasa or the CIA?) or did she want a “Jane Doe rape kit” with no name attached? An anonymous rape kit would be stored in case one day she chose to initiate a police report – the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape in Massachusetts is 15 years. Nguyen went for this option, then there were many tests done – blood count, microbiology tests, chemistry tests, a pregnancy test – and many pills given (about 30, including antibiotics, and hepatitis B and HIV prevention medication). Finally, she was discharged with a bill – $4,863.79 – as well as 65 pieces of paper: prescriptions and their side-effects, forms to sign, leaflets, a medical letter for university-work extensions. It was only later, back in her bedroom, that she found buried in them a devastating, nonsensical piece of information: all rape kits would be destroyed after six months.‘I was so happy to be living that dream’ … Nguyen at Harvard University.Photograph: Courtesy of Amanda Nguyen“The statute of limitations is 15 years because it recognises that trauma takes time to process,” says Nguyen. “It allows a victim to revisit that justice. It gives grace to the experience of trauma. But destroying the rape kit after six months prevents a survivor from being able to access vital evidence. I learned that those kits aren’t even being processed. Why would I go through this invasive procedure for it to be destroyed before it’s even tested? In murder cases, cold cases are solved years later because evidence is not destroyed. So why was this particular crime that predominantly impacts women the one where evidence was chucked out?”In the days that followed, Nguyen was also informed by her rape crisis volunteer that a prosecution would take on average two to three years and there was a 1% conviction rate. Was she ready to put her life on hold, freeze her applications and ambitions, for something with a 99% chance of failure? “The system was stacked against me, it felt rigged, and that felt like a greater betrayal to me than being raped,” she says. The person she had been just days before had vanished. “It was an elemental chemical transformation,” she says. “The life had gone out of me. I felt like a skeleton of that vivacious, happy young student. I was like a dried-up leaf and would never get back to being green and young.” She quietly laughs. “But I could transform into something else. It could become an ignition.”Nguyen’s memoir, Saving Five, tells the story of that ignition. Ultimately, she built a team of survivors into a powerfulgrassroots movement, Rise, and together they wrote a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, which included the right not to have your rape kit destroyed until the statute of limitations expired, and the right not to have to pay for it to be carried out. (For what other crime would you pay for evidence collection?) President Obama signed it into federal law in October 2016 – three years after Nguyen was raped. Since then, Rise has worked to guarantee the same protections in each state – it has successfully passed 91 laws over the last decade – and is also pursuing an international treaty that gives universal jurisdiction for rape cases. (This exists for drug crime, murder and torture but not sexual violence.) In 2019, Nguyen was nominated for the Nobel peace prize and in 2022, she was one of Time magazine’s women of the year. Nguyen is also an astronaut now, and will become the first Vietnamese woman to go to space when she flies onthe forthcoming Blue Origin rocket launch this spring.Saving Five is an account of trauma, rage and activism, and also a kind of guide through grief, which shows how every stage propelled Nguyen and served a purpose. More than this, though, the memoir goes further back to reveal how Nguyen became the person she is. If every student at Harvard is “driven”, then Nguyen was turbocharged. She arrived on her first day at college with her arm in a cast, having spent the previous night in hospital after an explosion of violence in her suburban California home. While other students hugged proud parents goodbye, Nguyen had police officers beside her and a no trespass order in place against her father.Her original plan for Saving Five included none of this. “I wasn’t going to write about my parents at all,” she says. “The pivotal conversation that changed my entire trajectory was with Tara Westover, who wrote the memoirEducated. I asked her where she found the strength and bravery to write about people who had hurt her and who are still alive. She said: ‘If I can forgive them for my childhood, then they can forgive me for writing about it.’ I thought: ‘Wow. That’s right.’ I wanted to show the complicated nature of loving somebody who has hurt you, and also how surviving my childhood is the reason I had the skills to survive a broken criminal justice system.”Nguyen’s parents met in the US, having both arrived as refugees after the fall of Saigon. They had left their country on small boats with no belongings and without most of their family members, using celestial navigation – their stories made the night sky magical for Nguyen from a young age. Nguyen’s father grew into a violent, angry, abusive man. While some childhood homes are marked by children’s heights noted on the wall, Nguyen says that hers was marked with head-shaped dents in the plaster. Entire days were spent with her mother in the local library or bookstore while they waited for her father to “cool down”. Before re-entering their home, her mum would always leave Nguyen outside while she checked it was safe. Nguyen would count the stars as she waited. “The idea of going to space meant an extra layer of promise to myself,” she says, “that I would find a way to escape.”View image in fullscreen‘The idea of going to space was a promise to myself that I would find a way to escape’ … Nguyen during astronaut trainingHarvard was her first haven as well as her whole future. “I had no safety net,” she says. “If I didn’t win that internship, if I didn’t get that scholarship, I had nothing to fall back on. That wiring pushed me to succeed – because success was my safety.” Nguyen didn’t go home in the holidays. She remained on campus and was given staff access. “I really did feel like Harry Potter because I lived there,” she says. “I had the Marauder’s Map! I could explore on my own terms; I got to know all the staff, the janitors, everyone. I was so happy to have built this life, with a community of friends and to be living that dream. That’s why what happened there, and the institutional betrayal that followed, felt all the more hurtful.”From the moment she learned that her rape kit would be destroyed in six months’ time, Nguyen lived with a countdown. “It felt as if there was a clock above my head and I was never released from it,” she says. “It wasn’t in the background. It was a thundering tick that I heard every single day.” She wasn’t ready to press charges – she was barely able to leave her building – but nor could she stand the thought of losing all chance of future justice.While slowly picking up her life, graduating, moving to Washington DC and undergoing long, secretive recruitment rounds with the CIA, Nguyen was simultaneously on a mission to save her rape kit. She was cold calling and emailing forensic labs, trying to locate it. Cambridge police directed her to Harvard University police who directed her back to Cambridge police. Finally, days before the six months were up, the kit was located and the lab agreed to extend the deadline. However, this guarantee couldn’t be emailed or posted to her. Instead, Nguyen had to fly from DC to Boston to pick up a piece of paper that said “request done and accepted”. After her initial relief, she realised that in six months’ time she’d have to do it all again.View image in fullscreenNguyen reacts after a resolution for sexual assault survivors is passed at the UNThough Nguyen had never seen herself as an activist, she was one now. She started out by sending a group email, with almost everyone she knew copied in, setting out what she wanted to change and why. The response was overwhelming. Friends offered to build a website, to calculate the economic impact; a Harvard law team helped draft the bill. However, it was the messages from survivors that stood out.Womenfrom across the country sent her their own stories. “They had experienced the terrible consequences of the criminal justice system being broken,” says Nguyen. One woman’s daughter had been raped and murdered by someone who had previously raped two other women. Their rape kits had been destroyed and never processed. “Maybe if they had, he would have been convicted and their daughter would have been saved,” says Nguyen. Another had been pursued by creditors demanding payment for her rape kit expenses. “Every one of the rights included in the bill was written for a woman on my team who had experienced the absolute tragedy of not having them.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m so excited to be part of this incredible, historic space flight’For Nguyen, this is key. “Although I don’t think there is a malicious legislator trying to make survivors jump through hoops,” she says, “I do think that there aren’t enough politicians and public servants who sit down with the communities they serve to work on these issues. If the people affected aren’t at the drafting table, then these huge gaps happen.” For this reason, Rise has also developed a 12-week training programme for activists who want to change the law and who come from the communities they wish to serve.Pushing through the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Rights Act took up all of Nguyen’s life. She withdrew her CIA application. “It was all-consuming,” she says. “I ate, slept and dreamed it, and could not go anywhere without talking about it. I’m not saying that’s healthy but it was certainly a major factor for the momentum.” While 99% of bills don’t make it through Congress, this one passed unanimously. Although the senior counsel from the Senate judiciary suggested calling it Amanda’s Law, Nguyen wanted it to represent all survivors. “When it was voted through, it felt almost like an out of body experience,” she says. “It felt like a curse was breaking.”In the years that followed, Nguyen got back to the life that had been derailed. She now fits Rise around her astronaut training. “I’m so excited to be part of this incredible, historic flight,” she says. One of her experiments in space will be around bleeding and menstruation – fluid absorption during different moments of gravity. “Historically, Nasa barred women from becoming astronauts and one of the reasons they cited the most was menstruation,” she says. “That’s why I’m doing it.”Whether or not she will access her rape kit and press charges is a decision for the future. The point is, she has kept the door open. “I’ve given myself time,” she says. “We’ve rewritten the law to give my future self that choice. I’m just so grateful I screamed and the world listened.”Saving Five: A Memoir of Hope by Amanda Nguyen is published by Headline Press (£20).

The carnival tradition dates tothe late 1700sand its origins are a swirl of intersections resulting in an annual celebration before the fast for the month of Lent. But within that is something far richer and layered about enslaved populations using song, dance and costume to assert their own culture and folklore while mocking the pomposity and wealth of plantation owners.As an outsider, it struck me how much of carnival’s hallmarks are linked to defiance in the face of oppression – either on the part of enslavers or colonisers – or innovation to circumvent that oppression. Calypso became the way isolated enslaved populations from west Africa communicated and secretly jeered at the authorities.The steel panevolved out of an attempt to get around a British ban on drumming, and so people began to use biscuit tins to make music, and the idea for using metal was born. Pick a thread of almost any aspect of carnival and it leads to a history of continuous reassertion of identity and the right to mischief and pleasure amid repression and erasure.If there were ever an event that exemplifies the enduring connections in the diaspora, it is carnival. Whether it is in the music, dance, or rituals, west Africa and its culture isembedded in the Caribbeandespite attempts to efface it. “African presence has been the victim of systematic erasure, elision and misrepresentation,”wrote the late Dr Louis Regis, an expert on calypso.‘You can seeAfricain everything’View image in fullscreenThe Nigerian-American afrobeats star Davido (left) on stage at Trini carnival with the Tobagonian soca veteran Machel Montano.Photograph: Maria NunesCalypso music has roots in kaiso, which originated in west Africa in general and Nigeria in particular. These links are being rediscovered. Natricia, reporting from Port of Spain, has been struck by how much the African connection is clear this year. The presence of African artists is remarkable, she tells me. Machel Montano, long regarded as the the king of soca and a cultural ambassador for Trinidad and Tobago,performed with the Nigerian-American singer-songwriter Davido, while the soca starNailah Blackman hosted the Nigerian artist DJ Obi.Natricia says: “There was talk about how there’s so much connection with west Africa, even in how we move and we dance.” Randall Mitchell, the minister of tourism, culture and arts said he, too, was struck by the similarities during a recent trip to Ghana. “The way we dance, it’s very west African. They dance from their waist down. In east Africa, they dance with their chest,” Mitchell told Natricia. “Our ancestral heritage, we trace it to west Africa, and that’s where that music is from and there’s always been that natural connection.” In theCaribbean, we call it wining, Natricia tells me, referring to the signature lower-body winding movement. “There is that direct connection,” she says. “All these soca artists are now looking to Afrobeats. You can see Africa in everything.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wasevident in the African Union summit last month, where the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, called for solidarity. Natricia also notes how African and Caribbean countries are joining forces on issues such as reparations anddecolonising the education system in Jamaica, which was working with African organisations to update the curriculum. From politics to education to music, Natricia says she is seeing an alignment between the Caribbean and Africa.Enduring connection and resistanceView image in fullscreenA ‘blue devil’ masquerader, a tradition that goes back hundreds of years.Photograph: Maria NunesThis feels like the start of something exciting, a new centre of cultural and political influence drawing onsynergies between the two regions. Natricia agrees and attributes this to the fact that we simply all now know more about each other. She shares a story of how, when she was growing up in St Vincent, she was exposed to mostly American shows. Her experience echoed my own – andinspired the name of this newsletter– listening to the long-wave radio and not hearing anything about Africa or the diaspora.Natricia says: “Back then, there was little exposure or understanding of what Africa is.” But things have changed. The rise of social media, music and videos going viral through instant messaging and sharing, coupled with the expansion and diversification of sources of entertainment, have made previously remote cultures recognisable and familiar. She describes it as the second stage of a regional coming together that began with Bob Marley and Rastafarianism – key aspects of Jamaican culture that were “important in building the link between the Caribbean and Africa”.She adds: “More and more, the average person on the street can see: ‘Hang on a minute, they move like us!’” There is something profoundly moving about this long arc of history bending towards people who were fractured and removed from one another, and then, centuries later, finding one another again. It made me quite emotional thatcarnival has kept a flambeau alive, in its ritual and music and dance, of the places that so many people had been wrenched from. Yet, hundreds of years later, those people still recognised each other.That sense of carnival as a space where people persevere despite adversity endures to this day, Natricia says.Trinidad and Tobago is in a state of emergencyafter a spike in crime, but on the ground Natricia has found that this year’s carnival to be “a show of resilience and not being held hostage” to escalating violence. Ultimately, it’s been a place where people can simply breathe.At the end of our conversation, not only did I feel that I had become immersed in an epic cultural and political event, but that I also had met a people in the diaspora with whom I shared an understanding that despite distance and the often heaviness of life and politics, sometimes you just need to exhale. It was a need that I could recognise, even though I am from east Africa and therewe move only the top of our bodies.Tap inRamadanis upon us, and if you observe the month, we would love to hear about your favourite foods, rituals and special moments – wherever you are in the world.

Just six months ago, these same roads had been a battleground littered with bullet casings and bodies, as students fought against armed police to bring down the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina.This time, students whosuccessfully overthrew the prime minsterwere here for a different purpose: to launch their Jatiya Nagorik or National Citizens’ party (NCP) in the presence of thousands of supporters.“During the July revolution there were slogans of ‘Who will be the alternative?’” said the new party’s leader, Nahid Islam, to loud cheers from the crowd. “Today, with this new party, we are offering the alternative.”In the six months since the student-led revolution toppled Hasina in early August, vast changes have taken place in Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel prize winning Bangladeshi economist, was brought back to head an appointed interim government tasked with restoring democracy, which was obliterated under Hasina’s oppressive government. Three student leaders, including Islam, were brought in by Yunus to serve as advisers to the interim government.‘A long way to go’: in revolution’s wake, questions linger over direction of the new BangladeshRead moreFreedom of speech returned to Bangladesh and political parties that had spent the 15 years of Hasina’s rule being routinely targeted were allowed to function freely once again.Initially, those in the Yunus government had spoken of being in power for several years, in order to see through their ambitious roster of reforms. However, mounting pressure has led him to announce that elections – promised to be free and fair, for the first time in decades – will probably take place in December.With Hasina’s Awami League party in tatters and its leadership in jail or hiding abroad, it is widely predicted that the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) will sweep any upcoming polls. However, the launch of the NCP by the student leaders – many of whom enjoy popularity among the country’s vast youth – could seismically shift the electoral landscape.‘We have had enough bloodshed’Speaking at the party’s launch, the newly appointed NCP leaders said their intention was nothing short of building a new Bangladesh, what they are calling a “second republic”. Among their ambitious pledges are creating an entirely new political system and rewriting the constitution, arguing that Bangladesh has never truly been free or democratic since independence in 1971.Getting justice, particularly for those killed during the July revolution, is also at the core of their purpose. A recent UN report on the July uprising found evidence of grave human rights abuses and possible crimes against humanity committed on Hasina’s orders as she tried to crush the unrest, with about 1,400 people killed.Among those who spoke at the party’s launch was Nowsher Ali, the father of six-year-old Zabir who was among those who died in the police violence. “We have had enough bloodshed,” he said. “I hope my country will be safer in the hands of this party.”View image in fullscreenThe National Citizens’ party (NCP), a new party born out of the July coup, debuts in Dhaka.Photograph: Habibur Rahman/ABACA/REX/ShutterstockIn his first interview since the NCP was launched, party leader Islam said there had been a demand for students to form their own political party since they toppled Hasina, but it had taken them several months to agree on what form it should take.“It’s important we have a voice in the development of a new democratic Bangladesh,” he said. “There is huge demand among the young people of this country for a political party which represents their views and demands. We were also worried that the fall of Hasina meant there was a power vacuum in the election, which would be problematic for the democratic process.”Islam said rewriting the constitution would be their primary focus, arguing that the current version – written after independence in 1971 and amended multiple times, including by Hasina – was not fit for purpose.Islam acknowledged there were challenges in their transformation from a motley crew of street fighting students with little political experience to an organised national party ready to contest a general election in a matter of months. Prior to the party’s launch, there were widespread reports of in-fighting, and the launch event was chaotic, beset with long delays and technical issues.“Of course it’s not easy,” he said. “We were a successful revolutionary force, now we want to be a democratic force. But right now, getting elected isn’t our primary goal. It’s more important we are a driving force behind the necessary reforms that need to happen.”Islam described his own role in the interim government as a “bittersweet journey” wherein Yunus had the right ideas of the necessary reforms for Bangladesh, but found himself up against a “resisting force” within the bureaucracy, which is still stacked with Hasina loyalists, making changes hard to implement.There has also been some unease around NCP in more liberal circles, with concerns raised over factions that appear to be aligned with more hardline Islamic elements, raising fears for the party’s vision of a secularised “second republic”. Since the fall of Hasina, there has been a notable surge in support for Islamist parties such as Jamaat-e-Islami, which were banned and routinely targeted under Hasina’s government. At the NCP launch event, Islam was repeatedly referred to as an “imam of democracy”.Islam pushed back against these allegations, describing them as propaganda meant to tarnish the party’s reputation. “Islam is the majority religion in Bangladesh and we are sensitive to that, we are sensitive to those values, but we do not want to create any extremist party or any pro-Islamic party. This is very clear.”The formation of the party could also pose problems for Yunus’s interim government. It is already seen as very close to the student leaders who invited Yunus back to lead the country. In an interview with the Guardian, Yunus said he was supportive of the students’ decision to form a party: “It’s a good thing, I always encourage young people to take the lead. That’s the only way we can create a new world.”While Yunus insisted there would be no compromise to the interim government’s neutrality, the senior BNP leader Amir Chowdhury said he had concerns otherwise. Islam resigned from his ministerial post to lead NCP but two other students remain in the government.“All eyes are on the government to maintain that neutrality and not be partisan to any sides,” said Chowdhury. “There are major suspicions that have called this neutrality into question. If they do not course correct quickly, then we will have to ask for a caretaker government for the electoral process which will be very unfortunate.”For all the questions over their experience and organisational capabilities, those within NCP’s executive committee said they had confidence the party would only get “bigger and bigger” in the buildup to the election.“Just wait, in three months we will have a presence at every local level across the country,” said Abdul Hannan, the NCP senior joint chief organiser. “It’s my strong belief we will form a significant part of the next government.”Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Black cultural center, where students would usually congregate and attend activities, would be full. And the month’s crown jewel would typically be a conference at the college for Black high schoolers in the area.But in July 2024, the center was shut down and turned into offices. The BSU budget, previously a guaranteed $11,000 a year to fund various gatherings to support the school’s marginal Black population, has been slashed. And the group has been forced to officially disassociate from the university in order to keep Black students at the center of their programming, all thanks to a new anti-DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) law passed in Utah last year.“It really hurts my soul to feel like we’re going backwards,” Parker, 19, told the Guardian. “We aren’t able to be as strong of a resource as we could be to Black students here.”View image in fullscreenThe BSU at the University of Utah.Photograph: Courtesy of Nevaeh ParkerBlack student unions at US colleges are fighting to stay in operation as state laws targeting DEI initiatives threaten their existence. Founded largely in the 1960s and 1970s, the campus groups support Black students at predominantly white universities by securing additional educational and financial resources, demanding more Black faculty, and building spaces for Black students to socialize. Activism by Black student unions helped spur the creation of African American studies programs across the US.BSUs are often the first line of response to racial discrimination on campus, organizing protests and holding universities accountable. Dozens of the groups held demonstrations after George Floyd’s murder in 2020.But anti-DEI bills are restricting what BSUs can do on campus, and how universities are legally allowed to support them. Since 2023, at least 11 states have passed laws targeting DEI initiatives in higher education. And conservative lawmakers in more than 30 stateshave also introducedsuch bills. At the federal level,Donald Trumpordered US universities and schoolsto eliminate DEI measures, threatening to withhold federal funding from those that do not comply.Trump administration gives schools deadline to cut DEI or lose federal fundsRead moreDEI programming at the collegiate level was initially conceived to support marginalized students, who are disproportionately affected by discrimination, financial hardship and feelings of alienation. But Republican legislators have argued that such initiatives are unfair and discriminate against white students. The flurry of anti-DEI bills, which have sharply increased since 2022, comes after the US supreme court struck down affirmative action, or the practice of race-conscious student admissions,in June 2023.Anti-DEI legislation and culture as a whole has had a chilling effect on colleges.Severaluniversitieshave cancelled scholarships specifically aimed at students of color. Multicultural andLGBTQ+ student centershavebeen shuttered. And staffoverseeing DEI initiativeshave been terminated or reassigned.In January 2024, the Utah legislature passed House bill 261, known as the Equal Opportunity Initiatives. The law prohibits state schools and public offices from engaging in “differential treatment”, essentially banning DEI efforts centered around a particular identity.In response to the new legislation, the University of Utah closed its Black cultural center, a major loss for Black students on campus looking for a physical location to socialize, especially asonly 3% of Utah students are Black. “It was a home away from home for a lot of students, especially those who lived out of state,” said Parker. “[The state of] Utah is less than 2% Black, [so] obviously, you are going to need spaces that are safe.”View image in fullscreenThe BSU at the University of Utah.Photograph: Courtesy of Nevaeh ParkerUtah’s BSU lost its adviser, as administrators either were reassigned to different parts of the university or resigned altogether. Notably, the words “diversity, equity and inclusion” cannot be used on any events sponsored by the university. “It basically took away our voice and took away what things that we wanted to talk about,” said Parker of the new limitations.In a comment to the Guardian, university officials said that identity-centered student groups are still able to gather as “affiliated” or “registered” organizations. “The University of Utah preserves and defends the rights of all registered student organizations – including the Black Student Union – to organize, gather and sponsor events on campus. Universities are marketplaces of diverse viewpoints and ideas, and that includes within our student clubs. Changing their status from ‘sponsored’ to ‘registered’ preserves their independence to continue working with a community of students, faculty and staff without limitation on their communication and activities.”The school said it has since opened the Center for Community and Cultural Engagement (CCE) and the Center for Student Access and Resources, which are “open to all students, whose dedicated staff still provide the same level of support – in advising, scholarship preparation, resource referrals and mentorship”. It has “redistributed the funds that were originally dedicated to BSU to efforts that work toward supporting all students”.Parker noted that the missions of these centers are broad and “not centered on student organization and affinity groups. It’s felt like their ability to support us in the ways that we need have not been met.”In October, the BSUpublicly announcedthat it would forgo official sponsorship in order to fight censorship attempts. Some events at Utah have had to be cancelled, Parker said, as students try and preserve funds they crowdsource across school years. The group has had to meet less as well, especially without a designated space. Club meetings are now held in various campus classrooms.Black students at the University of Alabama have also found themselves in a similar position. Their BSU had its funding revoked and was forced to relocate after a state bill restricting DEI went into effect in October 2024. “It’s been hard for freshmen especially to find their community and find like-minded people that look like them,” said Jordan Stokes, the BSU president.If the BSU wants university support, particularly funding for student events, the groups would be forced to “partner with another organization”, Stokes, 20, said, so the event is not solely focused on Black students and is in compliance with state law. The BSU has since successfully reached out to outside sponsors and alumni to finance Black History Month events, including its annual BSU week which features a number of celebratory gatherings. But that fundraising is finite compared to the university’s resources.The BSU office, which is now sitting empty, also held a significant amount of civil rights artifacts from past events at the university, said Stokes, and students are working to preserve its archives amid the closing. Posters highlighting important Black figures used to hang around the office. Yearbooks past were available for perusal.Trump threatens to pull federal funds for US schools allowing ‘illegal protests’Read moreNow, much of that history is sitting in storage, Stokes said. “We had writing on our wall and on the window where you could read about our history and everything,” she said. “It’s pretty sad for folks who [aren’t Black] to not see this history and learn and explore different cultures.” The University of Alabama did not reply to the Guardian’s request for comment.Both Parker and Stokes said that they are extremely frustrated with lawmakers who are going after their communities and other students of color. Watching the university comply with state demands has been hard, Parker added, especially amid concerns that directly protesting from the anti-DEI policies could have their organizations punished or removed from campus altogether.But both BSUs have continued hosting events to make sure that Black students feel supported. Attendance at BSU events has remained steady, said Stokes, with students becoming more interested in voting and learning more about these policies.Parker said that she and other BSU leaders are focusing on individuals, students who need the organization in whatever way it can exist. That means continuing to celebrate and gather, even under the threat of erasure. “It’s really sad,” she said, “that we as students, who are not politicians, have to take the responsibility to continuously fight every single day for our existence on campus.”Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesBlack US cultureUS educationRaceTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It allows companies to sue countries for lost profits caused by government action including corruption, seizure of assets or the introduction of health and environmental policies.The system wascreated in the 1960sby the World Bank. It was intended to give companies confidence to invest in poorer countries with weak political systems where they might not get a fair hearing in domestic courts.How does it work?The foreign company must put forward a case showing that the state has damaged its profits. Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals include ISDS clauses. Cases are heard by a private arbitration tribunal, and typically decided by a panel of three arbitrators – one chosen by the company, one chosen by the state and the third selected jointly.How much are the cases worth?Awards regularly amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, and some are in the billions. In 2024 the average amount awarded was$385m(£304m).  The average sum awardedis increasingand these payouts can make up a sizeable chunk of poorer countries' annual budgets.Who is involved?The fossil fuel and mining industries are the most litigious in the ISDS system, accounting formore than 30%of known cases.Most claims are brought by companies based in rich countries against the governments of developing countries. Companies registered in developed countries file81% of ISDS lawsuits, according to UN data, while developing countries have faced 62% of cases.How common is it?ISDS began as an obscure legal mechanism, averaging aboutone case a yearfor its first decade. Now, dozens are brought every year, with Guardian analysis finding more than 900 since 2013.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With litigation funders facing no risk of a counterclaim, and potential awards that now average more than $200m (£160m), legal experts warn that the system has become a “gambler’s nirvana” for hedge funds and specialist financiers.View image in fullscreenBurford Capital, the world’s largest litigation-finance firm, says it provides access to justice by supporting plaintiffs who otherwise could not afford legal action.Photograph: M4OS/AlamyWithin the sector, the debate is growing: advocates for third-party funding say it increases access to justice but critics, including arbitrators who rule on cases, are raising concerns that the growth of third-party funding is fuelling expensive and potentially frivolous cases at enormous cost to the public.A Guardian investigation, which analysed more than 1,400 cases launched against governments, found that ISDS cases have become far more common and lucrative. More than $120bn of public money was awarded to firms through ISDS courts, including at least $84bn to fossil fuel companies and $7.8bn awarded to mining companies.The true figures are likely to be far higher as companies often do not disclose the size of payouts they receive. The Guardian found that in 31% of cases where a payout or settlement was made, the size of the award was not disclosed.These cases have become an increasingly popular investment class for hedge funds and other investors, who back the legal action financially in exchange for a share of the final award. The Guardian identified at least 75 ISDS cases backed by third parties, although this too is likely to be a substantial underestimate: many treaties include no obligation to disclose third-party funding of cases, and the largest dispute-resolution body only began demanding disclosure in 2022.Half of all third-party funded cases were launched by investors from the US, Britain or Canada, and more than 50% were cases relating to fossil fuels or mining. More than three-quarters of cases were against developing countries, according to Guardian analysis of data provided byJus Mundi, a legal intelligence platform with access to the largest international law and arbitration database.Q&AHow did the Guardian analyse ISDS cases?ShowThe database created by the Guardian includes cases brought by companies against states (and, in a small number of cases, wholly state-owned enterprises) that are decided by international arbitration. These cases are governed by a range of dispute resolution systems and arbitration systems. For simplicity we refer to them as ISDS (investor-state dispute settlement) cases, which is the most commonly understood term for international arbitration between companies and countries.The Guardian analysed more than 1,400 cases, but these may only be a snapshot of the actual number of suits. Some cases are conducted entirely in secret, with no public record of their existence. Others do not disclose the way they were decided, or the size of the award.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Examples of third-party funded cases include the Bermudan company South American Silver, whose subsidiary acquiredmining concessionsin an area of Bolivia mainly inhabited by Indigenous communities. In 2010, the company was accused of polluting sacred spaces and threatening community members, and the Bolivian government revoked the concessions. The government had to pay the mining company$18.7min compensation.View image in fullscreenThe Malku Khota mine, one of the world’s largest reserves of silver, indium and gallium.

The case is expected to start in October.This year, Burford Capital – the world’s largest litigation-finance company – is backing a caseagainst Greenlandfor the impact of a uranium mining ban that a mining company argues in effect ended its development of one of the world’s largest rare earth mineral deposits. If Greenland loses the case, it faces either allowing the mining to go ahead or paying as much as $11.5bn in compensation.Fearing toxic waste, Greenland ended uranium mining. Now, they could be forced to restart - or pay $11bnRead moreConcerns are increasingly being raised by those who work within the ISDS system, including arbitrators who adjudicate cases.Muthucumaraswamy Sornarajah, an international lawyer and ISDS arbitrator, believes third-party funding has made ISDS into “big business”. He said it was likely that there were more claims being brought, because the risk of losing the claim “vanishes” for the claimant: “So it would mean that the respondent states – most of which are developing countries – would have to face the cost of defending potentially frivolous claims that are brought with third-party funding.”Sornarajah said the combination of ballooning legal fees and third-party funding meant “the extent of the business, or profits, that can be made as a result of ISDS is quite massive”.Internationally, the litigation finance industry is booming,worth $17.5bn in 2024. Supporters of third-party funding typically argue that their participation makes the justice system more accessible.Christopher Bogart, chief executive and co-founder of Burford Capital, the largest provider of litigation finance in the world, said third-party funding played an important role in providing access to justice by supporting litigants that otherwise would not be able to afford legal action. Burford Capital was the only third-party finance firm that would speak to the Guardian. The company said that as of September 2024, 93% of concluded cases generated a return for clients.“Legal finance provides a vetting function and weeds out meritless cases: we only get paid when our clients win their cases – if the cases we fund lose, we lose 100% of our money,” the company said in a statement.Bogart added: “I don’t think ISDS is any more high potential or lucrative than lots of other areas of litigation.”View image in fullscreenThe Kvanefjeld mine site near Narsaq. Greenland is being sued after it stopped Energy Transition Minerals mining rare-earth elements and uranium there.Photograph: Patrick Greenfield/GuardianBut critics warn that the rise of third-party cases is driving the growth of speculative cases. Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, said: “Third-party funding enables, or even encourages, investors to pursue claims off investors’ balance sheets, removing a key deterrent to bringing weak or speculative claims.“The litigation funders seek out and invest in cases as an opportunity to generate a return on their investments, at times partnering with law firms who have a financial interest in bringing more claims as well. This dynamic incentivises more arbitration, regardless of broader public interest or the legitimacy of the claims.”However, Burford said: “We would go out of business if we chose bad or frivolous cases and business necessity requires us to be highly selective in our investments and to back winning cases. We enable businesses that wouldn’t otherwise be able to seek justice.”Currently, arbitrators cannot financially penalise third-party funders by forcing them to cover a government’s legal costs. But some think that should change. Commenting on the case ofTeinver v Argentina, one of the arbitrators, Kamal Hossain, said in a dissenting opinion that “the creation of a ‘gambler’s Nirvana’ by allowing third-party funders to use investor-state dispute settlements as a means of financial speculation, without any possibility of making costs awards against those funders, is deeply problematic.”“The current inability of tribunals to make cost awards against third-party funders is a real and serious issue, and has attracted the concern of arbitrators in previous cases,” he said. “Their involvement may add to the costs of the proceedings. For that reason, as a matter of principle, a tribunal should be able to make a costs order against a third-party funder.”View image in fullscreenThe US-based Odyssey Marine Exploration won a payout of $37.1m from the Mexican state after it was denied a permit to mine the seabed on environmental grounds.Photograph: ReutersIn a recent dissenting opinion on the Odyssey Marine Explorationcase against Mexico, Prof Philippe Sands, one of the arbitrators, highlighted the “jaw-dropping” costs that the claimant had racked up, which amounted to more than $21m, half of which was covered by third-party funding. The investors’ costs were about 10 times that of the government in defending the claim.In a subsequent lecture, Sands raised the broader issue of third-party finance in the ISDS world, echoing concerns about how costly the system has become. “The arrangements may be said to assist in delivering a flowering of sorts: more fees for the lawyers, more cases for the arbitrators and a deeper, wider and more lucrative trough into which all of our snouts may be dipped,” he said.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsInvestor-state dispute settlementThe age of extinctionMiningEnergy industryPhilippe SandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Would their household fall apart if they changed places?Chloë HamiltonWed 5 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTShareIt starts with a discussion in the car, prompted by the washing up. It wasn’t done that morning. The laundry needs hanging up, too, and someone has forgotten to make the packed lunches. We need to pay the dog walker, fix the broken bath panel, work out why our toddler has started waking in the night and book our youngest in for a haircut. Then there’s a half-planned playdate to confirm, meals to plan and all those family WhatsApp group messages that need a response.Historically, women in heterosexual relationships have carried the heft of the mental load, also known ascognitive household labour. This is the behind-the-scenes work, often intangible, that goes into running a household. It’s not just the jobs: it’s thinking about those jobs. The true extent of this work, invisible and embedded as it is, can be hard to define; an iceberg of tasks concealed beneath waves of tradition, expectation and stereotypes. It’s not just the doing, it’s the remembering, the realising, the anticipating, the assigning. It’s not just making packed lunches, it’s getting food in, making sure it’s nutritious, checking the lunchboxes are washed and ready. It’s knowing the toddler has gone off bananas and the baby can’t eat chunks of apple yet. This work is unpaid, unseen and, often, unappreciated.You may assume, though, that as modern couples strive to split domestic responsibilities 50:50, the mental load is borne more equally, too. Research, however, suggests otherwise. According toa US study published last year, mothers still take on seven in 10 mental load tasks. Even women without children or a partner can be lumped with the load:a 2020 Australian studyfound single women over 45 with no children take on more responsibility for ageing or disabled relatives than any other group their age.View image in fullscreenChloë realises she has left sorting out the mortgage to Stuart and their fixed rate is ending.Photograph: Ernesto r Ageitos/Getty ImagesBack in the car, my partner, Stuart, and I are batting tasks back and forth, both determined to strike a winner. That the rally goes on for so long is, I think, testament to the fact that our partnership is rooted in equality. But, as we play mental load tennis, I’m struck by how much he does – and thinks about – that I, in all honesty, give scant consideration to: when we should paint the house; what is happening to interest rates as we approach the end of our fixed-term mortgage; whether delivery drivers scoff at our unmown lawn. I can’t help but wonder: is his mental load equal to – or, whisper it, greater than – the one I have spent years buckling under?By the end of the journey, we have decided upon an experiment: a mental load swap. He takes on mine for a week, and I his. We opt for half-term: he is a teacher and I am on maternity leave, so we will both be at home. The goal, we agree, is not to catch each other out but to explore, with open minds, how our other half lives.Our first stumbling block is how to launch the challenge. Do we write down our loads and do a formal swap? Or do we revolt, downing tools to see if our partner picks up the slack? Option one appears to negate a large part of the experiment: is a written listsidestepping the “mental” side of the mental load? Can we really be said to have swapped loads if we are working from bullet points written by the previous load-bearer? But going on strike, though tempting, doesn’t feel in tune with the spirit of exploration. Is there much to be gained from spending a week keeping tabs on what has been missed?Writing it down, then, seems like the better course of action. On my list is food shopping, meal planning and cooking, endless thinking about parenting and organising activities. On his list are the finances, infinite house jobs and looking after the dog. We hand over our documents and head to bed with more than a little trepidation about the week ahead.MondayChloë:It is said you should walk a mile in another man’s shoes in order to see things from his perspective. Instead I do the first day of the experiment wearing my partner’s down jacket. So many of his jobs involve going outside. Fortunately, the weather is gloriously cold and crisp with blue skies that signal spring is on the way, making the chores chilly but bearable. The dog walk – solo, silent, not a single child in tow – is a particular highlight and, actually, doesn’t feel like a load at all, although I suspect poor weather would make it a grim business. Stuart replenishes the food cupboards, plans tea and cooks: bangers and mash. The impact is remarkable. I feel like I’m on holiday! This has been a brilliant idea! And then the baby smears mashed potato into his hair and, while Stuart does bathe him, he doesn’t wash it out. Damn.View image in fullscreenStuart’s usual task of walking the dog doesn’t feel like a chore to Chloë.Photograph: GK Hart/Vikki Hart/Getty ImagesStuart:I think Chloë may have twigged that walking the dog is actually nice and not a chore at all, but I keep my counsel and pray it rains tomorrow. I take the boys to a nature reserve and time a click-and-collect supermarket stop with our journey home. I smile as I survey the ingredients for a full week of what I call “dynamic fusion cooking” and what Chloë calls “eating the first three things you see when you open the fridge”. We are all fed and the baby has almost no mashed potato in his hair after his bath.TuesdayChloë:Over breakfast, Stuart tells me his plan for the day: build the baby’s new cot, take both boys to the park, make tea, bathe the baby (no mention of hair washing but I’m hopeful). He asks me to check a list he has made, neatly written in his notebook. The experiment is proving to be rather artificial. This is, after all, the same list I gave him two days ago. I’ve found myself checking in with him, too: we both want to get it right. But it does suggest we are still carrying at least part of our own loads. Even so, I do remember to take the bins out. At dinner, the baby adds a subtle streak of banana to the mashed potato. Still no hair wash. Double damn.View image in fullscreenBathtime – but the baby’s hair still needs washed.Photograph: Peter Dazeley/Getty ImagesStuart:I feel a bit of a fraud running my plan for the day past Chloë to check if it’s OK, especially as, unprompted, she trudges off to discover where the bins are kept. I build the baby’s cot, take both boys to the park, cook the first three things I see when I open the fridge and wonder which day I should wash the baby’s hair.WednesdayChloë:Today is the hardest so far for me. It’s half-term and the children’s grandparents are taking them for the day. I’m itching to organise it. What time are they being dropped off? Do they need packed lunches? Has the routine been explained? Instead, I leave it to Stuart who is remarkably relaxed about it all. But then … it’s all fine. Everyone has a lovely day; disaster doesn’t strike. I wonder whether the weight of my mental load is, in part, linked to my own anxiety. While everyone is out, I tackle the housework on my (new) list: folding, vacuuming, wiping, washing, even clambering into the loft to put away stuff that has been festering on the landing. Stuart seems impressed although I catch him casting a concerned eye on the unvacuumed stairs as he heads up to tackle bathtime. He washes the baby’s hair, though. Hurrah!View image in fullscreenA pile left to languish on the landing got stored in the loft.Photograph: Posed by model; Antonio Garcia Recena/Getty ImagesStuart:I start to think that we both create a fair chunk of our own mental loads by worrying about small details. I demonstrate how this can be avoided by dropping the boys with their grandparents without checking their lunch plans or asking if 180 wet wipes will be enough. Chloë responds in kind, putting things in the loft apparently by hurling them through the hole in the ceiling. I wash the baby’s hair.ThursdayChloë:This is trickier than we realised. The mental load, it seems, is not something that can be handed over easily, like a baton in a relay. It’s baked into the way we live our lives, into what I think about as I fall asleep and the things Instagram’s algorithm hits me with when I wake up (this morning: seven signs your toddler is unhappy!) While I feel confident with the household chores, I’m ashamed to say I struggle to take on the heaviest load Stuart told me he carries: the finances. Despite having remortgaged a property I owned when I was single, I left this job to Stuart when we bought a house together in 2021 and haven’t really thought about it since; an admission so painfully traditional I feel embarrassed to admit it. So I cast a cursory eye over the falling interest rates and resolve to ask him more questions about how I can help.View image in fullscreenChloë is confident about household chores like laundry, less so on the family finances.Photograph: DNY59/Getty ImagesStuart:As much as I want to stick to the spirit of the week, I can’t help but worry about our mortgage. The fixed-term rate is ending and our next step will have consequences. What if we tie in for longer and rates go down? What if we don’t and they go up? I know our finances to the pound and a bad call will have a big impact. In the end, Chloë puts on a good show of being interested in the interest, but I make the decision.FridayChloë:As we relax into the week and the shiny novelty of the experiment begins to tarnish, it’s becoming harder not to slip back into the familiar. Trying not to act on my own mental load – while also taking on Stuart’s – is like wearing my shoes on the wrong feet or writing with my other hand: bloody awkward. At times, I find myself on autopilot, organising nap-times, planning the boys’ snacks and lunches, and responding to family WhatsApp group messages that I know Stuart won’t think are urgent but which I can’t leave unanswered. I also have the children all day today and, given a large chunk of my mental load is around parenting – and it’s a playdate I had organised with a friend – it doesn’t feel unlike a normal day. Not having to sort out tea when I get home, though, is a marked improvement.Stuart:I realise I’m thinking more and doing less but the workload feels similar. Chloë has the boys and I make a conscious effort not to tidy the house or check if blue tits have made a nest in our wall insulation again. However, the mental work of deciding what is for tea and timing it to be on the table when everyone is home feels like a fair swap for cleaning the stairs, which I’m sure Chloë will do any day now.View image in fullscreenPacked lunches with vegetables and fruit.Photograph: Olga Mazyarkina/Getty ImagesSaturdayChloë:Today, I tackle the stairs, a bleak task that involves scraping up the dog hair that clings to our carpet regardless of how much we (OK, Stuart) vacuum. While I’m clawing away at the floor, Stuart is making plans for the afternoon: a visit to a child-friendly pub to watch rugby. The outing will be over the boys’ teatime and, unprompted, he packs them a box of pesto pasta – their favourite – as well as fruit and vegetable snacks. It’s the kind of thing I would have done pre-swap and I am appreciative.Stuart:I take both boys on a parkrun in the double buggy while Chloë does a long run. At home, she cleans the stairs after I dedicate the drive back to sending her a psychic reminder. I organise a pub trip with friends in the afternoon, arriving with a prepared dinner for the boys that could feed us all for a week.SundayChloë:On the final day, Stuart begins to tidy up in earnest. He promises that this isn’t because the house is untidy (although with two children it always is) but because he has missed pottering around the house, doing jobs. I do think there’s something in this: I have missed cooking meals (although not planning them). I power through and meet friends for a baby-free lunch while Stuart looks after the boys. I’m not sure what they get up to, what they eat or if they nap but note, pleased, that I feel remarkably OK about that.Stuart:After letting my mind wander, I realise I have spent an hour absent-mindedly tidying. I drop Chloë at lunch and the hour-long nap that the boys are guaranteed to take in the car lasts seven minutes. I run round a supermarket before discussing in depth with the toddler whether or not starfish have arms. As the week draws to a close, I am glad to be returning to my more chore-centric existence, but with an increased appreciation that doing more is different to thinking more.View image in fullscreenWhat have Chloë and Stuart learned after a week?Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The GuardianConclusionThe experiment ends with another discussion in the car, debriefing as we drive to collect our toddler from the childminder.It transpires that neither of us thinks the other has it much easier but nor do we begrudge a swap back. While we did switch chores with some success, we actually found the week more stressful than usual as we juggled a contrived mental load with fretting about whether or not our usual load was being picked up. We note, too, that our mental loads are so deep-rooted, a complete handover – if, indeed, that is the goal – would require more than a week’s secondment. (On-the-job training, perhaps? Regular appraisals?) We also agree that whether the mental load feels heavy or not depends on changing factors: how much sleep you got the night before, for example, or if there is a big work deadline. Stuart points out that, more important than dividing the mental load equally, is being responsive to what your partner needs and adapting as necessary. Who, ultimately, has the greater mental load? We decide I do but that the load is often offset by the amount of physical work – from tidying to playing with our sons – that Stuart does.We conclude, as we pull into the childminder’s, that if long-term change is the objective, talking about it with your partner isn’t just recommended, it is essential – and, actually, doesn’t at all nullify the purpose of the chat. Opening up a dialogue has allowed us to have a respectful, thoughtful and continuing conversation about how we are feeling and faring. We have made the invisible visible.Which is why, when we get home, Stuart reveals that he has done the online food shop.Explore more on these topicsFamilyParents and parentingChildrenMarriageRelationshipsGrandparents and grandparentingWomen (Life and style)featuresShareReuse this content"

Dafir said one of his friends was among those hurt.“I lost my voice, I was so scared,” said Dafir. “We’re being forced to be silent; it seems like no wants to listen to us.”A group of young refugees based in the camp, Youth Voices in Kakuma, said protesters had spent hours outside the UNHCR offices but when no one came out to listen to their concerns some began trying to climb the fence, prompting the police to step in.A Kakuma resident named Blax Von, who uploaded videos of the protest on to TikTok, said the tensions had been building for several months, with water supplies being reduced, cash support payments slashed, and refugees required to pay their children’s school fees.Many of the protesters carried empty pots, while others held signs questioning whether 3kg of cereals was enough. “This is the container they are now using to measure beans and oil and the other one for rice. And this is equivalent for one month for your food,” a South Sudanese refugee, holding an empty cooking pot, told the Associated Press.“Assume you don’t have another income, it’s only this. Is this enough for you?”Deaths predicted amid the chaos of Elon Musk’s shutdown of USAidRead moreUNHCR said in a statement that it was “deeply concerned” about the impact of the cuts. It said “government security personnel in Kakuma intervened to contain the situation. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.“However, at least four refugees and one local government official sustained injuries. UNHCR cannot confirm the use of live rounds during the demonstrations.”TheSocial Justice Centre Working Group, a Kenyan civil society organisation, said: “Brutalising those who flee war, persecution and hunger instead of addressing their cries for food and water is the height of state-sponsored cruelty.”Kipchumba Murkomen, the cabinet secretaryat Kenya’s interior ministry,said on Tuesdaythat the recent aid cuts had had a “sudden and severe” impact on Kenya’s ability to host 800,000 refugees and asylum seekers.“With the cut in funding for humanitarian assistance programmes by the developed world, the socioeconomic impact on our country will be unbearable. And yet to turn our backs on the most vulnerable people runs counter to our belief in shared humanity. It’s therefore incumbent on developed countries to shoulder the financial burden as we do our bit,” said Murkomen.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentKenyaRefugeesHungerUnited NationsAfricaAidnewsShareReuse this content"

One former player who was coached by Eyi claimed he would lure alleged victims to his home, which he called the “Garden of Eden”.US Center for SafeSport sexual abuse investigator charged with rapeRead moreFifa provisionally suspended Eyi when the claims were first made in 2021 and its independent ethics committee opened an investigation. It was confirmed on Tuesday that he has been handed a lifetime ban from all football-related activities and fined 1m Swiss francs (£878,000).“The investigation into Mr Eyi concerns complaints from at least four male football players who accused him of sexual abuse between 2006 and 2021. Most of these incidents occurred while the players were minors,” said Fifa.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“In its decision, the adjudicatory chamber found that Mr Eyi had breached article 24 (Protection of physical and mental integrity) and article 26 (Abuse of position) of the Fifa code of ethics and sanctioned him with a lifetime ban from all football-related activities (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international level. In addition, a fine in the amount of CHF 1,000,000 has been imposed on Mr Eyi.”It is understood Fifa is continuing to investigate allegations that the president, Pierre-Alain Mounguengui, did not report alleged sexual abuse by Eyi and a number of other coaches to Gabon’s authorities. The Guardian reported last January that an independent investigator recommended he should be immediately suspended.Fifpro, the international players’ union, welcomed the ban issued to Eyi and said: “This ruling stands as a testament to the incredible courage and persistence of survivors and whistleblowers who, despite facing threats, ostracisation, and immense pressure, refused to stay silent.”It said, though, that more work needed to be done. “Football in Gabon will not be safe until all perpetrators and those who enabled them are brought to justice.”The Guardian has approached Eyi for comment.Explore more on these topicsFootballSexual abuse in sportGabonAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts have said this is a response to a more challenging environment both for the company and the broader spirits industry.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCanadaAlcoholAmericasDonald TrumpMexicoTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The benchmark S&P 500 increased 1.1% on Wall Street.A separate call between Trump and Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, did not lead to any larger breakthrough, however. Trudeau “largely caused the problems we have with them because of his Weak Border Policies”, Trump declared on his Truth Social platform after they spoke. “These Policies are responsible for the death of many people!”Trudeau insisted there had been improvements at the border, the US president claimed, adding that he told him this was “not good enough”.After the US imposed tariffs this week Trump,Trudeau told Trump publicly: “Even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.”During Trump’sjoint address to Congresson Tuesday evening, he acknowledged that tariffs would cause disruption. There will be “a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that”, he said.He blamed cost of living challenges on his predecessor, Joe Biden, from whom he claimed to have inherited “an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare”.TheUS economyhas, in fact, remained resilient in recent years, and inflation has fallen dramatically from its peak – at the highest level in a generation – three years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this is the first time I’ve seen a bald eagle go in for something as big as a goose,” he said.Despite multiple attacks by the eagle, the goose remained unbowed. The raptor, defeated, flew off.View image in fullscreenMervyn Sequeira: ‘Not often does one see our apex raptor, the American bald eagle attempting to take down a Canada goose.’Photograph: Mervyn SequeiraAt a time whenCanada’s sovereignty has come under unprecedented threat fromDonald Trump’s US, the battle between the two birds closely associated with each country has emerged as the latest symbol of tensions between the two countries.‘The relationship is broken’: Canadians respond to Trump’s tariffsRead moreThis week, Trump put a 25% tax on most Canadian goods and has further aggravated his northern neighbour, derisively calling it the 51st state and pledging to annex the world’s second largest country.Three days earlier, Canada’s national hockey team had stepped on to the ice in Boston for a match heralded as a showdown between the sport’s most powerful nations.An overtime Canadian goal, heavily laden with symbolism, finished the game and both electrified and soothed an anxious nation.“You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, posted on social media.For Canadians, such encounters have been impossible to untangle from a trade war brought on by the country’s closest ally and largest trading partner.View image in fullscreenAfter a 20-minute confrontation the defeated raptor flew off.Photograph: Mervyn Sequeira“We’ve been in tough spots before … but we have not only survived, we have emerged stronger than ever, because when it comes to defending our great nation, there is no price we all aren’t willing to pay, and today is no different,” Trudeau told Canadians.Sequeira, a retired airline pilot and avid bird photographer, is hesitant to impress symbolism on to the pictures.“It’s quite a coincidence that it should have happened at this time. And I’m not entirely surprised. I like to look at things from the naturalist point of view and from the wildlife photographer’s point of view and not put a spin on it. But it’s quite natural for people to look at it in the context of what’s happening,” he said.Certainly others see the fight as representing Canada’s scrappy nature and its unwillingness to back away when threatened.“Nature has its way of taking out the weak and the not so well and the injured. The eagle likely thought it would be able to take it out quite easily,” Sequeira said. “But, it wasn’t.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaBirdsAmericasWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Exile is the only thing left when nothing else has worked, it’s the only thing you’ve got left to defend your life and your freedom.Top corruption prosecutor held in jail as Guatemalan elite bids to purge foesRead more“Exile is just little bit different, a little bit less than death. [Your persecutors] take everything from you, take away your family, your children, your parents, your house, your way of life, your friends.’Laparra headed a special prosecutor’s office working alongside the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig),a UN anti-corruption missionthat was controversially expelled in September 2019 by the then president, Jimmy Morales. Widespread reprisals followed against those who had worked with Cicig.When Laparra was taken taken into preventive detention, she said it was as “if I were the worst drugs trafficker inGuatemala. When we drove out of the underground parking in my building there were soldiers, the police, hooded, with heavy weapons on both sides of the street. It was like in a film.”She spent her first five months in solitary confinement in a windowless 2.5 sq meter cell in a high security jail in Guatemala City, 200 miles away from her Quetzaltenango home, and allowed out for only one hour a day.“Usually, the male prisoners in that place were only in solitary for two or three days, they can’t really deal with much more,” she said. “That’s what I had to suffer.”She also endured bleeding to the womb in prison but waited months for treatment. Laparra eventually had a hysterectomy and four subsequent operations, during which she said police surrounded “the hospital, the gynaecology area, the operation room, and I had on each side of my bed a member of the police”.She was later transferred to Matamoros prison, another notorious facility where drug traffickers and gang leaders are held, after she angered the authorities by speaking to a journalist. “My idea was that at least if I’m going to die [in jail], let’s make sure the world knows what happened,” said Laparra.She considered pleading guilty in the hope that she might be released as both her sentences were commutable, which in Guatemala usually means no jail time is served, but her daughters told her: “Don’t do that, you’ve been here too long to give up now.”When things reached their lowest ebb, Laparra said she decided to kill herself before remembering the promise she made to her daughters each time they visited – that she would be there the next time they came.After her release on house arrest last year, she received an award from Guatemala’s current progressive president, Bernardo Arévalo,a surprise victorin the 2023 election. But Laparra believes the award only inflamed the pursuit of her by the public prosecutor’s office led by the attorney general, María Consuelo Porras, who had also tried to stop Arévalo from taking office.Porras, who has pursued many other anti-corruption prosecutors and judges, also forced into exile her predecessor as attorney general and has beensanctioned by the USfor corruption andthe Council of the European Unionfor undermining democracy.The Fund for Global Human Rights,which nominated Laparra for the Sir Henry Brooke award, and Amnesty International, whichnamed her as a prisoner of consciencein 2022,saidthey were “deeply concerned about the systematic pattern of criminalisation imposed by the Guatemalan judiciary and the public prosecutor’s office against former judges, prosecutors, human rights defenders and journalists who have worked tirelessly for years to fight impunity and corruption in the country”.Laparra says she feels proud to have received the award but adds that her persecutors reacted to the news with anger online. “I thought that it wasn’t possible to keep hate burning for so long,” she said. “Surely, two years in prison would have been enough for them, I thought, but it wasn’t.”Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing approved 66.7GW of new coal-fired power capacity in 2024, the majority in the final months of the year. One gigawatt is the equivalent of a large coal power plant.There was also strong momentum in building new coal power.A reportpublished last month by the Global Energy Monitor and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said China accounted for 93% of global construction starts for coal power in 2024. The report also noted that long-term power purchase agreements, which set minimum quotas for coal power bought by local governments, were slowing the integration of renewable energy into the power grid.Toledo said such trends were unnecessary and that China could quit coal while safeguarding its energy security. “Commentators outside China are increasingly puzzled at the continued containment of domestic renewable generation in future stranded coal assets,” he said.Experts say China’s rapid development of renewable energy while still building new coal-fired power plants is pitting clean and dirty energy against each other in the country’s economy.China is the global leader in renewable energy, and solar and wind installations soared to record levels last year. Solar capacity increased by 45% to 887GW and wind capacity by 18% to 521GW.China has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and many experts predict it willreach that target ahead of schedule.Zhang Xiaoye, a scholar from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and co-chair of one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s working groups, said on Wednesday that the total amount of electricity produced by renewable energy in China last year was equal to the total amount of electricity produced in the US. He stressed the need for the EU and China to cooperate to achieve “blue skies and clean water”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Beijing denies any abuses.The Thai deputy prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai said on Monday that no country made any concrete offer to resettle the 48Uyghurs.“We waited for more than 10 years, and I have spoken to many major countries, but no one told me for certain,” he told reporters.Phumtham was out of government from 2006 until mid-2023.The US offered to resettle the 48 Uyghurs, an official from the US state department said.“The United States has worked with Thailand for years to avoid this situation, including by consistently and repeatedly offering to resettle the Uyghurs in other countries, including, at one point, the United States,” the US official said, asking not to be named.Canada also offered asylum to the detained Uyghurs, said four sources, including diplomats and people with direct knowledge. Two of these sources said another offer came from Australia.These proposals, which the sources said were not taken forward by Thailand over fears of a falling-out withChina, have not been previously reported.All the sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Thailand’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.China’s foreign ministry said that the repatriation was carried out in accordance with Chinese, Thai and international law. “The repatriated were Chinese nationals who are illegal migrants,” it said. “The legitimate rights of the relevant people are fully protected.”A spokesperson for Canada’s immigration ministry said they would not comment on individual cases.The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade referred to a statement by the foreign minister, Penny Wong, who said on Friday the country “strongly disagrees” with Thailand’s decision.Besides the 40 Uyghurs deported last week, five are in a Thai prison due to a continuing criminal case, according to local officials. Reuters could not immediately confirm the whereabouts of the other three people.Pisan Manawapat, a Thai ambassador to Canada and the US between 2013 and 2017 and a senator before he retired in 2024, said that at least three countries had approached Thailand with proposals to resettle the Uyghurs, but declined to name them.“We didn’t want to upset China,” Pisan said, without providing further details. “So we did not make the decision at the political level to go through with this.”China is Thailand’s biggest trade partner and the two countries have close business ties.Phumtham said Thailand made the decision to deport the group to China last week after reassurances from Beijing that Thai officials would be allow to monitor the Uyghurs’ wellbeing in the country following their return.UN human rights experts had said the group would be at risk of torture, ill-treatment and “irreparable harm” if returned to China, and their deportation has drawn widespread condemnation.Following the deportation, the UN’s refugee agency said in a statement that it was repeatedly denied access to the group by Thai authorities.A source said the UN refugee agency’s lack of access to the Uyghurs meant they could not be processed as asylum seekers, stalling their potential resettlement and leaving them stuck in detention.Explore more on these topicsThailandUyghursAsia PacificChinaXinjiangCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s not a matter of order and I don’t expect to have further points of order raised about it.”Remains of carved canoe may be most significant discovery of its kind, NZ archaeologist saysRead moreThe ruling comes after Winston Peters – who is deputy prime minister, foreign affairs minister and the leader of the populist New Zealand First party – questioned why the Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March had used “Aotearoa” during house proceedings last month.“Why is someone who applied to come to a country called New Zealand as an immigrant in 2006 allowed in this house to change the country’s name without the mandate, approval or referendum of the New Zealand people?” Peters asked.Menéndez March is originally from Mexico but is a New Zealand citizen.New Zealand First minister Shane Jones later questioned the appropriateness of “recent immigrants” telling Māori what the name of the country should be.After the incident, Menéndez March accused the minister’s comments of being “explicitly xenophobic” and said it could translate into harm within the community.Other lawmakers have referred to Aotearoa in the house, including the National party minister Tama Potaka who used it a day before Menéndez March.Brownlee’s ruling comes at a moment of high tension between the government and the Indigenous population. Since taking office, the rightwing coalition’s broaderpolicy direction for Māori– including limiting Māori language use in public services and sweeping rollbacks to policies designed to improve Māori health and wellbeing – has promptedstrident criticismandmajor protests.The name Aotearoa – commonly translated to “long white cloud” or “long bright world” – is increasingly used by members of the public, within media, businesses and government, amid adecades-long push to revitalisethe Indigenous language.But while Māori words and phrases have become commonplace – even among non-Māori – the appetite to officially change New Zealand’s name is low. In 2022, Te Pāti Māori (the Māori party)delivered a petition of 70,000 signaturesto parliament calling for the country’s name to be officially changed to Aotearoa. At the time, polling suggested the majority of New Zealanders were not ready for it.Peters – who is Māori – hasopposed affirmative initiativesintended to advance Māori, criticised the use ofMāori names for government departmentsand drawn ire forclaiming Māori are not Indigenous.After Tuesday’s ruling, Peters told media the speaker’s conclusion was “wrong”. “And I’ll tell you why he’s wrong. This matter has never gone to the people of this country, has never got the people’s consent. There’s no mandate, there’s no authority,” he said.In a statement to the Guardian, Menéndez March said Peters was “leaning into culture wars”.“The use of Aotearoa should have always been a non-issue,” Menéndez March said. “The key thing here is the ongoing disregard for migrant communities from the government’s ministers.”Jones declined the Guardian’s requests for comment. Peters has not responded to a request for comment.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandMāoriAsia PacificNew Zealand politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

China reached its target last year with a last-minute export boom. Exports surged by 10.7% in December, pushing China’s trade surplus to a record $1tn. But with anew US-China trade waras Donald Trump settles into his second term in the White House, this year it will be harder to boost the economy through trade.China and Canada retaliate after Trump trade tariffs come into effectRead moreThis week, Trump doubled tariffs on most Chinese goods to 20%, with some duties reaching 45%.Chinaswiftly announced retaliatory tariffs of its own, imposing duties of up to 15% on agricultural goods.“The target is very ambitious,” said Alicia García-Herrero, the chief economist forAsia Pacificat investment bank Natixis. She said it was “non-reachable” without a bigger stimulus, especially in light of the increased tariffs.China’s challenge for 2025 will be shielding its economy from the impact of the trade war. Economists have urged policymakers to boost stimulus measures, especially those that would put more money in consumers’ pockets to boost domestic demand.In Wednesday’s work report, Li said the government wanted to “make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of economic growth”. But details on how the government would do this were scant, save for a pledge to issue 300bn yuan ($41.2bn) of special treasury bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes. That is double the amount that was issued to support last year’s subsidies scheme, in which consumers can trade in old household appliances such as microwaves and rice cookers to get a discount on new purchases. Officials said that last year’s scheme resulted in 240bn yuan of home appliances sales.Beijing is increasingly focused on the need to develop domestic innovation and hi-tech industries, fields whichXi Jinping, China’s leader, calls “new quality productive forces”. Addressing the nearly 3,000 delegates who gathered in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People for the opening session of the NPC, Li said the government would “establish a mechanism to increase funding for industries of the future” such as artificial intelligence and 6G.The push for “new quality productive forces”, which include electric vehicles and battery storage, is linked to China’s green ambitions. But experts warned that a key climate pledge in Wednesday’s report – to reduce carbon intensity by 3% per unit of GDP – was insufficient.Carbon intensity refers to how much CO2 is emitted for every dollar of economic activity. The prominence of heavy industries in China’s economy means that China’s carbon intensity has traditionally been much higher than other countries. In 2023, it produced twice as much CO2 per dollar as the global average. Achieving the 3% target announced on Wednesday means that China would miss its target of reducing carbon intensity by 18% between 2021 and 2025, said Zhe Yao, a global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia.“Despite the record expansion of renewables, an inconvenient truth is that China’s economy hasn’t become much more energy efficient in recent years … As policymakers continue to look for new drivers of growth, they shouldn’t forget the need for a new mode of growth that is less dependent on energy,” Yao said.The government work report also said China would “firmly advance” the cause ofunification with Taiwanand “refine the mechanisms for strengthening mutual support between civilian sectors and the military”, a reference to the civil-military fusion strategy that has caused alarm in the west.Another official report released on Wednesday said China would increase defence spending by 7.2% this year, the same as last year’s figure. China spends less than 2% of its GDP on the military, a much lower share than the US, whose defence spending is over 3% of GDP.The NPC’s annual session will run until 11 March. The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a high level advisory body, is also meeting in Beijing this week.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificXi JinpingnewsShareReuse this content"

The trial ran from April 2019 through November 2023 across two sexual health services and three family-planning services in three states.The couples were randomly assigned to two groups – one where both the male and female partner were treated, and one control group where only the female partner received treatment.The researchers ensured there was equal representation in each group of women using an intrauterine device (IUD) and uncircumcised males – both of which have been linked with an increased risk of BV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s proven sexual transmission of BV.”Bradshaw acknowledges that while reinfection with BV bacteria from male partners may be responsible for recurrence in many women, there were some women who weren’t cured.Antibiotics might not have worked for women with adense biofilm – the biological tissue of the vaginal microbiome– or with an IUD, which the bacteria coats, making it harder for antibiotics to clear, Bradshaw said.Further strategies need to be developed for these women, such as a longer course of antibiotics, she said.The editorial also noted that 14% of the men in the intervention group reported taking less than 70% of their prescribed doses of medication, “an early signal that male partner buy-in could be challenging in some situations”.Bradshaw said that the cure rates in women whose male partners were 100% adherent to the tablets and the cream were far higher.The authors acknowledged a limitation of the study was that the participants largely included people attending sexual health centres, which may reflect a higher-risk population.Prof Rebecca Guy from the Kirby Institute’s Sexual Health Program said this was the “first study to show sustained and substantial benefit for a common and debilitating vaginal infection”.“It also provides evidence for sexual transmission of the bacteria that causes bacterial vaginosis.”Guy said the findings will inform clinical guidelines and new clinical protocols on treatment of the condition. “Success will rely on strategies to ensure high treatment cooperation rates among male partners, as achieved in the trial.”Explore more on these topicsHealthMedical researchWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The US, our ally, has changed its position on this war, supporting Ukraine less and allowing doubt to linger on what will come next.”He said the increasingly “brutal” world was entering “a new era” and “it would be madness to stay a spectator in this world of danger”.Macron saidFranceand Europe must keep helping Ukraine “to resist until Ukraine can negotiate a peace with Russia that is solid for themselves and for all of us”. He said no path to peace could happen through “abandoning Ukraine”.In an implicit reference to Trump’s attempts to force Ukraine into peace talks with Russia, he added: “Peace cannot be concluded at any price.”He said: “Who can believe today that Russia would stop at Ukraine?”2:05Macron could travel to see Trump with Starmer, Zelenskyy, French government spokesperson suggestsMacron said any European forces deployed would not fight today or at the frontline, but would be there to guarantee any peace in Ukraine once it had been signed.He also said he would discuss with European partners extending French nuclear deterrence to other countries on the continent, but that the decision and control would always remain in the hands of the French president.Macron said:“Europe’s future should not be decided in Washington or Moscow, and yes the threat from the east is returning. And the innocence of these 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall is over.”He said France and Europe must also prepare for tariffs on European goods, calling that decision “incomprehensible, as much for the American economy as ours”. He said France and Europe would respond but he hoped to be able to dissuadeDonald Trump.On Thursday, a Brussels defence summit will see the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, join the 27 EU leaders in person.European leaders are stepping up diplomatic efforts after Trump ordered a pause on all critical US military aid for Ukraine against Russia, three years into the invasion, after an explosivepublic confrontationin the Oval Office last week with Zelenskyy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The summit will discuss a massive boost in European defence spending to make up for the expected dwindling of transatlantic support under Trump. Alongside the Ukraine crisis, EU leaders will discuss aproposal by the European Commissionto borrow up to €150bn to lend to member states under a rearmament plan.Consensus on all these issues is not straightforward. Orbán is an admirer not only of Trump but also Putin, and has repeatedlybroken a united EU front on Ukraine. The Hungarian leader – one of Trump’s and Moscow’s closest allies in the EU – said earlier this week that a “transatlantic rift” over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had become apparent over recent days.He told a briefing: “There is a clear strategic difference, which the US presidential election has made unbridgeable … Some want war and some want peace. This is the challenge we will have to face on Thursday.” He said he would have to face that challenge as early as Wednesday, in an apparent reference to his planned dinner with Macron.He accused European leaders, who met in London over the weekend to support Kyiv, of having decided “that the war in Ukraine must continue”.An Élysée official said France was “inclusive” and “speaking to everyone” and viewed Thursday’s summit as “a new moment in the consolidation of European unity”.The official said France would press “the necessity that Ukraine is fully associated with any discussion on its future. That is obvious, but it has to be remembered, respected and fully taken into account.”Macron, whose popularity had dropped during adomestic political crisis prompted by him calling snap elections, appears to be experiencing a slight increase in support among voters, amid Ukraine diplomacy and the first steps of the Trump administration.One poll, after Macron’s recent visit to Washington, showed an improvement in his confidence ratings among French voters.But the push to increase French defence spending is coinciding with government struggles to reduce the budget deficit.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Share prices also leapt in London, Paris and Milan amid investor hopes that a massive boost in European spending on defence and infrastructure would kickstart the region’s ailing economy.European defence stocks soar as arms makers expect orders boomRead moreDefence stocks have gained sharply in recent weeks as world leaders scramble to piece together the funding for a vast increase in military expenditure amid mounting concern over Donald Trump’s commitment to European security.The EUoutlined a plan on Tuesday to unlock almost €800bn (£670bn)for defence spending, while the UK government said last week it wouldraise its spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, two years earlier than planned, worth an additional £6bn a year.Shares in Rheinmetall, the German automotive and arms manufacturer, rose by 7.2% on Wednesday and have rocketed by 99% this year.Britain’s BAE Systems has ralliedby 41% so far this year, Italy’s Leonardo is up 73% and Paris-listed Thales has risen by 78%.The euro rose by 1.5% against the US dollar to about €1.08. The pound also gained against the dollar on a day of dramatic moves in markets, as investors also reacted to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, suggesting a deal could “probably” be reached to de-escalate Trump’s trade war with Canada and Mexico.Some analysts said there was a danger of the dollar losing its “safe-haven” status among global investors as Trump’s trade wars rattle the world’s largest economy. “The speed and scale of global shifts is so rapid that this needs to be acknowledged as a possibility,” said George Saravelos, global head of currency research at Deutsche Bank..In a sea change for economic policy after years of sticking to tough rules on government debt, Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, said on Tuesday thatdefence spending above 1% of GDP would be exemptfrom the country’s debt rule.Agreed with the centre-left Social Democrats, who are expected to form a coalition with Merz’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the plan also includes the creation of a €500bn fund to finance spending on Germany’s infrastructure over the next 10 years. Any lifting of the debt brake must command a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag.In response, Germany’s biggest construction and engineering companies posted sharp share gains on Wednesday. Cement maker Heidelberg Materials jumped by 17%, industrial services firm Bilfinger leapt by 18% and construction group Hochtief advanced by 15.5%. Engineering and steel firm ThyssenKrupp rose by 13.4%.Echoingthe words of Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank president during the eurozone debt crisis, Merz said Germany would do “whatever it takes” on defence. Under pressure to raise spending on defence from 2.1% of GDP last year, analysts at Morgan Stanley said the overall size of the German plan could reach more than €1tn.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said the plan amounted to a “really big bazooka” with potential to transform Europe’s largest economy. “They are a fiscal sea change for Germany,” he said.“The extra room for defence spending sends a clear signal to Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as well as to Germany’s European friends that Germany is serious about defending itself and helping Ukraine.”.Described as “one of the most historic paradigm shifts in German postwar history” by economists at Deutsche Bank, the deal will effectively sideline the constitutional debt brake, orschuldenbremse,for spending on defence.Introduced in 2009 byAngela Merkelafter the financial crisis, the rule, often restricting annual federal borrowing to 0.35% of GDP, had been symbolic of Germany’s strict approach to tax and spending policy.City analysts said sidelining the rule would be a gamechanger for the country’s economy amid big challenges from collapsing industrial output, weakened by slack demand and competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.“Germany was facing a potential growth trajectory heading towards zero over coming years. [The defence and infrastructure boost] catapults growth prospects closer to 1.5-2% for 2027 onwards,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a note to clients.The debt-fuelled stimulus package comes with a cost, reflected in a rise in 10-year bond yields to almost 2.7%. However, German borrowing costs still remain significantly lower than in the US and the UK, where yields have reached more than 4%.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzEuroEurozoneStock marketsBondsEuropean Central BanknewsShareReuse this content"

Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool. We reiterate that the civilians of Gaza who have suffered so much must be allowed to return to their homes and rebuild their lives.”During the 15 months of theIsrael-Gaza war, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government repeatedly denied aid agencies’ claims that it was blocking humanitarian deliveries, blaming the very limited flow on other factors.UN officials said before the ceasefire that widespread famine was imminent. In the six weeks of the first phase of the truce, deliveries returned to the prewar levels of about 600 trucks a day, mostly carrying food.Aid officials said that even with the restoration of food deliveries, the lack of drinkable water, the near-complete destruction of Gaza’s hospitals and clinics, the lack of shelter in winter and the buildup of untreated sewage among the rubble could all be lethal to the surviving population of 2.2 million.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warForeign policyIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesFranceGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

One way or the other we’re going to get it,” he said to laughs and applause.Addressing Greenlandic people, he added: “We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.”Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for natural resources, equality, business and justice, said the scenes showed a “fundamental lack of respect for us as a people, for our historical connection to these lands and for our democratic institutions”.She said she was “not blind” to the potential for increased trade and cooperation, but “the absence of a respectful tone stands in the way”.She said: “Hearing American legislators giggle over statements like ‘we are gonna get it one way or the other’ is disrespectful. I say no thank you to the idea of Red, White and Blueland. No thank you to the prospect of becoming an American state or some other form of American subsidiary.”Nathanielsen said the US was “sending some very unclear signals” about who it considered allies and how it used its “enormous power”.Using the Greenlandic name for Greenland, the prime minister, Múte Egede, said: “Kalaallit Nunaat is ours.” He wrote on social media: “We don’t want to be Americans, nor Danes; We are Kalaallit. The Americans and their leader must understand that. We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken. Our future will be decided by us in Greenland.”Denmark formerly ruled Greenland as a colony and continues to control its foreign and security policy. Greenland goes to the polls on 11 March in a high-stakes general election that could prove pivotal in terms of its relationship with the US and how quickly it moves towards independence from Denmark.According to an opinion poll commissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske in January,85% of Greenlandersdo not want Greenland to be part of the US.Nathanielsen said she did not see Trump’s comments as a “reason to panic”, adding: “The speech is aimed at an American Republican audience and is intended to entertain and shock.”But she added: “The handling of our strong neighbour will be an important issue for the upcoming Inatsisartut [parliament of Greenland] and Naalakkersuisut [government of Greenland] to deal with and I hope and believe that a majority of parties will create a common front and speak with one voice.”She urged people to vote for a party “that is not naive about the American interests in our country”.The finance minister, Erik Jensen, said: “It is terrible to see the view of humanity in the speech. The vice-president also laughs. It shows that they have an unacceptable view of humanity.”The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, reiterated previous statements that the future of Greenland would be decided by the Greenlandic people, but said: “I hope as Danish prime minister that we can hold on to our commonwealth, because I believe that is to the benefit of all three countries.”In another interview, she said Denmark andEuropehad benefited from “very strong collaboration” with the US and that they would “do what we can to hold on to the Americans”.She added: “It is important right now that we make ourselves as strong as possible, so that we can stand in our own right in a completely different way than before.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandUS foreign policyTrump administrationDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They said this would have a “very bad impact” on the fight against Russia.The White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said Trump would consider restoring aid to Ukraine if peace talks were arranged and confidence-building measures taken. Discussions were ongoing with Ukraine over a date and place for talks, he told Fox News.Speaking on Wednesday in his nightly address Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there had been “positive movement” in cooperation with the US. Results were expected next week involving a future meeting between the two sides, he added. On Thursday, Zelenskyy will join 27 EU leaders as they hold emergency talks in Brussels to agree ways to quickly increase their military budgets.Ukraine’s president is seeking to repair relations with the US after his acrimonious meeting on Friday with Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, during which Trump publicly berated Zelenskyy and accused him of not wanting a deal with Russia.On Tuesday, Zelenskyy wrote a conciliatory letter. It said he was committed to negotiations and ready to work with America under Trump’s “strong leadership”.In a speech to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump called the letter “important” and said: “I appreciate that he sent this letter … Simultaneously, we’ve had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn’t that be beautiful?”Waltz described the message on Wednesday as a “good, positive first step”. He said: “We’re already talking about confidence-building measures that we’ll then take to the Russians and test that side.” If the negotiations were “nailed down”, Trump would “take a hard look at lifting this pause”, Waltz said.Ukrainian commentators expressed scepticism that a deal could be easily and swiftly reached. They pointed out that the White House had so far asked no concessions of Russia and appeared willing to accept Vladimir Putin’s demands undiluted.Putin has called on Ukraine to give up territory, reduce the size of its military and accept “neutrality” under a new government. Last week Zelenskyy said Ukraine needed security guarantees before it could sign a deal – something an infuriated Trump categorically ruled out.Speaking to Fox, the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, confirmed the intelligence freeze. He expressed confidence that the “pause” on the “intelligence and military front” was temporary and would “go away”. He added: “I think we’ll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have, to push back on the aggression that’s there.”Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said they could not comment on intelligence matters. They said the UK had been clear it would do everything it could to put Ukraine in the strongest position.Experts said the impact of US restrictions on intelligence sharing would depend partly on what precisely had been stopped, and they emphasised that Kyiv was already more capable than Washington appreciated.One western expert familiar with Ukraine’s conduct of the war said Kyiv already made heavy use of open-source and human intelligence to identify Russian targets and was not particularly dependent on the US for targeting information.Giving an example, the person said “oil refineries don’t move”, citing a frequent target of Ukrainian long range-drone attacks. “Donald Trump might be surprised to find that when he pulls the levers they have little impact,” they added.The restrictions would not prevent the UK and other countries from carrying on as before. Wider restrictions on intelligence sharing, such as refusing to share intercepts that provide clues as to Russian strategic intentions or military plans, would have a greater effect.In February 2022, US intelligence told Ukraine that Russia was trying to seizure Hostomel airport north-west of Kyiv. The location’s defences were reinforced. Russia was never able to securely capture the airstrip, which it had intended to use to fly in large numbers of troops to take control of the Ukrainian capital.A Ukrainian defence official acknowledged that a cut-off would be damaging. “We need satellite data to carry out deep strikes. It enables us to identify [Russian] targets and to guide our drones,” he said.As part of his attempt to move on from the Oval Office row, Zelenskyy has offered to sign a minerals deal with the US. Trump has described the agreement as an economic backstop. The presence of US workers on the ground in Ukraine would deter Russia from attack, he argues.A senior official in Kyiv said Ukraine was aware of its precarious position and doing everything it could to fix relations with the US. However, some Ukrainian observers believe Ukrainian concessions will not work and think Washington has definitively swapped sides in the war and is actively helping the Kremlin.The journalistKristina Berdynskykhwrote that Trump’s team was humiliating and threatening Ukraine while not applying any pressure to Putin. “Now every day there is some bad news for Ukraine from the US. And so far, there is no bad news for Russia, but the opposite,” she said.Since US and Russian negotiators began peace talks in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin has stepped up its attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid and civilian infrastructure. It sent a record 267 drones on the third anniversary last month of its full-scale invasion. Another 181 were launched on Wednesday, together with three missiles. A 73-year-old man was killed in the Odesa region and 20 private houses were damaged.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyTrump administrationRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the return of his 15bn toman bail, paid by a third party, was dependent on his flogging, which was carried out this week.At the time, Yarrahi wrote on X: “I am ready to receive the sentence of 74 lashes, and while I condemn this inhuman torture, I make no request to cancel it.”The news of the lashes was shared on Wednesday by Zahra Minouei, the singer’s lawyer.Minouei wrote on X on Wednesday that the last part of the sentences issued by the Tehran revolutionary court had been administered.Yarahi wrote on Instagram: “You have brought glass to break our stone. Thank you for your constant support, dear ones, and the sincere companionship of the respected lawyers Mustafa Nili and Zahra Minoui. He who is not willing to pay the price of freedom does not deserve freedom. Wishing you freedom.”News of the medieval-style flogging caused widespread outrage on Iranian social media.Nobel peace prize laureate Narges Mohammadi wrote on Instagram: “The execution of Mehdi Yarrahi’s flogging sentence is revenge for his support for the women of Iran. The flogging on Mehdi’s body is a whip on the proud, resistant women of Iran and the flourishing and powerful soul of the ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ movement.”Masih Alinejad,a well-known US-based human rights campaigner, said: “For every lash they strike, more women will take off their scarves. More voices will rise. And nothing will stop this revolution. To the west: negotiating human rights with barbarians won’t save you. This regime is a virus, it will spread if you let it.”In 2024 at least 131 individuals were sentenced to a combined 9,957 lashes by the Iranian judiciary, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, an Iranian NGO.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Nevertheless, our commitment is to dismantle whatever may be left from it, to put an end to this painful legacy and ensure Syria becomes a nation aligned with international norms.”Earlier on Wednesday, the OPCW chief, Fernando Arias, called Syria’s political shift “a new and historic opportunity to obtain clarifications on the full extent and scope of the Syrian chemical weapons programme”.Shaibani said planning had begun, but that the help of the international community would be critical. Syria would require technical assistance, logistical assistance, capacity building, resources and expertise on the ground, he said.“Although the Assad regime stalled for many years, we understand the need to act quickly, but we also understand that this needs to be done thoroughly. For that, we cannot succeed alone,” he said.Syria’s declared stockpile has never accurately reflected the situation on the ground, OPCW inspectors have concluded. They now want to visit roughly 100 sites that may have been tied to Assad’s decades-old chemical weapons programme.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaChemical weaponsBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

It also listed Netanyahu’s acquiescence in the flow of funds from Qatar to Gaza, a policy designed to divide Palestinians by boosting Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian state.The Shin Bet report also pointed to the daily Jewish prayers that have been taking place in recent years in the compound around Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque, known to Jews as the Temple Mount. The prayers violate a 58-year-old understanding with Jordan that only Muslims should be allowed to pray at the al-Aqsa and the esplanade around it, but they were championed by the governing coalition’s former national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir.“The cumulative weight of violations on the Temple Mount, the treatment of [Palestinian] prisoners and the perception that Israeli society had been weakened because of the damage to social cohesion” were all contributory factors to Israel’s vulnerability to attack, the report said.Shin Bet argued that it had not underestimated Hamas and its desire to mount a major attack from Gaza by overwhelming Israeli fortifications around the coastal strip. The security agency said it even gave the plan the code name of Walls of Jericho, but it did not lead to heightened security.“The plans were not viewed as a relatable threat, and the series of weak indicative signs that began in the summer of 2023 were not attributed to that threat,” the report said, adding that a Hamas insurgency in the West Bank was seen as more likely at the time.“That led to the mortal flaw in the decision-making on the night between 6 and 7 October,” the report said.The night before the massacre, Shin Bet raised an alert over the activation of 45 Israeli sim cards by Hamas militants. The agency labelled the sim activation as unusual and a possible pointer to an impending attack, if other indicative signs emerged. The fact that no defensive preparations were taken, the Shin Bet report blamed in part on lack of cooperation with army intelligence.In response to the report, sources described as close to Netanyahu briefed Israeli reporters against the head of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, whom the prime minister has been trying to remove.Bar, the Netanyahu associates were quoted as saying, “failed completely” in dealing with the Hamas threat and had been a “slave to preconceptions” about the militant group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A source said the talks had focused on gaining the release of US nationals still held hostage in Gaza, but also included discussions about a broader deal to release all remaining hostages and how to reach a long-term truce.The US state department designated Hamas as a foreign terrorist organisation in 1997.The Israeli embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boehler’s office declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHamasPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Later, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the world body stood ready to “fully cooperate”.In a final communique, the summit announced the adoption of a “comprehensive Arab plan”, urging the international community to offer its support.It said that “all these efforts are proceeding in parallel with the launch of a political track” towards Palestinian statehood, which Israeli leaders have opposed.The summit called on Palestinian representation to be unified under the PLO, an umbrella group that is the dominant political force within the PA – and which excludes Hamas.In a 112-page document, the Egyptian government presented colourful AI-generated images of housing developments, gardens and community centres, with plans for a commercial harbour, a technology hub, beach hotels and an airport.What the Egyptian proposal did not fully address was who would run the devastated territory, with a draft communique only mentioning what it called support for a Palestinian administrative committee.Critically, it has also not received backing from Gaza’s occupying power: Israel. Previous economic plans for Gaza failed after they were stifled by Israel,which has blockaded and bombed the strip for years. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said hewants permanent, overarching control over all land in the Palestinian territories.Meanwhile, inside the coastal strip, the Hamas group has been battered by 16 months of war but remains a political force, and is unlikely to agree to a process that excludes it.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said the group rejected any attempt to impose projects on Palestinians.“We are keen for the success of the summit, and we hope that there will be a call to reject the displacement and to protect the right of our people in resisting the occupation and governing itself away from any custodianship and intervention,” he added.Hamas also released a statement on Tuesday calling for the Arab League summit in Cairo to “thwart” the relocation of Palestinians fromGaza.“We look forward to an effective Arab role that ends the humanitarian tragedy created by the occupation in the Gaza Strip … and thwarts the [Israeli] occupation’s plans to displace [Palestinians],” it said.The Egyptian plan did acknowledge the challenge posed by armed factions in Gaza but said the issue could be resolved through a “credible political process” that restores Palestinian rights and offers a clear path forward.The military regime in Cairo and many other Arab states are outspoken on Israel’s violence but consider Islamist Hamas a threat. Cairo has long maintained a blockade on Gaza in coordination with Israel.The Palestinian president,Mahmoud Abbas, who runs the western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, attended the summit, although he has limited influence in Gaza.The devastating impact of 15 months of war on GazaRead moreEgypt’s plan also garnered backing from the United Nations secretary general, Guterres, who had previouslywarned of ethnic cleansingafter Trump released his “Riveria of the Middle East” plan.“I welcome and strongly endorse the Arab-led initiative to mobilise support for Gaza’s reconstruction, clearly expressed in this summit,” Guterres said at the summit. “The UN stands ready to fully cooperate in this endeavour.”Guterres also called for the resumption “without delay” of negotiations on continuing a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has killed nearly 50,000 people while Hamas, which killed approximately 1,200 people during an attack that sparked the latest war, still holds Israeli hostages.While the ceasefire remains in place, Arab states have rushed to present an alternative to Trump’s plan, which they fear would destabilise the entire region, especially if Palestinians in Gaza are forcibly ejected.Trump has called for the US to effectively colonise Gaza and for its population to be displaced to neighbouring countries, including Jordan and Egypt, while the territory is “developed”.“The US will take over theGazaStrip and we will do a job with it too,” he said. “We’ll own it.”Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaEgyptMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesDonald TrumpIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Tidball has physical impairments affecting all four of her limbs and had major surgeries on both her hips and legs as a child.She is speaking publicly about her experiences for the first time to highlight a report showing that disabled mothers and their children have significantly worse neonatal and postnatal NHS care than others.Speaking about the doctor’s request to open her legs, Tidball told the Guardian: “I was shocked, really, that that was their approach, rather than actually looking properly at some of my medical history and the notes around my hips.“They didn’t think about how that orthopaedic surgery might interact with birth, but also [about] carrying the baby and the way the baby was lying in uterus. They just hadn’t really thought those intersections through.”The review, authored by the academics Hannah Kuper and Danae Rodríguez Gatta, looked at 11 different studies to collate data on the health outcomes experienced by disabled mothers and their children in the UK.The authors found that disabled mothers had a 44% higher chance of having a stillbirth than others; that they were up to 69% more likely to have a caesarean section; they had up to 70% lower rates of breastfeeding; and they could have more than double the chance of having to stay in hospital longer after the birth. The findings broadly correlated with what they found in literature from across the world.The report said: “Few policies, guidance documents, or programmes appear to be in place to close the gap in maternity care for disabled women in the UK. Indeed, there is a general lack of attention on this topic in the UK.”Tidball said the findings tallied with her own experiences during pregnancy and childbirth. Though her daughter was born healthy without major complications, there were several moments at which the MP found healthcare professionals had not taken her physical disability needs into account.Every time she had blood taken, Tidball had to visit an anaesthetist to find a vein because it is difficult to find hers. She said that a mobile scanning unit, which are now being rolled out to places such as GPs’ surgeries, would have prevented this.At no point, Tidball said, did a doctor discuss with her whether she would be able to continue wearing her prosthetic leg even as her body changed during pregnancy – nor what might happen should she develop an issue such as varicose veins.Having waited weeks to see a consultant midwife, Tidball said her lowest moment during the pregnancy was when she received a call about her pregnancy from the genetic counselling service to discuss whether her child might inherit her disabilities.“I was absolutely devastated,” she said. “I wasn’t interested in talking about whether or not my baby had my disability, and so the whole tenor of having had that contact really made me feel really upset.”Then during the birth, Tidball was over-anaesthetised because the procedure to test her pain sensitivity did not account for the fact the ends of her limbs are more sensitive than the rest of her body and she has a high pain threshold. As a result, she found herself unable to use her arms during the birth and for several hours afterwards.After the birth itself, Tidball struggled to get advice on how to breastfeed given she could not hold her baby in the traditional position. “Having to be reliant on other people really took me back to being a child in body plaster, from your chest to your ankle, where you are reliant on everybody else,” she said. “That was a pretty upsetting time.”Like the report’s authors, Tidball said she wanted to see new NHS guidelines on how to care for disabled mothers and their children. These would include advice on pain management and clear pathways for expectant and new mothers to see specialists who understand their condition. They would also include providing adapted equipment to make it easier for disabled mothers to use, such as mobility aids or easy-to-fasten baby clothes.As part of her lobbying campaign, she has met the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and is hoping some of her recommended changes make it into a forthcoming report into the way the NHS works. “My vision is that we get to a situation where disabled women in this country can have adequate and high quality, inclusive maternity care,” she said.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityPregnancyChildbirthHealthLabourWomenReproductionnewsShareReuse this content"

It has a lot of education charities that would contribute towards this. I do not understand why they should not pay for their own memorial.”Ian Austin, a former Labour MP who now sits as a crossbench peer, intervened to say the memorial was not one for the Jewish community but “for everybody”.Hamilton replied: “I take that point, but the driving forces behind putting up this memorial are the Jewish people in this country. They are people who have property everywhere. I do not see why they should not fund it.”The peer added that he had “plenty of Jewish blood, and I am a member of the Conservative Friends of Israel”.Austin said afterwards that Hamilton’s comments were “completely unacceptable” and that the Conservatives should take action.He said: “How many antisemitic caricatures is it possible to get in one speech? It is shocking to hear comments like this in a debate about the Holocaust. It shows that antisemitism remains a real problem – even in parliament – but it does show why a memorial that focuses on anti-Jewish racism is still necessary.”Danny Stone, the chief executive of theAntisemitismPolicy Trust, which works with parliamentarians and others, said: “Not only were Lord Hamilton’s comments ill-judged, racist and false, they betrayed a lack of knowledge and understanding about the Jewish community and what the Holocaust memorial is for.“It is shocking that his slur was not challenged by those leading the debate. We will be working with parliamentarians to ensure this appalling rhetoric does not remain unchallenged.”Hamilton issued a statement on Wednesday evening saying he wished to withdraw his comments during the debate and apologise.“My remarks were not intended to be antisemitic and I apologise unreservedly,” he said. “With hindsight, having read my comments , I realise that my remarks were insensitive and I apologise. I intend to meet with groups from the Jewish community in order to understand how to communicate about issues affecting British Jews.”The site for the memorial and education centrewas approvedin 2021 after a public inquiry, eight years after David Cameron’s government announced the idea.While the decision was backed by many Jewish groups, some people said the decision to use a relatively small green space was mistaken. Among the opponents was the crossbench peer Ruth Deech, whose father fled the Nazis.Speaking in the same Lords debate as Hamilton, Deech said she wanted to bring some “fiscal discipline” to a project she said could now cost more than £190m.The Conservative party were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

(See12.04pm.)A full-blown trade war would pose a “substantial” threat to the British economy, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has warned.Around a dozen Labour MPs have expressed concerns about the cuts to the aid budget in a Commons debate on the Foreign Office estimates.They includedSarah Champion, chair of the Commons international development committee (see4.27pm), andEmily Thornberry,chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee. Thornberry said:I am concerned these ODA [official development assistance] cuts won’t be the last of these challenges, there are also rumours that the Foreign Office will, on top of that, be expecting cuts of between 2 and 11%. In that scenario, it would be selling its businesses, its buildings, will the embassies shrink?I’m concerned that we’ll lose the British Council which only receives 20% of it’s funding from the FCDO and generates the rest of its income itself.I trust that there will be enormous amount of work being done into the details of these cuts, but we haven’t heard anything more that aspiration at the moment as to where the other funding is going to come from.Because I fear we may be looking back at this time and we may say to ourselves, this is when Britain left the world and yet it really should be the time when we’re able to say Britain is back, and we’re back as a force for good.Something seismic has changed in the US-British relationship that will require the UK to look elsewhere for allies and accept that deals such as cooperation over the British nuclear deterrent are now in question, a former British ambassador to Washington has warned.The UK government has pledged to “unleash the North Sea’s clean energy future”, as it confirmed plans to ban new drilling licences but also unveiled proposals that could ease the tax burden on the oil and gas sector.Pregnant women should not be sent to jail unless it is “unavoidable”, according to new sentencing guidelines.TheUkraineSolidarity Campaign is holding a protest outside the US embassy in London.This is from the campaigner and journalistPaul Mason.Happening now!

For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance,” he wrote. “Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!”Trump also made clear there could be repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel’s relentless offensive response to the Hamas 7 October 2023 attacks.“To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!”Trump’s comments came hours after Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said that officials had held “ongoing talks and discussions” with Hamas officials amida shaky ceasefire deal.Leavitt told reporters that Israel had been consulted on the talks and that the US special envoy Adam Boehler “does have the authority to talk to anyone” when “American lives are at stake”.Hamas members confirmed the talks, saying there had been two direct meetings between US officials and Hamas in Doha, the Qatari capital, in recent days.“Several communications took place between Hamas and various American communication channels, the latest being with a US envoy and discussed the issue of Israeli prisoners who hold American citizenship, both the living and the deceased,” a Hamas official told AFP.Israel said it had conveyed its position on direct talks with Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said late on Wednesday, offering no further details.“Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas,” the statement from the prime minister’s office said.“Dialogue and talking to people around the world to do the best interests of the American people is something that the president has proven, is what he believes is good-faith effort to do what’s right for the American people,” Leavitt said.Axios first reported the “secret talks” with Hamas, citing two sources with direct knowledge of meetings held in Doha, Qatar, in recent weeks.The outlet called the talks “unprecedented”, noting that the US had never before engaged with Hamas and that it had declared the group a terrorist organisation in 1997.Under the terms of the hostages-for-ceasefire deal, which went into effect on 19 January, Hamas was expected to release hostages weekly in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.After six weeks, Israel and Hamas were expected to enter a second stage of the negotiations, which would make the ceasefire permanent and secure the release of the remaining hostages.But those talks have not progressed and the White House’s decision to engage directly with Hamas appears to be targeted to meet Trump’s goals of securing the release of all hostages held in Gaza.Trump has previously warned that unless they are released,there will be “hell to pay” in the region, in what appeared to be a threat directed specifically at Hamas.Israel prepares Gaza ‘hell plan’ to pile pressure on Hamas – reportsRead moreBut Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has also pressured Netanyahu to push forward with the negotiations, and was crucial in convincing the Israeli prime minister to sign the original ceasefire deal that went into effect in January.Boehler is tasked with securing the release of Americans who have been “wrongfully detained” by governments or other groups around the world. But it remains unclear whether he is discussing the release of these hostages as part of a longer-term truce, which would mark a significant increase in his authority and indicate that the US could be going around Israel to negotiate an end to the war.Witkoff, the Trump envoywho negotiated the earlier ceasefireand has now been tasked with negotiations with Russia as well, was set to travel to Doha earlier this week to meet the Qatari prime minister about the ceasefire negotiations but “canceled the trip on Tuesday night after he saw there was no progress from Hamas’ side”, a US official told Axios.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The benchmark S&P 500 increased 1.1% on Wall Street.A separate call between Trump and Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, did not lead to any larger breakthrough, however. Trudeau “largely caused the problems we have with them because of his Weak Border Policies”, Trump declared on his Truth Social platform after they spoke. “These Policies are responsible for the death of many people!”Trudeau insisted there had been improvements at the border, the US president claimed, adding that he told him this was “not good enough”.After the US imposed tariffs this week Trump,Trudeau told Trump publicly: “Even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.”During Trump’sjoint address to Congresson Tuesday evening, he acknowledged that tariffs would cause disruption. There will be “a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that”, he said.He blamed cost of living challenges on his predecessor, Joe Biden, from whom he claimed to have inherited “an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare”.TheUS economyhas, in fact, remained resilient in recent years, and inflation has fallen dramatically from its peak – at the highest level in a generation – three years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It allows companies to sue countries for lost profits caused by government action including corruption, seizure of assets or the introduction of health and environmental policies.The system wascreated in the 1960sby the World Bank. It was intended to give companies confidence to invest in poorer countries with weak political systems where they might not get a fair hearing in domestic courts.How does it work?The foreign company must put forward a case showing that the state has damaged its profits. Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals include ISDS clauses. Cases are heard by a private arbitration tribunal, and typically decided by a panel of three arbitrators – one chosen by the company, one chosen by the state and the third selected jointly.How much are the cases worth?Awards regularly amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, and some are in the billions. In 2024 the average amount awarded was$385m(£304m).  The average sum awardedis increasingand these payouts can make up a sizeable chunk of poorer countries' annual budgets.Who is involved?The fossil fuel and mining industries are the most litigious in the ISDS system, accounting formore than 30%of known cases.Most claims are brought by companies based in rich countries against the governments of developing countries. Companies registered in developed countries file81% of ISDS lawsuits, according to UN data, while developing countries have faced 62% of cases.How common is it?ISDS began as an obscure legal mechanism, averaging aboutone case a yearfor its first decade. Now, dozens are brought every year, with Guardian analysis finding more than 900 since 2013.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With litigation funders facing no risk of a counterclaim, and potential awards that now average more than $200m (£160m), legal experts warn that the system has become a “gambler’s nirvana” for hedge funds and specialist financiers.View image in fullscreenBurford Capital, the world’s largest litigation-finance firm, says it provides access to justice by supporting plaintiffs who otherwise could not afford legal action.Photograph: M4OS/AlamyWithin the sector, the debate is growing: advocates for third-party funding say it increases access to justice but critics, including arbitrators who rule on cases, are raising concerns that the growth of third-party funding is fuelling expensive and potentially frivolous cases at enormous cost to the public.A Guardian investigation, which analysed more than 1,400 cases launched against governments, found that ISDS cases have become far more common and lucrative. More than $120bn of public money was awarded to firms through ISDS courts, including at least $84bn to fossil fuel companies and $7.8bn awarded to mining companies.The true figures are likely to be far higher as companies often do not disclose the size of payouts they receive. The Guardian found that in 31% of cases where a payout or settlement was made, the size of the award was not disclosed.These cases have become an increasingly popular investment class for hedge funds and other investors, who back the legal action financially in exchange for a share of the final award. The Guardian identified at least 75 ISDS cases backed by third parties, although this too is likely to be a substantial underestimate: many treaties include no obligation to disclose third-party funding of cases, and the largest dispute-resolution body only began demanding disclosure in 2022.Half of all third-party funded cases were launched by investors from the US, Britain or Canada, and more than 50% were cases relating to fossil fuels or mining. More than three-quarters of cases were against developing countries, according to Guardian analysis of data provided byJus Mundi, a legal intelligence platform with access to the largest international law and arbitration database.Q&AHow did the Guardian analyse ISDS cases?ShowThe database created by the Guardian includes cases brought by companies against states (and, in a small number of cases, wholly state-owned enterprises) that are decided by international arbitration. These cases are governed by a range of dispute resolution systems and arbitration systems. For simplicity we refer to them as ISDS (investor-state dispute settlement) cases, which is the most commonly understood term for international arbitration between companies and countries.The Guardian analysed more than 1,400 cases, but these may only be a snapshot of the actual number of suits. Some cases are conducted entirely in secret, with no public record of their existence. Others do not disclose the way they were decided, or the size of the award.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Examples of third-party funded cases include the Bermudan company South American Silver, whose subsidiary acquiredmining concessionsin an area of Bolivia mainly inhabited by Indigenous communities. In 2010, the company was accused of polluting sacred spaces and threatening community members, and the Bolivian government revoked the concessions. The government had to pay the mining company$18.7min compensation.View image in fullscreenThe Malku Khota mine, one of the world’s largest reserves of silver, indium and gallium.

The case is expected to start in October.This year, Burford Capital – the world’s largest litigation-finance company – is backing a caseagainst Greenlandfor the impact of a uranium mining ban that a mining company argues in effect ended its development of one of the world’s largest rare earth mineral deposits. If Greenland loses the case, it faces either allowing the mining to go ahead or paying as much as $11.5bn in compensation.Fearing toxic waste, Greenland ended uranium mining. Now, they could be forced to restart - or pay $11bnRead moreConcerns are increasingly being raised by those who work within the ISDS system, including arbitrators who adjudicate cases.Muthucumaraswamy Sornarajah, an international lawyer and ISDS arbitrator, believes third-party funding has made ISDS into “big business”. He said it was likely that there were more claims being brought, because the risk of losing the claim “vanishes” for the claimant: “So it would mean that the respondent states – most of which are developing countries – would have to face the cost of defending potentially frivolous claims that are brought with third-party funding.”Sornarajah said the combination of ballooning legal fees and third-party funding meant “the extent of the business, or profits, that can be made as a result of ISDS is quite massive”.Internationally, the litigation finance industry is booming,worth $17.5bn in 2024. Supporters of third-party funding typically argue that their participation makes the justice system more accessible.Christopher Bogart, chief executive and co-founder of Burford Capital, the largest provider of litigation finance in the world, said third-party funding played an important role in providing access to justice by supporting litigants that otherwise would not be able to afford legal action. Burford Capital was the only third-party finance firm that would speak to the Guardian. The company said that as of September 2024, 93% of concluded cases generated a return for clients.“Legal finance provides a vetting function and weeds out meritless cases: we only get paid when our clients win their cases – if the cases we fund lose, we lose 100% of our money,” the company said in a statement.Bogart added: “I don’t think ISDS is any more high potential or lucrative than lots of other areas of litigation.”View image in fullscreenThe Kvanefjeld mine site near Narsaq. Greenland is being sued after it stopped Energy Transition Minerals mining rare-earth elements and uranium there.Photograph: Patrick Greenfield/GuardianBut critics warn that the rise of third-party cases is driving the growth of speculative cases. Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, said: “Third-party funding enables, or even encourages, investors to pursue claims off investors’ balance sheets, removing a key deterrent to bringing weak or speculative claims.“The litigation funders seek out and invest in cases as an opportunity to generate a return on their investments, at times partnering with law firms who have a financial interest in bringing more claims as well. This dynamic incentivises more arbitration, regardless of broader public interest or the legitimacy of the claims.”However, Burford said: “We would go out of business if we chose bad or frivolous cases and business necessity requires us to be highly selective in our investments and to back winning cases. We enable businesses that wouldn’t otherwise be able to seek justice.”Currently, arbitrators cannot financially penalise third-party funders by forcing them to cover a government’s legal costs. But some think that should change. Commenting on the case ofTeinver v Argentina, one of the arbitrators, Kamal Hossain, said in a dissenting opinion that “the creation of a ‘gambler’s Nirvana’ by allowing third-party funders to use investor-state dispute settlements as a means of financial speculation, without any possibility of making costs awards against those funders, is deeply problematic.”“The current inability of tribunals to make cost awards against third-party funders is a real and serious issue, and has attracted the concern of arbitrators in previous cases,” he said. “Their involvement may add to the costs of the proceedings. For that reason, as a matter of principle, a tribunal should be able to make a costs order against a third-party funder.”View image in fullscreenThe US-based Odyssey Marine Exploration won a payout of $37.1m from the Mexican state after it was denied a permit to mine the seabed on environmental grounds.Photograph: ReutersIn a recent dissenting opinion on the Odyssey Marine Explorationcase against Mexico, Prof Philippe Sands, one of the arbitrators, highlighted the “jaw-dropping” costs that the claimant had racked up, which amounted to more than $21m, half of which was covered by third-party funding. The investors’ costs were about 10 times that of the government in defending the claim.In a subsequent lecture, Sands raised the broader issue of third-party finance in the ISDS world, echoing concerns about how costly the system has become. “The arrangements may be said to assist in delivering a flowering of sorts: more fees for the lawyers, more cases for the arbitrators and a deeper, wider and more lucrative trough into which all of our snouts may be dipped,” he said.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsInvestor-state dispute settlementThe age of extinctionMiningEnergy industryPhilippe SandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Share prices also leapt in London, Paris and Milan amid investor hopes that a massive boost in European spending on defence and infrastructure would kickstart the region’s ailing economy.European defence stocks soar as arms makers expect orders boomRead moreDefence stocks have gained sharply in recent weeks as world leaders scramble to piece together the funding for a vast increase in military expenditure amid mounting concern over Donald Trump’s commitment to European security.The EUoutlined a plan on Tuesday to unlock almost €800bn (£670bn)for defence spending, while the UK government said last week it wouldraise its spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, two years earlier than planned, worth an additional £6bn a year.Shares in Rheinmetall, the German automotive and arms manufacturer, rose by 7.2% on Wednesday and have rocketed by 99% this year.Britain’s BAE Systems has ralliedby 41% so far this year, Italy’s Leonardo is up 73% and Paris-listed Thales has risen by 78%.The euro rose by 1.5% against the US dollar to about €1.08. The pound also gained against the dollar on a day of dramatic moves in markets, as investors also reacted to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, suggesting a deal could “probably” be reached to de-escalate Trump’s trade war with Canada and Mexico.Some analysts said there was a danger of the dollar losing its “safe-haven” status among global investors as Trump’s trade wars rattle the world’s largest economy. “The speed and scale of global shifts is so rapid that this needs to be acknowledged as a possibility,” said George Saravelos, global head of currency research at Deutsche Bank..In a sea change for economic policy after years of sticking to tough rules on government debt, Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, said on Tuesday thatdefence spending above 1% of GDP would be exemptfrom the country’s debt rule.Agreed with the centre-left Social Democrats, who are expected to form a coalition with Merz’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the plan also includes the creation of a €500bn fund to finance spending on Germany’s infrastructure over the next 10 years. Any lifting of the debt brake must command a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag.In response, Germany’s biggest construction and engineering companies posted sharp share gains on Wednesday. Cement maker Heidelberg Materials jumped by 17%, industrial services firm Bilfinger leapt by 18% and construction group Hochtief advanced by 15.5%. Engineering and steel firm ThyssenKrupp rose by 13.4%.Echoingthe words of Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank president during the eurozone debt crisis, Merz said Germany would do “whatever it takes” on defence. Under pressure to raise spending on defence from 2.1% of GDP last year, analysts at Morgan Stanley said the overall size of the German plan could reach more than €1tn.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said the plan amounted to a “really big bazooka” with potential to transform Europe’s largest economy. “They are a fiscal sea change for Germany,” he said.“The extra room for defence spending sends a clear signal to Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as well as to Germany’s European friends that Germany is serious about defending itself and helping Ukraine.”.Described as “one of the most historic paradigm shifts in German postwar history” by economists at Deutsche Bank, the deal will effectively sideline the constitutional debt brake, orschuldenbremse,for spending on defence.Introduced in 2009 byAngela Merkelafter the financial crisis, the rule, often restricting annual federal borrowing to 0.35% of GDP, had been symbolic of Germany’s strict approach to tax and spending policy.City analysts said sidelining the rule would be a gamechanger for the country’s economy amid big challenges from collapsing industrial output, weakened by slack demand and competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.“Germany was facing a potential growth trajectory heading towards zero over coming years. [The defence and infrastructure boost] catapults growth prospects closer to 1.5-2% for 2027 onwards,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a note to clients.The debt-fuelled stimulus package comes with a cost, reflected in a rise in 10-year bond yields to almost 2.7%. However, German borrowing costs still remain significantly lower than in the US and the UK, where yields have reached more than 4%.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzEuroEurozoneStock marketsBondsEuropean Central BanknewsShareReuse this content"

That’s bad news for a tournament that is supposed to unite nationsAaron TimmsWed 5 Mar 2025 08.25 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 10.56 ESTShareThe start of the run-up to a World Cup is traditionally an upbeat affair. New stadium launches, inclusion-friendly marketing and merch campaigns, the unveiling of a tournament song or quirky mascot: these are the traditional signals by which host nations announce that the big show is approaching. This time, pre-tournament preparations are taking shape a little differently. Thanks to Donald Trump and his determination to pursue economic armageddon against the US’s co-hosts, Canada and Mexico, the tone for the 2026 World Cup is being set not byShakiraor ananthropomorphic keffiyehbut by reciprocal tariffs, a flurry of cross-border insults, and crumbling diplomatic relations between the host nations. On Tuesday, Trumpconfirmedthat the US will begin imposing levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico; Canada immediately retaliated, and Mexico looks set to follow. Welcome to the Trade War World Cup; please tip your host 25% of the entrance fee on your way in. If things continue on their current course, the 2026 tournament will be the first installment of the World Cup to be co-hosted by the antagonists of an active international economic conflict.Whether things do in fact continue as they are is, of course, difficult to predict: Trump’s approach to policy is famously erratic, and the protectionism that marked his first administration was leavened by various exemptions and carve-outs to the tariffs imposed on trading partners, a cycle of aggression and moderation that could be repeated this time round. With the first match still 15 months away, there’s plenty of time for the deterioration in diplomatic relations between the co-hosts to give way to reconciliation. But as things stand today, with Trump and his cabinet lackeys apparently hellbent on trashing the global economy and humiliating traditional allies, that hope seems pretty remote. The US – which is due to host 75% of the matches during the 2026 tournament, and every fixture from the quarter-finals onwards – looks set to steam into the approaching World Cup with a spirit of hospitality roughly equivalent toRoy Keane sizing up Alf-Inge Haaland’s knee.Canada’s ice hockey win over Trump’s America was her soft power laid bare | Colin HorganRead moreTrump’s mercantile war on America’s co-hosts sends the World Cup into uncharted waters, compounding many of the existing imponderables about next year’s tournament. Tariffs on their own won’t directly affect the staging; the schedule has already been decided, so the World Cup could go ahead even if the host nations are at economic loggerheads, with each country taking care of its part of the tournament in a spirit of steadfast mutual ignorance. But an ongoing trade war would naturally make everything far more awkward. Trump wrote to Fifa during his first term, while the bids for 2026 were under assessment, to reassure officials that there would no travel bans or other restrictions in place during the tournament, and that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” That pledge is already at risk thanks to Elon Musk’s incineration of the federal government, which hasledto massive blowouts in visa processing times and could leave many fansunable to enter the US.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino and Donald Trump have become somewhat of a double act in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAdd that uncertainty to the diplomatic and economic offensive that Trump has now unleashed on the US’s neighbors, and things could quickly deteriorate. Travel for fans between the host nations seems the part of the tournament most likely to end up being affected, and there’s a very real question of how far the contagion from deteriorating diplomatic relations will spread: a breakdown in cooperation at the highest levels of government between the hosts could seriously affect logistical and security coordination, the information sharing that makes big events like theWorld Cuprun smoothly. The tournament, barring a security calamity, could probably still forge ahead in the face of such difficulties. But given the cruelty and volatility of the current US administration – plus its power to compel obsequious submission from even the leaders of the world’s most advanced economies – there’s every reason to assume the worst.Will Trump insist that Canada and Mexico somehow compensate the US for the costs of staging the tournament? Will he cook up a plan with home broadcaster Fox to refer to the US’s northern neighbor as “the state of Canada”? Could the US impose a World Cup entry tax on visitors, or force them to pay into the US’s new strategic crypto reserve? Will every foreign team competing on US soil be made to join in a special rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner? Will visiting stars have to offer up praise for the US leader during a televised World Cup struggle session in the West Wing (“Stand up, Kylian”), the way Trump’s cabinet members often have to? Could we see the Jules Rimet Trophy renamed theRoy Cohn Cup?So exceptional is the pettiness of America’s leaders that none of these scenarios seems even remotely implausible; and Trump, who in 2018threatenednations considering voting against the US’s World Cup bid with retribution, has form in this area. A tournament that should be the catalyst for soccer’s next big push into the world’s heftiest media market – and a platform for the expression of an eternal bond between the three leading nations of North America – now risks turning into a month-long dummy spit from the most childish president in US history.Fifa has given itself little authority to weigh in on the matter, given how central the US – the obvious senior partner in this coalition of hosting unequals – is to the staging of the tournament and how cravenly toadyish Gianni Infantino has been in his courting of Trump. The Fifa president, or “Johnny” as Trump calls him, has forged an alliance with his US counterpart that he defends as“absolutely crucial”to the success of the 2026 World Cup. But this is a strategy built on subordination and fealty, not a meeting of peers: from theday in 2018that Infantino yucked it up for the cameras with Trump in the Oval Office, presenting the president with a special Trump 26 jersey (“You are part of the Fifa team,” he said) and a red card that then-president of the US Soccer Federation Carlos Cordeiro joked could be useful at “the next media session” (lol!), Fifa has effectively hitched its fortunes to Trump’s, making itself a tool of the Maga project.This spineless display of loyalty is at odds with Fifa’s nominal political neutrality, but it won Infantino prime seats at this year’s Super Bowl and has turned him into a perpetual background presence in Trumpworld, where he can now be regularly found beaming vacantly off the president’s shoulder during various functions, a useful sporting idiot ready to defend the US leader to the hilt. Fifa did not exactly have much integrity to begin with, but the scale of its leader’s prostration is extraordinary. So completely has Infantino debased himself that after he witnessed Trump describe Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “dictator” at a recent event in Miami, he immediatelypraisedhis American host for promoting a message of “peace and unity”. There is no way a man this deeply in thrall to Trump and his cognitive dissolution will have any power to mend relations between 2026’s host nations. For Infantino and Fifa, it’s Trump or bust.With the global economy fracturing and the notion of American leadership of a “rules-based international order” in the trash, there’s a bigger question to confront: can football continue to be a globalizing force in a deglobalizing world? The guiding direction of the times is away from international cooperation and towards tariffs, export controls, the formation of trade blocs, and the carving out of great power spheres of interest. This retreat of nations and cultures behind protective walls is at odds with the World Cup’s abidingly sunny message of a common humanity and growing shared territory of footballing competition – not to mention the expansion of the tournament itself, which next year will swell to 48 teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Interestingly, given the current circumstances, the lead-up to that World Cup was not always smooth political sailing: most notably, Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi’s visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in 2001 fueled a diplomatic row that briefly threatened to derail the tournament. But cooler heads prevailed, tensions eased, and in retrospect cooperation between the two hosts – which included, in addition to all the regular logistical coordination, important legal breakthroughs such as the signature of a mutually binding extradition treaty – can be seen as a meaningful marker in the long road towards Japanese-Korean reconciliation. Two decades later, in the shadow of a resurgent China, détente is slowly giving way to rapprochement: cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo isdeepening, cross-border trade is on the rise, and a majority of young South Koreans nowhavea favorable view of Japan.View image in fullscreenThen Fifa president Sepp Blatter walks with Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korea’s minister of culture and tourism Nam Gung-Jung before the 2002 World Cup final.Photograph: Odd Andersen/EPACould the co-hosts of the approaching World Cup overcome today’s economic turmoil, peacefully unite in common purpose next year, and find a way to their own happy diplomatic ending? Under the Trump administration, it seems unlikely. The damage being done to what’s left of both the global order and Fifa’s credibility may be so severe that future World Cups will unfold amid a cold war-style atmosphere of mutual suspicion and sabotage. Certainly, there is nothing in the choice of Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 tournament to suggest the World Cup’s imminent liberation from the game ofglobal power, which is becoming more nakedly nativist and zero-sum with each passing week. Infantino seems totally uninterested in playing the role of a neutral broker in this new universe. The World Cup, perhaps appropriately, is becoming a football for strong nations to kick and distort to their own quixotic ends. “When I heard World Cup, I wanted to do it,” Trump told Infantino during their 2018 love-in at the White House. Now we’re getting a greater sense for how Trump might want to do it, and there’s every chance the results won’t be pretty.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupFifaGianni InfantinoUS politicsCanadaMexicoShareReuse this content"

Beijing approved 66.7GW of new coal-fired power capacity in 2024, the majority in the final months of the year. One gigawatt is the equivalent of a large coal power plant.There was also strong momentum in building new coal power.A reportpublished last month by the Global Energy Monitor and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air said China accounted for 93% of global construction starts for coal power in 2024. The report also noted that long-term power purchase agreements, which set minimum quotas for coal power bought by local governments, were slowing the integration of renewable energy into the power grid.Toledo said such trends were unnecessary and that China could quit coal while safeguarding its energy security. “Commentators outside China are increasingly puzzled at the continued containment of domestic renewable generation in future stranded coal assets,” he said.Experts say China’s rapid development of renewable energy while still building new coal-fired power plants is pitting clean and dirty energy against each other in the country’s economy.China is the global leader in renewable energy, and solar and wind installations soared to record levels last year. Solar capacity increased by 45% to 887GW and wind capacity by 18% to 521GW.China has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and many experts predict it willreach that target ahead of schedule.Zhang Xiaoye, a scholar from the Chinese Academy of Engineering and co-chair of one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s working groups, said on Wednesday that the total amount of electricity produced by renewable energy in China last year was equal to the total amount of electricity produced in the US. He stressed the need for the EU and China to cooperate to achieve “blue skies and clean water”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One night in Paris changed that. The Liverpool goalkeeper gave the performance of a lifetime, by his own admission, to ensure Paris Saint-Germain’s dominance came to nothing. Harvey Elliott applied theécraser et attraper. That’s smash and grab, to you and me.Liverpool could have been buried in the first half of the first leg alone. Luis Enrique’s young, fast and vibrant team squandered several clear chances and bemoaned the decision not to dismiss Ibrahima Konaté for denying Bradley Barcola a clear goalscoring opportunity. Even Slot admitted that was a close call.‘The best goalkeeper in the world’: Arne Slot hails Alisson’s Paris masterclassRead moreBut Alisson stood tall throughout. The 32-year-old has been well protected by his defence this season. Not here. How Liverpool needed their world-class keeper, the man whose latesave against Napolikept Jürgen Klopp’s team on course to become European champions in 2019.Alisson produced nine saves to drive PSG to despair, a record for a Liverpool goalkeeper in aChampions Leaguefixture and the most the Brazil international has made in any game for the club. He was even involved in the grand larceny of Elliott’s late winner, struck 47 seconds after the substitute had entered the pitch. Alisson’s long ball was gathered well by another impressive substitute, Darwin Núñez, who laid the ball into the path of Elliott to strike a clinical finish past Gianluigi Donnarumma. It was the only time the PSG crowd fell silent all night. A goalless draw would have felt scant reward for their team’s efforts.Parc des Princes provided a spectacular backdrop to the meeting of the free-scoring French champions and runaway Premier League leaders. The home crowd were in fine voice long before the teams entered a cauldron of noise and pyrotechnics. After the fire came the fury for PSG of two big calls going against them in the first half, laced with widespread disbelief at the absence of a comprehensive lead. Alisson, semi-automated VAR and PSG profligacy were the reasons why.Liverpool were dominated for almost the entirety of the opening period as Luis Enrique’s team dictated play and stretched the visiting defence time and again. Slot had predicted PSG’s front three of Barcola, Ousmane Dembélé and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia would pose a similar test to Manchester City with their speed and movement. Unlike therecent win at the Etihad Stadium, however, his team struggled in its collective attempts to contain them. Nor did Liverpool combine containment with a cutting edge. Donnarumma was a virtual spectator in the PSG goal throughout a first half in which Liverpool had no attempts on target. His opposite number was overworked by comparison but produced an unforgettable shift.PSG went man-to-man in midfield with Vitinha sitting deep on Dominik Szoboszlai, Fabián Ruiz denying Ryan Gravenberch space to break the lines and João Neves stifling Alexis Mac Allister’s influence. They spent more time toying with Liverpool in possession.Neves should have opened the scoring when Dembélé turned on the afterburners to leave Andy Robinson and Mac Allister in his rearview mirror. The revitalised forward picked out the unmarked Neves from the byline but the midfielder scuffed his shot into the ground and over.View image in fullscreenAlisson makes one of a number of saves that earned him the player of the match award.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersAnother brilliant run from Dembélé resulted in a corner when his shot looped off Virgil van Dijk and over Alisson. The Liverpool keeper clawed away the set piece only for Neves to pick out Kvaratskhelia on the right of the penalty area. The January signing from Napoli curled an exquisite finish inside Alisson’s far corner. It was a fabulous finish, but disallowed for a tight offside against the goalscorer’s calf.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Contact occurred outside the area but VAR checked a possible red-card offence by Konaté. It eventually stuck with the on-field referee’s decision not to penalise Liverpool’s last man.The let-offs did not spark a reaction from Liverpool. The visitors remained encamped on the back foot, struggling to match PSG’s sharpness on the ball or energy off it. Alisson denied Dembélé with an outstretched foot when he was played through by Barcola’s cute ball. He then made a superb reaction save, adjusting his feet and getting down low to his left to tip away a Kvaratskhelia effort that was destined for the bottom corner.Slot’s half-time instructions did little to turn the tide either. Waves of PSG attacks kept coming. Alisson kept repelling them, the Brazil international making another vital intervention when the mesmerising Kvaratskhelia swept a free-kick from 25 yards towards the far corner.Liverpool managed to restrict PSG to shots from distance in the closing stages but Désiré Doué almost punctured their resistance. The substitute’s strike arced towards the far corner only for the Brazilian to brilliantly thwart PSG with his fingertips yet again. He also scooped away a Dembélé attempt before delivering one final blow to the disbelieving French champions with his part in Elliott’s winner. Anfield awaits the return with bated breath.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Stevens launched the fund to reward American athletes for sacrificing other opportunities to train for an opportunity to represent Team USA.“Team USA athletes, extraordinary individuals, have proven they can achieve greatness and represent our incredible country with pride,” Stevens said in a statement. “The Stevens Awards honor the sacrifices they have made on behalf of all Americans while inspiring the development of their dreams in the post-Games chapter of their lives.“Several athletes at the 2024 Paris Games said the perception of sponsorship and endorsement payments sustaining amateurs is accurate only for the best known of Team USA members, such as gymnast Simone Biles or swimmer Katie Ledecky. An estimated 90% of Team USA athletes participating in the Olympic and Paralympic Games are paid only small stipends and describe economic stability as “paycheck to paycheck”.All Team USA athletes would be eligible to receive the “Stevens Financial Security Award”, the USOPC said.A one-time Olympic participant is eligible to receive $100,000 over a four-year period 20 years after their qualifying Games or when they turn 45, whichever is later. A two-time US Olympian or Paralympics athlete would be eligible for $400,000 in post-career benefits, increasing another $200,000 for a three-time participant to $600,000.Designated athlete beneficiaries also will receive $100,000 upon their death.“Because of Ross’ extraordinary generosity and philanthropic creativity, we can create more than a financial safety net,” USOPC chairman Gene Sykes said in a statement. “We can build a springboard that will propel these athletes to even greater heights beyond their Olympic and Paralympic careers.”The USOPC is a “mission driven non-profit” and receives no government funding. Multiple US athletes said in Paris they pay five figures for coaching, lodging, food, gym access and related Olympics-training expenses.The most successful US athletes have made six-figure salaries using appearance fees, corporate sponsorship and other endorsements. Winning is the only other route to a guaranteed USOPC payment. Men’s swimmer Caeleb Dressel received $187,500 total for his five Gold medals at the Tokyo Games.The USOPC pays Team USA medalists $37,500 for winning gold, $22,500 for silver and third-place or bronze finishers take home $15,000.The 2024 commission on the State of the U.S. Olympics & Paralympics found 26.5% of high-performance American athletes earn an annual total of less than $15,000 a year and more than one-third of athletes earn less than $25,000 per year.Explore more on these topicsUSA Olympic teamUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He is the undisputed world No 1, who this week will chase a third Arnold Palmer Invitational in four attempts. The Texan used pre-tournament media duties at Bay Hill to reveal he is fallible, including in dramatic circumstances to an amateur friend with whom he faced off in Dallas at the weekend.‘I’ve just changed my life’: ex-biker gang member books place at the OpenRead more“He holed a bunker shot on 18 to win,” the 28-year-old explained. “I got out of the way because I thought he could potentially shank it and he ended up holing it. So it was kind of one of those.“I didn’t like losing. I handed him the money and then I told him: ‘Thanks, man. Now I got to go play a golf tournament next week so I appreciate the confidence boost that I just lost to a 10 handicap.’”It should be noted that the double Masters champion was laughing in self-deprecating fashion when recounting this tale. “I still love cutting it up with my buddies on weekends, playing money games and gambling,” he added. “That’s kind of one of the great things about golf, I can go out with a guy who is going to shoot 90 and I can give him enough strokes to where we’ll have a good competition. That’s what makes it so fun about the game of golf. I don’t think my position has ever changed on that, it’s always just been really fun.”Professional golf finds itself in such a pickle that it requires these light-hearted episodes. Another past Arnold Palmer champion, Rory McIlroy, sounded distinctly downbeat on the prospect of imminent reunification between the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV circuit and golf’s traditional tours. Talks between the relevant parties took place at the White House last month; the word around the Bay Hill campfire is that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund was not altogether enamoured by what appeared on offer.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy takes cover with his caddie and playing partner Nate Bargatze during the Arnold Palmer Invitational pro-am.Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images“It takes two to tango,” said McIlroy. “So if one party is willing and ready and the other isn’t, it sort of makes it tough. I don’t think it [unification] has ever felt that close but it doesn’t feel like it’s any closer.”The Northern Irishman believes the PGA Tour now has sufficient margin for error that concluding a successful negotiation may not be required. “I think the narrative around golf would welcome a deal in terms of just having all the best players together again,” McIlroy explained. “But I don’t think the PGA Tourneedsa deal. I think the momentum is pretty strong.“TV [ratings] have been good, TGL [the tech-infused golf league launched by McIlroy and Tiger Woods] has been hopefully pretty additive to the overall situation. I think it would still be the ideal scenario for golf as a whole. But from a pure PGA Tour perspective, I don’t think it necessarilyneedsit.”McIlroy has made some equipment changes as he glances towards Augusta National and the opening major of the year, which is now little over a month away. Bay Hill’s demanding setup will offer those clubs little time to bed in.“Arnold would write me a letter pretty much every year from when I was eligible to play the event, I think in 2010, and I didn’t make it here until 2015,” said McIlroy of Palmer, who died in 2016. “I think there was one point where he said he was going to break my arm if I didn’t come, so eventually I did. As soon as I got here and saw the golf course, I instantly regretted that I didn’t come a little sooner, because it’s a golf course that sets up really, really well for me. I’ve obviously done pretty well here with the win and a lot of other good finishes. It’s a great event.”Explore more on these topicsScottie SchefflerGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s bad news for a tournament that is supposed to unite nationsAaron TimmsWed 5 Mar 2025 08.25 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 10.56 ESTShareThe start of the run-up to a World Cup is traditionally an upbeat affair. New stadium launches, inclusion-friendly marketing and merch campaigns, the unveiling of a tournament song or quirky mascot: these are the traditional signals by which host nations announce that the big show is approaching. This time, pre-tournament preparations are taking shape a little differently. Thanks to Donald Trump and his determination to pursue economic armageddon against the US’s co-hosts, Canada and Mexico, the tone for the 2026 World Cup is being set not byShakiraor ananthropomorphic keffiyehbut by reciprocal tariffs, a flurry of cross-border insults, and crumbling diplomatic relations between the host nations. On Tuesday, Trumpconfirmedthat the US will begin imposing levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico; Canada immediately retaliated, and Mexico looks set to follow. Welcome to the Trade War World Cup; please tip your host 25% of the entrance fee on your way in. If things continue on their current course, the 2026 tournament will be the first installment of the World Cup to be co-hosted by the antagonists of an active international economic conflict.Whether things do in fact continue as they are is, of course, difficult to predict: Trump’s approach to policy is famously erratic, and the protectionism that marked his first administration was leavened by various exemptions and carve-outs to the tariffs imposed on trading partners, a cycle of aggression and moderation that could be repeated this time round. With the first match still 15 months away, there’s plenty of time for the deterioration in diplomatic relations between the co-hosts to give way to reconciliation. But as things stand today, with Trump and his cabinet lackeys apparently hellbent on trashing the global economy and humiliating traditional allies, that hope seems pretty remote. The US – which is due to host 75% of the matches during the 2026 tournament, and every fixture from the quarter-finals onwards – looks set to steam into the approaching World Cup with a spirit of hospitality roughly equivalent toRoy Keane sizing up Alf-Inge Haaland’s knee.Canada’s ice hockey win over Trump’s America was her soft power laid bare | Colin HorganRead moreTrump’s mercantile war on America’s co-hosts sends the World Cup into uncharted waters, compounding many of the existing imponderables about next year’s tournament. Tariffs on their own won’t directly affect the staging; the schedule has already been decided, so the World Cup could go ahead even if the host nations are at economic loggerheads, with each country taking care of its part of the tournament in a spirit of steadfast mutual ignorance. But an ongoing trade war would naturally make everything far more awkward. Trump wrote to Fifa during his first term, while the bids for 2026 were under assessment, to reassure officials that there would no travel bans or other restrictions in place during the tournament, and that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” That pledge is already at risk thanks to Elon Musk’s incineration of the federal government, which hasledto massive blowouts in visa processing times and could leave many fansunable to enter the US.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino and Donald Trump have become somewhat of a double act in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAdd that uncertainty to the diplomatic and economic offensive that Trump has now unleashed on the US’s neighbors, and things could quickly deteriorate. Travel for fans between the host nations seems the part of the tournament most likely to end up being affected, and there’s a very real question of how far the contagion from deteriorating diplomatic relations will spread: a breakdown in cooperation at the highest levels of government between the hosts could seriously affect logistical and security coordination, the information sharing that makes big events like theWorld Cuprun smoothly. The tournament, barring a security calamity, could probably still forge ahead in the face of such difficulties. But given the cruelty and volatility of the current US administration – plus its power to compel obsequious submission from even the leaders of the world’s most advanced economies – there’s every reason to assume the worst.Will Trump insist that Canada and Mexico somehow compensate the US for the costs of staging the tournament? Will he cook up a plan with home broadcaster Fox to refer to the US’s northern neighbor as “the state of Canada”? Could the US impose a World Cup entry tax on visitors, or force them to pay into the US’s new strategic crypto reserve? Will every foreign team competing on US soil be made to join in a special rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner? Will visiting stars have to offer up praise for the US leader during a televised World Cup struggle session in the West Wing (“Stand up, Kylian”), the way Trump’s cabinet members often have to? Could we see the Jules Rimet Trophy renamed theRoy Cohn Cup?So exceptional is the pettiness of America’s leaders that none of these scenarios seems even remotely implausible; and Trump, who in 2018threatenednations considering voting against the US’s World Cup bid with retribution, has form in this area. A tournament that should be the catalyst for soccer’s next big push into the world’s heftiest media market – and a platform for the expression of an eternal bond between the three leading nations of North America – now risks turning into a month-long dummy spit from the most childish president in US history.Fifa has given itself little authority to weigh in on the matter, given how central the US – the obvious senior partner in this coalition of hosting unequals – is to the staging of the tournament and how cravenly toadyish Gianni Infantino has been in his courting of Trump. The Fifa president, or “Johnny” as Trump calls him, has forged an alliance with his US counterpart that he defends as“absolutely crucial”to the success of the 2026 World Cup. But this is a strategy built on subordination and fealty, not a meeting of peers: from theday in 2018that Infantino yucked it up for the cameras with Trump in the Oval Office, presenting the president with a special Trump 26 jersey (“You are part of the Fifa team,” he said) and a red card that then-president of the US Soccer Federation Carlos Cordeiro joked could be useful at “the next media session” (lol!), Fifa has effectively hitched its fortunes to Trump’s, making itself a tool of the Maga project.This spineless display of loyalty is at odds with Fifa’s nominal political neutrality, but it won Infantino prime seats at this year’s Super Bowl and has turned him into a perpetual background presence in Trumpworld, where he can now be regularly found beaming vacantly off the president’s shoulder during various functions, a useful sporting idiot ready to defend the US leader to the hilt. Fifa did not exactly have much integrity to begin with, but the scale of its leader’s prostration is extraordinary. So completely has Infantino debased himself that after he witnessed Trump describe Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “dictator” at a recent event in Miami, he immediatelypraisedhis American host for promoting a message of “peace and unity”. There is no way a man this deeply in thrall to Trump and his cognitive dissolution will have any power to mend relations between 2026’s host nations. For Infantino and Fifa, it’s Trump or bust.With the global economy fracturing and the notion of American leadership of a “rules-based international order” in the trash, there’s a bigger question to confront: can football continue to be a globalizing force in a deglobalizing world? The guiding direction of the times is away from international cooperation and towards tariffs, export controls, the formation of trade blocs, and the carving out of great power spheres of interest. This retreat of nations and cultures behind protective walls is at odds with the World Cup’s abidingly sunny message of a common humanity and growing shared territory of footballing competition – not to mention the expansion of the tournament itself, which next year will swell to 48 teams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Interestingly, given the current circumstances, the lead-up to that World Cup was not always smooth political sailing: most notably, Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi’s visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in 2001 fueled a diplomatic row that briefly threatened to derail the tournament. But cooler heads prevailed, tensions eased, and in retrospect cooperation between the two hosts – which included, in addition to all the regular logistical coordination, important legal breakthroughs such as the signature of a mutually binding extradition treaty – can be seen as a meaningful marker in the long road towards Japanese-Korean reconciliation. Two decades later, in the shadow of a resurgent China, détente is slowly giving way to rapprochement: cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo isdeepening, cross-border trade is on the rise, and a majority of young South Koreans nowhavea favorable view of Japan.View image in fullscreenThen Fifa president Sepp Blatter walks with Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korea’s minister of culture and tourism Nam Gung-Jung before the 2002 World Cup final.Photograph: Odd Andersen/EPACould the co-hosts of the approaching World Cup overcome today’s economic turmoil, peacefully unite in common purpose next year, and find a way to their own happy diplomatic ending? Under the Trump administration, it seems unlikely. The damage being done to what’s left of both the global order and Fifa’s credibility may be so severe that future World Cups will unfold amid a cold war-style atmosphere of mutual suspicion and sabotage. Certainly, there is nothing in the choice of Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 tournament to suggest the World Cup’s imminent liberation from the game ofglobal power, which is becoming more nakedly nativist and zero-sum with each passing week. Infantino seems totally uninterested in playing the role of a neutral broker in this new universe. The World Cup, perhaps appropriately, is becoming a football for strong nations to kick and distort to their own quixotic ends. “When I heard World Cup, I wanted to do it,” Trump told Infantino during their 2018 love-in at the White House. Now we’re getting a greater sense for how Trump might want to do it, and there’s every chance the results won’t be pretty.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupFifaGianni InfantinoUS politicsCanadaMexicoShareReuse this content"

For Vincent Kompany’s side are cruising to the Bundesliga title and now they are cruising to the Champions League quarter-finals too. They may well sign Bayer Leverkusen’s best player in the summer, but here they played him off the park. It smells like game over, and in more senses than one.This week the Bayern director of sport, Max Eberl, made an eye-catching comparison. He compared Alonso and Kompany to Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp, the coaching duopoly that shaped modern football for almost a decade. Bit soon for all that, most people reckoned, but it feels just a little less fanciful now. The bloke who got Burnley relegated to the Championship may just be the next big thing in European coaching.Raphinha strike and Szczesny saves help 10-man Barcelona edge BenficaRead moreAlonso himself may well be on his way to more moneyed pastures soon, and so perhaps this is the end of a golden chapter in Germany’s great new rivalry, its new superclasico. After three inconclusive instalments of this epic duel already this season, the fourth was utterly unequivocal; the fifth next week will probably end up being an afterthought. And while Alonso’s Leverkusen have been rattled before, while they have been beaten before, not since theEuropa League final in Mayhave they been outmanoeuvred like this, frustrated to the point of genuine head-loss.And Bayern were good value for this too, throttling Leverkusen’s strikerless threat well before the raw Matej Kovar dropped a simple cross and the wretched Nordi Mukiele was dismissed for a second yellow card. Harry Kane – subjected to a little local criticism of late for his attacking work rate – offered the perfect response by brilliantly heading in the first goal and smashing in the last. A defence well protected by Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka gave up just three shots.Above all Bayern were just smarter, positionally disciplined and physically dominant, well prepared for Leverkusen’s game of organised chaos. There is of course a danger in explaining away everything through tactics. You can lose with a great tactical plan and win with a bad one. But as Bayern slowly turned the screw, you could see how far Kompany has already developed as a coach, even in the nine months he has been here.There was a clear Guardiola influence in the way the full-backs tapered inwards to snuff out the counter, in the way Kompany opted for the pure straight-line speed of Kingsley Coman over Leroy Sané or Serge Gnabry on the left. On the other wing, he has in Michael Olise a player currently reaching at the limits of his talents and grasping only fresh air. There are times during this stunning breakthrough season when Olise has touched Arjen Robben levels. That is not hyperbole.“It was our fault,” Alonso said afterwards. “Today everything went against us. We were ready for a hard game, but we did not control the small details and so our pain was self-inflicted.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane outjumps the Leverkusen defence to put Munich ahead.Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty ImagesDid Bayern score a little psychological blow by so publicly stepping up their pursuit of Florian Wirtz this week? Certainly Wirtz cut a subdued figure this evening : aggressively man-marked by Kimmich, his lines of supply cut off, Leverkusen simply not getting enough of the ball to allow him an influence. Amine Adli, deployed up front alongside Wirtz, has started just five times this season through injury and looked unsuited to a game of this intensity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alonso has been rotating him and Lukas Hradecky in and out of the starting lineup all season, with a clear view to Kovar taking over at some point. But throwing him into aChampions Leagueknockout at the Allianz was a huge gamble, and as Jamal Musiala pounced gleefully on his fumbled cross, it was a gamble that had clearly failed.Leverkusen pretty much self-destructed after that. A pointless petty challenge on Coman by Mukiele gave Michael Oliver no choice but to show a red; Edmond Tapsoba came on and immediately grappled Kane to the ground to give away a penalty.And yet. In the dying seconds João Palhinha missed an open goal to make it 4-0 after a sublime piece of skill by Musiala. Was that the moment that left the door open? “It’s not over until it’s over,” Alonso said defiantly. And despite everything, you would rather a tiny sliver of hope than none at all.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBayern MunichBayer Leverkusenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Eilish McColgan was subject toa wave of body shaming abusethis week with people posting that she “looks like a skeleton” and had anorexia, and Hunter Bell called for more to be done to protect sportswomen.The 31-year-old was one of the feelgood stories of 2024 as she went from her full-time job in cybersecurity to the podium in Paris, smashing the British 1500m record by running 3min 52.61sec along the way. But she said her success has led to her being targeted more.‘Stop the abuse’: Liz McColgan hits back at online criticism of daughter EilishRead moreAsked whether social media could be a quite a nasty place, Hunter Bell said: “It definitely is. I have had to get quite a thick skin quite quickly, ever since last summer. The majority of people are really supportive but there is a really dark side of social media where people write things about you, about your body, about how you look, about what they think of you, your performance. It’s hard when they’re directed to you.“Sometimes I’ll have people direct messaging me things and it is something that does need to stop. I know Eilish has spoken about it. It is a really tough one, because it drains a lot of your energy. You only have so much and when you’re trying to focus on winning races, it’s tough to respond to every comment and look at them.”Asked about whether athletics needed to adopt the AI threat matrix used by the Women’s Tennis Association to stop harassment on social media and in public, Hunter Bell said abuse is “definitely something that needs to stop”.“I try to just see it as a compliment almost. That’s what my husband, George, tells me to do. Because, when you get to a certain level, people think they can say what they want, that you’re fair game. It’s not nice, but it just proves people have got something to be angry about.“I might do a post in the morning if I’ve got a race and then I won’t go on social media all day. Because you can see something and it can just really affect you and hit you in a strange spot.”Hunter Bell is the headline name in the British team for the European Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn, which start on Thursday evening. After quitting her day job to become a professional athlete – having initially taken a sabbatical in May to train full-time for the Olympics – she believes she is in shape to win her first gold medal.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell is hugely grateful for the guidance of her training partner Keely Hodgkinson.Photograph: J Kruger/British Athletics/Getty Images“After Paris, I thought, ‘I owe it to myself just to see what I’m capable of over these next four years in the run up to LA,’” she said. “Luckily, work was very understanding. They had a sweepstake, apparently, about whether I would come back or not.“When I left in May, they said, ‘Oh, well, you know, even if you get a medal, we’ll still want you back.’ I didn’t think at that point I would get a medal, so I said, ‘I’ll definitely be back.’ And then they were tuning in with everyone. They did watch parties and stuff together and they were just super supportive.

It’s mainly a mindset shift, and she worked with a sports psychologist to change that mindset from seeing yourself as a medallist to seeing yourself as a winner.“It’s something that I’m going to explore this year as well.

The home nations believe that collaboration and a strong track record will give them a fighting chance of securing the UK its first major global football tournament since 1966.Mark Bullingham, the CEO of the English FA, said the success of the women’s Euros in England in 2022 had proven Britain’s credentials.“Hosting the Fifa Women’s World Cup in 2035 would be an honour,” he said. “We strongly believe that we could organise a fantastic tournament, building on the success of the Uefa Women’s Euro in 2022 and the subsequent rapid growth of the women’s game in England.“We’re excited about the opportunity to welcome the world, and hosting participating nations and fans in sold-out stadiums. There is outstanding support for the women’s game in this country and we want to maximise this, not only for women’s and girls’ football here but also for the benefit of the global game.”View image in fullscreenWales, who qualified for their first major women’s tournament by reaching Euro 2025, are one of four home nations in the bid.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesThe prime minister gave his full support to the bid in a statement, arguing football was a key part of British identity. “Whether we watch on TV, play at the weekends like I do, or simply enjoy soaking up the atmosphere in the pub, it brings communities together like little else,” he said.“That pride was on full display when England hosted Uefa Women’s Euro 2022. It not only showed the best of our nation to the world but inspired a generation of girls into the game, all whilst boosting the economy. The Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035 on home turf would be another monumental moment in our sporting history, driving growth and leaving a lasting legacy. The FA’s intention to bid has my government’s full support.”The Scottish, Welsh and Irish FAs said that the goal of driving continued growth in the women’s game was behind their 2035 ambitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some estimates suggest the winning club in the 32-team tournament could take home as much as $100m (£77.5m); this would be equivalent to winning the Uefa Champions League, but after playing only seven matches.World Cup 2026 final to get half-time show with planning input from ColdplayRead moreSpeculation over the size of Fifa’s prize pot has persisted since the organisers launched the tournament as a new and controversial fixture in the international calendar.Fifasubsequently announced a $1bn broadcast deal with Dazn last year, with the streamer earning exclusive rights to all matches over the four-week tournament. European teams will form the largest contingent at the Club World Cup with 12 sides set to take part.Fifa are committed to keeping all revenues from the tournament inside the club game. Operational costs are included as part of the expenditure, but solidarity payments to clubs who did not earn an invitation to the tournament will also be part of the picture. The final sum of any solidarity fund is to be determined later once the revenues generated by the tournament have been confirmed, but the target is to share a quarter of a billion dollars.A statement from Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, read: “The Fifa Club World Cup will not only be the pinnacle of club football, but also a vivid demonstration of solidarity that will benefit clubs at large to a scale that no other competition has ever done. All revenue generated by the tournament will be distributed to the participating clubs and via club solidarity across the world as Fifa will not keep a single dollar.

On other days it was harder for us but today we hung on and defended really well.”Szczesny’s brilliant night started 30 seconds after kick-off, when Pavlidis recovered the ball and fed Kerem Akturkoglu inside the box. He fired a low strike that the 34-year-old kept out with a one-handed save.The visiting keeper ended up making eight saves, five of those in the second half when Benfica piled on the pressure with over 60% of possession and 15 goal attempts. Barça had only a couple, with Raphinha netting with their only shot on target in the second half.Szczesny’s magic included a stunning reflex save to deny Fredrik Aursnes from close range early on after the break and an excellent stop to palm away Renato Sanches’s bullet strike from the edge of the box four minutes into added time.“It’s a bad result, we had good chances today, especially when they got the red card … It’s a very disappointing result,” Aursnes told Benfica TV. “We created a lot of chances, but unfortunately we didn’t manage to score and paid a heavy price for that.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueBenficaBarcelonamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Fonseca angrily confronted Millot during his team’s 2-1 league victory over Brest on Sunday.Madrid and Marseille lead anti-referee epidemic but no officials means no game | Max RushdenRead moreThe LFP said in a statement that Fonseca will be barred from accessing the dugout, the officials’ dressing rooms, and participating in any official functions before, during or after matches until 30 November. Lyon have confirmed they will appeal the verdict, which was announced on their head coach’s 52nd birthday.The Ligue 1 side have said they are concerned by the severity of the sanction imposed on Fonseca, and described his behaviour as an emotional reaction without intent to harm the referee. “In light of a sanction that seems to have been dictated by the negative context affecting French refereeing, [Lyon] announce it is studying all possible avenues of appeal,” the statement added.Fonsecawas shown a red cardduring Sunday’s match after a review of a potential penalty for Brest, which the Brittany team were not awarded. The Portuguese coach was dismissed for his “intimidating attitude”, according to Millot.The referee claimed thatFonseca then escalated the confrontation: “He had an even more intense attitude, attempting to deliver a blow, in fact. A head-butt.” Fonseca, who only took over as Lyon manager in January having left Milan a month before, apologised for his reaction after the game.The French referees’ union said last week its members would exercise their right to resign if they or their families were in danger. That came after a match official faced an alleged “outpouring of hatred” following comments made by the Marseille president, Pablo Longoria.

Only 10 days have passed since he was tasked with leading the club that forged him and it was a delicious twist of fate that Inter, contributors to a formative moment in his playing career, posed his firstChampions Leaguetest. This proved a harsh introduction to the sharper end of management and it will be a shock for the ages if a depleted Feyenoord, willing but callow, can turn around a two-goal deficit at San Siro next week.Inter simply weathered an early storm and, summoning the poise and wisdom that so often helps Serie A sides dismiss irritating arrivistes, brought their potent strike force to bear. Marcus Thuram and Lautaro Martínez finished clinically either side of half-time and at this point it would be a stretch to claim Piotr Zielinski’s missed penalty may be consequential. While Milan had fallen here in the playoffs and been humbled in the return leg too, their city rivals simply looked a level above when it mattered. The weaker half of the draw may soon open up for Simone Inzaghi’s team.Kane at the double as Bayern ease to first-leg win against 10-man LeverkusenRead more“The boys gave their all and I can’t ask for more,” said Van Persie, who will require time to revive the glow of Arne Slot’s reign. “I’m not a coach that puts the focus on winning a game too much. I put the focus on energy, body language and leaving everything you’ve got on the pitch.”While reality eventually bit hard, there had been an epic quality to the buildup. The sun shimmered over this city’s snaking waterways while vessels hauled their freight this way and that along the arteries that keep a continent in motion. As the light receded, focus was concentrated on the curves of a venue with no equivalent in Europe. Sound courses around this uncompromising, sweeping yet intimate, cauldron with the ferocity of cyclists hurtling round the bends in a velodrome. It reached guttural, feverish levels as Van Persie and his players emerged. This could be Rotterdam and nowhere else.Van Persie knows better than most what happened in April 2002, when Feyenoord’s home staged one of its most famous nights. Inter were overcome in a Uefa Cup semi-final, a certain 18-year-old forward setting up the first goal for Pierre van Hooijdonk, andFeyenoordproceeded to win the trophy. The rangy-looking left winger who started that game could barely have countenanced overseeing the chance to do it all over again.View image in fullscreenFeyenoord coach Robin van Persie applauds the home fans at the De Kuip after the defeat.Photograph: Olaf Kraak/EPAInitially it appeared Feyenoord might seize it. They were missing 16 players through injury, suspension or ineligibility, Van Persie inheriting a personnel crisis along with his dream job, but began with the sharpness their head coach had detected in training. His tenure had begun with a goalless draw against NEC but Ibrahim Osman, a livewire left winger on loan from Brighton, came close in the third minute with a shot that Josep Martínez parried wide.Feyenoord needed to make those early moments count. They won five corners in the first 20 minutes, that pumped-up support doing its job, but their old boy Stefan de Vrij was a towering presence in the backline and Inter rarely felt more than mild concern. The attacks kept coming but Igor Paixão, scourge of theRossoneri, was never afforded the space to inflict a similar level of damage.Instead Inter, their pack lightly shuffled by Inzaghi with an eye on domestic title concerns, assumed a level of command without sparkling. Thuram and Martínez had flickered slightly before Denzel Dumfries, a Sparta Rotterdam alumnus, teed up Nicolò Barella for a cross that dipped teasingly towards the six-yard box. The Feyenoord defence had not kept track of Thuram, who contorted in mid-air and could divert a difficult volley high into the roof of the net with the outside of his right foot.Saves by Timon Wellenreuther from Martínez and Kristjan Asllani stopped Inter turning the screw before half-time. Five minutes after the restart, though, he was powerless to prevent the Argentinian flattening a mood that had hitherto retained its buoyancy. Alessandro Bastoni is not a natural left wing-back but marauded inside to feed Zielinski, who eventually found Martínez for an immaculate first touch and thrashed finish that effectively placed one foot in the quarter-finals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their team tried to channel the relevant Chumbawamba hit and Jakub Moder, gloriously placed, sidefooted wastefully high after another searing run from Osman. Their public rediscovered its voice when Weidenreuther repelled Zielinski’s spot-kick, awarded through a VAR check after the struggling deputy right-back Jeyland Mitchell had fouled Thuram, but could not manifest any lifelines at the other end.“We know we’re in a challenging phase but that’s not why we lost,” Van Persie said. “The players who played are really good players who we all believe in. We’re still in the game.” His beloved Feyenoord are firmly back on the map but may, for all his trademark optimism, need longer before reviving the spirit of 23 years ago.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueFeyenoordInternazionalematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Yet Amorim insisted that even an absence from Europe would not prevent players from coming to Old Trafford and said that there are “more important things” than lifting trophies.“It is not the crucial thing for the future of the club, but I understand that it is a massive difference in our season, especially because we are out of the cups and in a bad position in the league,” Amorim said.“It will change a lot of things, even the way they see the coach. So I know that is a massive pressure. But I will say it again: Manchester United can call the best players even without Champions League in the future. We have to change a lot of things and we are trying to do that. There are more important things than to win cups in this moment, that is my feeling. But I understand that winning theEuropa Leaguecan change everything.”The Portuguese is without 11 first-team players in Spain, with Harry Maguire and Manuel Ugarte joining the injury list after picking up issues in theFA Cup defeat by Fulhamon Sunday.Amorim had previously said that he did not know if he would be part of the club’s long-term future but insisted here that he has the self-belief to continue. “What I mean[t] is that we have to think, as a club, about a long project, on sorting things out,” he said.“We are in a bad position and if we win the Europa League we would not be in an amazing position. The problems would continue even in the Champions League. I know you guys: I am really confident in the people in the club; I am just trying to show the big picture.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I know what to do. Sometimes there are a lack of results and you have to win. I know the consequences if you don’t win. I am a little more frustrated than I was since day one, but I am confident.”“I think it is quite simple: we talk about a system but it is not a system. I don’t see football like that. The problem with our team is not the system. We have a lot of problems and we are trying to work on those problems. It is really clear. I am still really confident because I have an idea of how to play. I will not change that no matter what. And I am not talking about a system, I am talking about an idea of football.”“We are going to do it,” he said at the end, applying a pause before adding: “Or not, we will see.” And then he got up and walked out of the room, exiting to the left.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimReal SociedadEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

While Chelsea relished in home comforts on this occasion, registering their 14th WSL win of the season againstLeicester, Gareth Taylor’s side faltered and could only return from Dagenham with a point against a resilientWest Ham. Their 1-1 draw means they now sit 12 points off the top of the table.Fifa launches new Women’s Champions Cup but delays Women’s Club World CupRead moreTaylor cut a frustrated figure as his side failed to hold on to a 1-0 lead against the Hammers. A 91st-minute equaliser from Manuela Paví cancelled out Khadija Shaw’s opener to the delight of the hosts. Injury and loading caused both managers to change personnel, with the visitors in particular looking out of sorts.Rehanne Skinner’s side started with intensity, the aggressive press of their attacking players causing issues for City’s defence. Many developing sides might have wilted after the kind of defeat they had suffered at Arsenal just three days previously but, if there was any loss of confidence, it did not show. They had the best opportunities of the first half with Seraina Piubel stinging the gloves of Ayaka Yamashita.The Manchester City manager found energy from his bench, bringing on the firepower of Shaw and Vivianne Miedema. They had an almost immediate impact, the latter setting up the former for her 12th goal of the campaign. Their joy was short-lived, however, with the hosts digging deep, a lovely touch from Riko Ueki to set Paví up to earn an important point.View image in fullscreenKhadija Shaw’s late goal was not enough as Manchester City drew 1-1 at West Ham.Photograph: John Walton/PAChelsea returned to winning ways after faltering slightlyin a draw with Brighton on Sunday.

Bompastor made several changes to her side and while they dominated the ball and created chances, they got just five on target.

The left-back emphasised the importance of showing the right mentality and accepted that the pressure is on Chelsea to win silverware for the first time since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought the club in 2022.Chelsea fans grapple with the art of omission by Boehly’s trainee regime | Jonathan LiewRead more“We have confidence and tomorrow is another opportunity to show that we are ready,” Cucurella said. “Now we need to do the last step for the last part of the season. I think it’s a good moment to show that we are ready to fight for big things. Being a younger squad doesn’t matter. We need to show we are maturing. It doesn’t matter if you win 10 games, 11 or five, the most important thing at the end of the season is where you finish, how many trophies you win.”Chelsea have far greater resources than Copenhagen, who have omitted their key attacker, Mohamed Elyounoussi, in their squad as they manage his return from injury. It was put to Cucurella that it would be a disappointment if Maresca’s side fail to win the competition.“For sure,” the Spain international said. “I think we are a top club. We have a lot of players with skill and abilities, and we need to feel we can win the competition.”It is a sign of Chelsea’s strength that they were able to cruise into the last 16 despite managing Palmer’s minutes by leaving him out of their squad for the league phase. But the stakes are higher now and Maresca said it was always the plan to bring the 22-year-old into the picture at this stage. There is no indication that Palmer sees himself as too big for the Conference League. “Cole is excited to play training sessions,” Maresca said. “He is excited to play these games.”Maresca, who will start Robert Sánchez in goal, is encouraged that Chelsea’s injury problems in central defence are easing. Benoît Badiashile and Trevoh Chalobah are available after returning to fitness and Wesley Fofana, who is not in the Conference League squad, is back. Roméo Lavia, the Belgian midfielder, has returned to training.Explore more on these topicsChelseaEuropa Conference LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

TheLiverpoolhead coach conceded his team would have been lucky to escape with a draw from Parc des Princes, such was PSG’s superiority, but had no doubt who was responsible for an unlikely victory.Harvey Elliott stuns PSG as Liverpool weather storm to snatch dramatic winRead more“I have had some very good players as a manager but never the best goalkeeper in the world until now,” said Slot. “He showed that he is the best in the world today. To go away with a win here was probably a bit more than we deserved.”Peter Schmeichel, who was on commentary duty in Paris, said: “I think this is one of the best goalkeeping displays I’ve ever seen in my life.” For his part, Alisson admitted: “It was probably the performance of my life. The manager was telling us how hard it would be to play against PSG, how good they are with the ball and that we would have to be ready to suffer. We knew what was coming.”“We worked hard. We gave away so many chances, sometimes one v one but all the efforts the team put in makes my job easier. Then at the end Harvey coming in and scoring the goal, it is a great story for us. A great night.”Luis Enrique called the result “unfair” and claimed PSG could go through with a repeat performance at Anfield next week. “It will be difficult in that atmosphere but we have nothing to lose and that makes us dangerous,” said the PSG and former Barcelona coach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were the much better team, especially in the first half when they had a lot of open chances.

So all these shots from outside the box, with a certain speed, that you only see with the top players. That’s why Alisson still had to make a lot of big saves.

Now he’s indispensableRead moreBut while Postecoglou revealed that Kulusevki has been nursing a foot problem for several weeks and will miss next week’s second leg in north London, he insisted that his returning players who have missed chunks of the campaign are determined to make up for lost time.“I think it is fair to say the boys really understand there is a great opportunity for us,” he said. “I think they’ve appreciated the fact that the guys who have been playing through are now able to recover and train and prepare themselves better for games.“That’s coincided with seeing their teammates come back and certainly the guys that have been out injured, we’ve already seen with guys like Guglielmo Vicario, Brennan Johnson, James Maddison to a lesser extent [due to time out] but Wilson Odobert, Destiny Udogie – they’ve come back with a real hunger and desire to help the team because I think they’ve all been frustrated to sit on the sidelines and see how difficult it has been for the group of players who have been playing. They’ve just wanted to help and now they get that opportunity.”Romero was called up by Argentina this week despite not having started a Premier League game since ­limping offagainst Chelseaat the start of December. He is likely to start ­alongside Kevin Danso in ­central defence and the Austria international has talked up Tottenham’s chances of going all the way in this competition.“A hundred per cent and I think it’s possible,” said Danso. “I said before the [Manchester] United game with the week of training that we had with some of the injured lads coming back – it was a lot of positive energy around the place and we ended upwinning that gameand keeping a clean sheet. It’s the same feeling now with Mickey and Cuti [Romero] back in the squad and everybody is wanting to finish the season strong.”AZ beat Galatasaray 4-1 at home in the first leg of their playoff and reached the Dutch Cup final last week. The former Tottenham striker Troy Parrott, who moved to the Netherlands on a permanent deal last summer, missed a penalty in the semi-final shootout but has scored 17 goals in all competitions this season. The Republic of Ireland international insisted he has no regrets about leaving Spurs a few weeks after Postecoglou took over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maintaining a spectacular level of play midway through his record-tying 22nd season, he is pulling away from the other greats of the game: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who played 20 seasons in the NBA, is a distant second with 44,149 combined points.Basketball has never seen anything like LeBron James’ dominant tenure | Claire de LuneRead moreJames got his milestone three-pointer off an assist by Luka Dončić, a piece of trivia that pleased both stars. Dončić’s arrival inlast month’s seismic tradewith the Dallas Mavericks has invigorated both James and the Lakers, who look like championship contenders, with a seven-game winning streak and 17 victories in their last 20 games.“It’s amazing, watching him do this stuff at this age,” said Dončić, who had 30 points, 15 assists and eight rebounds against New Orleans. “It’s just unbelievable, that 50K points. I can’t even explain how insane that is. He might get to 70K. You never know.”The Lakers recognized the milestone at the next timeout, with the public address announcer saying: “Ladies and gentlemen, we all have just witnessed history.” James acknowledged the standing ovation with several waves from the bench.James is tied with Vince Carter for the most seasons played in NBA history. But James’s game shows few signs of decline in his 40s. He was named the NBA’s Western Conference player of the month earlier on Tuesday after he averaged 29.3 points, 10.5 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 1.2 steals in February while playing more than 35 minutes per game for the Lakers, who went 9-2 to surge into second place in the West. With their victory over the Pelicans, the Lakers improved to 11-2 since acquiring Dončić.View image in fullscreenLeBron James’s points total dwarf other greats of the game.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesJames has played in 1,548 regular-season games, trailing only Robert Parish (1,611) and Abdul-Jabbar (1,560). If he stays healthy and elects to return for a record 23rd season, he will most likely surpass Parish next winter.James has also played in 287 postseason games, the most in NBA history. He became the league’s career playoff scoring leader in 2017, when he surpassed Michael Jordan’s total of 5,987 during the Cleveland Cavaliers’ Eastern Conference finals game at Boston. James then becamethe top scorer in regular-season historyin February 2023, when he topped Abdul-Jabbar’s record of 38,387 points during the Lakers’ game against Oklahoma City.After the game, James said retaining a passion for the game was crucial in his record-setting career.“Just not falling out of love with the process,” James said. “Continuing to fall in love with the process, that’s the hardest thing, every single year. You know it’s going to be a long season. It’s 82 games, 41 of them are on the road. It’s a lot of travel. And as you get older, it affects you even differently. If you have a family, it affects you even differently. So the process. Trying not to fall out of love with the process is the hardest thing.”James’s prolific scoring is due in large part to his metronomic consistency. With his performance against the Pelicans, he has scored at least 10 points in 1,278 consecutive games since 6 January 2007 – by far the longest such streak in NBA history.James’s player of the month award for February was his 41st, extending his own league record. He is also the oldest player to win the award, surpassing a 37-year-old Karl Malone in November 2000.Explore more on these topicsLeBron JamesLuka DončićNBALos Angeles LakersBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He told the Croatian newspaperVecernji listthat the man had followed Raducanu at consecutive tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Doha and then Dubai and he had carefully chosen moments to approach her when she was alone.“There were two instances and it was the second one that I just got freaked out by,” said the 22-year-old. “The first one was more like a normal fan approaching you, except for the fact he told me he followed me from everywhere. And then [he] watched me in the coffee shop for a while … the second incident was really worrying.”Shortly after her US Open triumph in 2021, she had an encounter with a stalker, Amrit Magar, who had visited her family home, stealing items from their front porch as he believed they belonged to Raducanu.He was given a five-year restraining orderfrom Raducanu and community service in 2022.During the court hearings, Raducanu said she felt her freedom had been “taken away from me”. In light of her experiences with obsessive, invasive fans, Raducanu is being escorted by extra security at Indian Wells.“It was a very emotional time,” she said on Tuesday. “After the match I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost. There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here.

Yes, Dr. J cradles the ball in his arm as he goes airborne and slams it home over the Lakers’ Michael Cooper.“It’s the greatest dunk of all time,” says Philadelphia Inquirer sports columnist Mike Sielski.Sielski has the authority to say so. He is the author ofa recently published book, Magic in the Air: The Myth, the Mystery, and the Soul of the Slam Dunk.Within its pages, you can relive those long-ago highlights from Dr J. The same goes forthe epic 1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest battlebetween Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins. There’s an unforgettable moment from college basketball:Lorenzo Charles dunkingto win the 1983 NCAA championship for NC State over Houston and its Phi Slama Jama roster. There are bittersweet moments as well: Gravity-defying stars who, for various reasons, fizzled in the pros (David Thompson) or never made it there at all (“Jumpin’” Jackie Jackson and Earl “The Goat” Manigault).The book delves into the origins of dunking and the perhaps unanswerable question of who was the first to dunk. The pioneers include Jack Inglis – who reportedly hung on to the cage surrounding a court and threw the ball into the net – and Bernard Dobbas, who was powerful off the court too: He reportedly slew a mountain lion with his bare hands. There was also the 1936 US Olympian Joe Fortenberry, who hailed from the unconventionally named town of Happy, Texas.The narrative explores dunking’s subsequent appeal to Black players during the civil rights era, when its top practitioners included Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and a UCLA standout named Lew Alcindor. After a sensational sophomore season from the future Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the dunk was controversially and mysteriously banned from high school and college play for nearly a decade.What brought the dunk back in favor? Sielski credits the upstart ABA and its popular slam dunk contest. The ABA-NBA merger brought dunking experts like Dr J into the NBA, while a younger generation, which included Jordan, created new memories in the dunk contest. There is also a chapter on trailblazers in women’s basketball – Georgeann Wells, Charlotte Smith and Sylvia Crawley. The book examines the reported decline in dunking today, while noting there are still NBA players who make it an essential part of their game, from tounlikely dunk contest championMac McClung.“I wanted it to be a fun ride, to feel like a journey,” Sielski says, “where the reader and I journeyed together to different places, different eras, fun stuff about the history of basketball, and stuff tangentially connected to basketball, so you would enjoy the ride.”The author did a fair amount of journeying for the book, making multiple road trips. Yes, he did travel to Happy, Texas, a suburb of Amarillo. There, he met Oliver Fortenberry, whose late father Joe had played for Team USA at the notorious 1936 Games in Berlin. Sielski got to hold Joe Fortenberry’s gold medal. He also got a warning to watch out for rattlesnakes.Then there was the trip to Raleigh, including a local restaurant with a name honoring the famed NC State coach Jim Valvano – Jimmy V’s Osteria and Bar. The score on the wall is always 54-52, the final of the 1983 NCAA championship, decided by Charles’s dunk. Sielski also visited Murray State, where Morant parlayed his dunking skills into big-man-on-campus status before leaving college early for theNBA.Yet there was one journey the author couldn’t make – to the offices of the NCAA in Indianapolis. Sielski wanted access to the organization’s presidential archives – specifically, with regard to the late NCAA president Walter Byers. Sielski was trying to document why the college (and high school) basketball establishment had banned the dunk from 1967 to 1976.Sielski points out that 1967 “was a year after Texas Western beat Kentucky for the national championship,” with an all-Black starting five defeating an all-white starting five, “after Lew Alcindor dominated college basketball in his sophomore season [at UCLA], the only season he could dunk the ball legally. Statistically, it was the best season of his college career. You can’t separate that decade [1967-76] and those who tried to keep the sport ‘as it should be’ from what was going on in society writ large.”He adds: “The ultimate act of dominance on a basketball court is to dunk over someone. It was an opportunity for Black men during the 50s, 60s and 70s. In society at large, Black people were fighting for their rightful place and piece of the American Dream.”View image in fullscreenMac McClung has been a revelation in the NBA’s dunk contest.Photograph: Kyle Terada/USA Today SportsFormally, the ban was issued by the NationalBasketballCommittee, a since-disbanded overseeing group for high school and college ball. The NCAA, on the other hand, is very much around, and that’s where Sielski made inquiries through email and was dissatisfied with what he received.“It got to the point where I said: ‘Look, if you don’t let me see the documents, I’m going to print our email exchange verbatim in the book, everyone can draw their own conclusions,’” he says. “I haven’t heard back from them since.”Sielski’s previous book was on Kobe Bryant. After finishing it, he and his agent were brainstorming ideas for another project. He says he was inspired by his friend and fellow sports journalist Tyler Kepner’s book K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches. He admired a book with chapters that could be read either sequentially or randomly and was, regardless, a good read.“I thought of doing something similar through basketball,” Sielski says. “The more I thought about big moments and big figures in the sport, they were all connected with the ability to dunk – Jordan, Julius Erving.”There’s an element of mythology to dunking’s history, the author notes, including protagonists who were larger than life literally and figuratively, whether through height, wizardry above the rim, or both.“People like to say Michael Jordan took off from the foul line at the 1988 dunk contest,” Sielski says. “Or that Julius Erving took off from the foul line at the 1976 ABA dunk contest. They really did not.”The author laments that the mythmaking and flamboyant play symbolized by dunking has given way to the analytical approach represented by the three-point shot.“It’s so much more analytical,” Sielski says. “The Celtics take and make the most three-pointers in the league … I think the game is suffering for it.”He sees an antidote in McClung’s wins at the dunk contest. The book notes that McClung’s spectacular dunks have gained millions of views online, while tweaking a stereotype summarized in the title of a hit movie: White Men Can’t Jump.“A 6ft 2in white guy, it appears challenging for him,” Sielski says, but adds that McClung can “jump over a car, do a 540-degree spin” en route to a dunk.In this, there’s a connection to the greats of the past.“Watching him dunk the ball goes back to that sense of wonder, an appreciation of the athleticism of the athletes, the players who dunked years ago, when it first appeared,” Sielski says.Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBAUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The overall market declined by 1%, with 84,054 new registrations.The SMMT said that sales of full electric vehicles rose almost 42% year on year, accounting for a quarter of all new registrations, because buyers are seeking to beat a new tax on expensive cars that comes into force in April and will affect many EVs for the first time.There has been some evidence that Musk’s interventions in European political affairs and his senior role in Trump’s administration are leading to a consumer backlash by some Tesla owners or prospective buyers.The tech billionaire and close Trump adviser hasshown support for Germany’s far-right AfD party, theatrically brandished a“chainsaw of democracy”at a conservative conference, and accused Keir Starmer and other senior politicians ofcovering up the scandal about grooming gangs.Sales of new Tesla carsalmost halved in Europe in January, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, pushing the carmaker’s market share down to 1%.In China, early numbers for February indicate a 49% fall in exports and retail sales, although analysts say this is likely to have been affected by Tesla’s Model Y changeover as it gives the model an updated design.Analysts at Morgan Stanley attributed the weaker sales toa “buyers’ strike”.After a jump following Trump’s election win, Tesla’s market value has dropped back to the level it was at the US presidential election in November, although its shares are currently up 45% over the last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The organisation’s chief executive, Sarah Cardell, has also said the CMA does not want to create a “chilling effect” on business confidence, amid pressure from the UK government on regulators toproduce pro-growth proposals.Competition watchdog to speed up decisions after UK government pressureRead moreThe CMA’s executive director for mergers, Joel Bamford, said: “We have found that there has not been a change of control by Microsoft from material influence to de facto control overOpenAI. Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK’s merger control regime.”However, Bamford added that the decision should “not be read as the partnership being given a clean bill of health on competition concerns”.The CMA started investigating the OpenAI relationship after the dramatic sacking and reinstatement of Sam Altman as OpenAI’s chief executive – over a hectic few days in November 2023, Microsoft announced it hadhired Altman, only for him torejoin the startup.The CMA highlighted a recent reduction in OpenAI’s reliance on Microsoft for computer power – a key factor in operating an AI business – as an influence over its decision.A Microsoft spokesperson said the partnership with OpenAI and its continued evolution “promote competition, innovation, and responsible AI development … We welcome the CMA’s conclusion, after careful and prudent consideration of the commercial realities, to close its investigation.”Last year, the CMA decided not to investigate Amazon’s investment in the AI firm Anthropic and further Microsoft partnerships with the AI firms Mistral and Inflection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Google is being investigated over itsdominance in internet search and search advertising, while it is also conducting a separate inquiry on the impact ofApple and Google’s mobile platformson consumers and businesses.In January, Microsoft said the CMA was making a “fundamental mistake” in its investigation into the cloud market, after the watchdog said the tech firm was making it harder for Google and Amazon to compete effectively for customers in cloud computing, the term for providing IT services such as data storage and computing power over the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing structure.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftChatGPTOpenAICompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorsComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The CEO of Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, accuses OpenAI of straying from its founding mission to developartificial intelligencefor the good of humanity, not corporate profit.OpenAI and its CEO,Sam Altman, have denied the allegations. At stake in the lawsuit is theChatGPTmaker’s transition to a for-profit model, which Altman has said is crucial to raising more capital and competing well in the expensive AI race.OpenAI welcomed the judge’s decision on Tuesday, saying the lawsuit by Musk, who launched the rival startup xAI in 2023, has “always been about competition”. OpenAI’s main backer, Microsoft, did not respond to a request for comment.Marc Toberoff, a lawyer for Musk, said they were pleased the judge “offered an expedited trial on the core claims driving this case”.“We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk’s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public’s benefit rather than his own enrichment,” Toberoff said.The ruling comes weeks after Altman rejected a $97.4bn unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium with a “no thank you”. Altman, who has said OpenAI is not for sale, alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Roughly the same proportion report a growing gap in productivity – a measure of economic efficiency – between employees who use AI and those who do not.“Some organisations appear to be stuck in neutral, caught in the experimentation phase, rather than in the deployment [of AI],” said Darren Hardman, the tech company’s UK chief executive.Microsoft, the biggest financial backer of the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI, has been pushing AI’s deployment in the workplace throughautonomous AI agents– tools that can carry out tasks without human intervention. Early adopters of Microsoft’s Copilot Studio product, which deploys bots, include the blue-chip consulting firm McKinsey, which is using agents to carry out tasks such as scheduling meetings with prospective clients.The Tony Blair Institute, a thinktank, has estimated AIcould displace up to 3m jobs in the UK, although it expects the net loss to be in the low hundreds of thousands as the technology creates new roles. Speaking to the Guardian, Hardman said AI agents would remove the “digital drudgery” of people’s jobs and allow them to focus on the “creative aspects” of their jobs, potentially creating new roles as the first wave of the internet did for the retail sector.Referring to the creation of new roles in retail such as data analysts, web designers and social media managers, he said: “The nature of that industry changed with the onset of the internet. And I think the creation of anagenticworkplace is going to do the same.”Hardman said proposed reforms to UK copyright law, which are fiercely opposed by Britain’s creative industries, would provide “wider economic growth for the UK”.He said: “We think it’s going to provide clarity. We think it’s going to support AI development.”The UK government is proposing to allow tech companies such as Microsoft to use copyright-protected work without permission in order to train their models. Critics of the proposals have described them as a“wholesale” transfer of wealthfrom the creative industries to the tech sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scammers are understood to have still been contacting victims in recent weeks.UK citizens were the hardest hit, accounting for a third – about £9m – of the money taken.The fraud was exposed by a huge leak of scam call centre data to the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, which then shared the files with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the Guardian and other international reporting partners.The UK government has introduceda new set of lawsaimed at protecting children and adults online. However, while the online safety act has been passed into law and scam posts could soon prompt fines, the sections relating to fraudulent advertising by organisations are not expected to become active until next year.Cases of authorised push payment (APP) fraud – when a victim is tricked into sending money directly from their account – rose by 12% to more than 230,000 in 2023,according to the most recent figures from the trade body UK Finance, although the total money lost dipped.View image in fullscreenThe victims fell for fake celebrity adverts on Facebook and Google.Photograph: Denis Charlet/AFP/Getty ImagesThe leak, which contains over 1m recordings – including long exchanges with victims scammed out of significant amounts of money– allows rare insight into exactly how scammers created havoc in the lives of their victims. And it raises fresh questions about how successful governments, banks and technology companies have been in combating these frauds.Operating from three office blocks in Tbilisi and referring to themselves as theskameri, Georgian for scammers, a group of about 85 well-paid call centre agents has persuaded pensioners, employees and small business owners to transfers millions out of their savings accounts.Since May 2022, the data suggests this industrial scale boiler room fraud duped around 6,000 people across the globe out of $35m (£27m). A separate dataset contained in the leak indicates that close to half – 45% – of attempted calls placed by the scammers were made to UK numbers.Of about 2,000 victims who were persuaded to part with the largest sums, 652 were based in the UK. The fake adverts, which often reference the billionaire Elon Musk, appear to have been placed by affiliate marketers, who communicated anonymously with the scammers and earned fees by gathering the contact details of potential victims.In one call, the victim – a former NHS doctor in her 70s who was living in sheltered housing in Londonand spent more than 55 hours on the phone to the scammers – pleaded with the call centre: “I’ve used up every penny of my savings, I have nothing. And I can’t survive like that. My brother is already asking me for the money I have borrowed from him back.”The records suggest this victim lost about £50,000. She is thought to have died shortly after her final contact with the call centre last summer.GraphicThe most-called UK victim, a retired London Stock Exchange employee, spent more than 135 hours on the phone and was persuaded to part with more than £162,000 in savings. The identities of thousands of people targeted in the UK,Europeand Canada are revealed in the data cache, along with details of the riches awarded to call centre operatives, who spent money on Rolex watches, Range Rovers, Cartier jewellery and lavish staff parties.Scammers can be heard in the leaked calls putting pressure on victims to open accounts with firms including Revolut and Chase, and the data shows the extent to which the new generation of online banks and payment services were used to process these payments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Revolut spokesperson added: “Across our UK customer base in 2023, we found that 60% of all reported scam cases originated on Meta owned platforms likeFacebookand WhatsApp. Yet these firms have no role in warning customers of such scams, nor reimbursing victims.”Fogle,LewisandBallpublicly spoke out against the deepfake videos last year. The sham adverts have been widely known to be an issue since at least 2018, when Lewis launched a high profile legal claim againstFacebook, which had published dozens of false investment stories featuring his face and name. The money-saving expert dropped the lawsuit nine months later after Facebook agreed todonate £3m to set up an anti-scam project with Citizens Advice and launch a UK-specific one-click reporting tool.The MP Chi Onwurah the chair of the Commons science, innovation and technology committee, said:“The committee is currently investigating the spread of misinformation online. Our inquiry has raised significant concerns about the effectiveness of the Online Safety Act in tackling bad practices online, threats from AI and issues with the online advertising ecosystem. This case shows the urgency of addressing the shortcomings of the OSA to ensure that it can protect the public and ensure their online safety.”A government spokesperson said: “Scammers who trick people into parting with their money are committing a criminal offence and should be punished. But social media companies also have a responsibility to ensure their sites are not providing a platform for such material intended to rip the public off.”AMetaspokesperson responded saying it was against company policies to run ads that “promote or facilitate scams”. They said: “Everyone needs to work together to tackle these sophisticated scams, which is why we created the Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange (FIRE) program to allow banks and financial institutions to share information and better combat this problem. We invite Revolut to be a part of this effort.”Google said: “Protecting users is our top priority and we have strict ads policies that govern the types of ads and advertisers we allow on our platforms. We enforce our policies vigorously, and if we find ads that are in violation we remove them.”Help us find out moreIf you’ve spotted a fake advert or news article that promotes fraudulent crypto schemes on platforms like Facebook and Google, please share a link with us in the form below and tell us where and when you saw it.

Then six people were killedHow a group of Silicon Valley math prodigies, AI researchers and internet burnouts descended into an alleged violent cultJ Oliver ConroyWed 5 Mar 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.29 ESTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Matt Rota/The GuardianYears before she became the peculiar central thread linking a double homicide in Pennsylvania, the fatal shooting of a federal agent in Vermont and the murder of an elderly landlord in California, a computer programmer bought a sailboat.The programmer was known to friends, foes and followers as Ziz. She had come to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016 as part of an influx of young people arriving to study the dangers that artificial intelligence could pose to humanity.In one of the most expensive regions of the United States, however, it is difficult to save the world when you can’t make rent. So she bought a boat for $600 and moored it next to a friend’s vessel in a marina. For five years, she used it as an occasional, cramped bunk.In her waking hours, she worked on a blog of provocative and increasingly extreme ideas about confrontation and retaliation. At night, she fell asleep as the boat rocked back and forth, drifting with the flotsam of greaterSilicon Valley.Then, on the night of 19 August 2022, her sister and a friend reported that they saw her fall overboard. The US Coast Guard and local authorities scrambled boats and aircraft. After a nearly 30-hour search, neither Ziz nor her body could be found.View image in fullscreenZiz was reported to have fallen overboard, and her body could not be found.A newspaper in Alaska, where she was born, published a short obituary referring to her by her birth name: “Jack Amadeus LaSota left our lives but not our hearts on Aug 19 after a boating accident. Loving adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals, you are missed.” She was 31.Ziz’s ideas did not die in the waters of the California coast. Nor did Ziz. She had faked her drowning and gone underground, before beingarrestedlast month in western Maryland and charged with trespassing and illegal transportation of a firearm.The targets of Ziz’s ire, who include some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent intellectuals, have taken security precautions. “Ziz is not stupid,” someone familiar with her, who asked to remain anonymous, told me. “This is a very smart person – both smart and crazy.”Ziz’s writing had polarized members of a niche but influential movement of AI theorists and tech bloggers who call themselves the “rationalists”. The movement is less about specific ideas than it is about an ethos – applying rigorous, mathematically informed thinking to AI, philosophy, psychology and the big questions of our time.Rationalists are odd, though often charming, people. They tend to be fantasy and sci-fi geeks, use lots of jargon and think intensely about things other people barely think about at all. They debate with earnest and deadly seriousness, and their preferred arena of intellectual combat is dense blogposts, often with footnotes.View image in fullscreenAn illustration of Ziz’s mug shot after her arrest.Illustration: Matt Rota/The GuardianSome in the rationalist community saw Ziz as a kook, even dangerous. But she had enough detractors and admirers to earn a school, of sorts, that an opponent dubbed the “Zizians”.Very few people had ever heard of Zizians until this January, when a US border patrol agent pulled over two young people, dressed in black, driving a Prius hybrid near the Vermont-Canada border. The ensuing shootout killed a federal officer. It also left one of the alleged shooters in custody and the other, a math prodigy who had formerly worked as a quant trader in New York, dead.From there, the story grew stranger. Reporting byOpen Vallejoandother outletsfound that the Vermont pair had ties to a group of leftwing anarchists in California – including one who won an $11,000 prize for AI research in 2023 and was also arrested this January for allegedly murdering a landlord.A few things drew those people together: all were militant vegans with a worldview that could be described as far-left. All were highly educated – or impressive autodidacts. Most were also, like Ziz, transgender. But what they had in common, above all, was a kinship with a philosophy, which Ziz largely promulgated, that takes abstract questions from AI research to extreme and selective conclusions.In reporting this story, I obtained exclusive chatroom logs that chart the Zizians’ radicalization and ultimate acceleration into violence. I examined thousands of words of blogposts, court filings and other documents, and spent weeks interviewing people familiar with Ziz and her circle.Ziz has not been charged in any killings. Yet acquaintances are unsettled, and former teachers frightened of their apostate pupil. Many sources requested anonymity due to safety concerns – “it’s just, you know …murder cult,” one person said – or a desire to speak freely about the rationalist and AI-risk communities.How, exactly, did hyper-intelligent young altruists – who studied at Oxford, Waterloo and Rice, won academic prizes and research grants, and spoke sincerely of bettering the world – enter a trajectory that has ended with at least six people dead? What would cause a former spelling bee finalist to write in a chatroom discussion of having “dramatic fantasies about becoming a knife murderer” – and then, a year later, allegedly participate in an attempt to stab someone to death?The answers lie in a strange saga of idealism and disenchantment:a violent collision of internet culture and the real world – and perhaps a harbinger of more uncanny tidings to come.Decades before Ziz was born, some philosophers and computer scientists began to predict a day when computers become truly and irreversibly smarter than humans. They called this event the “singularity”.Because computing power generally improves at an exponential rate, and because a true AI would also learn and improve, some AI theorists thought that the singularity might arrive sooner than most people understood. In their view – which not all AI researchers share – the arrival of superintelligence would be like a tsunami: a ripple that rapidly builds, before anyone notices, into a towering wall of water.‘Humanity’s remaining timeline? It looks more like five years than 50’: meet the neo-luddites warning of an AI apocalypseRead moreEliezer Yudkowsky, a burly man with a dark, bristly beard, grew up in a Modern Orthodox family in Chicago. As a precocious child in the 1990s, he became a voracious sci-fi reader. At a time when computers were still running on dial-up internet, he was particularly interested in the future of AI. An atheist who permanentlyrejectedhis family’s Judaism, he also wanted to flesh out a philosophy that could provide ethical frameworks without religion.In the 2000s, Yudkowsky began building on the work of earlier AI theorists. In a series of blogposts, he argued that the tsunami was coming – and would remake everything in its tidal path. By the time he was 20, his writing won the attention of AI academics, who accepted him into their ranks despite the fact that Yudkowsky had never attended high school.Today Yudkowsky is regarded as a leader of the “doomers”, a faction whose members believe that superintelligent AI will be unambiguously bad for humanity and perhaps even cause our extinction. That wasn’t always the case.At first, Yudkowsky believed that the singularity had the potential to be the best thing that ever happened to humanity. In the world he hoped to bring about, a benevolent, centralized, god-like AI, sometimes called a “singleton”, could end hunger and poverty and protect the human species for eternity. But that AI, unless designed carefully, could also prove to be disastrous to humanity.Researchers call it the “alignment problem”: would a superintelligent AI be hostile or benevolent? And is there any guarantee that its understanding of benevolence aligns with ours?Nick Bostrom: ‘We are like small children playing with a bomb’Read moreIn 2003, Nick Bostrom, a Swedish philosopher,illustratedthe risk of unintended consequences in a classic example. Say you program an AI to make paperclips. The AI is smart enough to not only make paperclips but learn new, better ways to make them. It consumes more and more resources to flood the world with paperclips. The AI resists efforts to switch it off, since that would conflict with making paperclips. Perhaps it even decides that humans, who are made of carbon, would be good raw material for more paperclips.Bostrom’s point was that there is no reason to assume that artificial superintelligence, even if designed by humans for human ends, would think at all like a human; its thinking might beeven morealien to ours than that of an actual extraterrestrial alien. In the worst nightmares of people like Yudkowsky and Bostrom, AI doom looks like an omnipotent version of Hal, the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey that starts jettisoning humans from a spaceship’s airlock when they conflict with its sense of mission.As he tried to proselytize the benefits and threats of AI, Yudkowsky was frustrated to encounter disagreements that leaned on what he viewed as fallacies. So he started writing blogposts explaining logic and decision-making with a statistical method calledBayesian inference. These essays were edited into a corpus – 2,100 pages in one version – that rationalists refer to, somewhat reverentially, as the “Sequences”.Yudkowsky was trying to teach people how to think better – by guarding against their cognitive biases, being rigorous in their assumptions and being willing to change their thinking. Although rationalists tend to be polite enough, some, including Yudkowsky,holdthat it is in effect impossible to “agree to disagree”: that if two “rational agents” whosharethe same assumptions come to different conclusions, one of themmustbe wrong.An online community, including many people who work in tech, gathered around the blog Yudkowsky founded in 2009,LessWrong. Soon, contributors began writing their own essays. The rationalist movement was born.Yudkowsky felt that there was still a larger, untapped audience. In 2010 he started publishing Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, a 662,000-wordfan fictionthat turned the original books on their head. In it, instead of a childhood as a miserable orphan, Harry was raised by an Oxford professor of biochemistry and knows science as well as magic; at Hogwarts he is assigned to the smart kids’ house, Ravenclaw, instead of the jocks’ Gryffindor; and he saves the world by embracing a manipulative, dark streak that might shock JK Rowling’s Potter.Yudkowsky wrote the series in part torecruittalentfor the alignment problem, and he succeeded wildly. The series was so popular that it birthed fan fiction of its own. Thousands of people around the world read it, including a young geek, interested in atheism, veganism and utilitarianism, who later took the name Ziz.Two organizations would shape Ziz’s thinking – then become bedrocks of her rage. In 2000, Yudkowsky founded a thinktank that would later be called the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, or Miri. And in 2012, a group of rationalists founded a daughter organization of sorts, the Center for Applied Rationality, or CFar. Both are based in Berkeley, near Silicon Valley.While AI theorists at Miri worked to bring to life a beautiful and safe singularity, CFar wouldpromoterationalist thinking, build a social scene and perhaps help to feed bright research minds to Miri.The rise of those two organizations also coincided with the emergence of the “effective altruism” movement. As a school of thought, effective altruism has now become tainted byassociationwith its most famous poster child, the crypto entrepreneur and convicted fraudsterSam Bankman-Fried, but at the time it was catching fire among earnest techies.Founded by some young philosophers at Oxford in the 2000s, effective altruism revitalized interest in the moral philosophy of consequentialism – the idea that endsdo, to some extent, justify means – and its stepchild, utilitarianism, which holds that the goal of human endeavor should be to do the most good for the most people.Soon, those movements began to build a pipeline of money toward research on existential risks to humanity’s future. Billionaires such as Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal, and Dustin Moskovitz, of Facebook,gave fundingfor non-profit AI research.Like many tech mavens, Yudkowsky is an advocate of “transhumanism”, the theory that technology will one day enable humanity to transcend the limitations of our bodies. He was deeply shaken by the death of hisbrother, in 2004, and his work reflects a cosmic horror at any sapient brain ever being extinguished.Transhumanists believe that scientific breakthroughs will not only eventually allow us to live longer, but perhaps also give us a kind of immortality, by creating digital versions of our minds that live on after we’re dead. Some also believe that computer power will eventually become so strong and cheap that those digital minds can each live in their own fully realized virtual-reality worlds.In this cosmology, an AI machine-god could give each of those minds utopias of their own choosing. But it could also choose not to – or, worse, subject people to eternal torment. A movement of atheists had found a new vision of heaven, and of hell.Ziz’s writing would come to be consumed by visions of damnation. But when she emailed a CFar listserv back in May 2015 to ask for leads on programming jobs in the Bay Area, she had a chipper tone that would be unrecognizable a few years later.“I think it’s about 50% likely I’ll be wanting one, starting in early August,” she wrote. “What’s the best way to find one? Preferably in Berkeley so I can not-inter-city-commute to alumni dojos and Berkeley meetups?”She sketched a CV of sorts, with positive reviews of coding projects she’d done and work experience (internships at Nasa and Oracle), and noted that she was currently a master’s student in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois.Ziz was exactly the sort of person who would be attracted to the rationalist scene. She was a computer wonk who’d grown up in Alaska with a father who was an AI researcher and instructor and a mother who was a school counselor. While still in middle school, Ziz and some friends hacked their school’s payroll system to award money to their favorite teachers, a former teacher recentlytoldthe Boston Globe, and cut the salaries of ones they disliked. The teacher also said that Ziz had problems with emotional regulation.(I contacted email accounts associated with Ziz but did not receive a response.)Ziz’s writing recounts, with anger, what she describes as her mother’s reluctance to accept her trans identity, and speaks of going through pubertyfeelingthat her genitals were an “alien parasite” on her body. She also had a visceral aversion to eating animals, and became a vegetarian by 2010 before coming to regard vegetarianism as an unacceptable compromise to veganism.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Ziz moved to Illinois with the apparent intent of pursuing a PhD in computer science or physics. But the lure of the Bay Area was stronger. A rationalist scene had flourished there, and people were flocking to the area to take workshops at CFar and apply for jobs at Miri and other AI organizations.It was an exciting time to be in Berkeley, Rachel Wolford, a startup founder who used to consider herself a rationalist, told me – “a place filled with people like me, who shared my desire for skeptical interpretations of the world. I felt welcome, partly because it was a place where people tended to be non-neurotypical in the same way I was, and partly because they had similar ideologies about the way you should approach figuring out what you believe.”At an early CFar workshop, Ziz described the “comparative advantage” she could offer the world, according to someone present, as a willingness to do good through means other people might consider bad.“She’s just very intense,” Octavia Nouzen, an acquaintance of Ziz’s, told me. “I mean, the word that comes to mind is just ‘intense’ – just, like, a super-penetrating gaze.” A rationalist who met Ziz during this period found her “nice enough but pretty quiet. They [Ziz] didn’t tend to come out for social events very much. They kind of just holed up in their room.”Ziz was also cognizant of her own challenges, and her writing reflects some anxiety about being able to communicate well with others; at one point she took a seminar in “Authentic Relating”. Yet if Ziz was unusual, she did not, at first, necessarily stand out to her peers. Eccentricity was common in the Berkeley scene, even expected, and a core tenet was that people needed to feel free to discuss strange ideas, in good faith, without judgment.There had been unintended consequences, however, to Miri and CFar’s efforts to gather the best and brightest to solve the alignment problem.A lot of eager young idealists were showing up who fit a certain mold. They were hyper-intelligent but not always wise, and had spent dizzying amounts of time on the internet. They were information sponges with a tendency to get sucked into rabbit holes, people with ambition but not always execution.These were people who had grown up reading Harry Potter fan fiction about rationalism by the glow of a computer screen, then quit families who didn’t understand them – or were in some cases abusive – to come to a mecca where they hoped to find intellectual parent figures and stimulating work. They’d spent lonely, sometimes traumatized, childhoods reading about the heroism of others; now they could finally be protagonists.But not everyone made the cut. Miri, CFar and other organizations could not give jobs or research grants to everyone interested, and the Bay Area is hideously expensive.Ziz’s money worries started almost immediately. Coding jobs she’d been promised fell through or didn’t work out. She did several rounds of interviews at Google that never went anywhere and had to ask for financial help from her parents. She stayed at some expensive short-term rentals, and one sublet where, shewrote, the landlord was abusive.Around this time, she also had a traumatic experience. A man saw her walking at night and offered her a ride. The encounter turned into what shedescribedas a sexual assault.Rationalists in the Bay Area often encountered financial problems. A common fix was a “rat house” with anywhere from four to nine roommates, often in violation of tenancy laws. Even then, some people struggled to make rent, and tense social or power dynamics could develop if one person with a well-paid tech job was fronting rent for everyone else.At their best, rat houses were fun places to be an intellectually minded idealist. At worst, rationalists told me, they were like halfway houses of smart but dysfunctional people, too fired up solving the alignment problem to do dishes, unaware that they may have been, in some sense, in the discard pile of AI-risk research.So when Ziz met Gwen Danielson, a 23-year-old fellow rationalist, she was intrigued to learn of her offbeat solution to high rent: living in a sailboat, for just the cost of mooring. Danielson offered to let Ziz join her on the boat.Like Ziz, Danielson had abandoned formal schooling – a full ride at Rice to study ethical AI,accordingto the San Francisco Chronicle – and, like Ziz, was trans and avoided eating meat. They even looked so similar, Ziz later wrote, that “strangers assumed we were siblings”.During their long exchanges of ideas, Danielson said she was an otherkin (someone who identifies as nonhuman), Ziz wrote, specifically a dragon:They [Danielson] showed me a dragon-shaped necklace, and said it was a reminder of how they would turn into a dragon after the singularity. And eat their human body, since that seemed like the most fitting way to dispose of it. I said I’d want mine burned once I could escape it.Danielson was shy, people told me, and gradually became so deferential to Ziz that others were concerned.Ziz found living on Danielson’s boat less than ideal, however: Danielson talked to herself constantly.So Ziz bought her own sailboat and moored it nearby. She decided tonameit the Black Cygnet. A cygnet is a baby swan; in popular theories of knowledge, a “black swan” is an unexpected, tectonic event that seems obvious only in retrospect.In her blog, Ziz later attributed her radicalization in part to her housing problems. “I came to see … artificially high housing prices as something that was crucial to escape for anyone who wanted to actually try to save the world. Who wouldn’t accept a 90% probability of [AI] doom.”Ziz’s willingness to talk bluntly about these frustrations – high rents, bad landlords, trouble finding a job – earned her blog a following. In an insular community in which many people believed that airing dirty laundry could harm the cause, sheattractedcredibility among other young, leftwing rationalists.Despite her unhappiness, Ziz’s worldview hadn’t yet hardened into cynicism. She could be kind, too. In an essay online, Zack M Davis, a rationalist who later drew Ziz’s anger in an intellectual disagreementabout gender identity,mentionsin passing that when he had a stress-induced psychotic break, in 2017, she dropped off chocolates – “allegedly good against dementors”.Around this time, Ziz and Danielson dreamed up a project they called “the rationalist fleet”. It would be a radical expansion of their experimental life on the water, with a floating hostel as a mothership. They raised some money for the project. On 1 July 2017, Ziz sent an email to a CFar listserv:We need a total of 5 people who are willing to serve as crew moving a 94’ tugboat (currently named Caleb) from Ketchikan, AK, to the Bay Area…For crew members with no nautical experience, all direct expenses including transportation to Ketchikan, from the Bay back to their place of residence, food, and direct incidentals would be covered.They found some crew members, including one, Dan Powell, who had nautical experience from a stint in the US navy. On 20 July, they set out from Alaska. It went mostly without incident, though one crew member who found Ziz’s assertiveness off-putting debarked early.The ship successfully made it to San Francisco, but a leaky second world war-era tugboat wasn’t the brilliant investment Ziz and Danielson had believed. The US Coast Guard declared the ship a “threat to the public health” and demanded an improvement plan. Powelllosttens of thousands of dollars on the project.Ziz continued blogging. She made friends in the rationalist scene, especially among a group of technically minded trans women. They included Alex Leatham, known as “Somni”, and Emma Borhanian.Leatham had studied math at UCLA and UC Berkeley and seemed to be a vagabond. Someone who went to high school with Leatham, in an upper-middle-class suburb of LA, recalled her to me as “really smart, beyond genius”, conspicuously bored in most classes and “extremely socially awkward”, but part of a group of math-geek friends. Her yearbook quote wasIch aufsteigen: “I rise.”Unlike Leatham, Borhanian had a conventional day job, for a time. She was a software engineer at Google and made good money. In 2017, shedonated$12,000 to Miri.Jessica Taylor, a former AI alignment researcher at Miri, told me she was loosely part of that group for a while. In late 2017, she had a nervous breakdown. “I went kind of psychotic,” sheelaboratedin a recent YouTube interview. Afterward, “Ziz offered to, like, help repair my mind, in exchange for information,” she said. “I’m in retrospect glad I declined.”Taylor may have been lucky. Leatham and Borhanian would become two of the most extreme apostles of Zizian ideas. Today, one is incarcerated, and the other is dead.One of the traits that distinguishes humans from machines is our ability to live with contradiction. Arguably, we need nuance – even if that flexibility also allows a certain amount of moral hypocrisy. Many of us would consider it murder if someone harmed our cat or dog, yet eat meat. We raise money for a neighbor with cancer, and blithely scroll past a news article about a cholera outbreak in Sudan that sickens hundreds of people.But Ziz, according to her writing and to people who know her, has an engineer’s obsession with taxonomy and consistency – albeit “consistency” that often involves leaps of logic. Once she comes to a particular conclusion, she applies it literally, maximally, and with confidence impervious to restraint. Her writing is contemptuous of the idea that actions should bejudgedright or wrong merely because laws or social norms say so.Her personal philosophy also draws heavily on a branch of thought called “decision theory”, which forms the intellectual spine of Miri’s research on AI risk.Decision theory studies how “rational agents” behave in situations of uncertainty. In trying to guess how a superintelligent AI in the future might act, we might try to predict that AI’s thinking with decision theory. Or an AI in the distant future, trying to guess what its human creators would have wanted it to do in a situation, might run a similar prediction to “ask” us.Because we and the future will be effectively communicating with each other through these predictions, some rationalists do not believe that our relationship with the future is linear. To a certain sort of person, such as Ziz, the schools of thought thatgrapplewith these hypotheticals pose exciting questions. Or frightening ones.In 2010, a writer on LessWrong published a notorious thought experiment that became known as “Roko’s basilisk”. The gist of the convoluted hypothetical was that, in the distant future, a superintelligent AI might decide to punish people who had been able to bring it into existence sooner, but didn’t – rich people or, say, AI researchers. Roko was suggesting that the future could blackmail the present.Some readers supposedly reacted with panic, believing that merely by having become aware of the hypothetical, they had been condemned to an eternal, AI-administered hell. Yudkowsky was furious that Roko had even posted the theory, in part, he pointed out, because blackmail only works if the person being blackmailed is aware of it. He deleted the post, and banned discussion of it for several years.The essay is sometimes cited as an example of what Bostrom, the Swedish philosopher, has called an “infohazard” – information that is innately dangerous. Today, rationalists tend to react with embarrassment if Roko’s basilisk is brought up, anddismissit as a silly thought experiment thatshould nothave been taken seriously.Yet Ziz did. She mentions it often in her writing, in a way that suggests intrusive thoughts. Similarly, she seems preoccupied with moral purity, to a point verging on obsessive scrupulosity. She describes her veganism in misanthropic terms – Zizians call meat-eating “carnism”, and non-vegans “flesh-eating monsters” – and in one essay recounts her anxiety at discovering ants in a shower. She weighs the costs of being late to work, thereby risking her job, against the moral cost of killing theinsects.Ziz became increasingly convinced that the AI-risk community had lost its way: Miri, in its early years, had started as a project to accelerate AI, before pivoting to focus on AI safety; shebelieved it wasn’t doing enough to prevent a hostile AI – that its leaders were self-interested people who would sacrifice others to an AI hell to save themselves, and that their considerations of the future did not account for the wellbeing of other sentient animals.She began to believe that it was not only probable but virtually certain that a future AI would subject her, personally, to some kind of damnation. Her writing also treated abstract ideas with increasing, and alarming, literality. Decision theory became, in her hands, justification for confrontation, escalation and retaliation.“Ziz didn’t do the things she did because of decision theory,” a prominent rationalist told me. She used it “as a prop and a pretext, to justify a bunch of extreme conclusions she was reaching for regardless”.Ziz also felt that naturally altruistic people were easily victimized by others because of their goodness. She wondered if good people should learn to act evil – that perhaps the only way the world could be saved was by a cadre of intelligent people whoadoptedthe methods of sociopaths.Some rationalists were surprised, and a bit put off, when Ziz announced that she would now be known as Ziz. The name comes from Worm, aroughly7,000-page serial fantasy story that many rationalists have read. Ziz is analiasused by a monster called the Simurgh, part of a group of villains called the Endbringers.The Simurgh has an unsettling power, a reader of Worm told me. She’s an infohazard: anyone “who has encountered the Simurgh for too long, listened to the Simurgh for too long, becomes a liability. Because at some point in the future they will go crazy and cause a bunch of destruction.”A couple years ago, Oliver Habryka, the CEO of Lightcone, a company affiliated with LessWrong, published an essay asking why people in the rationalism, effective altruism and AI communities “sometimes go crazy”.Habryka waswritingnot long after Sam Bankman-Fried, a major funder of AI research, had begun a spectacular downfall that would end in his conviction for $10bn of fraud. Habryka speculated that when a community is defined by a specific, high-stakes goal (such as making sure humanity isn’t destroyed by AI), members feel pressure to conspicuously live up to the “demanding standard” of that goal.Habryka used the word “crazy” in the non-clinical sense, to mean extreme or questionable behavior. Yet during the period when Ziz was making her way toward what she would call “the dark side”, the Berkeley AI scene seemed to have a lot of mental health crises.“This community was rife with nervous breakdown,” a rationalist told me, in a sentiment others echoed, “and it wasn’t random.” People working on the alignment problem “were having these psychological breakdownsbecausethey were in this environment”. There were even suicides, including of two people who were part of the Zizians’ circle.Wolford, the startup founder and former rationalist, described a chicken-and-egg situation: “If you take the earnestness that defines this community, and you look at civilization-ending risks of a scale that are not particularly implausible at this point, and you are somebody with poor emotional regulation, which also happens to be pretty common among the people that we’re talking about – yeah, why wouldn’t you freak the hell out? It keepsmeup at night, and I have stuff to distract me.”A high rate of pre-existing mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental disorders was probably also a factor, she and others told me. (Respondents to a 2016 survey of users of LessWrongreportedrates of ADHD significantly higherthanthe average for the adult US population.) The community also attracted people eager for hacks and shortcuts (“speedruns”, “munchkining”) for self-improvement or “optimization”.Rationalists had considerable openness to new experiences, but sometimes poordisciplineor judgment, and could embody the old joke about being so open-minded that one’s brain falls out – trying Buddhist meditation, polyamory, LSD and a radical diet in the same week, without considering why that might be a bad idea.Some people were fond of the idea that there is a thin line between genius and psychosis, rationalists told me, and were eager to find it. Ziz is “actually straight edge [and] super paranoid about drugs”, Nouzen hassaid, but many rationalists weren’t, and psychedelics use was common.To the extent that the community around Miri had always had a tinge of cultishness, some cliques took that tendency further, adopting the language of secret societies, experimenting with ritual magic or trying to give themselves alternate personalitiescalled“tulpas”. People would speak of “mental subprocesses” beingwieldedalmost like sorcery, or of a particular idea infecting them like a contagious virus.In 2021, a former employee of Leverage Research, an organization that hired heavily from the LessWrong blogosphere, published an essayaccusingthe group of behavior including two- to six-hour “group debugging sessions in which we as a sub-faction … would attempt to articulate a ‘demon’ which had infiltrated our psyches from one of the rival groups”.(Leverage’s CEO, Geoff Anders,respondedat the time by saying that the essay “took incredible courage to write”;a representative told me that Leverage disagrees with the essay’s characterizations, and that aninquiryfound them overblown.)There could also be a tendency to treat people like gurus. One such person was Alice Monday, a rationalist who was eventually banned from CFar events for confrontational behavior. (I was unable to contact Monday.)Ziz treated her as a mentor. She also became close with Monday’s roommate, Michelle “Jamie” Zajko, a bioinformatician who had grown up in an affluent suburb of Philadelphia.Soon, Ziz “started writing stuff that sounded a lot like Alice”, a rationalist told me, and acting “a bit more like Alice, more aggressive, more argue-y”. By then, Ziz had adopted long black robes as her signature look. She called her aesthetic “vegan Sith lord”.She had, she later elaborated in a Discord chatroom, “constructed an idiosyncratic religion where I’m religiously required to do whatever I want”.Ziz was still blogging regularly. She and Danielson were toying with some unusual theories about the brain. They speculated that every person is in fact “two” people, because the two hemispheres of the brain could have different personalities, genders, and good or bad moralities. They alsoexperimentedwith “unihemispheric sleep”, a method of trying to make half of your body sleep while half remains awake.To someone who is not a rationalist or AI-risk thinker, let alone a Zizian, much of Ziz’s writing would look like gibberish, perhaps even written by someone suffering from hallucinations. Here is one passagefrom2019:I think vampires are people who have made the choices long ago of a zombie or lich, who have been exposed to the shade to such a degree that it left pain that cannot be ignored by allowing their mind to dissolve. The world has forced them to be able to think. They do not have the life-orientation that revenants have to incorporate the pain and find a new form of wholeness.Yet Ziz’s writing was, at least in some sense, coherent, which was part of what made it seductive. It was cipher targeted to an extraordinarily specific reader – someone who knows computer jargon, has mathematical ability, has read hundreds of pages of Yudkowsky’s canonical work, understands decision theory, and is familiar with an array of niche fantasy and sci-fi references.Even then, she often coined her own concepts or gave new meanings to phrases from elsewhere. The vocabulary is so confusing that Nouzen helped to compile a glossary. When I saved the glossary as a Word document, it came to 78 pages.The only way to understand Ziz’s writing was to learn her language and theories; the problem was that this had a tendency to turn people into Zizians.By 2019, fissures were creeping into the rationalist community. A few years earlier, a former employee of Miri had created a salacious webpage that accused people affiliated with the organization of statutory rape. The president of Miri responded at the time,accordingto Wired, by saying that he had investigated “some of the most serious allegations” and “found them to be straightforwardly false”.Miri eventually reached an unspecified agreement with the ex-employee, who signed a document retracting his claims.Ziz came to believe that Miri had paid a monetary settlement to make the website’s author go away. She was enraged. A core principle of Miri’s understanding of decision theory is that a rational actor should never pay blackmail, because it encourages blackmailers. She seemed as angry about what she saw as that hypocrisy as about the allegations themselves. Her entire worldview had been built on the credibility of decision theory; now the scaffolding threatened to topple.At the same time, Ziz, Danielson and Leatham, who were having trouble finding employment, were considering suing CFar because, they argued, it discriminated against transgender women in hiring.(CFar disagrees with that characterization.)On 15 November 2019, the day of CFar’s annual retreat, Ziz sent an email to hundreds of people accusing Miri and CFar of “institutional betrayal”. She, Borhanian, Leatham and Danielson, dressed in black and wearing Guy Fawkes masks, attempted to disrupt the retreat. They handed out ramblingfliersaccusing Yudkowsky of contributing to an AI “arms race”, and blocked a road with a truck.Someone called the police and said, wrongly, that they were armed. A Swat teammobilizedand arrested all four. They were booked, subjected to what they later said were humiliating strip searches, and spent several days in jail. They were charged with four misdemeanors, as well as felony conspiracy, though the cases were never resolved.Ziz was consumed with revenge. Before she was arrested, she had alsosentan email to Yudkowsky:There is one crime in my religion thought to be punishable by hell. And that is lifting an evil god to heaven, feeding your fellow sentient beings to it in order to reach heaven yourself…I will burn down all evil gods on their thrones; see them in hell if I must. And I stake my soul, and much more importantly the multiverse, on justice without compromise or concession …If you want to make it out of this universe alive, I suggest you do the same.While living at the marina, Ziz and Danielson had met Curtis Lind, a friendly older man who docked his 117ft boat there. Lind was kind, his friendtoldOpen Vallejo; he once tried to convince city officials to use cruise ships as housing for homeless people. Heletducks and geese live on his boat.“He tended to not have very good judgment in his choice of people,” his friend Thomas Young said. “That’s partly how these people got into his life.”The rationalist fleet hadn’t worked out, so the Zizians had moved to a new strategy: “slackmobiles” made from covertly converted box trucks. The theory was that a commercial truck provided the mobile and cheap living of an RV, but more inconspicuously, to avoid camping permits and the attention of cops.Ziz and her friends acquired trucks and parked them near the docks while they retrofitted the interiors with beds and cooking equipment. They cut holes in the bottom of the trucks’ holds, toaccessthem without opening the cargo doors, and wriggled in and out to the raised eyebrows of people at the marina.View image in fullscreen‘At their best, rat houses were fun places to be an intellectually minded idealist.’Illustration: Matt Rota/The GuardianLind had decided to sell his boat and move to a trailer lot he owned in Vallejo. He was thinking of letting artists and craftspeople live on the lot in exchange for cheap rent. The Zizians loved the idea.Danielsonmadean agreement with Lind to use some trailers on the property as well as park up to half a dozen trucks there. She and Ziz abandoned their tugboat to sink slowly into the harbor, leaking oil.By early 2020, Ziz, Danielson, Borhanian and Leatham had moved their trucks to the Vallejo lot. The Zizians were increasingly isolated from the larger rationalist scene. Vallejo is about 30 minutes from Berkeley, and they’d been banned from CFar functions. They were outcasts of outcasts, too weird even for a community that prided itself on weirdness. Yet new people continued to trickle into the circle.One was Maximilian Snyder, known as “Audere”. He’d graduated from a prestigious private school in Seattle, then done academic work in philosophy and computer science at Oxford. He visited the Vallejo lot, along with someone who later told police she was named Suri Dao.According to people familiar with the group, prosecutors andreportingby the San Francisco Chronicle, Dao was almost certainly a recent high-school graduate from Denver named Tessa “Elizah” Berns, and almost certainly also the author of an account on Tumblr and Discord called Silver-and-Ivory.The Tumblr account contains dense discussions of leftwing political ethics, and expresses anger at parents (“almost all parents are evil in intent”), schooling and psychiatry. The author describesdealingwith “scrupulosity”anda “tendency to freak out and assign myself terrible painful punishments hyperbolically when I think I’ve screwed up”. The author also says she identifies as “bigender” anduseseither masculine or feminine pronouns.Berns was adopted from China, a childhood friend told the Chronicle, and had been bullied as a child. She’d been a spelling bee finalist in middle school andfinishedhigh school as a National Merit Scholar. She was thinking of running away from her first year of college, an idea which found sympathetic ears on a rationalist Discord chatroom that the Zizians frequented.Like the other Zizians, Berns welled with an anger at the world that seemed to braid genuine, visceral despair at moral injustice with adolescent self-absorption.Discord conversations would sometimes turn into speculations about the psychologies of famous killers such as Ted Kaczynski; during one such discussion, Berns offered a strange aside:silver-and-ivory:it’s really awkward talking about this because I’ve had very dramatic fantasies about becoming a knife murdererand I wrote this whole fake news article about it (…I’m not going to share here)A common theme of the chatroom discussions was resentment of authority – the government, the AI establishment, and especially parents and schooling.Here are Borhanian and a user who has been identified as Leatham:𒀭 💮 [Leatham]:not only do public schools function like public hospitals function like public courthouses function like public jails, they are also made out of the same materials. the same plastic chairs with cold aluminum legs, the same pinboards on the walls, the same clocks, the same “administrators” walking around. they all blur together. id microsleep during school too. it was so boring. i knew more math than the teachers and was forced to be thereemma.:i remember in like, second grade, a bunch of teachers standing around my desk saying i was hopeless and i’d never be able to do anything because when they told me to practice drawing cursive L’s and I’s I couldn’t get consistent sizes, and started drawing a border around my page insteadlater I was diagnosed with dyspraxia, learning disability affecting fine motor tasks …𒀭 💮 [Leatham]:they confiscated my katana [samurai sword], tried to make me sit in chairs a certain way, gave me an F for turning in a 10-page poem when they asked for a 1-page poem. i carved out some space such that i would just have chinese tea ceremonies at the back of class and talk with someone about math and [LessWrong] and would sit in my chair weird and refuse to pay attention and they stopped trying to stop me.…also i threw desks around because i was bored. not at anyone, i just wanted to throw desks. i did refuse to go to school my last year of highschool.emma.:…when i went to private school my parents would threaten to send me to public school insteadeveryone said i was so weird the kids there would super bully me and i’d get beat up or somethingwe must get revenge someday. for all of this.There was a similar discussion about the ethics of obligation to family:emma.:umm i’m curious what other ppl would do [with regards to] spending large amounts of money to save the life of a birth-family memberZiz:I would not…My family’s stance on the cosmos and [mine] are fundamentally misaligned. They chose to give their souls to the gods of the easy path, including evolution, as they commit suicide. My parents did not choose to create me in some timeless contract, some considered decision, they rolled the dice because their programming told them to.Adopting vocabulary from the multiplayer video game Among Us, some of the Zizians had started to speak of foes as “impostors” and of “airlocking” people they didn’t trust.Chatroom conversations sometimes spiraled into violent fantasies:emma.:like imagine getting tons and tons of revenge for JUSTICE!! isn’t that cool?silver-and-ivory:are you sure? do you get to hold bloody knives?as you plunge the knife into someone’s bared throatam unclear on how much i actually want to stab my mothers [her parents were gay women] but probably a lotemma.:Yesi mean if you wantthose can totally be good thingsemma.:like there’s totally a different way to do good vengeance vs evil vengeance, like, the shape of the poetry is different butbrutally plunging a knife into [a person’s] throat sounds like a clean killthey have to be actually bad thoughlike forcing you to go to school or somethingon pain of deathwhich is totally a thing parents door any of the other really bad things they do“kill your parents” is a very good memesilver-and-ivory:so much of my revenge imagery is about bleeding people dry, hanging the white women on my wall like beautiful dead butterflies, etc etc etcout of resentment for the false ideal they claimed to be and the reality of their imperfect selvesso that they can be perfect again in deathAfter two years of internal feuds, scandals and a pandemic, the rationalist community was under severe strain. Advances in machine learning had also called into question many of Miri’s technical assumptions about AI. Then the research organization OpenAI began investing in AI development at a scale that doomers found disturbing.In April 2022, Yudkowskypublisheda bleak essay of defeat: “It’s obvious at this point that humanity isn’t going to solve the alignment problem, or even try very hard, or even go out with much of a fight. Since survival is unattainable, we should shift the focus of our efforts to helping humanity die [with] slightly more dignity.”Confusion and disillusion slowly set in. Many people had paid dearly, personally and financially, to come to northern California to solve the alignment problem. They’d devoted years to the mission, often at great opportunity cost to their careers. They’d made the best friends they’d ever had, and then – in an environment where some people believed it was literally impossible to agree to disagree – lost them to bitter intellectual schisms, exhaustion and nervous collapse. They’d sacrificed to be present at the birth of the future, and now discovered that the future was already being born elsewhere.At the Vallejo lot, the Zizians embraced this burnout. Once upon a time they’d been National Merit Scholars, math-club types. Now, free from the constraints of external authorities and structures, they returned to a state of nature. They walked around naked, carried katanas, kept their own hours. They were feral,and relished it.Despite their peculiarities, the Zizians’ time at the lot had started well enough. Within a few months of their arrival, however, they’d stopped paying rent, citing a state Covid moratorium. Borhanian was probably the only one with any savings, and she had quit her Google job. The Zizians’ rent strike went on for two years, in an account Lind latergaveto a documentary filmmaker, and “got to the point where if they saw me they’d run away”.After the Covid law ended, in 2022, Lind decided to evict them.The Zizians requested a meeting to ask to stay for another two months for free. At the meeting, “I said, no, I can’t do that,” he recalled. “So one of them took out a … fairly large folding knife. And started patting the blade in his hand like this and looking at me and smiling.”Lind turned around and left. The next day he bought a gun.View image in fullscreenCurtis Lind was kind, he’d once tried to convince city officials to use cruise ships for homeless people.Illustration: Matt Rota/The GuardianTwo days before the sheriff’s office was scheduled to evict the Zizians, Berns approached Lind at the lot, according to Lind, and asked for his help turning off a tap leaking water into a trailer.As he bent to look, something hit him on the head and he blacked out. When he woke up, at least three of the Zizians were allegedly standing around him with knives.“[T]he right side of my skull was shattered,” Lind later said. “And I was bleeding from numerous puncture wounds … The back of my neck had some severe cuts. Like somebody was trying to cut my head off.” His torso was impaled with a samurai sword.Lind drew his gun, which was concealed in a pocket, and started shooting. He wounded Leatham and killed Borhanian. He stumbled away with the sword still in him. He survived, but lost an eye.Some friends of the Zizians have argued that the eruption of violence wasn’t so one-sided – or even that the Zizians, not Lind, were the ones acting in self-defense.The authorities did not agree. Leatham and Berns were arrested and charged with attempted murder. They were also charged with responsibility for Borhanian’s death, under a California felony murder law. At the lot after the attack, police also tried to interrogate a tall blond person there whose description matches that of Ziz. That person suddenly began having an apparent medical emergency. At a hospital, they vanished.When Lind’s friends and family latersearchedthe Zizians’ trucks, theyfoundmore than a dozen encrypted computers and an array of surgical equipment. They also found containers of lye, which they believed the Zizians intended to use to dissolve Lind’s body.Once the tipping point was reached, events seemed to accelerate by their own logic.In February, 2022, according to police, Michelle Zajko bought a 9mm pistol, ammunition and a holster in Vermont. She was now living there with Monday, as well as with a third acquaintance, Daniel Blank, a Berkeley bioengineering and computer science grad whose parents reported him missing.Zajko published a blogpostalludingto a power struggle of sorts. She claimed that Ziz had recently told her that the only way to regain her trust would be to murder Monday (“Ziz helpfully suggested I use a gun with a potato as a makeshift suppressor, and that I might destroy the body with lye”), and that if she didn’t, Ziz would come to Vermont and kill her.That never happened. Later that year, for unclear reasons, she and Ziz reconciled.Then, on the night of 31 December 2022, according to police documents, a neighbor’s doorbell camera captured a car arriving at Zajko’s parents’ house, in a suburb of Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter there was a flurry of movement at the Zajkos’ door. A higher-pitched voice appeared to be saying “Mom!” Two people later left the house.A few days later, Rita and Richard Zajko were found dead at home. They had been shot to death, with what police believed were 9mm bullets, during an apparent home invasion.Not long after that, Zajko went to Pennsylvania to identify her parents’ bodies and make funeral arrangements. She was their only heir. State troopers executed a search warrant at the hotel where she was staying, detained her, and found $40,000 in cash in her Subaru.The police also found Ziz in an adjoining hotel room, along with Blank. When they arrested them, Ziz lay down on the ground, shut her eyes and refused to move. She had to be carried out. Her booking photo shows her eyes closed, as if catatonic.Ziz was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Police continued investigating Zajko as a possible murder suspect, but did not charge her.Ziz spent five months in jail. On 22 June 2023, a judge agreed to reduce her bail. She was released on an unsecured bond, and never showed up to her court date.Within a year, two people thousands of miles away, who had never met Ziz, began acting strangely.The first was Felix Bauckholt, known as Ophelia, an earnest math prodigy from Germany who was working in New York as a quantitative trader. She was alreadymakinghalf a million dollars a year at the age of 26, but “was kind of a nonconformist”, Jessica Taylor told me, and extremely interested in political ethics. Bauckholt was online friends with some of the Zizians, and in one conversation she seemed to defend the Zizians’ alleged attack on Lind, Taylor said.The other person was Teresa Youngblut, a young computer science student at the University of Washington. Youngblut, who sometimes went as “Milo”, had attended the same private high school as Maximilian Snyder, and they’d reconnected online. Snyder had recentlywonhis AI research prize, and they had a lot to discuss.Around June and July, Bauckholt started taking secret phone calls,accordingto people who knew her. She cut contact with friends. In November she got on a flight and did not return. Not long after, Youngblut’s parents contacted police to report her missing, too, and in the grips of what they believed was a controlling romantic relationship.After disappearing, Bauckholt and Youngblut both went to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they lived at a rental property with Ziz and Zajko.Then, this January, Bauckholt and Youngblut went to Vermont. They wanted to see a property for sale – a remote, completely off-the-grid house, on 11 acres near the Quebec border.An employee at the hotel where they were staying contacted authorities about two guests who dressed in black, carried guns and acted strangely; the US border patrol began monitoring them.On 16 January 2025, back in Vallejo, prosecutors asked a judge to expedite Berns and Leatham’s trial for allegedly attacking Lind. The judge agreed. The next day, while Lind was at his lot, a man who prosecutors say was Snyder approached Lind, grabbed him and stabbed him to death.Three days later, Agent David Maland of the US border patrol pulled over Youngblut and Bauckholt as they were driving a Prius southbound near the Canadian border. Other officers arrived behind Maland.Youngblut, knowing Snyder had recently been arrested, may have panicked. She allegedly drew a gun and started shooting. Bauckholt also allegedly drew a gun. The officers returned fire, wounding Youngblut and killing Bauckholt.Maland died a short time later at the hospital.On 16 February, Ziz, Zajko and Blank were arrested in a rural area of western Maryland, not far from Pennsylvania, where they were living in two box trucks that they’d parked on a stranger’s land. They had handguns and a rifle, according to authorities, but surrendered nonviolently.According to a police report, Zajko pleaded with officers not to kill her.Snyder has now been arrested for Lind’s murder in California, joining Berns and Leatham. (All three deny the charges against them.) Berns and Leatham have both made escape attempts, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors also believe that “Suri Dao” was an alias Berns made up while being arrested;her lawyer hassaidthat is irrelevant.Berns and Leatham are both being held in mental health facilities, according to Wired, and are in significant distress. Berns has engaged in self-mutilation.Youngblut has been charged with attacking a federal officer. (She pleaded not guilty.) According to court filings, the car she and Bauckholt were in contained hollow-point ammunition, a night-vision monocular, a ballistic helmet, shooting targets, full-face respirator masks, handheld radios, cellphoneswrappedin tin foil, a dozen unspecified electronic devices, and a diary with references to doing LSD and passages of “apparent cypher text”.Ziz, Zajko and Blank are being held in a county jail in Maryland. They’ve been charged with trespassing and obstructing an officer; Ziz and Zajko have also been charged with firearms offenses. All three deny the charges against them, and at this time none have been charged in relation to any of the deaths that have occurred.During a recent hearing, Ziz pleaded for vegan food in jail and suggested she may be suffering from malnutrition. “I haven’t done anything wrong,” she told the judge. “I shouldn’t be here.”Theattorneyrepresenting Ziz in Pennsylvania, Daniel McGarrigle, told me that she is “wholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case”, and “has been vilified mercilessly” despite the fact that “only low-level misdemeanor charges” are pending in both the Pennsylvania and Maryland cases.Maland was recentlyburiedwith military honors. He was engaged to be married.The exact whereabouts of Alice Monday and Gwen Danielson are unknown, though both appear to be alive. They seem to have cut ties with the Zizians, and may bescaredthemselves.It goes without saying that the AI-risk and rationalist communities are not morally responsible for the Zizians any more than any movement isaccountablefor a deranged fringe. Yet there is a sense that Ziz acted, well, not unlike a runaway AI – taking ideas and applying them with zealous literality, pushing her mission to its most bizarre, final extremes.Although self-serving and grandiose, Ziz is probably to some extent sincere – “a true believer”, one person told me. It is unclear, however, what the Zizians’ long-term objectives were, if any. The murders they allegedly committed were less calculated acts of political violence than the flailing of a paranoid clique plunging out of society with no plan for how to get back.All they had left, in the end, was Oedipal rage, certainty in their conclusions and guns. Their alleged victims were an elderly landlord who liked to feed ducks, two suburbanite parents, a cop doing his job and themselves.Rachel Wolford, the startup founder, asked for anyone reading this to know that “there are a lot of weird nerds who are doing a lot of really good things. They are meaningfully trying to make the world better. It’s not that weird nerds are bad; it’s that weird nerds have specific failure modes that specific branches of Silicon Valley have done a very poor job of checking.”While expressing a range of views about AI safety, she and others believe it is still an important problem worth humanity’s time. They emphasized that AI does not need to become the distant basilisk of doomers’ waking nightmares to create seriouseconomic,surveillance,environmentalandsocialdilemmas in our near future.That message is increasingly unpopular in Silicon Valley, where the doomers have, by and large, lost to the accelerationists.Similarly, the rationalists’ influence has waned. “Post-rationalism” – a schoolemphasizingthe self-help aspects of the scene, and trading hard-headed rationality for new age-y spirituality – is ascendent, though splinters and remnants live on in freewheeling Discord chats and officious Reddit forums.So far, Snyder is the only one of the Zizians who has made any real public statement about his beliefs. Hedictateda 1,500-word letter to the San Francisco Chronicle to give to Yudkowsky, “from one student among many, to his old teacher”. The letter called on him to think of animals as “brothers and sisters”, and lamented that Yudkowsky “could have been much more pessimistic about humanity much sooner and avoided starting the AI arms race”.Yudkowsky refused to read it. To do so would be to surrender to blackmail and incentivize more alleged violence. Snyder, as a student of decision theory, ought to have known."

But it struggles to match the seamless gaming experience I yearn forKeza MacDonaldWed 5 Mar 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 10.03 ESTShareHappy Monster Hunter Wilds week to all who celebrate: Capcom’s thrilling action game has sold8m unitsin three days, which means that quite a lot of you are likely to be playing it. I’m a huge fan of this series and amdelighted by the latest entry, but after filing the review last week, I’ve barely had a minute to play it since it came out. Regular readers will know that this is a familiar problem for me: I have two kids, so my gaming time is tight, and the living room TV is very often in use.I anticipated this, so in the run-up to Monster Hunter Wilds’ release, I spent £200 on aPlayStation Portal– essentially a screen sandwiched between two halves of a PlayStation 5 controller. I can’t decide whether it’s one of the most unwieldy things that Sony has ever come out with, or one of the most elegant. It lets me stream games from my PS5, so the console can be whirring away under the TV and I can be on the sofa with my little screen, swinging a transforming axe at adreadful octopus.Here’s how the Portal works: you turn it on, and it makes pleasing futuristic noises. A circular portal appears, pulsing soothingly, as it tries to connect to your home console. Then, if it works (sometimes it took a few attempts for me), your PlayStation 5 homepage appears through that portal, and expands to fill the whole of the screen in your hands. Then you can play everything just as you would on your TV, with controller rumble and haptic feedback and everything. When the internet connection falters, the device downgrades the game’s appearance rather than booting you out; it’ll let the game become a soup of pixels and weird messy visual artefacts rather than forcing you to reconnect.View image in fullscreenMonster Hunter Wilds looks perfect on the PS Portal … when the device works.Photograph: CapcomI have played with a whole bunch of game-streaming “solutions” over the years (the first wasGaikai, way back in 2009, which offered games like World of Warcraft streamed from the cloud, still very novel at the time), and they have always been, well, suboptimal. No matter how good your internet connection was, there was always just that bit too much lag. Streamed games always looked noticeably worse. Wifi was neverquitereliable enough. But the Portal works stunningly well on my home wifi. Monster Hunter looks perfect. It’s a demanding action game, so any lag quickly makes it feel unplayable, yet I have been able to play it on the Portal for many hours without feeling too frustrated.You can also use the Portal to play PS5 games away from home, using the device to turn your console on remotely in your empty house (tip: yank the HDMI cable out the back before you leave so it won’t turn your TV on). I took the Portal on a wee half-term holiday with my family – certainly more convenient than packing up an entire console and all its gubbins – and had a go at connecting to my home PlayStation 5 from my hotel room. It took a few tries, but itdidwork even on hotel wifi, which I found near-miraculous. Unfortunately, under these circumstances, the streaming quality was sometimes so bad that the game looked worse than it did 15 years ago on the PSP, and the lag was unbearable. It was not the on-the-go PlayStation gaming experience I was hoping for.The Portal is a useful little gadget – at home, when it works. And that is the case with any kind of internet-reliant game streaming: it’s goodwhen it works. One day I would love to be able to play my games wherever I am, without sacrificing the quality of the experience, but streaming technology hasn’t gotten there yet and I’m starting to wonder if it ever will. It’s certainly gotten better: I’ve streamed games from theXbox’s Game Passlibrary on my home console with only the occasional problem. But what I really want is to be able to stream games to a handheld when I’m in my office or travelling.TheNintendo Switchwas released eight years ago, and it remains the gold standard of at home/on-the-go hybrid gaming – because it doesn’t rely on an internet connection. It just works, seamlessly: you pick it up and take it with you, put it in the dock and it instantly appears on the TV. The Switch changed my life, by letting me fit my game time around my job, friends, travel and family. TheSteam Deckhas also been transformative, letting me take a game I’m reviewing (or enjoying) from my office to my house, or play it on a long-haul flight. We’re used to this now, after almost a decade, but it was truly one of the most revolutionary technical things any console has achieved.It’s only a few weeks until the bigNintendo Switch 2event on 2 April, when we’ll learn more about what this next console can actually do. Given that this is Nintendo, I’d be surprised if internet-based game streaming was a part of the new console’s offering; Nintendo tends to favour older, proven technology over risky bets. Eight years is a long time for Nintendo’s competitors to have perfected an alternative untethered gaming solution, and nobody has yet done it. Perhaps it’s just not possible; no wonder the Switch 2 is sticking to what works.What to playView image in fullscreenAmbitious and gently silly … Split FictionPhotograph: Electronic ArtsFrom the makers ofco-op divorce platformerIt Takes Two – which unexpectedly, sold 23m copies, a figure that publishers would do well to remember in this age of safe bets –Split Fictionis an ambitious and gently silly game about two authors who are forced to inhabit each other’s stories. Sci-fi writer Mio and fantasy writer Zoe turn up at a meeting at a big publishing house, only for its sinister CEO to imprison them in a futuristic idea-stealing machine.You need two players for this game, as it’s entirely dependent on working together for both the puzzley and actiony bits. (Don’t worry if there’s a skill differential between you and your prospective co-op partner – one player can do most of the heavy lifting if required.) It’s full of ideas, this, and wonderfully designed around co-operative play, whether you’re playing with a friend, a partner or an older child.Available on:PC, Xbox, PlayStation 5Estimated playtime:15 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenBetter skate than never … Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4.Photograph: SteamTony Hawk’s Pro Skateris back, again.

I’m sure we can all immediately think of a TV show we enjoyed as teenagers that we find deeply embarrassing now (*cough* Family Guy *cough*) – but we tend to make excuses for the games we adored when we were young, even if our tastes have changed massively since then. I would have talked your ear off about how greatShenmuewas as a teenager, because everything it did was new at the time. Now, even if you ignore the technological advances that have made realistic-looking game worlds standards, the sheer cringeworthy thinness of the plot and characters make it harder to love. I adored a lot of JRPGs, fromSkies of ArcadiatoDragon Quest, that I simply wouldn’t be able to enjoy now due to their slow pace (and the interminable repetitive random battles).Also, in the 00s we all gave a lot of games a pass for being technically interesting or ambitious, when they were also juvenile and/or sexist. I’m thinking especially of 2005’sIndigo Prophecyhere (Fahrenheit in the US), a game that was certainly interesting but also rife with racial and gender stereotyping that made me want to cringe myself inside out when I replayed it a few years later. I remember defending an obscure Japanese horror-ish game that put all the female characters into a strip-club room as a reward for finishing the game, because it was otherwise novel. These days, with the benefit of age and experience, my tolerance for casual sexism is basically zero – and quite a few games in my PS2-era collection would now be more difficult to enjoy.If you’ve got a question for Question Blockemail us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Clad in full scuba gear, she would have gone unnoticed as she weaved among the usual visitors – a bored gaggle of schoolchildren, tourists, and a yeti – were it not for a beady eyed security guard. The woman, it turns out, was a member of an infamous crime syndicate, renowned for breaking into museums, stealing priceless exhibits and slipping back into the sewers like a well-remunerated goldfish. As my security guard tackled the thief, the museum’s prehistory expert neatly sidestepped the fray and departed for a far-flung corner of the Earth, soon to return with a prized relic of the ancient world. Burglars get caught; museums just hire better qualified thieves and send them on expeditions.This is the kind of whimsical satire that Two Point Studios trades on, making delightful and irreverent management games that poke fun at very serious establishments: hospitals, universities, and now museums. Here, as the curator of the county’s timeworn institutions, you must protect profit first and history second. Easier said than done when there’s so much to manage: you must hire experts to source and maintain exhibits, assistants to run front-of-house, janitors to scrape stubborn substances from floors, and security guards to handle donations and play whack-a-mole with criminals.Tour routes must be carefully plotted and decorated to impress, thus generating “buzz” and convincing visitors to make a donation. Different visitor types like different things: sage professors crave knowledge from well-placed information stands, while hyperactive children just want something that goesbeep. To please pint-sized punters, you need to research and build kid-friendly interactive displays in the workshop, paying for the materials through any fundraising means necessary, whether that be loans, gift-shop sales, or advertising deals with local businesses. It’s a beautifully detailed operation that suggests the developers have paid close attention to human nature, and how to mirror it in an intriguing game-loop.You can imagine that the curators atthe British Museum scratch their heads over the same challenges (save the scuba thieves). Some visitors barrel straight through, pausing just long enough to take a selfie with the most popular exhibit, while others will spend hours in the gift shop. Two Point does a spectacular job of simulating the challenge of satisfying diverse crowds … despite the fact that here, your audience includes literalclowns.Museum themes range from the expected – prehistoric, aquatic, botanical – to the outlandish – haunted, extraterrestrial, apocalyptic. Previous instalments in the Two Point series forced your institutions to stay siloed (it would have been odd, after all, for a sports university to install a wizarding magic department). But the very nature of museums requires a joyful mishmash of curiosities, allowing you to build wildly varied exhibits across unique locations. The aquarium, for instance, offers expeditions that yield the prehistoric bones of sea creatures, or cursed booty from creepy sunken pirate ships. This means your collection stays useful, rather than languishing in a forgotten inventory menu, and progression feels consistently rewarding.View image in fullscreenHistory repeating itself … Two Point Museum.Photograph: Two Point Studios/SEGAThis is easily the best-looking Two Point game yet, even the simple act of placing objects has been improved, with priceless artefacts wobbling precariously as you move them.

Age ratings are intended to help parents determine whether or not a game is appropriate for their children. But in practice, an erroneous label doesn’t just mislead consumers – it can be the difference between success or failure.Balatro is an award-winning poker game made by ananonymous game developer known as LocalThunk, in which the only guiding principle is chaos. In each match the player must divine the best possible poker hand out of a randomised draw, but the conditions fluctuate constantly. In one round, the game might prevent you from using an entire suit or junk all your face cards, while the next round might challenge you to achieve an eyebrow-raising score with only a single hand. As the game progresses, players accrue jokers for their deck that add yet more wild rules.It’s an ingenious premise that has allowed a game that began as a small side-project to sell millions of copies since its release in February 2024. Though players win in-game money to buy new cards between rounds, Balatro’s version of poker is fictional, and only bears a faint resemblance to the classic card game. Yet shortly after launching, Balatro hit a snag: it was classified as a gambling game.At first, Balatro went on sale with a classification that deemed it appropriate for audiences ages three and up. But then, the classification was revised to an adults-only 18 rating. The reasoning? The Pan-European Game Information (Pegi), the organisation that determines age classifications, claimed that Balatro “contains prominent gambling imagery and material that instructs about gambling”.Without warning, Balatro was pulled from sale on some digital storefronts in Europe and Asia.“This was obviously a crucial moment and we had two options,” says Wout van Halderen, the communications director at PlayStack, Balatro’s publisher. “Be de-listed, or take the 18+ rating and get back in the store Asap. We opted for the second and started preparing an appeal to have the rating changed.”The appeal was initially declined – and issues began to snowball. In Korea, the rating outright barred Balatro from being sold. In December, when Balatro wonGame of the Yearat The Game awards, the team was also ramping up for a physical release. Another appeal was filed by that version’s distributor, Fireshine. It is only now, a year later and after a handful of updates, that the dust has settled and Balatro has been bumped down to a 12+ rating by Pegi.“It’s difficult to quantify the sales impact, as Balatro’s surge in popularity may have mitigated losses,” Halderen says. “That said, the de-listing disrupted momentum at a key point in the launch. Development-wise, the rating saga took time and resources, but it didn’t fundamentally delay planned updates.”Pegi, for its part, reiterated that it seeks to apply a fair criteria for ratingsin a press release, and that any game that teaches or glamorises gambling will automatically lead to an 18+ rating. The board that oversaw the appeal also ceded that Pegi is a system that “continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process”. To that end, Balatro’s dilemma has led Pegi to create a more granular classification system for games that depict gambling. The 18+ rating will now only apply to games that simulate the type of poker people play at actual casinos.It is a tale with a happy ending for Balatro, yet it highlights the limitations of Pegi’s current system. The appeal process was an extended one, and while that didn’t impact Balatro’s massive success, a smaller game without such acclaim would not fare nearly as well.The wording of the new classification system suggests that any realistic depiction of gambling within a game would still result in an 18+ rating, even if players cannot actually spend, bet or lose money in the game. Meanwhile, games such as EA’s football series Sports FC, which sell players digital loot boxes with randomised contents, sport Pegi’s 3+ classification. The loot boxes only have a small chance of dropping a rare item, which means players are effectively gambling their money by buying them.Even with better classification systems and streamlined processes, any age rating system would struggle to keep consumers informed about the contents of a game in the age of user-generated content. A game like Roblox, for example, is deemed to be appropriate for users 7+ – but the rating does not apply to anything created by players, which is the vast majority of the content, andcan be inappropriate.The reclassification of Balatro has been a great relief for its publisher, and the amendment to Pegi’s rules shows that the organisation is open to change. “We applaud the Pegi Experts Group on their commitment to develop a more granular set of classification criteria as indie games continue to stretch into new ideas and concepts,” Halderen says.“We believe it is a sign of a healthy classification board that it evolves in line with cultural expectations and continues to ensure that audiences understand the type of content present in games.”Explore more on these topicsGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

It had heavyweight cross-party backing from MPs and a string of child protection charities but will now commit the government to researching the issue further rather than immediate change.The government will accept the new proposal, the Guardian understands. Government sources suggested that MacAlister’s original bill would not have received ministers’ backing – and would probably have been talked out or whipped against.They said more time was needed to research the impact of phones on teenagers and assess the evolving technologies that could restrict content developed by the phone companies themselves.Kyle is understood to be opposed to any major bill which would be the equivalent of a second Online Safety Act, which some campaigners want.A source close to Kyle said he was not in principle opposed to further government intervention on this specific issue but that work was at an early stage.The original proposal would have forced social media companies to exclude young teens from algorithms to make content less addictive for under-16s – raising the age of internet adulthood from 13 to 16.It would also have committed the government to a review of the sale of phones to teens and whether additional technological safeguards should be on phones sold to under-16s. Both measures have been removed from the final bill.Another measure to ban mobile phones in schools had already been dropped after opposition by Phillipson, who is understood to believe schools should police themselves. One government source said they did not believe there should be criminal or civil penalties for phones being brought into school and it was unclear who would be liable for any breaches.One MP who had backed MacAlister’s bill said there was frustration at the lack of government will on the issue. “It’s effectively seen as a side issue,” the MP said.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is seen as an outlier in cabinet on the need to do more on addictive smartphone use – and had publicly backed MacAlister’s bill.The new version of the private member’s bill will instruct the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, to look at the health impact of smartphone use – giving Streeting’s department some new oversight on the issue. Last year the then US surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, said social media should have smoking-style health warning labels.MacAlister, the MP for Whitehaven and Workington, told the Guardian the bill was a first step in government taking the issue of addictive smartphone use seriously, rather than focusing just on harmful or illegal content.“It will be the first meaningful step from a UK government to engage with the widespread impacts of excessive smartphone and social media use by children,” he said.Violence on social media making teenagers afraid to go out, study findsRead moreMacAlister will present his bill to the Commons on Friday, where MPs will debate it. If ministers then commit to take the new measures forward, as expected, MacAlister will not push the bill to a vote.It will now say that the government must “publish a plan for research into the impact of use of social media on children” and ask the UK’s chief medical officers to prepare advice for parents on the use of smartphones and social media by children.Polling suggests measures to limit their use by young people are extremely popular. More in Common found last month 74% wanted social media banned for under-16s.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaInternet safetyYoung peopleMobile phonesSmartphonesnewsShareReuse this content"

Vladimir Putin’s aggression, hetolda stunned Bundestag in explanation, meant that Europe was living through aZeitenwende, or turning point.Mr Scholz was right. But it has taken the return ofDonald Trumpto the White House to lay bare the full scale of the emerging threat to European values, security and economic interests. For leaders across the continent, the dawning realisation of what Trump 2.0 means for the transatlantic alliance constitutes a second historic moment of jeopardy and decision.Crucially, Mr Scholz’s centre-right successor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, appears ready to act accordingly. Mr Merz won February’s snapelectionon a manifesto that would have boxed in state spending on both defence and a stagnating economy. But on Tuesday heU-turnedto quite spectacular effect, unveiling a proposal to change Germany’s Basic Law to permit huge debt-financed investment in the military and the economy.In a famously cautious political culture, Mr Merz’s bid to bypass legal restrictions on government debt represents aseismic shift. It would permit a step-change in defence spending for years to come, putting Germany in a leadership position as Europe seeks strategic autonomy from the United States.This would not, however, come at the expense of vital investment in other areas. The proposed deal, if passed by the outgoing Bundestag next week, would also incorporate Social Democratic party (SPD) demands for spending on economic and social infrastructure. This would be channelled through a €500bn special fund, also to be financed by borrowing.Mr Merz, a former investment banker, has been a deficit hawk and economic liberal throughout his career. It is an irony of fate that it should fall to him to challenge the debt-aversion that has hobbled Germany’s ability to react to new geopolitical realities. But the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader should be congratulated for having the political courage to read the signs of the times.Across Europe,poorly performingeconomies and a lack of investment have fuelled distrust in mainstream politics, and contributed to the dangerous rise of the Trumpian far right. In Germany, the constitutional “debt brake” – in effect a legal requirement to balance budgets – was originally conceived as a means of protecting younger generations from the consequences of risky borrowing. In these tumultuous times, amid multiple costly challenges, it has instead become an obstacle to investing in their future.Other leaders should take note – not least in Britain, where the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,appears likelyto double down on her self-imposed fiscal rules in this month’s spring statement. Thursday’s EU summit in Brussels is expected to license greater national spending on defence. But for a new era characterised by threats at home and abroad, a sea change in the EU’s overall approach to debt and deficits, similar to that agreed by Mr Merz with the SPD, is needed.Echoing the words of the former European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi, during the eurozone crisis, Mr Merzpledgedon Tuesday to do “whatever it takes” to protect freedom and peace. He will need the support of the Greens, as well as the SPD, to push his gamechanging proposals through. It is in the overwhelming interests of Germany and Europe that he gets it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As the occupying power, Israel is legally bound to allow relief into Gaza under the Geneva convention. Denying it isn’t just inhumane – it’s awar crime. But Benjamin Netanyahu already faces an international criminal courtarrestwarrant for “starvation as a method of warfare” and “crimes against humanity”.Mr Netanyahu’s ability to flout international law is thanks to Donald Trump, who remains firmly in his corner. Washington now appears to accept starvation as an Israeli bargaining chip to pressure Hamas into accepting aUS-devisedtruce extension – one that secures hostage exchanges while ensuring Israeli forces remain in Gaza. Hamas, which sparked the war with its 2023massacreof Israeli civilians, insists Israel honour its commitment to a second phase of Gazaceasefirenegotiations – ending the fighting and withdrawing troops.Palestinians in Gaza are on the brink. Food isrunningout, hospitals are unable to function and families scavenge for clean water. Any further aid restrictions will turn desperation into catastrophe. It would be far better for a negotiated peace to be worked out that would see the Palestinians stay to rebuild their lives and for the remaining Israeli hostages to return home.After 15 months of war, and having achieved many of its declared objectives, Israel is no closer to peace in Gaza. That view is echoed byScott Atranof Paris’s Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, who polled civilians in Gaza in January, shortly before the ceasefire came into effect. Prof Atran correctly argues that Israel lacks a political strategy for Palestine’s future and is only fuelling Palestinian anger.From the outset, the Trump administration has pursued an aggressive, unilateral approach to Gaza, aligning firmly with Israeli interests while disregarding Palestinian concerns. According toNabeel Khoury, a former US state department official, the Abraham accords – Mr Trump’s flagship Middle East initiative – remain central to Washington’s evolving strategy, one that envisions Israeli territorial consolidation and unchallenged regional dominance.Mr Khoury has noted the US’s immediate priority is the wholesale removal of Palestinians from Gaza, followed, if conditions permit, by a gradual takeover of the West Bank. That vision coincides with the Washington visit of Israel’s far-right finance minister,Bezalel Smotrich, a pro-annexationist who has warned Mr Netanyahu that he would collapse the government if Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza under a truce.AnArab-led planfor Gaza’s post-war reconstruction – allowing its 2 million residents to remain – was rebuffed by the US and Israel. Yet it marked an important show of force: a pan-Arab coalition pushing back against the visible Netanyahu-Trump effort to erase Palestinian self-determination. In contrast, reports suggest the Trump administration is indirect talkswith Hamas.If true, this would be a striking reversal of US policy. Engaging Hamas – once deemed untouchable – as a US negotiating partner might be pragmatic realism, an example of Trumpian transactional diplomacy or both. The UNestimatedin 2019 that oil and natural gas resources in the occupied Palestinian territories could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for development. But Palestinian national aspirations are impossible under occupation.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But such was the case when Jacqui Heinrich, a senior political correspondent at Fox, responded to the news that Trump’s White House would now handpick the reporters who get to cover the president in small settings, with the post: “This move does not give the power back to the people – it gives power to the White House.” Heinrich was specifically responding to press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s Orwellian claim that lettingDonald Trumpchoose who would cover him was designed to restore power “back to the American people”.The fruits of the new policy were richly on display during the sickening scene that unfolded in the Oval Office last week. If the president and JD Vance’s disgraceful treatment ofVolodymyr Zelenskyywasn’t bad enough, there was the unprecedented role that the “press” played in the unseemly drama.Here I’m not simply referring to Brian Glenn’s pugnacious demand that the leader of a war-torn nation justify his sartorial decisions – less a question than a provocation that served as a prelude to the pile-on that followed. Trump appeared to wink at Glenn, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, a far-right cable channel freshly included in the press pool, leading to speculation that Glenn’s question had been scripted in advance, a speculation that is both plausible – I mean, why not? – and irrelevant.These are the kinds of questions we should expect when serious journalists are replaced with puppets who perform the role of state propagandistsFor whether scripted or not, these are the kinds of questions we should expect when serious journalists are replaced with mouthpieces of the regime, puppets who perform the role of state propagandists in the guise of reportage. Glenn, who dates Majorie Taylor Greene and describes himself as “100% behind President Trump”, claims not to truck in far-right conspiracy theories – while insisting that January 6t was anantifa-instigated inside joband that a vast mechanism of fraud cost Trump the 2020 election.But before Glenn turned on the Ukrainian president, he had directed an earlier question to Trump: “Mr President, [do] you think ultimately your legacy will be the peacemaker and not the president that led this country into another war … ?” This puffball in the guise of a query gave Trump the opportunity to wax poetic: “I hope I’m going to be remembered as a peacemaker … I’m doing this to save lives more than anything else … Thank you, Brian, for that question. It was a nice question.”But we weren’t done with paeans to the great peacemaker. No sooner had Zelenskyy tersely assured Glenn that he would wear a suit once the war had ended, we were greeted with this question: “Keir Starmer … praised your courage and conviction to lead … What gave you the moral courage and conviction to step forward and lead?”Three billionaires: America’s oligarchy is now fully exposed | Robert ReichRead moreIn a properly functioning press corps, we might have expected that the question was directed to Zelenskyy, who, with exceptional fortitude and resolve, has led his countryin a war against a ruthless aggressor. But no. The question was directed to Trump, who responded: “Boy, I love this guy. Who are you with?” The answer was One America News, another network that operates to the far right of Fox, trafficking in conspiracy theories and committed to an unwavering support of Maga politics – and also a beneficiary of the White House’s commandeering of its own press pool.Once again, Trump grew almost wistful – “I like the question … it’s a very good question” – before blaming Russia’s invasion ofUkraineand Hamas’s attack on Israel on Joe Biden. From there, as we witnessed, things grew more acrimonious, but lost in the belligerent and belittling treatment of Zelenskyy, particularly at the hands of Vance (“Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting?”) was the Pyongyang-esque quality of Trump’s hand-picked pool reporters using their questions not to challenge or examine, but to burnish and bolster the Great Leader with ever fluffier valentines of adoration.Meanwhile, the Associated Press remained barred from the historic meeting, because it continues to call a body of water that lies almost entirely outside of US jurisdiction by the name it has carried since the 16th century.Lawrence Douglas is a professor of law at Amherst College in MassachusettsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingTrump administrationUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS politicsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

And Democrats are nowhere to be seenWed 5 Mar 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.03 ESTShareWhat was the point ofDonald Trump’saddress to Congresson Tuesday night? The annual speech – called the “State of the Union” address in every year except the one just after the president’s ascent to office – has long been a somewhat outdated bit of political theater, an event light on policy specifics and heavy on messaging in an era in which political messaging’s most effective venues have long since moved online.It’s perhaps even less clear what a speech toCongressis supposed to mean for this president, who has proven himself so indifferent to constitutional limits on his power – or for this Congress, which has shown itself so willing to abdicate its own constitutional responsibilities. It seems, like so many of the formalities of American politics do now, a bit like a phantom limb: something that Americans keep feeling for long after it has been excised. How long will it be, one wonders, until everyone stops bothering to go through the motions?As Republicans thunderously applauded and Democrats walked out in droves, Trump’s Congress speech showcased the US divide | Lloyd GreenRead moreBut Trump, for one, seems to delight in any opportunity to make a spectacle of himself. On Tuesday, with a captive audience of all of Congress, many military leaders, about half of the US supreme court, and large swaths of the American public, he set about indulging all of hisworst whims and lowest impulses. He repeatedly and extensively insulted his predecessor, the former president Joe Biden, by name and in strong terms. He relitigated old grievances, from his many prosecutions to his annoyance that not everyone likes him. He threatened the sovereignty of Panama and Greenland, went into extended discussions of the careers of various transgender athletes, boasted of ending “the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion” and removing “the poison of critical race theory”, and reminded his audience that he had renamed the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”. Occasionally, the gathered Republicans in the crowd would burst into grunting chants of “USA! USA!” It was worse than merely vulgar. It was stupid.Trump boasted of the rapid pursuit of his agenda in the weeks since he returned to power, declaring that the US was entering its “greatest, most successful era” and that “our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never seen, perhaps never will see”. In fact, the country is on the verge of an economic recession. Thousands of federal workers have been laid off, and Trump’s hefty tariffs on theUS’s largest trading partners– namely Canada, Mexico and China – sent the stock market into a freefall earlier that day. In the past, Trump has got cold feet, and backed off his tariff threats. On stage in the House chamber, he doubled down on them, declaring that he would pursue his trade wars, and acknowledging: “There will be a little disturbance.”Democrats, who have told their voters that Trump represents a threat to democracy, sat silently, holding up ping-pong paddles printed with the word ‘false’Trump spoke intensely and at length about his culture war grievances, touting his executive orders declaringEnglish to be the United States’ official languageand that the federal government would recognize “only two genders”. “Our country will be woke no longer,” he said.He also touted his record on immigration, boasting of his administration’s mass deportation plans and the decreased number of migrants and asylum seekers at the southern border. He dwelt at length on stories of violence by undocumented immigrants, pointing to the families of murdered Americans in the crowd and describing undocumented people as “savages”. Alluding to a fringe legal theory that could be deployed to support his unconstitutional effort to end birthright citizenship, he referred to the immigrant population as an “occupation”, and cast his own mass deportation effort as something like the expulsion of an invading army – which sounds a lot more noble than the chaoticand brutal humiliationsandhuman rights abusesthat have actually taken place as a part of Trump’s deportation effort.In a section on economic issues, he blamed Biden, specifically, for theprice of eggs, which have soared in some places to nearly $20 a dozen. (According to reporting from NPR, some of Trump’s advisers have asked him to talk more about egg prices, which were a repeated talking point during his campaign but which he has mentioned rarely since taking office, though prices continue to climb.) He also repeatedfalse claimsby Elon Musk’s extra-constitutional government-slashing group, the “department of government efficiency”, that Musk’s band of sycophantic teenagers who are leading the decimation of government services have found “hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud and waste” in Musk-targeted programs, such as social security.They have not.In fact, he talked about Biden a lot. At times, when he seemed to get distracted or lose his place in the speech, Trump appeared to insert insults towards Biden almost as filler. “And think of where we were withJoe Biden,” he said, in one such non-sequitur. “Biden took us very low, the lowest we have ever been.” Other digressions included complaints about his own various grievances and mistreatment. “Nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody,” he said once, after a brief discussion of a bill to combat revenge porn.Where were the Democrats during all this? Mostly, they were quiet. A few high-profile Democratic leaders, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the senator Patty Murray, skipped the speech. Others stayed and sat, sedate. Reportedly, word had gone outfrom Democratic leadershipthat party members should have a “dignified” presence at the speech, neither seizing the spotlight nor protesting against Trump out loud. The result was underwhelming.Democrats, who have told their voters that Trump represents a threat to democracy, sat silently, holding up ping-pong paddles printed with the word “false”. In an apparent nod to women’s eroded rights, some of them wore pink. Trump, for his part, used their silent presence to his advantage, turning them into props. Even if he cured a terrible disease, he jeered at the Democrats: “They will not stand, they will not jeer, they will not clap.” In fact, Trump has frozen virtually all federal funding of research into those terrible diseases, like cancer and Alzheimer’s, that American scientists were once working to cure. An opposition worth the name could have pointed that out; the one we have raised their ping-pong paddles a little higher.Trump is not the figure he used to be. He no longer seems to be quite in control of his own administration: he has delegated most spending policy to Musk, and has busied himself instead merely with turning the federal law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI and the broader justice department, into instruments of his petty revenge. He’s not funny any more. But he is also more comfortable in power: even less deferential to formality, even less reverent towards his office, even more inclined to turn the presidency into what was always his greatest passion, a TV show.In Trump’s hands, an old State of the Union convention – pointing out citizens who had been brought to Congress as special guests – was given a new twist: Trump set the people up for surprises. One child, a 13-year-old aspiring police officer with cancer, was gifted with an honorary membership in the Secret Service; the cameras on him, his sunken eyes widened with surprise. A teenager who aspired to go to West Point stood up to wave to the crowd, and was told by Trump himself that he’d gotten in; his jaw momentarily hung open. The genre was the gameshow, the carnivalesque kind where nobodies see if they can catch some luck amid the random dispensation of gifts by the glamorous and benevolent host. Think of Oprah, in her decadent generosity, yelling: “You get a car!” In these moments, Trump seemed to be having fun. At least somebody is.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsUS CongressTrump administrationDemocratsUS immigrationJoe BidencommentShareReuse this content"

Then help plan for a better world without himJohn McDonnellWe need a ‘coalition of the willing’ capable of bringing together those in Europe and the global south. Britain should facilitate thatWed 5 Mar 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.49 ESTShareThere are only so many times Donald Trumpcan be offered a state and royal visitto temper his political tantrums. With his latest attacks on Volodymyr Zelenskyy andthe halting of aid to Ukraine, it’s already clear that not even the offer of a bed for the night at Balmoral has worked.The silver lining of the Trump experience over the past fortnight is hopefully that it leads to a more realistic appraisal not just of the implications of the re-election of this narcissistic, bullying, corporate thug, but an understanding of the role the US has played over generations. Trump and his gang members JD Vance and Elon Musk are just the ugliest of faces of the US global policy pursued for a century at least.In 1992 Noam Chomsky published a bestselling booklet,What Uncle Sam Really Wants. A read of Chomsky may help Labour’s policymakers overcome their apparent naivety so worryingly displayed in the constant references to the special relationship between the UK and US.Trump’s “America First” policy is simply a more blatant articulation of the role the US has pursued globally since at least the second world war. The US has had no qualms in supporting, dealing with and sometimes installing authoritarian regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s across the globe for decades. Dividing up Ukraine and its natural resources with Putin is little different from what US administrations have done in Latin America and Africa by using their economic and military might.What has surprised European political leaders and commentators is that this is the first time a US president has done so on European soil since Franklin D Roosevelt carved up Europe with Stalinat Yaltain 1945 and that, unlike then, now there is no Churchill figure even to be invited to sit in the chair for the post-conference-deal photograph.Our political leaders can continue to try to exploit the fiction of the special relationship and seek to avoid direct diplomatic conflict with the US and to fawn over Trump to extract what concessions they can, but this is at best buying time. That time needs to be used wisely.In the short term, of course, there is a fundamental role to be played by European leaders to prevent a peace being imposed by Trump and Putin against the wishes of Ukraine. Standing up to the bullying behaviour of Trump and Vance to secure a place forEuropeand Zelenskyy at the negotiating table is essential if Ukraine is not to be betrayed and a stable peace is to be secured.During last Friday’spre-planned muggingin the Oval Office Trump told Zelenskyy that he had no cards to play in these negotiations. That might have played well with the Trump base for now, but Vance, in particular, knows that pictures of Russian tanks rolling into Kyiv as a result of a US withdrawal of support for Ukraine would more than match the opprobrium poured on Joe Biden (even though Trump signed the deal) as a result of thewithdrawal from Afghanistan. It would have the potential of dismembering the Trump cult Vance would rely upon four years from now in a post-Trump election.But in the longer term, it is clear that Trump’s behaviour since re-election – extolled in his nauseatingly arrogant, error-strewnspeech to Congresson Tuesday night – is forcing on to the political agenda across Europe and the global south a discussion of what alternatives there are to a politics and economics dominated by the whims of US presidents and the aggressive self-interest of China.There is an opening now for a much greater and more longer-sighted “coalition of the willing” capable of bringing together those in Europe and the global south to create the alliances and institutions needed to pursue the political and economic agenda that the US now resiles from.This includes an economic cooperation agenda not based upon tariffs and protectionism for the wealthy, but one that is mutually beneficial and tackles both the grotesque inequalities between north and south and the common threat of the climate emergency.The US, with its slashing of aid and punitive tariffs, is increasingly alienating countries and continents, and this presents an immense diplomatic opportunity for Keir Starmer’s government. Some say it’s the PM’s chance to make his mark on history.Unwise and immoral plans to cut British overseas aid, undermining soft power, are a legacy of a sort, but how much better it would be to see our prime minister using our influence and heft to bring together all those who want to discuss and construct a world reordered without the malign influences of Trump and China. That really would be a place in history worth having.John McDonnell is MP for Hayes and Harlington.

Vengeful nihilism is a big part of the Maga projectWed 5 Mar 2025 07.04 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 11.55 ESTShareIn thinking about the war being waged against life on Earth byDonald Trump, Elon Musk and their minions, I keep bumping into a horrible suspicion. Could it be that this is not just about delivering the world to oligarchs and corporations – not just about wringing as much profit from living systems as they can? Could it be that theywantto see the destruction of the habitable planet?We know that Trump’s overriding purpose is power. We have seen that no amount of power appears to satisfy his craving. So let’s consider power’s ultimate destination. It is to become not only an emperor, but the last of the emperors: to close the chapter on civilisation. It is to scratch your name indelibly upon a geological epoch. Look on my works, ye vermin, and despair.It’s true, of course, that many of his actions amount to standardcapitalist looting, released from the feeble regulatory restraints of previous administrations. This week Trump ordered themass destructionof national forests and other protected lands by the timber industry, to be overseen by the US Forest Service, whose new boss was previously vice-president of atimber company. The results will include heartbreaking losses of wildlife and rare ecosystems, and a heightenedrisk of wildfires. Trump justified his order with that classic dictator’s gambit: a purported “emergency”.He has used the same excuse to trigger a new wave of fossil-fuel projects, granting them “emergency” permits to override environmental protections. This is likely to cause the poisoning of wetlands and water supplies. Overseeing the assault is the new energy secretary, Chris Wright, previously CEO of afracking company.If the US were really suffering an “energy emergency”, you would expect the government also to accelerate the deployment of renewable power. Instead, Trump hasfrozen it. You might also expect it to insist that energy is used more sparingly; instead, his team is deletingfuel economy standards. This looks like payback to the fossil-fuel industry that helpedelect him.But other policies look more like gleeful vandalism. Thedevastating staffing cutsat national parks and forests won’t help any of his corporate backers. But they will degrade the experience of visitors, while jeopardising wildlife and habitats.The same goes for the mass destruction of jobs at theUS Fish and Wildlife Serviceandthe freezingof all the international conservation grants it offered, many of which are crucial to the protection of wildlife overseas. There’s not much to be gained here by any corporate lobby, and a great deal to be lost by the rest of us. Trump’s stated aim of “getting rid” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency would put corporate profits at severe risk, especially among insurers and investment funds, while intensifying the suffering of people hit by environmental crisis. He has alsoeliminated the helpoffered to communities suffering from heavy pollution. Again, there’s no obvious gain for capital, just plenty more human misery.Vengeful nihilism, the destruction of what they do not love, know or understand, is a major theme inMaga politics. It is applied as viciously to culture and science as it is to the natural world. It is hard to avoid the thought that environmental destruction is not just a means by which Trump serves his corporate backers, but an end in itself.At the same time, Trump enthusiastically (albeit vaguely) boosts Musk’s plans to send people to Mars, a planet incapable of supporting human life. These men, who claim without evidence that unless they cut $1tn from the federal budget, causing innumerable harms, “America will go bankrupt”, are pressing for a programme likely to cost hundreds of billions while delivering no benefit to humanity. For all its grandiosity, the plan amounts to nothing more than anelaborate meansof sending people to their deaths.One of the most persuasive explanations of our times I’ve read isan essayby the author Jay Griffiths, published in 2017. She connects today’s planetary vandals with the Italian futurists of the early 20th century. The futurists, who created much of the iconography and ideology of fascism, fetishised the machine, fantasising about “the technological triumph of humanity over nature”. They were obsessed by flight. “Hurrah! No more contact with the vile earth!”, the author of their manifesto, Filippo Marinetti, exulted. “Life on earth is a creeping, crawling business,” the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio claimed. “It is in the air that one feels the glory of being a man and of conquering the elements.”First Trump threatened to nuke hurricanes. Now he’s waging war on weather forecasters | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThrough flight, Griffiths notes, they believed they could achieve their ideal, purified state, characterised by the notion of Deus Invictus: the unbound, totalitarian god, no longer restrained by such earthy, humdrum matters as honesty, kindness, sympathy, respect or even gravity.I believe, like her, that the revival of this belief system might offer a key to understanding Elon Musk and his remarkable hold over theTrump administration. What Musk presents is the definitive fantasy of escape: from decency, care, love and the living planet itself. They can leave it all behind, leap off the vile Earth, and ascend into heaven.On Mars,Musk dreamsof building private cities under the exclusive control of his companySpaceX. Never mind thetechnical impossibilities; it’s the fantasy that counts: the definitive release from social and biological constraint. His subterranean prison cities, in which survival would depend on extreme technological intervention – the slightest interruption of which would mean instant death – would make the worst terrestrial dictatorship in history look like a yoga retreat. Deus Invictus would reign supreme.Where there is no love, there can be only destruction. Smash the planet then transcend it; leave your indelible mark on Earth while reigning triumphant in the heavens: this, I believe, is a deep, unspoken urge that helps explain Trump’s programmes. But even if, through some grim miracle, the planet wreckers succeeded, they would soon discover that no technological wonderland, no space station or Martian city, compares to what we have.This is the only planet in the universe to which we are adapted. Things we seldom think about – 1 bar of atmospheric pressure at the Earth’s surface; themagnetosphere, which, with the atmosphere, shields us from cosmic radiation and solar proton bombardment; ambient oxygen; 9.8 m/s2of gravity; an average surface temperature of 15C – create, alongside the living systems that feed, water and shelter us, a place that would sound like paradise to anyone removed from it. This is our heaven, and there can be no other.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionClimate crisisDonald TrumpFossil fuelsEnergyElon MuskMarscommentShareReuse this content"

Many media owners have political views; but the best keep those views to themselves, or at least allow their news organizations to exercise editorial freedom.But Soon-Shiong, who took over promising to steady the ship and return it to financial health, has turned out to be a deeply flawed leader. You might recall that many longtime subscribers canceled their subscriptions months ago when Soon-Shiong blocked his editorial board’s decision to endorse Kamala Harris for president.Then he reportedly told his editorial board to “take a break” from writing about Trump, and, according to a staff memo signed by members of the opinion section, instituted a policy in which articles critical of the newly elected president were to be published side-by-side with the opposing, pro-Trump, view. That’s straight-up meddling.But now, he’s taken a more public-facing step by inflicting what’s become known as a “bias meter” on some LA Times opinion pieces. Its findings are generated by artificial intelligence, without human intervention or review.This effort is less a rooting out of lefty bias than a way to give a platform to pro-Trump viewsIf there’s one firm rule about the use of AI in journalism, it’s this: there should always be a “human in the loop” before publication. Why? Because AI, at least at this point, is often wrong on the facts, and because many news consumers are suspicious of it.At the LA Times,the AI-powered “Insights” featureevaluates opinion articles and puts a label on them – for example, “center left”. Then it provides “different views”.Articles about Trump-related policies have gotten the bias meter treatment – for example, an opinion piece on Ukraine that stated that “Trump is surrendering a century’s worth of US global power in a matter of weeks.” According tothe Guardian’s Lois Beckett,that piece is followed by an AI-generated summary of “different views”, such as describing Trump’s policy as “a pragmatic reset of US foreign policy”.Soon-Shiong called the new feature a victory for viewpoint diversity. “No more echo chamber,” he crowed on social media.The LA Times published an op-ed warning of AI’s dangers. It also published its AI tool’s replyRead moreIt looks more like a way to avoid offending President Trump.Let’s get real. Many opinion pieces at legitimate publications these days are critical of Trump – for good reason, given the chaotic damage he and his helpers have unleashed.So this effort is less a rooting out of lefty bias than a way to give a platform to pro-Trump views.At well-run news companies, it is journalists themselves – editors, in particular – who can point out unfairness, inaccuracy or bias. And they deal with that, editor to writer, before pieces are published.“Our members – and all Times staffers – abide by a strict sense of ethics guidelines, which call for fairness, precision, transparency, vigilance against bias, and an earnest search to understand all sides of an issue,” the LA Guild, the union representing the paper’s journalists, said in a statement objecting to Soon-Shiong’s idea.These days, many of the opinion-side journalists at the LA Times have fled. This is apparently no longer a place where they feel they can do their jobs.Soon-Shiong’s gambit is happening in a broader context of media companies yielding to Trump’s will, as Axios’sSara Fischer aptly noted.Journalists are doing their jobs, but owners are “compromised”, she wrote, listing some of the most prominent examples: ABC News settled a defamation suit by Trump it could have won; CBS seems poised to settle Trump’s absurd claim against its flagship 60 Minutes show; Disney and Paramount have rolled back some DEI policies; the Washington Post’s opinion section will reflect owner Jeff Bezos’s beliefs about “personal liberties and free markets”.Some of the bias-meter results so far are simply weird, as in an AI response toan article critical of AI itself.The original piece, by two experts in film production, explored the dangers of AI-generated footage within documentary films and how it could shatter audience trust in the visuals they see.The AI-generated bias meter labeled this piece “center-left” and provided “different views”.Another piece, reflecting on thehistory of the KKKin Anaheim, California, included an AI-generated defense of the Klan at the bottom, as the tech journalistRyan Mac pointed out. It’s since been removed.I can’t imagine what reader would want to trot around in this silly circle like a horse on a lead line. Most of us can read a viewpoint article and decide, all by ourselves, without a helpful robot, whether we agree.In the name of viewpoint diversity – but really to push his paper Trump-ward – Soon-Shiong has done far more harm than good. His bias meter should – quickly – go the way of hot type, the manual typewriter and the dodo.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles TimesOpinionDonald TrumpUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesJeff BezoscommentShareReuse this content"

They’re investing billions in defense, border control and prisonsWed 5 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 13.54 ESTShareLast week, the federal human resources departmentsent out a seven-page memoordering agencies to submit detailed plans on how they will work with the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to slash their payrolls. To do this, they were to eliminate whole job categories – except one. Untouchable were positions “necessary to meet law enforcement, border security, national security, immigration enforcement, or public safety responsibilities”.While we’ve had our eyes on the wrecking ball–Doge pulverizing social services, environmental protection and scientific research, we’ve hardly taken notice of what is being constructed. In the footprint of the already shabby, now half-demolished US welfare state, theTrump administrationis building a police state.In spite of Doge’s cuts to the FBI, the agency’s director,Kash Patel, is gearing up to turn the agency – whose job has always been to spy on US citizens, including enemies of the state as identified by the government in power – into Donald Trump’s personal secret police. At the state level, lawmakers are compiling their own enemies lists and filing bills to reward those who snitch on abortion seekers, transgender people, undocumented immigrants and school librarians suspected of harboring the wrong books.The Republican House budget includes$300bn in new fundingfor defense and border control. Among the Senate budget committee’sannouncedpriorities are finishing the border wall, increasing the number of immigrant detention “beds”, hiring more border patrol agents, and investing in state and local law enforcement to assist in “immigration enforcement and removal efforts”. While no figures are provided in theattached budget, the Senate budget committee assures Americans that any new spending will be offset by reductions.While we’ve had our eyes on the wrecking ball, we’ve hardly taken notice of what is being constructedSome of those reductions involvefiring immigration judgesandcutting federal supportsto local police. Clearly, the right hand doesn’t know what the other right hand is doing. Still, cuts are not always cuts. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth has instructed senior staff to shave 8% off the department’s $850bn annual expenditures. Programs addressing theclimate crisisand “excessive bureaucracy” are high on the list, of course. But, as the Interceptpoints out, savings will be repurposed for the president’s pet projects. For instance: theIron Dome, an enormously complex, costly – and, critics say, unfeasible,unnecessary and even futile– space-based missile-defense and “warfighting” system that has been a fantasy of tech-drunk Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan. In keeping with Trumpian décor and his “golden age of America”, the Iron Dome has recently beenrechristenedthe Golden Dome.The Golden Dome might also be a symbol of what a state devoted to protecting itself from enemies real and imagined offers corporate America. Because as the civil service shrinks, private industry – particularly the overlapping defense and tech sectors – willfill in the blanks. Project 2025, which is essentially being cut and pasted into Trump’s executive orders,calls on the administrationto “strengthen the defense industrial base”, stockpile ammunition and “modernize” the nukes, while streamlining procurement from private contractors and involving them in decisions about what to produce. With Tesla and SpaceX contracts worth$38bnand of course, control of Doge, Elon Musk is already at the table. SpaceX practicallyownsNasa’s rocket launch and space travel programs, freaking out engineers familiar with its bargain-basement manufacturing practices – and failures. Next up: artificial intelligence to replace human expertise.Trump is unleashing sadism upon the world. But we cannot get overwhelmed | Judith ButlerRead moreTrump’s war on immigrants also promises a windfall. During his first term, and Joe Biden’s as well, the creation and operation of a “smart” border wall – comprising mobile towers, autonomous drones, thermal imaging, biometric data collection and artificial intelligence – funneled billions of taxpayer dollars toSilicon ValleyandWall Street. A 2022reportby the National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights on border militarization and corporate outsourcing called border security a “for-profit industry”, which perpetuates itself by lobbying for ever more draconian crackdowns on migrants.Those profits are about to explode. “The border security market is projected to reach $34.4 billion by 2029, from $26.8 billion in 2024,” with Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics the biggest beneficiaries, according to the market research firmMarketsandMarkets.Private prison companies– the two largest contractors are GEO Group and CoreCivic – anticipate unprecedented revenues too. Implementation of theLaken Riley Act, which mandates locking up undocumented people charged not just with violent crimes but with offenses as trivial as shoplifting, will require a huge buildout of detention facilities; Project 2025recommends100,000 available beds daily. Flying deportees to their home countries could generate $40m to $50m of business, according to GEO’s executive chairperson. “We believe the scale of the opportunity before our company is unlike any we’ve previously experienced,”crowedthe chief executive officer, J David Donahue, on the company’s quarterly earnings call.The removal of millions of migrants will necessitate more than software, planes and prisons. It will need personnel. And wouldn’t you know it, an enterprising group of military contractors including the CEO of Blackwater hassubmitted a proposalto the Trump administration to deputize a mercenary border patrol of 10,000 private citizens. The plan also recommends payments to bounty hunters. Estimated cost: $25bn.These surveillance technologies and tactics are not targeted solely at foreign and extraterrestrial invaders, however. Government droneskept watch overthe Black Lives Matter protests of 2017; at a protest against Israel’s war on Gaza at New York University, a student called my attention to a police drone circling above. In 2021 SpaceX signed a $1.8bn contract with the Pentagon’s National Reconnaissance Office for a network of low-orbiting spy satellites called Starshield. “A US government database of objects in orbit shows several SpaceX missions having deployed satellites that neither the company nor the government have ever acknowledged” but were identified by experts as Starshield prototypes,Reutersreported. It is unclear whether the network will be used for military or domestic spying, but its reach is vast. Said one Reuters source: “No one can hide.”Trump pits immigrants against other working people. But we have a common enemy |  Alejandra Gomez and Greisa Martínez RosasRead moreThe transformation of the US government is not just a matter of replacing an accountable civil service with self-interested private contractors. “It seems like they are using [Doge] to reshape the purpose of the government rather than execute it more efficiently,” Max Stier, president of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, told theWashington Post.That purpose, Trump tells us, is public safety from threats without and within. But a capitalist police state redefines public safety. Safety does not include housing or food security, disease prevention or disaster relief. The state protects companies, not workers, consumers or the environment. The “public” in “public safety” also attains new meaning: it embraces only native-born practitioners of the state religion, political loyalists and favored profiteers.As this inner circle shrinks, the outside expands. There are citizens and what the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben calls “margizens”, those who live in a country but do not benefit from its rights or protections. Not only are the margizens denied safety; they are deemed dangerous. To keep the nation “proud and prosperous and free”, as Trump described his America, the state will need to humiliate, impoverish, pursue, imprison and punish almost everyone.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist and the author of five books.

We are, said the US president, in a move straight from the populist playbookWed 5 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 11.46 ESTShareDuring adramatic Oval Office meetinglast Friday, US president Donald Trump confronted Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a move that upended the long-established narrative of Russia as the aggressor and Ukraine as the victim.In the conversation, which quickly escalated into a tense exchange, Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war with Russia by refusing to engage in peace negotiations with Vladimir Putin. His rhetoric suggested thatUkraine, not Russia, was responsible for escalating the conflict and that the US had unfairly borne the burden of Ukraine’s resistance. Trump constructed a new hierarchy of suffering, one in which the US emerged as the primary victim, Ukraine as the source of its burdens and Russia as innocent of blame.This reversal of victimhood was not just a matter of rhetoric – it was a calculated political manoeuvre. Until that moment, the war in Ukraine had been widely seen as a struggle between an imperialist aggressor and a smaller nation fighting for its sovereignty. Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 – preceded by its illegalannexation of Crimea in 2014– was broadly recognised by the international community as a violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and an act of aggression. The country was viewed as the defiant victim resisting a formidable adversary. Western nations, including the US, provided billions in military and economic aid to bolster Kyiv’s defence.Trump’s reproach upended this narrative. He accused Ukraine of being the true obstacle to peace, dismissing its refusal to negotiate with Putin as reckless and unnecessary. Rather than recognising Russia as the aggressor, he blamed Ukraine for prolonging the war and accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war three”.His reframing not only weakened the western stance to support Ukraine and provided political cover for thesuspension of military aid, but also emboldens Russia. In effect, it shifts the moral calculus of the war, providing certain political actors with a stronger case for peace on Russia’s terms over continued support for Ukraine.If Ukraine is no longer seen as the victim – an invaded and violated nation – then the urgency to defend it dissipates. IfRussiais no longer viewed as the aggressor, the rationale for sanctions and diplomatic pressure weakens. And if the US is instead cast as the unwilling victim of this war, Trump’s isolationist policies gain newfound legitimacy.On the domestic front, Trump’s casting of the US as the victim helped him amplify American grievances – a potent political tactic in a country where economic concerns dominate voter priorities. He, at the same time, emerges as a real leader who speaks “the truth”: his nation is exploited by costly foreign entanglements while its own citizens’ struggles go ignored.Far-right leaders have long understood the power of victimhood narratives, and Trump has weaponised those throughout his political career. His claims of a “rigged” 2020 election painted both himself and his supporters as casualties of a conspiracy, fuelling a grievance-driven movement that ultimately culminated in the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021. His impeachment proceedings were framed as “witch-hunts” planned by corrupt elites, an attempt to silence a president who dared to challenge the establishment. Even his legal troubles – from criminal indictments to social media bans – have been cast as tales of persecution, positioning Trump as the ultimate martyr of a broken system. Each of these instances reinforces the core message that his movement, and by extension the American people themselves, are under siege.Tories compare Nigel Farage to Jeremy Corbyn over Ukraine warRead moreTrump’s rhetoric is part of a broader pattern among far-right populists worldwide.Viktor Orbán in Hungarycasts his nation as a besieged fortress under assault by Brussels bureaucrats and liberal elites. Marine Le Pen in France frames the country’s economic struggles as the result of globalist elites. And here in the UK, Nigel Farageused a similar strategy, portraying Brexit as a battle between an oppressed British public and an out-of-touch European elite determined to undermine national sovereignty. The playbook is simple but effective: paint the people as victims, externalise blame and consolidate power by positioning oneself as the people’s sole guardian.Victimhood is never just about suffering; it is about power. The question now is whether the world will accept such an unabashed rewriting of history or resist this cynical recasting of suffering. Last weekend’sEuropean summit on Ukrainein London may mark the beginning of a response by reaffirming that defending Ukraine is not an act of charity but a political stance against the weaponisation of victimhood by the far right. What is needed is not just rhetoric but a coherent, strategic and actionable plan – one that reclaims the political initiative rather than ceding ground to reactionary opportunism.The stakes couldn’t be higher. For every shift in who we recognise as the victim is simultaneously a shift in who we believe deserves justice.Lilie Chouliaraki is professor of media and communications at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the author of Wronged: The Weaponization of VictimhoodExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyThe far rightcommentShareReuse this content"

Six weeks into his second term, he has reversed the course of US policy towards Ukraine, imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and delegated the task of slashing government to Elon Musk. The stock market plummets.Recession and stagflation are no longer hypotheticals. The term “trade war” fills the headlines. The Dow sits hundreds of points below where it stood on Inauguration Day. Trump’s second term is already consequential and controversial.In the opening words ofhis speech to a joint session of Congress, he proclaimed that America was back, that the country’s golden age lay ahead, and that “momentum” had returned. He spoke for nearly two hours, the longest speech to Congress ever. Trump was nakedly partisan, the reception in the House chamber was raucous.Trump turns Congress speech into a sordid campaign rally, igniting a Democrat fightbackRead moreRepublicans thunderously applauded while Democrats delivered a chorus of catcalls. Early on, Speaker Mike Johnson demanded order, andcalled the sergeant-at-arms to remove Al Green, a Texas Democrat, from the hall. Democrats walked out in droves. The speech showcased the American divide.1:22US House speaker ejects Texas congressman Al Green during Trump speech  – videoThroughout the night, Trump made Joe Biden his foil and punching bag. He labeled his predecessor the worst president in American history, lambasting his policies a disaster. Trump also took congressionalDemocratsto task for their refusal to stand or applaud during his speech. He continues to yearn for adulation.On that note, he described himself as more successful even than George Washington, the first president. As ever, self-deprecation and modesty were nowhere to be found.Immigration and social issues policy took pride of place. Here, the speech sounded like a continuation of the fall campaign. Trump pointed to quiet at the southern border and read a laundry list of changes implemented by his administration.He bragged of making English the official language of the US, abolishing DEI in and out of government, and barring transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. Said differently, his campaign slogan, “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you”, continues to retain its salience.Trump remains a culture warrior, a tack that twice led him to the White House. Throughout the evening, he returned to immigration as a rhetorical touchstone. He also attacked street gangs, urban crime and street violence. For the Democrats to regain competitive political footing, they will need to reconcile themselves to the reality that mass immigration is unpopular, that being tough on crime is a winner, and that the language of “wokeness” goes no further than the faculty lounge.Past demands to defund the police will likely haunt the party for the foreseeable future. The fact that Trump repeated his call for an immigration gold card, with citizenship sold to Russian oligarchs at $5m a pop, does not detract from the potency of immigration as an issue.By the numbers, nearly half the US supports building a wall along the entire US-Mexico border. At the same time, support for conferring legal status to undocumented or illegal immigrants brought to the US as children declines.As to be expected, Trump ignored the stock market drop and instead pointed to a decline of interest rates. Whether the latter is a harbinger of a decline in inflation, a slowing economy, or both, remains to be seen. He repeated his call to “drill, baby, drill”. He also gave Elon Musk, his largest campaign donor and the head of Doge, star treatment and a shout-out.‘Resist’ shirts and ‘a little disturbance’: key takeaways from Trump’s Congress speechRead moreForeign policy occupied little space. Trump repeated his threat toward Denmark over Greenland. “I think we’re going to get it – one way or the other, we’re going to get it.” He again staked a US claim to Panama. Ukraine came late, almost as an afterthought.0:58Donald Trump on Greenland: 'I think we're going to get it one way or another' - videoDespite market turmoil, “tariffs” remained a beautiful word in the Trumpian lexicon. On Tuesday night, he announced that US-imposed reciprocal tariffs will kick in on 2 April, less than a month away. Much can go wrong between now and then.The possibility of averting a trade war does not appear to have lessened during the course of the speech. He said tariffs are about the “soul” of the country while acknowledging that they may bring temporary dislocation. Still, he didn’t seem all that bothered.The speech won’t unite a nation, but it will rally the Republican base.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpUS CongressDemocratsRepublicansMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

No longer is population the only thing keeping the economy growing. But the still-weak GDP figures of the last three months of 2024 highlight that the Reserve Bank took too long to cut rates and more cuts are needed.First things first: let’s bid adieu to the crappiness that was 2024. It was not a year that will bring many fond memories, especially on the economic front here in Australia.RBA minutes suggest another interest rate cut isn’t imminent with board expressing ‘caution’Read moreWe normally talk about annual GDP growth in terms of the growth in a quarter compared with the same quarter a year earlier. So when you see reports that in the past year Australia’s GDP grew 1.3%, that means the economy in the December quarter of 2024 was 1.3% bigger than it was in the December quarter of 2023.But to get a true picture of 2024, we need to compare the total amount of production in all of 2024 with that in all of 2023. This reveals that Australia’s economy grew just 1.1% in 2024 – the sixth-worst year on record and, excluding the pandemic year of 2020, the worst since 1990:If the graph does not display click hereBut at least in the more traditional way of looking at growth, things are improving.Finally, we are no longer in a “per capita” recession as, for the first time since December 2022, GDP per capita grew. Sure it was only 0.1% but we’ll take what we can get.And it wasn’t due to a slowing of population growth in the last three months of 2024 – rather the strength of the economy was finally enough that population wasn’t the only thing keeping the economy growing:If the graph does not display click hereNot that anyone should get too carried away with this growth.The talk of course immediately turned to interest rates and the belief that the 0.6% growth in the December quarter, which was the fastest for three years, will mean the RBA won’t cut rates again in April.It really is quite dispiriting how easily some of the commentaries and economists are now satisfied.The economic growth in the December quarter might have been the fastest for three years but that’s a bit like saying Donald Trump’saddress to Congress on Tuesdaywas his least unhinged speech for three years – the bar is very low and it does not deserve praise.Neoliberalism is dead. So why haven’t Australia’s leaders got the message? | John QuigginRead moreIn the 25 years before the pandemic, average quarterly growth was 0.8% and average annual growth was 3.1%. When you have the economy only growing 1.3% that is hardly cause to suggest an economy in danger of overheating lest the RBA cut rates again.Instead it should have everyone wondering why the RBA thought they didn’t need to cut rates in November or December last year. Nothing in these figures suggest the best course of action was to wait until February.The reasons for the growth also demonstrate that while the economy is not as weak as it was, it’s still weak:If the graph does not display click hereGovernment spending and investment over the past year was overwhelmingly the main cause of the economy growing. Even in the December quarter the public sector remained a major cause of growth. Net exports – led by agriculture (chickpeas going to India being a main driver) – and tourists taking advantage of our low dollar helped out.This is all well and good but if you take out trade and government spending the economy grew only 0.7% in the past year – well below the 2.6% long-term average:If the graph does not display click hereAnd while households began to spend more, again, we are talking off a very low base:If the graph does not display click hereFortunately the last quarter of December saw some small improvements but this was not due to the RBA doing anything other than perhaps stopping hitting us all in the solar plexus.The level of household income being spent on mortgage repayments has peaked at lower than occurred in 2008 – although given the cash rate is nearly three percentage point lower than then, it shows just how much bigger mortgages are not than in 2008:If the graph does not display click hereBut mortgage repayments continue to be the major reason why households are struggling. On a per capita basis, increased mortgage repayments caused nearly half of the drop in living standards:If the graph does not display click hereThere was a slight increase in living standards in the December quarter but things remain pretty bleak – especially for the Albanese government given this is the line the opposition will trumpet from now until the federal election:If the graph does not display click hereCertainly things are gloomy on this score, however I think we should consider the analysis ofeconomist Zac Grosswho notes that, unlike other countries such as the US, Australia over the past few years has had a large spike in migration. This makes the per capita picture looks worse, without truly reflecting the reality.“Per capita” is just an average. If 10 people in a room each have an annual income of $100,000 and then three foreign students with an annual income each of $40,000 enter, then the average income of the room falls but no one is actually worse off – but that is essentially what has happened. Australia has had a big spike in migrants – many of whom are students. That doesn’t make us worse off but it makes the average lower.Total household disposable income has actually risen since the pandemic but migration which has seen population grow faster than usual makes things look perhaps worse than they are:If the graph does not display click hereThat is not to say the situation is fine and dandy. That growth in total disposable income is rather weak and real wages remain well below pandemic levels, and households clearly have seen a fall in living standards.These national accounts provide little sense of an economy powering ahead at full steam.Yes, the corner has been turned, but the Reserve Bank should be looking at these numbers and wondering why it waited until February to act, and it should also realise it needs to cut the rate again in April to keep the recovery going at a solid speed.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsBusinessInterest ratesReserve Bank of AustraliaCost of living crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

It was one of the best conversations of my lifeWing KuangSex is still a taboo topic for my Chinese immigrant baby boomer parents, but i’ve discovered it’s never too late to have ‘the talk’Wed 5 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 20.24 ESTShareSitting in a cafe in Sydney recently, I heard a line that I would never have expected to hear from Dad, a dull, quiet, introverted Chinese man in his late 60s who can be quite conservative and stubborn, especially when it comes to dating.“When you hang out with boys and go on dates, don’t forget to use condoms to protect yourself.”Looking serious, he went on to tell me that using protection can not only prevent pregnancy, but also sexually transmitted infections. “When I was in my 20s, a colleague of mine in the factory met a woman …”I didn’t follow the love life of Dad’s ex-colleague as I was still in shock that Dad, who turned 68 last year, had just given me a sex education talk. I was 27 years old, and I had been on and off in the dating world for years. Wasn’t it a bit too late to teach me the importance of condoms?How to prepare for Cyclone Alfred and what to do if it’s too late to leaveRead moreI know how challenging it is for Dad to even mention the word “condom” in front of me. Despite the rapidly developing internet culture and social progression in China, sex is still a taboo for my parents’ generation. Nor was there adequate sex education in China when I was growing up. The only time we would touch on the topic of sex was year 8 biology class, when we were taught about reproduction and pregnancy from a medical perspective. Dating was seen as a disturbance to academic progress in many Chinese schools, and harsh punishments – including suspension – could be imposed if a student got caught.But just like other teenagers curious about their bodies and the world, I was good at finding what I wanted to learn on the internet. My elder brother, who once saw my search history, complained about this to my parents. But since they still had to turn to me for technological support, there was little way my baby boomer parents could stop my secret navigation into the world of love and intimacy.As I got older, the consequences of lacking a comprehensive education about sex and relationships gradually emerged as I began navigating romance. I did later learn about safe sex and sexual consent, as well as big topics such as domestic violence and sexual abuse.But I didn’t have enough resources to master the skill set embedded in the principles of Respectful Relationships Education programs that are now rolled out across Australia: to develop and maintain positive and healthy relationships with those around them.In the past four years, I have failed to pick up red flags of toxic relationships while, in the eyes of some ex-dates, I was the problem.I assume my parents, who have heard so much about my heartbreaks over the phone in China, had been planning to have some conversations with me. For instance, Mum once told me that before marrying Dad, she went on dates with him for three years yet didn’t find out Dad was a heavy smoker until they got married. Shocked at first, she decided to accept Dad fully, including the hobby she disliked. Mum said she didn’t know the “fashionable” way or “the right word” to summarise what she meant but I knew her message.The dangerous folly of Australia’s come-what-may sycophancy towards Trump is on full display | Paul DaleyRead moreIn fact, since I began reporting on sex education in 2021, I have encountered many parents from culturally and linguistically diverse communities who told me they wanted to talk about sex and dating with their children after the national sexual consent campaign led by Chanel Contos. However, many struggled to find resources for themselves to prepare for the talk.And, on many occasions, CALD parents and sex educators found they have to challenge the conservative stereotype of CALD communities, so that they can secure funding and resources from governments and schools. It was assumed that CALD parents would feel offended if it was found their children learn about sex and dating at school. However, what I had been told by sex educators and parents of various cultural communities is that sometimes they wanted the school to also give them a workshop, so that they could continue the sex education talks at home.Looking back, I wish I’d had more conversations about love and intimacy with my parents. But it’s not too late. I am still exploring the dating scene and I would love to learn more about and from my parents. I’m not sure if we would bring up the topics of condoms again at our next dinner but I know many years later, when talking about my parents, I will recall that on a sunny afternoon in a Sydney cafe my parents and I had one of the best conversations in life.Wing Kuang is a freelance journalist in Sydney, focusing on CALD community affairsExplore more on these topicsAustralia newsOpinionSexual consentHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Her plea for justice five years on drew an astonishing reaction from the stateWed 5 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 05.53 ESTShareThe first time I went toHanau, I was creeped out by how ordinary it was. This mid-sized city of 100,000 people right in the geographical centre of Germany, looked and felt like many other places in western Germany I had been to: built around a bombed and reconstructed old town, expanded by a soulless mall with a multiplex cinema, surrounded by a vast industrial area and neighbourhoods separated along class lines. What the city prides itself on is that the Brothers Grimm grew up here in the late 18th century before they started publishing folk tales such as Cinderella and The Frog Prince. Since 2020, however, Hanau stands for something else: it’s the place where a far-right gunmankilled nine peoplehe assumed to be immigrants, and afterwards killed his mother and himself.The attack on 19 February of that year not only left a deep wound within immigrant communities throughout the country, it again raised questions about how seriously the German state takes rightwing extremist terrorism, even after theinfamous murdersby neo-Nazi terrorist cell the National Socialist Underground (NSU), which spanned most of the decade from 2000.Emiş Gürbüz, mother of one of the Hanau victims, spoke at this year’sofficial commemoration, attended by the city’s highest-ranking politicians as well as Germany’s federal president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. “This event is a stain on the history of Hanau and of Germany,” Gürbüz said, close to tears. “If everyone had carried out their duties, these nine people would still be alive.” Gürbüz’s son, Sedat, was killed during the attack at the shisha bar he had previously owned. He was 29 years old.Hanau has dealt with this attack with some ambivalence. There were endless arguments, for instance, about whether the city centre was anappropriate place for a memorialto the victims, since the market place is reserved for a statue of the Brothers Grimm. Had it not been for the persistence of the victims’ families inpursuing justice, it has often felt like Hanau would have preferred to get back to normal within weeks of the massacre.But what followed this year’s commemoration – which, unfortunately, coincided with the anti-immigrant and racist discourse of the final week of the federal election campaign – was frankly shocking.In these dark times of racially charged election campaigns, the German left offers a flicker of hope | Fatma AydemirRead moreThe coalition of mainstream parties that runs Hanau’s city governmentissued an extraordinary statementlaying into Gürbüz, accusing her of political agitation, disrespect and of “exploiting” the atrocity. It said that no such future commemorations would be held in Hanau to mark the victims. Citing another speech that Gürbüz made at the Berlin film festival, the statement further alleged that she had publicly expressed hatred for Germany and Hanau. “Why she applied for German citizenship in such a state of mind will probably remain her secret,” the statement added.The alleged “hate” quotes from Gürbüz’s Berlin speechcould not be verifiedby any of the guests who attended the event. But why would it be inappropriate for a grieving mother whose son was murdered by a racist and who now has to witness almost every political party campaigning on anti-immigrant manifestos, to express hatred for what Germany has become?And, speaking of political agitation, why would Gürbüz’s personal naturalisation process be mentioned in an official statement? At a time when theexpatriation of people with dual citizenshipwho commit a crime is being discussed in parliament, this remark seems more than insidious.Gürbüz’s demand that the city council take responsibility for its structural role in the terrorist attack was not exactly unfounded. The perpetrator had beenwriting paranoid and racist lettersto authorities for years, yet was allowed to obtain and keep his gun licence. At one of the crime scenes, a shisha bar frequently raided by the police for drugs and controlled by the regulatory office, theemergency exitwasallegedy lockedon the night of the attack. A campaign led by some of the victims’ families alleged that police had ordered theexit to be kept lockedduring raids. If the door had been open, they alleged, some victims could have been saved. In 2021 the public prosecutor’s officedropped its investigationinto the locked door allegation in the absence of conclusive evidence.On the night of the crime, the local emergencypolice telephone linecouldn’t be reached by witnesses. Vili Viorel Păun, 22, followed the gunman in his car from the first to the second shooting attacks while trying to call the police several times. Eventually, Păun was fatally shot himself, before the gunman entered a kiosk and a bar and killed more people. It took the police another hour to finally reach the perpetrator’s home.Days after the coalition’s public accusations against Gürbüz, the mayor of Hanau, Claus Kaminsky,downplayed the statementby claiming that the commemorative events would be smaller from now on and that this decision had nothing to do with Gürbüz’s speech. But the mayor highlighted for criticism a different part of the speech, in which Gürbüz claimed the city had received public funding in the aftermath of the attack and had used the money to “balance their own deficits”. True, Gürbüz provided no evidence for this claim. But a one-sentence rejection by the city council would have been more than enough of a response to a grieving mother. Instead, the city publicly defamed the victims of a devastating terrorist attack as “disrespectful”.At a time whenfar-right supporthas reached historic levels, it’s a peculiar take on the term “respect” to treat survivors of aracially motivated right wing terrorist attackin this way.Is this to be the fate now of anyone of migrant heritage who criticises public failings? How believable is the state’s investigation of the continuum of racist and right wing extremist violence, if it’s more concerned with exposing the victims than with protecting them from more violence?Maybe this is why the mediocrity of Hanau is creeping me out – what has happened here, it seems, could have happened anywhere else in the country. The behaviour of office holders in Hanau seems to mirror the general messageGermanyis sending to its immigrants right now: just be grateful you are still alive – and still here.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But for some, we can beofEngland, we just cannot beEnglish. Capisce? Because, as they see it and say it, the main ingredient of Englishness is whiteness.For wisdom on this, as in all things, we turn to the former home secretary, would-be once-upon-a-time Conservative party leaderSuella Braverman. Referring to non-white, largely non-Christian communities in England, of which she appears to disapprove, Braverman said: “Some in these communities may hold British passports and be born here. But does that make them English?”According to most people, it does. WhenYouGov asked English adultsa few years back, 81% of those canvassed said being born in England pretty much does it. Fifty-seven per cent said growing up in England was enough, 29% thought just “considering themselves English” was enough. Which rules out Braverman. All good.“Remember that you are an Englishman and have consequently won first prize in the lottery of life,”quippedthe genocidal coloniserCecil Rhodes. You doubt he had Maro Itoje, captain of the England rugby team or young Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, mixed-heritage son of an English prince, or any of their ilk in mind when he proclaimed this.The belonging-driven desire to prove yourself “worthy” of Englishness is part of why we’re having this debate today. It is probably why the likes of Braverman contort themselves to project a questionable image of who they are and who and what they think other minorities are – or should be.Poor Rishi Sunak, his English “lottery winnings” were questioned on the rightwing Triggernometry podcast by the host, who cited the disqualifying fact that the former PM, former champion of the English Tory right, is a “Brown Hindu”. Of course, Sunak won the lottery beforeby marrying an heiress, but money isn’t everything. In this regard, it isn’t anything. Poor Sunak. So, quick pop quiz: what does a Black boy born in London to Nigerian parents and raised in an English village by a (white-appearing) German mother and a (white) Scottish father consider his nationality? The correct answer is, of course, English, though Braverman might wag that finger.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Maro Itoje with the Calcutta Cup, 22 February 2025.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/Rex/ShutterstockI am that boy. I was born in London, in the same hospital as Prince William (guess he’s English), and spent much of the first decade of my life raised in England, in a small Oxfordshire village called Benson. A place that I often joke is “so white (and cold) that white people don’t know it exists” (most don’t). Even though my father was Scottish, and my mother was German, I was raised an English boy by my foster parents (which passes the YouGov test). Understandably, by the time I came into consciousness of nationality there was no question about it: I was English. Beyond that, I was English to the point that I harboured what would today be considered nationalist tendencies (the Conservative party or Reform would have loved me).I didn’t become at all “British”, let alone British Nigerian, until I was much older and had been subject to a series of “stay-in-your-place-ism” moments, as well as travelling the world a bit. What happens abroad is interesting. When I open my mouth, I’m considered either English or British (or “oyinbo” in Nigeria).Yet despite pollssaying that skin colour and Englishness aren’t inextricably linked, I find I am considered English practically everywhere but in Braverman’s corner of England. Poor little me.Perhaps there are valid debates to be had about who is English and who is not. What makes an Englishman and what makes a bloody foreigner. What defines Englishness: blood and soil, birth and culture, heritage and ethnicity, who you support during a cricket match or the ability to score a World Cup-winning penalty? Is Englishness a fluid or a stationary concept? Who gets to decide: those who have been English for centuries, those who had Englishness imposed upon them and/or those who chose to embrace the concept?Can a brown Hindu be English? English people say yes. Why do so many on the right say no? | Kenan MalikRead moreBut be under no illusion why we are discussing this now. It’s not about who to embrace, it’s about who to exclude. It’s part of the erosion of the firewall between mainstream conservativism and ethno-supremacism. There is a disturbing racist effort to delegitimise the place and position of non-white people in Europe, with the hard-right dream of “remigration” as the ultimate end result.If you can delegitimise Rishi Sunak and mark his card for “remigration”, then everyone else is fair game. Some don’t even need delegitimising: they’re ready to do it to themselves. Imagine Braverman, from her first-class seat on the one-way Remigration Airways flight: “I see nothing wrong with this: I’m not even English. Anyway, the Islamists run Britain now, so what’s to stay for? Steward, when’s dinner? I’ll have anything but tofu.”The news is bad for blowhard podcasters, desperate politicians and assorted racists, for Englishness is becoming more brown and more beautiful. Englishness is today as much Bukayo Saka, just as Japaneseness is Naomi Osaka, as Yorubaness isAshleigh Plumptreand South Africaness is Charlize Theron. The world is evolving, and the labels? They’re falling off.Nels Abbey is an author, broadcaster and the founder ofUppity: the Intellectual PlaygroundDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

All those imperial conflicts Australia trailed Washington into (Korea, Vietnam,Iraq,Afghanistan) for “alliance maintenance’’ mean nothing to an expansionist Trump who treats far more geo-politically important supposed friends, likeCanada, with blatant contempt.And yet a cloak of major party bipartisanship ensures no mainstream political challenge to the sanctified US-Australia relationship, as embodied in the 1951Anzus treatyand, more recently, the reckless $368bnAukus submarine plan.Asked onRadio Nationalthis week if the US remained a reliable ally, Coalition foreign affairs spokesperson, David Coleman, blithely parroted the increasingly risible Australian orthodoxy: “Yes of course. The US is our most important ally … and has been for many decades and will continue to be.’’But Australians, perhaps never as heightened to global danger since the second world war, the Cuban missile crisis or US-Soviet nuclear tensions of the early 1980s, can decipher the precarious strategic realpolitik,even from way down here.It’s not that complicated, no matter how lacking some of our politicians might condescendingly think us.In late February when the United Nations considered aresolutioncondemning dictatorial Russia’s invasion of democratic Ukraine, the US voted against it. Their bedfellows? Russia naturally, but also pariah states Belarus and North Korea.And, so,the US stands solidly with Russia over its invasion of a democratic neighbour, at the UNand for the TV cameras as Trump (with the help of vice president JD Vance) made clear in hisWhite House meetingwith Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy.3:20'Make a deal or we are out': the worst of Trump and Zelenskyy’s clash – videoWhat shape might Trump America’s support of Putin’s Russia ultimately take? Will it go beyond UN resolutions to access to satellite technology currently afforded Ukraine? To intelligence sharing, perhaps? In which case should Canberra simply cut another front door key for Putin to what is in all practical terms a fully American-controlled military base,Pine Gap, in Australia’s midst? Might it go beyondTrump America’s suspensionof critical US military aid to Kyiv towards a shift of more profound military cooperation with – and support of – Russia?Which, of course, would put America at odds with its other supposed best friend forever, the United Kingdom, as well as the European Union. It is, indeed, asGeorge Monbiotpointed out, a “troubling question’’.It’s one being publicly canvased bysome independents, and public figures associated with both major sides of politics who are, thankfully, beyond the reach of party strictures and their inane talking points.As former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull recentlyobservedwith poignant understatement: “He [Trump] appears to be at the point of facilitating a victory for Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. Now, just contemplate that. It is mind-blowing … we have to recognise the world has changed, America has changed. And we cannot assume that we can rely on America in the way we have in the past.’’America. Has. Changed.We’ve got the memo. It seems like our leaders haven’t, or won’t.Former Labor ministerPeter Garrettrecently pointed out Australia’s political elites have long assumed Australia’s only viable security option was to have a very powerful friend in the US even if they were an “unlikeable bully’’.“There was a degree of subservience – that that was the price you had to pay. Now, that has been taken to a new dangerous, illogical and expensive extreme with the Aukus deal’’.These sentiments certainly reflect the deep private concerns of some major party politicians who are concerned by their parties’ continued unerring sycophancy towards Trump’s America amid its alignment with Russia. And, of course, the bipartisanship protecting Aukus, whose fundamental feature is dramatically enhanced, hand-in-glove, military interoperability with the US. In simple words: it locks Australia in as an unerring military ally at a time when it would be prudent to be anything but.How? Look to a near future where the EU and Britain and most right-thinking nations, are at odds with an America aligning militarily, morally, strategically with Russia.And where would Australia be? Despite the consistent major party condemnations of “murderous dictator’’ Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, we will be militarily hocked for $368bn – and therefore tied – to the expansionist America of Trump (or perhaps Vance, should Trump not show further contempt for his own country’s institutions and somehow engineer another term).The dangerous folly of it all, Australia’s come-what-may bipartisan obsequiousness, was on full cringe-making display when reliable buddy Trump seemed never to have heard of Aukus, despite it being the centrepiece of Australian defence and foreign policy since 2021.Hearing our leading politicians from both major partiescontort to defend him, to forgive his apparent ignorance because, you know, acronyms can be so damn tricky and he’s a helluva busy guy, was an Olympic exercise in gaslighting the Australian public.We – you – deserve better in these dangerous times.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionAustralian politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

You have to hang onto your own worth, she saysWed 5 Mar 2025 11.44 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.41 ESTShareFor at least half her life, the Belize-born British composer Errollyn Wallen, appointed last year to the title ofMaster of the King’s Music, has steered herself through a web of invisible rules. Classical composers, dead or alive, were male and white. Their Black and female counterparts were derided or ignored, excised from history. Then, slowly but definitively, things changed, and the institutions that used to give her the cold shoulder started to open up to the music they had dismissed. “People always want to put labels on things, on people,” Wallen says, without rancour. “Let them. You have to hang on to your own worth, see what needs doing. I was written off young, but then found a way through. There’s still so much work to be done.”Wallen’s musical range is ambitious, eclectic, often immediately appealing and expressive. Her huge catalogue includes works for ballet, brass bands, orchestras, choirs, solo singers, duos, pianists, chamber ensembles; her 22 operas make her almost as prolific as Verdi and nearly twice as productive as Puccini. She was the first Black woman to have music performed in the Proms, in 1998. Now among the most performed of living composers, she can’t quite remember how many world premieres she has in the next few weeks (after a recount, she decides it’s five), including two on the same night in different venues. She also has a new album out later this month:Errollyn Wallen Orchestral Works, played by the BBC Concert Orchestra. By any measure this is an achievement.Living in Orkney is a constant relief. I have to be able to bash away at the piano late at night – you can’t do that in a London flatBelying the glorious flamboyance of her appearance: pink statement glasses, a long waistcoat studded with felt flowers “from a charity shop”, black satin shirt trimmed with lace, fiery hair streaked with highlights (“thank goodness I’m going to the hairdresser this week”), Wallen’s conversation is quiet, thoughtful, poised. A can-do determination marks her out. The prompt for our conversation, over scrambled eggs and coffee in a grand London club where she greets the staff and they greet her, is her new choral work, Reign. She has been down in London from her home in Orkney, excited to hear the first rehearsals.View image in fullscreenWomen of the World preparations … rehearsal with full choir at the Mulberry School for Girls.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianFor high voices and organ, with her own hymn-like lyrics, it was commissioned by the feminist arts festivalWomen of the World(WOW), and will be performed on Saturday, International Women’s Day, at the Royal Albert Hall. The singers are 150 women, girls and non-binary people aged between eight and 80 years drawn from three London-based choirs: Mulberry School for Girls, St Boniface School andLips. Wallen was part of the original WOW team, founded by Jude Kelly in 2010. Is this festival focused on women still vital?“I think it is,” says Wallen, 66. “The world has always been in turmoil but recently it has taken a step back. Women in all parts of the world have faced a backlash. Girls and young women are still forbidden to have education. Misogyny abounds. If I hadn’t had access to free education, I’d never have had the chance to succeed.”A child of the Commonwealth, as she considers herself, Wallen grew up in Tottenham, north London. Singing has always been part of her life. She loves the English Hymnal, the definitive book of Anglican church music, and sees it as part of her cultural heritage. A talented pianist, Wallen frequently led her fellow pupils at her all-girls’ boarding school in Sussex in rousing accounts of Jerusalem, one of her favourite hymns. When the BBC commissioned a new version from her, for the Last Night of the Proms 2020 – the year of Covid – she combined a homage to Hubert Parry’s original with a sensitive new creation. The Proms played to an empty Albert Hall, but aired on TV and radio. Afterwards, she received hundreds of messages of abuse, essentially attacking her for daring to tamper with this national icon. Speaking to Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs in July last year, she said: “I spent the next day deleting abusive messages thinking, ‘Well, actually, when was the last time somebody really talked about a new piece of music in the national press? So yeah, I’ll take it.’”Wallen’s own astonishing life reads likes a set of disturbing short stories, set out in her 2023 memoir, Becoming a Composer. Soon after arriving in Britain, when she was two, her parents decided they would rather live in New York. She and her siblings were left with a childless aunt and uncle, Belize-born Arthur and Renee, a white EastEnder. Wallen expected her parents to send for her to join them. They never did, though later the children spent summers in New York. She loved her aunt and uncle, and accepted their hopes and anxieties as her own. Home life offered a culinary mix of pie and mash, jellied eels and, a nod to Belize cuisine, rice with everything.View image in fullscreenControversial … Golda Schultz performing Wallen’s new version of Jerusalem at the Last Night of the Proms in 2020.Photograph: Mark Allan/BBCLater, the young Wallen, who for many years wanted to be a ballerina, put herself on a diet of cake, strictly limited, and became very thin, one of many uneasy incidents that, today, might sound alarm bells. Her ambition to dance was abandoned when she was told there were no Black ballerinas. Uncle Arthur, perceptive as well as authoritarian, was the first to suggest the constant sounds in Wallen’s head might indicate she was a composer. He also helped her see wider horizons, introducing her to poetry, literature and concerts at London’s Wigmore Hall. “I never thought it was strange that we were the only Black people there,” she says. “I felt I could go anywhere. I will always thank Uncle Arthur for that. It must have been very difficult for him at that time.”Obstacles and educational diversions aside – she ran away from school and, in her late teens, made a suicide attempt nobody talked about – she went to Goldsmiths College to study music. She was steeped in the music of Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, JS Bach and, one of her all-time musical gods, Stevie Wonder. She became a session musician, which included an appearance on Top of the Pops, to her chagrin miming to a pre-recorded backing track with girl group Eternal (but she got to meet Cher, who admired her leopard-print waistcoat). She also set up her own ensemble. Somehow, and it is hard to imagine quite how, Wallen always hung on to an innate sense of worth, even as she was being crushed. “Show me your scores and we can have a good laugh” one influential concert director told her, in the 1980s, when her male contemporaries were securing performances of their works by elite groups such at the London Sinfonietta.From mini Mars bars to matters of life or death: Errollyn Wallen on becoming a composerRead moreWere her aunt and uncle alive now, or her distant but proud parents, would they countenance her appointment by King Charles? It came as a surprise to Wallen herself. She assumed the call from a palace official was an invitation to a reception. “I heard myself say ‘yes’. I had friends with me who cushioned the shock.” She is beginning to think how to direct her energies to the role – a post in the royal household, not dissimilar to that of poet laureate, whose loosely specified duties include composing music for important royal events. One of her imminent premieres is a work for solo soprano to be sung at the Commonwealth 2025 service in Westminster Abbey next Monday.Our wide-ranging conversation is over, with many brightly coloured strands left hanging. Later that day, Wallen will return home to solitude, composition, the sea at the bottom of the garden. (She used to live in a lighthouse near Thurso. She has since moved even farther north, close to where one of her predecessors, Master of the Queen’s Music, Peter Maxwell Davies, lived.) She will drive back to the sound, a current obsession, of the Jackson Five’s I Want You Back – “not very modern I know!” – thinking about how their clever bass line could fit with one of her own pieces. The relief of being there is constant, she says.“I’m a Londoner but I have to be able to go to the piano when I feel like it and bash away late at night. You can’t do that in a London flat.” Before she went there, three Black friends said, ‘Won’t you feel scared, being a in a place with so few Black people?’ Orcadians, she says, are like the people of Belize: gentle, welcoming, accepting. “If I want to go somewhere, nothing’s ever really stopped me. I just go ahead and do it.”Errollyn Wallen’s Reign has its world premiere atWOW at 15– an event featuring music and conversation at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 8 March.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

They’re telling Margot, Gordon’s mum, that they’re about to appear in a Valentine’s Day issue of the local newspaper’Interview byLydia FigesWed 5 Mar 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 12.17 ESTShareItook this shot in 1987, when I was living in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the middle of the Aids crisis, and there was an atmosphere of fear as more people fell victim to the virus. The year before, I had decided to createAt Home With Themselves,a series in which I captured the lives of same-sex couples in photographs and interviews. That’s how I met Gordon and Jim, the couple shown here next to Gordon’s mother Margot in their home in San Diego.By the mid-1980s, and with the advent of Aids, there was a backlash against the growing openness towards homosexuality. There were all sorts of misconceptions about how you could contract the disease: from toilet seats, or sharing an ice-cream cone. The press played into stereotypes, particularly the idea that gay men were very sexually promiscuous. But that period got me thinking about the prevalence, variety and longevity of gay and lesbian relationships. My ambition was to make pictures that gave dignity to gay love. I wanted to create images that moved people in a visual and psychological sense.So I started approaching friends, and friends of friends. I put ads in local gay newspapers and met couples in gay bars. I went to LGBTQ parades and the following year I attended the 1987Second National March on Washington. It was surprisingly easy to find couples who were willing to be photographed, even though many people were still not openly homosexual. I had heard a lot about the tea dances in Provincetown – afternoon gatherings that brought people from the community together, which was where I found many of my sitters.Gordon’s dad was homophobic and would forbid the subject of homosexuality in the houseI met Gordon and Jim because they responded to one of my newspaper ads. We talked several times on the phone before I finally went to their house. They had been together for 21 years, and had lived next to Gordon’s parents for a long time. Although they cohabited, Gordon’s parents didn’t realise, or simply ignored the fact, that they were a couple. The four of them regularly ate meals together and lived as one family. Jim felt accepted by Gordon’s parents, like he was another son. But they also told me that Gordon’s dad was homophobic, that he would forbid the subject of homosexuality in the house, and turned off the television or radio if it came up. Margot, Gordon’s mom, apparently always had suspicions about their relationship, though it was never openly discussed with her before.I took this shot two weeks after Gordon and Jim finally came out to Margot. It was a few years after the death of Gordon’s father, and they were about to be interviewed by a local newspaper for a special Valentine’s Day issue. When I was at their house, they were telling Margot about the project – giving her advance warning about the coverage. I think the photograph captures the tension and raw emotion in the room. But there is also a sense of Margot’s slow acceptance of the situation. There is warmth and familiarity in this shot, even if you can detect the discomfort.Several months into making the At Home with Themselves series, I realised I had turned to this subject for another reason. My curiosity about the gay community also stemmed from my father – who was gay. He was a second world war veteran and had left my mother when my sister and I were very young. It was not until my early 20s that I realised he was gay, partly because every time I’d visit, he was accompanied by much younger men. He never came out to me.‘Time moved more slowly then’: Sage Sohier’s vintage America – in picturesRead moreWhen the project was completed, I visited my father in New York. We looked at the photographs together. He didn’t say much, but he teared up. I could tell he was moved by the portraits. In that moment there was a mutual understanding. I could sense his gratitude and relief. It was my way of telling him I saw him – and that he was accepted.Looking back at these pictures now, I can fully comprehend the courage it took to stand up and be photographed as a same-sex couple in the 1980s. The portraits gave couples an opportunity to declare themselves and be seen. I have received emails from people around the world saying how much the project has meant to them. As a photographer, one always hopes that one’s pictures will have an impact, and in a small way, make the world a better place.Sage Sohier’s CVView image in fullscreenSage Sohier.Born:Washington DC, 1954Trained:Photographyat the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts while getting a BA at Harvard University.Influences:Helen Levitt, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Chauncey Hare.Low point:“A hand injury in my 40s that kept me from photographing for a couple of years.”Top tip:“Start by photographing what you know and have access to (your family, etc).

I can only assume Anselm Kiefer’s alienating exhibition is part of this plan to scare off the punters.A curator lent weight to the suspicion by telling me “the sort of people who come here” may be perplexed to see this giant of contemporary art next to their idol Vincent. To herd these people into the museum’s exhibition wing, they’ve moved some of Van Gogh’s most beloved works there from the permanent collection. It’s a fatal decision – for Kiefer.No artist is likely to come off well from a direct comparison with Van Gogh. But the catastrophe Kiefer suffers is a Götterdämmerung. Here is one of the gods of today’s art, whom I have always seen as a creative giant, crashing into Van Gogh’s wheatfields in a smoking heap.View image in fullscreenDead stuff … Anselm Kiefer’s Sol Invictus, 1995.Photograph: Charles Duprat/Collection of the artistIf that sounds like a bad taste image from German history – and in my head I see Paul Nash’s paintingTotes Meerof a field full of destroyed Nazi planes – that’s inspired by Kiefer at his best. This artist born in the ruins of Germany in 1945 has bravely used his work to insist that Germans, and the rest of us, keep the evil of nazism in sight. He’s done that in provocative ways, frombeing photographed making Hitler salutesto creating installations resembling the Führerbunker. You can understand why, in his 80th year, Kiefer might want to be seen differently, as a sensitive painter of nature, a fellow spirit of Van Gogh, who, just as the Dutchman fled to Arles, has a home and studio in the south of France. Macho history painter?, this show screams. No, I’m a sensitive landscapist!But Kiefer can’t do small or subtle. In his first gigantic painting, it looks as if Stukas are dive-bombing Auvers-sur-Oise. Another colossal “painting” recreates Van Gogh’s Starry Night in vast swirls of real straw.Kiefer’s best painting, however, is a grey expanse of ruined nature with a fire-fringed horizon. It belongs in a different show. One that mentions the war. Then he’s back to piling up dried vegetation in an outsized recreation of an early Van Gogh painting of a Dutch woodland, or sticking a single dead sunflower in a vitrine spilling its seeds on to an open book. There is darkness in Van Gogh, and madness and isolation, yet it’s tempered by his humble vocation of looking at the world. Kiefer uses massive scale instead of the small pictures Vincent painted, heaps of dead stuff instead of trusting in paint, sensation instead of substance. It’s all sound and fury. On the next floor you find it signifies nothing.Van Gogh’s paintings have been hung opposite a wall of golden, encrusted, gargantuan Kiefers. Do the big 21st-century works overwhelm the poor little 19th-century ones? No. You are drawn magnetically to Vincent’s. The Van Gogh Museum doesn’t like it if you say Wheatfield with Crows is his “last” work (it’s just one of his last!) or read too much into the deathly birds streaking out of a billowing sky. But Van Gogh stood here, saw this, in this mood, and expressed his response in colours wrenched from within.Going from this to the vast Kiefer paintings is like tearing yourself from, well, a sincere folk song to a kitsch cabaret version of it. The title of this exhibition, Sag mir wo die Blumen sind, is the first line of Marlene Dietrich’s 1962 cover version of Pete Seeger’sWhere Have All the Flowers Gone? This pop oddity, on an album that also includes Dietrich’s Blowin’ in the Wind, is an unexpectedly flip quotation from Kiefer. Facing Van Gogh, the most authentic of all artists, he looks inauthentic, endlessly upping the materials, replacing numinous golden mists, especially in Vincent’s little wonder,Wheatfield with a Reaper, with coarsely applied gold paint.View image in fullscreenDive-bombers … Anselm Kiefer’s Die Krähen (The Crows), 2019.Photograph: Georges Poncet/Collection of the artist, courtesy White CubeNext door in the Stedelijk Museum, where the show continues, you find Kiefer’s response to Wheatfield with a Reaper: he has, you guessed right, fixed actual scythes on it. To accompany the Stedelijk’s stroll through its Kiefer collection is a suck-up film of the artist at his Barjac estate. He has sculpted this bit of sunny France, building new roads, a tunnel between the main house and “the children’s house”, and a warscape of tottering concrete bunker-towers. Van Gogh was a poor man surviving through his brother Theo’s handouts. Kiefer belongs to a commercial art world where artists who make it live on huge estates they survey by helicopter and produce art on an industrial scale.Yet on the top floor of the Van Gogh Museum another film tells another story. News footage from early 1960s television features the bespectacled, intense, teenaged Kiefer as the winner of a grant to go on a journey through the Netherlands and France visiting Van Gogh’s landscapes. The drawings he made on his youthful quest are on show – loving imitations of his hero, full of promise.Dietrich’s version of Seeger’s song must have been on the airwaves at the time. Unfortunately, Kiefer’s latterday responses to Vincent look all the more false compared with these relics of youthful sincerity. Where have all the flowers gone? Indeed.Anselm Kiefer: Sag mir wo die Blumen sind is at the Van Gogh Museum and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, from 7 March to 9 June, then theRoyal Academy, London, from 28 June to 26 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArt and designAnselm KieferVincent van GoghExhibitionsPaintingArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Age ratings are intended to help parents determine whether or not a game is appropriate for their children. But in practice, an erroneous label doesn’t just mislead consumers – it can be the difference between success or failure.Balatro is an award-winning poker game made by ananonymous game developer known as LocalThunk, in which the only guiding principle is chaos. In each match the player must divine the best possible poker hand out of a randomised draw, but the conditions fluctuate constantly. In one round, the game might prevent you from using an entire suit or junk all your face cards, while the next round might challenge you to achieve an eyebrow-raising score with only a single hand. As the game progresses, players accrue jokers for their deck that add yet more wild rules.It’s an ingenious premise that has allowed a game that began as a small side-project to sell millions of copies since its release in February 2024. Though players win in-game money to buy new cards between rounds, Balatro’s version of poker is fictional, and only bears a faint resemblance to the classic card game. Yet shortly after launching, Balatro hit a snag: it was classified as a gambling game.At first, Balatro went on sale with a classification that deemed it appropriate for audiences ages three and up. But then, the classification was revised to an adults-only 18 rating. The reasoning? The Pan-European Game Information (Pegi), the organisation that determines age classifications, claimed that Balatro “contains prominent gambling imagery and material that instructs about gambling”.Without warning, Balatro was pulled from sale on some digital storefronts in Europe and Asia.“This was obviously a crucial moment and we had two options,” says Wout van Halderen, the communications director at PlayStack, Balatro’s publisher. “Be de-listed, or take the 18+ rating and get back in the store Asap. We opted for the second and started preparing an appeal to have the rating changed.”The appeal was initially declined – and issues began to snowball. In Korea, the rating outright barred Balatro from being sold. In December, when Balatro wonGame of the Yearat The Game awards, the team was also ramping up for a physical release. Another appeal was filed by that version’s distributor, Fireshine. It is only now, a year later and after a handful of updates, that the dust has settled and Balatro has been bumped down to a 12+ rating by Pegi.“It’s difficult to quantify the sales impact, as Balatro’s surge in popularity may have mitigated losses,” Halderen says. “That said, the de-listing disrupted momentum at a key point in the launch. Development-wise, the rating saga took time and resources, but it didn’t fundamentally delay planned updates.”Pegi, for its part, reiterated that it seeks to apply a fair criteria for ratingsin a press release, and that any game that teaches or glamorises gambling will automatically lead to an 18+ rating. The board that oversaw the appeal also ceded that Pegi is a system that “continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process”. To that end, Balatro’s dilemma has led Pegi to create a more granular classification system for games that depict gambling. The 18+ rating will now only apply to games that simulate the type of poker people play at actual casinos.It is a tale with a happy ending for Balatro, yet it highlights the limitations of Pegi’s current system. The appeal process was an extended one, and while that didn’t impact Balatro’s massive success, a smaller game without such acclaim would not fare nearly as well.The wording of the new classification system suggests that any realistic depiction of gambling within a game would still result in an 18+ rating, even if players cannot actually spend, bet or lose money in the game. Meanwhile, games such as EA’s football series Sports FC, which sell players digital loot boxes with randomised contents, sport Pegi’s 3+ classification. The loot boxes only have a small chance of dropping a rare item, which means players are effectively gambling their money by buying them.Even with better classification systems and streamlined processes, any age rating system would struggle to keep consumers informed about the contents of a game in the age of user-generated content. A game like Roblox, for example, is deemed to be appropriate for users 7+ – but the rating does not apply to anything created by players, which is the vast majority of the content, andcan be inappropriate.The reclassification of Balatro has been a great relief for its publisher, and the amendment to Pegi’s rules shows that the organisation is open to change. “We applaud the Pegi Experts Group on their commitment to develop a more granular set of classification criteria as indie games continue to stretch into new ideas and concepts,” Halderen says.“We believe it is a sign of a healthy classification board that it evolves in line with cultural expectations and continues to ensure that audiences understand the type of content present in games.”Explore more on these topicsGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

During that prolonged period of isolation and uncertainty, he comforted himself by devouring shelves full ofbooks, including memoirs penned by other musicians. “After a while all those memoirs started to seem the same,” he said. “And I came to the realization that, unless you were a huge fan of that musician, the details of their story wouldn’t seem particularly captivating.”Grace Slick on sex, drugs and Jefferson Airplane: ‘I was sober in the 80s. That was a mistake’Read moreSuch thoughts had a major impact on Wolf when he was approached to tell his own story. As a result, his new book, titled Waiting on the Moon, threads the outlines of a memoir – highlighted by his years fronting the hit group J Geils Band – through a host of colorful anecdotes about what he describes as the “artists, poets, drifters, grifters and goddesses” he met along the way.One such goddess happened to beFaye Dunaway, to whom he was married for five tumultuous years in the 70s. Initially, Wolf was so reluctant to include any details of his personal story that he didn’t even want to mention his band, which topped the charts in the 80s with songs like Freeze-Frame and Centerfold, or his marriage to one of Hollywood’s biggest and most controversial stars. It took the combined force of his editor and agent to throw cold water in his face. “They told me it would seem odd if I left those things out,” he said. “It would only wind up bringing more attention to them.”The balance Wolf eventually struck makes much of his book read less like the work of a memoirist than that of a raconteur, eager to revel in the quirks of the characters in his orbit. “In writing the book I found that people reveal themselves best in the little details,” he said. “That’s where you see what they’re really like.”The more unexpected the detail, the better – like discovering upon meeting Fred Astaire that he was utterly entranced by the dancers on Soul Train. Or observing thatAretha Franklin, with whom Wolf cut a duet in the 80s, would only speak to him in a British accent due to her love at the time of the delicious bitchery of Joan Collins on Dynasty.The book begins as conventional memoirs must, with Wolf’s childhood. But unlike the legion of rockers who rebelled against their square parents, Wolf echoed their love of the arts as well as their countercultural politics. During his childhood, his parents’ leftist affiliations were pronounced enough to put them under surveillance by the US government.“When we got a TV, which was a really exciting thing for a kid in the 50s, it wasn’t for entertainment,” he said. “It was so my parents could watch the McCarthy hearings.”View image in fullscreenA young Peter Wolf and his family.Photograph: Peter WolfAs a child, Wolf was so hyper-active his mother used to tie a leash around him to stop him from running wild. “I remember how horrified the neighbors were by that,” he said with a laugh.His parents encouraged his interests in both music and painting, which soon attracted interesting company. As a teen, Wolf took his paintings to Washington Square Park, where he wound up meeting Edward Hopper, who would stop by to chat. “Here was this great artist,” Wolf said, “but at the time he was considered passé because it was the age of the abstract impressionists.”Wolf’s parallel obsession with music led him to early shows byBob Dylansoon after he arrived in the Village in the early 60s. The visionary scope of Dylan’s work convinced Wolf that this wasn’t just a great artist but a seer. He was so convinced that one day he cornered Dylan with a demand to know “what is truth?” The question elicited from Dylan a pitched screed about the unknowability of all things, which Wolf recounts in two burning pages in the book. “I think I got what I deserved,” the author said with a laugh.To develop his painting skills, Wolf attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where his first roommate turned out to be a youngDavid Lynch, who also aspired to an art career. “There was no talk of cinema whatsoever then,” Wolf said. “We were truly the odd couple. David came from the preppie world and was into the Beach Boys and the Four Seasons while I was this debauched person from Greenwich Village who listened to Thelonious Monk.”Despite Lynch’s buttoned-up demeanor, elements of his future feel for surrealism poked through one day when he was brushing his teeth. Unfortunately, Lynch had failed to notice that a dead cockroach had become entangled on the brush, resulting in a rash of insect remains strewn across his teeth.During his time in Boston, Wolf began to perform with an R&B band called the Hallucinations, who opened shows for idols of his like Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters. Wolf and Waters became especially close. “Muddy came from a totally different culture, but here he was sitting on my futon telling me that as a young man he sang the songs of [country legend] Gene Autry,” he said. “To me, that was mind-blowing.”Besides Howlin’ Wolf’s genius, Peter Wolf was drawn to his determination to sustain a career with little financial reward. “He stayed in these cheap hotels with yellow window shades and beds that sagged like you see in noir films,” he said. “But he still kept going.”Wolf was with Waters that horrible night in 1968 when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated, a night that also happened to be the blues legend’s birthday. “While Muddy was blowing out his candles, sirens blared in the background,” Wolf said. “The whole country was on edge.”View image in fullscreenPeter Wolf in Bayside, New York.Photograph: Peter WolfBy that time, Wolf had begun working as a DJ at WBCN, which became the city’s best champion for cutting-edge music. In that capacity, he began to receive a steady stream of anonymous notes that begged him to “play more Van Morrison”. Only after befriending the Irish singer a while later did he discover that the notes were written by Morrison’s girlfriend and sometimes by the man himself. “He signed them Mongo Bongo,” Wolf said. “I still have them.”That was during a fraught time in Morrison’s life when he was hiding out in Boston to escape a rash of legal issues with his record company in New York. “Van had absolutely no money and was feeling so lost,” Wolf said. “I provided a shelter for him.”At the same time, Morrison was developing the revolutionary sound of Astral Weeks, an album that would become a gamechanger not just for him but for music itself. As much affection as Wolf brings to his descriptions of Morrison, he also captures the famously difficult side of him, replete with random outbursts and last-minute refusals to go on stage. Rather than label him difficult, however, Wolf sees him as “moody”. “Van doesn’t deal with bullshit,” he said.The tolerance Wolf had for such things would come in handy when he met his future wife, Faye Dunaway, another artist known for her fast-moving moods. A mutual friend introduced them after a J Geils show in 1972. By that time, she’d become a gigantic star, having broken through five years earlier with her role in Bonnie and Clyde. By contrast, Wolf’s band then drew a cultish crowd. As stark as the power imbalance was between them, Wolf recalled the 70s as an era “when all movie stars wanted to be rockers, and all rockers wanted to be movie stars”.Moreover, Dunaway was a huge Otis Redding fan and she adored hanging out with the band and crew, regardless of their sometimes ratty circumstances. It helped that she could drink them all under the table. “She really was two people,” Wolf said. “There was Dorothy Faye [her birth name], who was this sweet southern girl, and Faye Dunaway, this very cultured actress.”View image in fullscreenFaye Dunaway.Photograph: Peter WolfThe book chronicles her moods without judgment but, ina new documentaryabout the star, she herself ponders on camera the possibility that she might be bipolar. “That term didn’t exist when we were married,” Wolf said. “But when people are graced with an artistic gift, there are things that come along with that. Maybe I just have a gift for being able to deal with those things.”However, even he could reach a breaking point, like the moment during the filming of Chinatown in 1974 when Dunaway and co-star Jack Nicholson met to talk about the film, with Wolf in tow. At one point, the movie stars excused themselves to go upstairs for what Wolf eventually realized was an impromptu assignation. Though that made him far from happy at the time, he now advises readers to consider “the era in which this was happening. The climate was ripe for that.”Soon after the ensuing blow-up, the two reconciled and, out of nowhere, Dunaway proposed to him. As exciting as their subsequent marriage was, it was far from stable. Several years into it Dunaway left him for photographer Terry O’Neill.Meanwhile, Wolf’s band continued to coast commercially, despite the mountain of critical respect they’d amassed. The songs J Geils cut in the 70s, captured most searingly on their live album Full House, forged an entirely new brand of R&B, fired by hard rock power and delivered at the speed of a runaway train. However, their contract with Atlantic Records was so onerous that profits were nearly impossible to realize. Their turnaround didn’t occur until they moved to EMI Records in the early 80s, resulting in a No 1 album for Freeze-Frame. With that win came an invitation to open a Stones tour that also featured the first stadium appearances by a young Prince. Shockingly, the purple one often got booed off the stage. “It wasn’t a racial thing,” Wolf said. “It was just that seeing Prince sing songs like Jerk U Off in a trenchcoat was just too outlandish for the generic AOR rock fan of the day.”Though J Geils went down well with that crowd, their success caused most of the band members to want to lean further into the slick, synth-driven sound that gave them hits. By contrast, Wolf wanted to use their new exposure to lead the audience back to their core R&B sound. At an impasse, the band unceremoniously fired him in 1983.In the years since, Wolf has released eight solo albums, all of which finely balance his root R&B style with more mature and poignant lyrics. (He’s in the process of recording a new solo album now.) He brought that same mature perspective to his book. If the anecdotes he offers along the way often outweigh the personal details he reveals, the end result makes a powerful point: sometimes the story of who we are can best be told by the things we love.“The work of all those people I’ve admired so much has defined a lot of my life,” Wolf said. “Because I was lucky enough to spend so many private moments with them, my mission was to be an observer and to share all that I got to see.”Waiting on the Moon is out on 11 MarchExplore more on these topicsMusicMusic booksFaye DunawayPop and rockDavid LynchBob DylanAretha FranklininterviewsShareReuse this content"

Francesco Petrarca, known asPetrarch, had commissioned the Sienese artist Simone Martini to paint a portrait of his beloved, Laura. The result was so marvellous, he wrote, that if all the famous artists of ancient Greece “competed for a thousand years they wouldn’t have seen a tiny bit of the beauty that’s conquered my heart”.Petrarch’s rave review has it right. Conquering the heart is what Martini and other 14th-century painters from Siena do in the National Gallery’s devastatingly exact, epochal exhibition about the moment western art came alive. Simone’s painting of Laura is lost but you see why he was the artist for the job. He is so expressive, so tender, exploding any idea of medieval art as remote.There is a melting intimacy to the soft pale faces from his Palazzo Pubblico altarpiece that are displayed as a row of portraits. Saint Anselm is a dreamy knight with a flag in his hand. Saint Luke, with his sketchbook and stylus at the ready as he gazes passionately at the Virgin Mary, may be a self-portrait. The Virgin herself is rapt as she looks at, or mystically past us. Even strapping baby Jesus in her arms is struck by sublime, face-misting thoughts under his mop of golden hair.View image in fullscreenAlive to motherhood … Madonna del Latte by Ambrogio Lorenzetti.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesIsn’t such sensitive portraiture meant to have entered European art much later, in the age of Botticelli, Petrus Christus and Leonardo da Vinci? The Renaissance, this exhibition shows, was all there in microcosm in the creative explosion that took place in a small hilltop city 700 years ago. The Siena of this exhibition has nothing much to do with the tourist Siena of thePalio horse race. Instead you walk into a dark space where gold-mounted paintings are picked out by intense lighting, and are suddenly plunged into a world of inner feeling.The love between mother and child peels away your cynicism in a small, heart-opening panel that’s the first thing to hit your eyes – a little painting byDuccio, done some time between 1290 and 1300. Around it are examples of what a worshipper in an Italian church would usually have seen at this time: stiffly posed images of the Virgin by Byzantine artists and their imitators. Duccio’s Virgin and Child bursts out of those conventions. Instead of sitting coldly enthroned in his mother’s arms, Jesus, dressed like a little adult but with baby hands and feet, reaches up to touch his mother’s veil, pulling it aside to reveal her face.Duccio has a touching, truthful eye for how a real baby might touch mummy’s face. This is the start of an intimate journey as three generations of Sienese artists compete to be still more alive to motherhood, culminating withAmbrogio Lorenzetti’s Madonna del Latte in which a life-sized baby looks at you intensely with a huge, gloating eye as he sucks on Mary’s naked breast, holding it in his little hand, letting us know her life-giving milk is all for him.Once again, though, Simone Martini adds a genius twist. His painting Christ Discovered in the Temple, lent by Liverpool’s WalkerArtGallery, brings acute psychology to a story of family tension. The teenage Christ has wandered off in the Temple, panicking his parents. Joseph has just brought him back. Jesus looks sulky and confrontational. His father’s purple face indicates he is just about controlling himself. Mary sits calmly but her words, written in Latin on the book in her lap, roughly translate as, “Son, why do you treat us this way?”All this emotional power comes from a mastery of space. Perspective was invented in Florence during the Renaissance, right? Not entirely. The artists of early 14th-century Siena did not yet comprehend the systematic, “single-point” perspective Leonardo would use. Instead they play with partial perspective effects to create fairytale vistas of walled cities, merchant ships and the soaring interiors of gothic cathedrals.View image in fullscreenEye-fooling depth … Duccio’s The Temptation of Christ on the Temple, c 1308-11.Photograph: Museo dell’Opera della Metropolitana, SienaThis playful mapping is at its most magical in the masterpiece at the heart of this show. Duccio’s Maestà was a massive altarpiece broken up in the 18th century. The National Gallery owns three panels from a layer of narrative scenes at the bottom, known as a predella. It has borrowed accompanying panels to resurrect this artistic miracle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet what grabs you is Duccio’s spatial conjuring. As the devil tempts Christ to throw himself from the highest point of a temple, we see an amazingly solid, polygonal building filling the wooden panel, even seeming to bulge out of it. Christ confronts Satan on a marble balcony rendered in eye-fooling depth. You can see inside where gothic arches and a particoloured pavement recede with hypnotic reality. It’s not just visual trickery. Space creates emotion. The solidity of real objects means that when the devil dares Christ to jump, there is danger.Poetry again is key. Duccio was the contemporary of Dante whose Divine Comedy visualises Hell, Purgatory and Paradise as real places with the same spatial precision that makes the Maestà so wondrous.

It was chosen for the Gold prize over Lost in the Garden by Adam S Leslie, which won the fiction category; Wild Houses by Colin Barrett, which won the debut fiction category; and The Twelve by Liz Hyder, illustrated by Tom de Freston, which won the children’s fiction category. Each of the four category winners received £5,000.This year marks the second iteration of the Nero prizes, which were launched after Costa Coffeeabruptly endedits book awards in 2022. The Bee Sting by Paul Murray was chosen as theinaugural Gold prize winner.Maurice and Maralyn tells the story of a couple who, bored with suburban life in Derby, decide to sell their house, build a boat and set sail for New Zealand. However, 250 miles north of Ecuador, a sperm whale smashes into the boat, and they are cast adrift for nearly four months in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat.Elmhirst marshals their story into an “electrifying narrative full of atmosphere and humanity and with the lightest dusting of romance,” wrote Fiona Sturges in aGuardian reviewof the book. “Maurice and Maralyn is about a shipwreck, yes, but it’s also a tender portrait of two unconventional souls blithely defying the conventions of their era and making a break for freedom.”As well as being a story about survival at sea and physical endurance, the book chronicles a marriage under immense stress. “For what else is a marriage, really, if not being stuck on a small raft with someone and trying to survive?”, Elmhirst writes.“Shining through is the heroine’s courage and fortitude”, said Bryson. “As Maurice flounders, it is Maralyn’s strength that allows them to survive at sea”, adding that the book “is a tribute to Maralyn’s grit”. Researching the book, Elmhirst studied the diaries Maralyn wrote on the raft, interviews with the couple after their rescue and the memoirs they wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Maurice and Maralyn is her first book. She described winning the Nero nonfiction category award as like “being given a lovely confidence transfusion”.Alongside Bryson, the Gold prize judging panel included Booker-winning author and Royal Society of Literature president Bernardine Evaristo and journalist Emily Maitlis.“Elmhirst’s writing is understated but powerful, immersing the reader intimately in the unfolding drama and the horror of struggling to survive against the odds with very few resources,” said Bryson. “We unanimously agreed that Maurice and Maralyn is a nonfiction work that reaches the highest literary eminence”.Wednesday’s ceremony also saw the announcement of a new award, the Nero new writers prize, to be run in association with Brunel University. Unpublished writers will be invited to submit 5,000 words of original adult fiction, children’s fiction or creative nonfiction, with the winner receiving a cash prize, a scholarship to study for an MA in creative writing at Brunel and an introductory meeting with a literary agent.Maurice and Maralyn by Sophie Elmhirst is published by Vintage (£10.99).

We’re hosting an event of that scale in this city every single year without any of that central infrastructure that you would automatically get with a sporting event.”She called on the city and government to help with “the unlocking of every single piece of capacity” in theEdinburgharea to house performers and crew. “I think if we were a major sporting event, that kind of infrastructure would have been put in place,” she added.McCarthy also said the city desperately needed mobile phone signal boosters as festivalgoers were often unable to secure tickets on their mobiles, which cut income for the fringe as well as venues. “This is not rocket science. This is something that can absolutely be sorted,” she said.McCarthy, one of the fringe’s longest-serving chief executives, said she was “really surprised” when she arrived in Edinburgh in 2016 to find there were no late-running train services to accommodate ticket holders from outside the city, such as those returning to Glasgow.She had “lobbied like crazy” for ScotRail, the train operator, and Network Rail to put on later trains and allow ticket booths on stations.One other success was the recent decision by Queen Margaret University to set up an artists’ village on its small campus just outside Edinburgh every August. That needed to be replicated, she said.McCarthy was more optimistic that strategic planning might happen after Angus Robertson, the Scottish culture secretary and MSP for Edinburgh Central, announced a new festivals partnership group and pledged additional funding for the fringe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its shows are the responsibility of thousands of producers. The Fringe Society coordinates ticket sales and the main programme, provides strategic direction and helps facilitate events.“I think there is an understanding from Scottish government that the Fringe Society has fallen between the cracks as the central charitable organisation that provides core services to the festival,” she said.McCarthy said she feared that the fringe was still the object of a form of snobbery, with its events seen as mid-market or amateur, serving instead as an opportunity for the city and its businesses to make a profit.She said the city council had massively increased costs for producers. It now charged a £1,000 licence fee for every raised platform and charged the full hourly cost for every parking space if a street was closed for festival events. “This festival is not seen as something that you invest in,” she said. “It’s seen as something that’s a money-spinner that you can extract from. And I think that’s a real problem.”The council argues it is striving to increase funding for the festivals witha new 5% visitor levy on overnight stays, which will be levied from October this year on all stays that start after July 2026.Part of the £50m raised each year will improve tourism infrastructure. Councillors argue the city’s housing crisis is year-round, so they plan to earmark £5m towards a new affordable housebuilding programme.The Covid-19 crisis, which forced the Edinburgh festivals to shut down in 2020 for the first time since 1947, had helped the Fringe Society rediscover its core purpose, she added. That was “about freedom of expression; that’s about cultural democracy; that’s about the audience themselves as the curator of their own experience. That’s about inclusion and access and the right to have a voice.”Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsScotlandEdinburghTheatreComedy (Stage)newsShareReuse this content"

But actually we’re interdependent with all these living systems, so it’s really a new way of thinking that we’re trying to encourage,” he added.The More Than Human movement first emerged in the late 1990s when David Abram, the cultural ecologist, geo-philosopher and performance artist,coined the term. It has since moved from the theoretical to the real world.View image in fullscreenMicrographia by Johanna Seelemann.Photograph: c/o The Design Museum“It’s really only been around in theory for about 20 years,” said McGuirk. “But I’ve noticed among a younger generation of designers that this is becoming much more a way of thinking for them.”The exhibition is the first curatorial collaboration between the Design Museum and its national design research programme, Future Observatory, which launched in 2021 and champions new design thinking on environmental issues.Tim Marlow, director and CEO of the Design Museum said: “It’s important for museums and cultural institutions to respond to the complex issues facing our planet and society at present. It’s also important to shift perspectives from a human-centric view of the world to one closer to nature, which will make this a landmark exhibition in every sense.”Explore more on these topicsDesignMuseumsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Clad in full scuba gear, she would have gone unnoticed as she weaved among the usual visitors – a bored gaggle of schoolchildren, tourists, and a yeti – were it not for a beady eyed security guard. The woman, it turns out, was a member of an infamous crime syndicate, renowned for breaking into museums, stealing priceless exhibits and slipping back into the sewers like a well-remunerated goldfish. As my security guard tackled the thief, the museum’s prehistory expert neatly sidestepped the fray and departed for a far-flung corner of the Earth, soon to return with a prized relic of the ancient world. Burglars get caught; museums just hire better qualified thieves and send them on expeditions.This is the kind of whimsical satire that Two Point Studios trades on, making delightful and irreverent management games that poke fun at very serious establishments: hospitals, universities, and now museums. Here, as the curator of the county’s timeworn institutions, you must protect profit first and history second. Easier said than done when there’s so much to manage: you must hire experts to source and maintain exhibits, assistants to run front-of-house, janitors to scrape stubborn substances from floors, and security guards to handle donations and play whack-a-mole with criminals.Tour routes must be carefully plotted and decorated to impress, thus generating “buzz” and convincing visitors to make a donation. Different visitor types like different things: sage professors crave knowledge from well-placed information stands, while hyperactive children just want something that goesbeep. To please pint-sized punters, you need to research and build kid-friendly interactive displays in the workshop, paying for the materials through any fundraising means necessary, whether that be loans, gift-shop sales, or advertising deals with local businesses. It’s a beautifully detailed operation that suggests the developers have paid close attention to human nature, and how to mirror it in an intriguing game-loop.You can imagine that the curators atthe British Museum scratch their heads over the same challenges (save the scuba thieves). Some visitors barrel straight through, pausing just long enough to take a selfie with the most popular exhibit, while others will spend hours in the gift shop. Two Point does a spectacular job of simulating the challenge of satisfying diverse crowds … despite the fact that here, your audience includes literalclowns.Museum themes range from the expected – prehistoric, aquatic, botanical – to the outlandish – haunted, extraterrestrial, apocalyptic. Previous instalments in the Two Point series forced your institutions to stay siloed (it would have been odd, after all, for a sports university to install a wizarding magic department). But the very nature of museums requires a joyful mishmash of curiosities, allowing you to build wildly varied exhibits across unique locations. The aquarium, for instance, offers expeditions that yield the prehistoric bones of sea creatures, or cursed booty from creepy sunken pirate ships. This means your collection stays useful, rather than languishing in a forgotten inventory menu, and progression feels consistently rewarding.View image in fullscreenHistory repeating itself … Two Point Museum.Photograph: Two Point Studios/SEGAThis is easily the best-looking Two Point game yet, even the simple act of placing objects has been improved, with priceless artefacts wobbling precariously as you move them. Floors gleam with the reflections of those walking across them, shadows slant dramatically through windows, and vending machines cast an almost heavenly glow. This new lighting enhances Two Point’s signature cartoonish style, preserving its charm while elevating the spectacle. A hallmark of any great management game is empowering the player to create something that boasts form and function.“Prehistoric items have been here for thousands of years,” announces the museum’s public address system. “Same,” you may think, as you adjust the colours of your gift shop counter to match your new tiles. Yet, as you step back to admire the result, not a second feels wasted. Two Point Museum takes all the lessons from the previous games and builds on them to make a thoughtful and hugely entertaining contribution to the management sim genre.Two Point Museum is out now; £24.99Explore more on these topicsGamesSimulation gamesPCPlayStationPlayStation 5XboxSegareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also a sharp look at how the ruling classes survive social upheavalRachel AroestiWed 5 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 08.06 ESTShareFirst the Americans came for British period drama. Now the Brits are getting their mitts on Italy’s heritage. In 2020, the US producer Shonda Rhimes sexed-up Regency England with lusty intrigue, soapy storylines and orchestral covers of pop hits to create Netflix’s smash-hit Bridgerton. This year, British screenwriters Benji Walters and Richard Warlow (The Serpent) and director Tom Shankland (SAS Rogue Heroes) are collaborating with the streamer on a bit of pop cultural colonisation of their own.You can see why they would want to: The Leopard – the trio’s adaptation of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s seminal 1860s novel, set in Sicily – is sumptuous, sensuous, emotionally tempestuous and full of nice food; all qualities our homegrown costume drama tends to lack. But this sweaty, steamy series is far more than a treat for the senses. Behind the frills and the romantic thrills – at the centre of the action is a captivating young love triangle – is a socio-historically insightful tale of an elite clan’s descent into obsolescence.The eponymous Leopard is Don Fabrizio, the Prince of Salina, who got his nickname from the big cat on his family crest. Played by a whiskered Kim Rossi Stuart (the cast is Italian and the show is subtitled), the prince must reluctantly adapt to survive after Garibaldi’s redshirt army wrests control of Sicily from the House of Bourbon (try not to think about biscuits) as part of their quest to unify Italy. Fabrizio is – obviously – against the revolution; he fears for the safety of his family and the erosion of his wealth and influence. Yet his beloved nephew Tancredi isn’t so shortsighted. He joins the redshirts, not just because he’s a daredevil – he can see which way the wind is blowing. “If we want everything to stay as it is,” he tells his baffled uncle, “then everything must change.”View image in fullscreenFrills and thrills … Deva Cassel as Angelica in The Leopard.Photograph: Lucia Iuorio/APThe Leopard is a meditation on mortality. Fabrizio realises he is ageing out of relevance just as his way of life is becoming a thing of the past. The regime change does not spell annihilation for the nobility, but does require them to learn a different kind of dance: collaboration with the new proletarian overlords and the burgeoning middle class. Until now, our protagonist has been the last word in male, moneyed privilege. His entitlement means he thinks little of having his priest accompany him on a trip to visit his lover (challenged on his infidelity, his excuse is that he has never seen his pious wife’s navel) but all of a sudden he has to sweet talk some upstart colonel in order to visit his country pile. The crumbling of status and power is one of fiction’s most compelling archetypes, and The Leopard elicits its hypnotic combination of schadenfreude and sympathy.That country pile is the site of the show’s other major storyline. Tancredi has been kind-of courting his cousin Concetta, Fabrizio’s wholesome and besotted daughter. But soon there is a rival for his affections in the form of the newly wealthy mayor’s daughter, Angelica (Deva Cassel, daughter of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), who seems to have been bred for the task of seducing him.Before The Leopard was a six-part Netflix show, it was a three-hour film starring Burt Lancaster, released five years after the novel was posthumously published in 1958. On paper, the two are not that different; there are many overlaps between dialogue and scenes. Rossi Stuart’s prince is colder but less cruel, funny and pervy than Lancaster’s, while Saul Nanni’s Tancredi somehow rivals Alain Delon for renegade heart-throb status. In fact, this cast has a notable advantage: Rossi Stuart and Nanni are both Italian; in what must have been a confusing shoot, Lancaster spoke his lines in English while Delon spoke French, then both were dubbed in Italian.Yet Luchino Visconti’s movie was also steeped in a magical strangeness: a gothic gloom, a frenzy to the family’s Catholicism and a dangerously febrile feeling courses through every scene. The film’s stunning arrangement of bodies is a sight to behold, whether on Palermo’s city centre turned battlefield or the dancefloor in its famous 45-minute ballroom scene. Despite all its aesthetic loveliness, this new Leopard feels visually prosaic in comparison; a pretty streaming series rather than a veritable work of art.The advantage is that this version is more coherent and watchable, without ever being sugary or simplistic. The great story is intact, posing its evergreen questions – when it comes to tradition, where is the line between evolution and extinction? When it comes to power, where does pragmatism bleed into surrender? – for a new audience. The Leopard’s sultry good looks will make you swoon, but this beady-eyed examination of how the ruling classes navigate regime change has plenty of substance too.The Leopard is on Netflix now.This article was amended on 5 March 2025 to correct the spelling of Richard Warlow’s surname.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDramaDrama filmsNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

When Shakespeare set his characters a challenge in his early comedy, he measured it out in years. In a bid to lead a life of contemplative study, the king of Navarre persuades his friends to join him in a three-year regime of abstemiousness, requiring them to renounce women and cut back on food and sleep.Now, by contrast, playwrights Elizabeth Godber and Nick Lane have revisited the material but cut the pledge down. Their young men have to last a whole three days.For a show opening at the start of Lent, that seems pretty feeble, although, to be fair, the context has also changed. Berowne (Thomas Cotran), Long-Dumain (Linford Johnson) and Ferdy (Timothy Adam Lucas) agree to avoid the company of women not just anywhere, but in Ibiza, the throbbing heart of 1990s hedonism. For every other party of lads flying out of Manchester airport, meeting women is the point.View image in fullscreenA feeble challenge … Timothy Adam Lucas in Love’s Labour’s Lost (More or Less).Photograph: Patch DolanReturning to the blueprint of 2023’sThe Comedy of Errors (More or Less), a jokey rehash of Shakespeare with a pop-song setting, the writers have reunited with director Paul Robinson to put Love’s Labour’s Lost in the decade of Blur, the Spice Girls and Pete Tong atManumission.This one is even less reverent than the last, not only substituting almost the entire script for modern-day urban poetry, but also beefing up the women’s roles to make them equal partners with the men. Alice Imelda, Annie Kirkman, Alyce Liburd and Jo Patmore rise gutsily to the occasion. They are now on a mixed-up stag-and-hen weekend (with additional hired-assassin subplot), while a lovelorn Armado (David Kirkbride) is the Sun Park holiday resort’s resident pill supplier.So far so flippant, but is it irreverent enough? A truly modern comedy on this subject, apart from being an hour shorter, would have made more of the island’s temptations. To be puritanical in Ibiza would take some doing. Resisting would be funny. But by clinging on to Shakespeare’s plot, Godber and Lane minimise the men’s dilemma. The comic stakes are too low.Still, the audience delights in the old songs, dance routines and outrageous Cher costumes, not to mention the energetic silliness of it all.AtShakespeare North Playhouse, Prescot, until 22 March, then atStephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, 27 March-19 April.Explore more on these topicsTheatreComedyWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

The name is apt; it’s the time of the Dust Bowl, when the Great Plains states of the US suffered drought and colossal dust storms that blighted agriculture and turned a generation of farmers into climate refugees.The book has four protagonists, all with some connection to uncanny powers. The Antidote of the title is a “prairie witch” with the ability to take away people’s unwanted memories and hold them against the day the owner is ready to remember. Harp Oletsky is a farmer who finds his land is miraculously spared from the catastrophic “Black Sunday” dust storm; in its wake, the sky is blue over his fields alone, and they fill with healthy wheat. His teenage niece, Dell, is dealing with the murder of her mother by obsessively playing basketball and apprenticing herself to the Antidote as a trainee witch. Cleo Allfrey is a black photographer, sent to Nebraska by the New Deal’s Resettlement Administration to document the suffering of farmers. She buys a camera in a local pawn shop that turns out to have uncanny powers of its own: its photographs show scenes from potential futures and forgotten pasts. The novel also has brief sections from the perspectives of a haunted scarecrow and a stray cat.The great theme of The Antidote is deliberate amnesia – particularly that of white people about the ethnic cleansing of Native peoples that set the stage for the Dust Bowl. Under the care of the Pawnee, these prairies were lush, vibrantly living places, with crops and agricultural practices adapted to regional drought cycles; after the massacres and forced relocations that removed them, the topsoil has risen into the air as a vicious ghost that burns the eyes and lungs. Since this is magical realism, the storms aren’t just a physical consequence, but a haunting, a supernatural judgment on the people who inherited the fruits of a genocide. To heal, the community must first remember. The Antidote and Cleo Allfrey, with her haunted camera, are well positioned to kickstart this process.The most salient quality of The Antidote is the beauty and power of Russell’s writing, especially in documenting horrors. Here is a jack drive, where rabbits are driven into an enclosure to be slaughtered as pests: “The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down … Grey skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats … Quiet comes at last. The men’s arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears … Inside of you, the screaming continues.” The book also abounds in small delights such as, “Poor guitar! I sometimes stared, with sympathy, at the shocked hole in its centre,” or this description of trying to silence a guilty conscience: “The thought was like a loose knot I had to keep retying.”There are, however, two weaknesses that rob the book of much of its potential power. First, the plot is frustratingly scattered. Developments that initially seem crucial are left with no resolution; a narrative about the string of murders that included the killing of Dell’s mother is especially odd, as we’re asked to just stop caring about it midway through the book. Many scenes are devoted to Dell’s basketball career, while the crimes against Natives on which the story turns happen entirely off stage. Through this, Russell is easily good enough to keep us engaged. No writer, however, could be good enough to make it a feature and not a bug.The Antidote is clearly the work of a writer with prodigious gifts – but one who has bitten off more than she can chewSecond, Russell’s narrators seem more like 21st-century liberals than rural citizens of 1930s Nebraska. The white protagonists start out anti-racist, then go through an awakening that has them devoting their lives to atoning for their historical complicity in genocide. Meanwhile, they never worry about feeding themselves, though it’s unclear how this is possible for the Oletskies, since Harp is a no-yield farmer with huge debts to the bank, and his new miracle crop hasn’t yet been sold. Some elements feel jarringly anachronistic: Dell plays on an integrated girls’ basketball team, and when she falls in love with a teammate, she understands and embraces what she’s feeling without any panic or dissonance about the implications of being gay. There is no sense that Cleo Allfrey’s status as a black female photographer makes her an almost unbelievable exception to every rule. She also never seems culturally black, which, in the heavily segregated 1930s, calls for an explanation that is never forthcoming. While such fudging of history can work in some contexts (Bridgerton being an obvious example), it feels inappropriate in a work of political fiction about the moral imperative to accurately remember the past even when it makes us uncomfortable.The Antidote is clearly the work of a writer with prodigious gifts. But every novelist with a long enough career will ultimately produce a book where they’ve bitten off more than they can chew, or chewed and swallowed something they should have spat out. Despite The Antidote’s laudable ambitions and interesting conception, I’m afraid, for Russell, this is that book.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Using the actor’s own home movie footage, shot on lovely 16mm, plus new interviews with those close to him, including director Paul Verhoeven, actor Whoopi Goldberg, and his second wife Ineke ten Kate, a portrait emerges of a talented no-bullshit actor who fell slightly short of his potential due to Hollywood not being sure quite what to do with him. To be honest, that’s more or less what most people who are aware of Hauer thought of him already, so it’s not the case that this adds all that much to the narrative.The home movie archive is previously unseen, and there’s a nostalgic pleasure to seeing beautiful grainy footage of a young Hauer (what the famously private actor would have thought of this archive being made public remains a slightly uninterrogated question). The film is thematically strongest in interviews with frequent collaborator Verhoeven, who is both one of the key factors that ensured Hauer broke through in the first place, and, according to a remorseful Verhoeven, a part of the reason he never became bigger. The sticking point was their 1985 collaboration Flesh and Blood, which Verhoeven admits that Hauer participated in against his better judgment, having decided after a positive experience on Richard Donner’s Ladyhawke that he would rather play heroes than the villains who made his name. Verhoeven insisted Hauer honour their partnership, but appears to regret that decision now.Whether all this is of much interest to anyone who isn’t already a locked-on fan of the actor is debatable, and if you are a diehard Hauer expert, there’s probably not much here that you hadn’t already guessed or intuited. There’s very little opening out to draw any wider conclusions about the industry or acting in general, and fair enough, but it does mean that the overall sense of the film is that it’s more of a curio aimed at those who simply can’t get enough Hauer, than something that a wider audience could get a lot out of. It’s a shame as something really interesting could have been done with the archive, but what’s emerged is a bit of a DVD extra.Like Tears in Rain is on Viaplay from 10 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsRutger HauerreviewsShareReuse this content"

One wild rumour that circulated on social media suggested Ek’s eagerness to divest himself of stock in the company he founded was linked to the imminent publication of Liz Pelly’s book Mood Machine, as if Ek feared the revelations contained within it would adversely affect the share price. That was obviously a fanciful notion. Ek started cashing out Spotify shares in July 2023, and has continued doing so into 2025. At the time of his last transaction, a month after Pelly’s book was published in the US, Spotify’s share price was at an all-time high.And yet, you can see how people who had a preview of Mood Machine’s contents might get that idea into their head. It may be the most depressing and enraging book about music published this year, a thoroughly convincing argument that Spotify’s success has had a disastrous effect on pop music. Pelly also alleges a catalogue of alarming corporate behaviour, indicative of a company that, one former employee suggests, has “completely lost its moral centre”.The question is whether it ever had one to start with. The favoured origin story around Spotify’s founding involves Ek, a Swedish tech millionaire and “music nerd”, electing to save the industry from the scourge of online piracy by providing an alternative: an all-you-can-eat buffet of music on demand for a small monthly fee. Pelly suggests this is basically tripe. Ek’s speciality was in selling online advertising: his big idea was that some kind of streaming service would be a good way to do it. In its initial iteration, Spotify wasn’t even specifically intended as a music provider: the concept was to stream movies, until Ek and his co-founders realised that the size of the digital files involved was prohibitive. The picture that emerges is not of a munificent fan but a very different and familiar archetype: the guy who’s good with computers and neither understands, nor places any value on art.The more beige your sound, the more likely it was to find a place on a Spotify playlist and earn some cashCertainly, Spotify seems to have gone out of its way to denude musicians of earnings. Major labels were paid enormous advances to license their catalogues to the service, with no obligation to share any of the money with the people who had actually made the music. Spotify’s system of royalty payments is both byzantine and patently unfair. Artists aren’t paid simply by the number of streams their songs achieve, but by the percentage of total streams they account for in each country: not for your work, but how well your work is doing compared with that of a handful of megastars. One of Pelly’s interviewees calls it “forced consolidation”: not everyone who makes music wants to compete with Ed Sheeran, but this is a world in which you’re automatically obliged to do so. If you’re willing to forgo a further percentage of your earnings, then there’s Spotify Discovery, which adjusts the app’s much-vaunted algorithm to promote artists who accept a reduced royalty rate.Meanwhile, in the early 2010s, the company shifted its focus from “music enthusiasts” to what it calls “lean-back consumers”, effectively the kind of people who would once have turned the radio on in the morning and left it burbling in the background all day. The purpose of the playlists it designed to target them – “chill vibes”, “mellow morning”, “mood-booster” – was, and is, to provide unobtrusive background noise or, as Pelly suggests, a latter-day equivalent to muzak: nothing striking, unusual, out-of-the-ordinary, or indeed any of the things one might reasonably want music to be. The message that quickly filtered through to artists was that the more beige your sound, the more likely it was to find a place on a Spotify playlist and earn some cash. Hence the rise of a homogeneous genre dubbed “Spotifycore”, which you’ve doubtless heard even if the term seems unfamiliar. It’s a bit ambient, a bit electronic, a bit folky, a bit indie, a nonspecific wish-wash possessed only of a vague wistfulness, the sonic equivalent of a CBD gummy: music “for any place, for anyone”, as one producer put it, that ends up being “music for no place, for no one”.Spotify encouraged it, developing an “optimisation tool” called Spotify4Artists that urged musicians to examine the data, see what is doing well and tailor their music to be more like that. Given how hard it is for musicians to make a living in the 21st century, you can understand the pressure on artists to join this particular race to the bottom. “To be sustainable,” says one indie record label executive dolefully, “you have to put out records that are going to get repeat listens in coffee shops.”UK music sales hit record high as Taylor Swift tops album sellersRead moreBut there was more bad news for those that did. If you were dealing in music for no place and no one, it might as well be made by nobody. Spotify started buying in what it calls PFC, or “perfect fit content” – blandly nondescript “stock” tracks from companies that specialise in background music, made by session musicians paid a flat fee to crank out dozens of tracks at a time – and packing its playlists with them. PFC, usually hidden behind fake artist names and made-up biographies,proliferatedthrough official Spotify playlists. The company has dissociated itself from direct involvement in PFC, stating “we do not and never have created ‘fake’ artists and put them on Spotify playlists”. It remains a secretive world and Pelly gets almost nowhere investigating it, although she does track down some of the musicians involved: grateful for the cheque and frank about the “brain numbing … joyless” experience of battery-farming music “as milquetoast as possible”.It’s a relentlessly miserable story that one suspects will get more miserable still. The rise of AI presumably means that even the faceless session musicians will soon be out of a gig. Pelly reports that Spotify has experimented with an idea called Soundscape, an endless AI-generated “personalised” ambient stream (though the product has been put on “indefinite hiatus”). Its dream seems to be a world of entirely passive consumers who don’t choose what they listen to, but simply press play and let Spotify choose for them.She ends by attempting to suggest alternative futures – in which consumers switch to small, cooperative streaming services run by musicians, or go out of their way to buy direct from artists, replicating the “indie” economy of small labels and DIY gigs that once supported leftfield musicians – but her worthy ideas feel like sticking plasters on a gaping wound.Streaming now accounts for 85% of the music market in the UK: Spotify is the market leader, with the sharpest practices, but, as Pelly notes, its competitors aren’t much better. One suspects that for most consumers, Spotify’s convenience – and itisconvenient – trumps whatever damage its rise has inflicted on music and musicians thus far, which means it’s only going to get bigger and more powerful. What that means for music and musicians going forward remains to be seen, but Mood Machine doesn’t leave you filled with optimism for the future.Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly is published by Hodder & Stoughton (£22).

But the excellent acting and bravura set pieces make it a crowd-pleasing watchLucy ManganWed 5 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 5 Mar 2025 02.02 ESTShareFor those of you who like to keep count, Daredevil: Born Again is the 13th small-screen series under the aegis of the Marvel Television team (Agatha All Alonglast year was the 11th, and the 12th, the animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, launched a few weeks ago). For those of you who like to go more by what it feels like, it is number 872.So what do we have here? Well, it’s a revival/reboot/continuation of the Daredevil series that ran on Netflix for three seasons from 2015-2018. There were rumours that it began life as a comedy but was reshot to bring it more in line with fans’ expectations for a series about one of the MCU’s grittier characters. Let the online historians debate it all in a multiverse of furious threads while the rest of us get on with watching the actual show.We open with a bravura set piece involving most of the people you’d expect. Lawyer Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) AKA the vigilante superhero (Murdock was blinded in a childhood accident and developed heightened senses as a result) Daredevil is attending the retirement party of NYPD cop Cherry (Clark Johnson – revered for ever by those of us who remember his woefully underacknowledged performance as Det Meldrick Lewis inHomicide: Life on the Street) with his friends Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll). And, it suddenly turns out, his non-arch nemesis Benjamin “Dex” Poindexter, whose experimental spinal surgery at the end of the original series has rendered him literally fighting fit once more. After a brutal fight, a fall (or push) and a death, we cut to a year later to introduce the rest of the cast and start the devilry proper.Wilson Fisk (the returning Vincent D’Onofrio in an uncharacteristically unmannered performance as the crime lord, known as Kingpin, and most-arch nemesis of Daredevil) is back in town after a long absence. During this time, his wife, Vanessa (Ayelet Zurer), has run his empire with ever-greater efficiency and profit. She is not best pleased when her husband decides that now is the time to go legit and start accruing power instead of merely money. He runs for mayor of New York City and despite being a renowned wrong ‘un, he knows how to command a camera and whip up a media storm. People warm to his straight-talking ways and the simple solutions he seems to offer to all the city’s problems and ignore the various problematic aspects of his temperament and career and elect him. Imagine! I do sometimes wonder if Donald Trump isn’t a crisis actor deployed by desperate screenwriters to make even the most basic villain now seem a precision-tooled response to Our Troubled Times. This creeping suspicion is not helped by the many scenes of an internet reporter played by Genneya Walton vox-popping people on the street and them espousing polarised opinions on whether Fisk’s hardline anti-vigilantism message is good or bad for the city/America.Meanwhile, Murdock is having a crisis of conscience – are vigilantes good for the city/America? Or bad? – and trying to keep to the day job as a defence lawyer, with Cherry as his private investigator and much work for the common good to do. But the lines between heroic attorney work and vigilante violence begin to blur as Murdock must first find then save the sole witness to a bad cop beatdown of an informant. In the meantime, Kingpin is gathering kompromat on the commissioner of police to smooth his passage to power and, goodness me, isn’t keeping right from wrong difficult, whatever part of a multiverse you’re in?Murdock and Fisk – or Cox and D’Onofrio if you prefer – are great in key scenes together, the former fleet and dancing, the latter giving off a dark, heavy energy that has you backing away from the screen as you watch. This, the action sequences and the distribution of such superficially stirring lines as “I was raised to believe in grace and retribution” will certainly be enough to keep viewers happy, as will – surely – the return of Jon Bernthal as Frank “The Punisher” Castle. Whether the MCU team has done enough to take the comic adaptation crown from its current holder, DC’s dark, clever, critically acclaimedratings smash The Penguin, however, remains to be seen. And, of course, the wider question of how much IP exploitation a franchise can manage without collapsing under the weight of its own lore and Sacred Timeline becomes ever more pressing.Daredevil: Born Again is on Disney+ nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMarvelreviewsShareReuse this content"

Millie-Jean Black (Tamara Lawrance) grew up in Jamaica, until her abusive mother sent her to live in London. News of her beloved brother’s death sends Millie on a personal mission to become an ace Scotland Yard detective. But when her mother also dies, a discovery in her papers compels Millie to return to Jamaica and join Kingston’s police force. She is put on the case of a missing girl with partner Curtis (Gershwyn Eustache Jr), when Scotland Yard inspector Luke Holborn (Joe Dempsie) arrives with his own agenda. There’s plenty of action, but the personal conflicts with her past will keep you gripped, too.Hollie RichardsonRishi Sunak: Lessons from Downing Street7pm, BBC TwoA man who, it could be said, never looked comfortable as prime minister and has been swiftly forgotten returns for a two-part interview with Nick Robinson. Sunak, who has a new job in the US alongside his seat in the Commons, could be entertaining and enlightening. He certainly has nothing to lose by spilling some tea. .Jack SealeA Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story9pm, ITV1In 1955, nightclub host Ruth Ellis was the last woman in the UK to be hanged, after shooting dead her abusive lover David Blakely (Laurie Davidson) in north London.

There’s a flintlock pistol in his belt and he’s dressed in tattered rags. Is it a tribute to locals who survived a night out in Kirkcaldy? No, there is a weathered plaque that I can just read: “In memory of Alexander Selkirk, mariner, the original of Robinson Crusoe …”Fife walkThis is the site of a cottage where Selkirk was born in 1676. And suddenly a long-forgotten melody starts to play in my head, asweeping lyrical tunethat I haven’t heard in half a century. It’s shocking to discover what treasure lies forgotten between my ears, this being the theme from The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, a German television series that was aired in the UK at the time of the Apollo 11 moon landings (and repeatedly until 1982). From the moment I saw it, I gave up plans to be an astronaut and decided to travel the world instead.And now here I am back where it all began for Selkirk/Crusoe in Lower Largo in Fife. What is he looking at across the Firth of Forth? Perhaps it’s the Isle of May, now a national nature reserve, or Bass Rock lighthouse where I went aged five on my first ever sea voyage, little suspecting that my hero was staring across the waves towards me.View image in fullscreenThe home in Lower Largo of Alexander Selkirk, inspiration for Robinson Crusoe.Photograph: Stephen Bridger/AlamyI am about to start out on a four-day section of theFife coastal path, a 116-mile route that connects the firths of Forth and Tay and takes in some of Scotland’s finest seaside villages. It is also one part of theBeach of Dreams, a UK-wide coastal arts festival taking place from 1 May- June.Leaving Mr Selkirk behind, I set out around a broad bay where the tide is retreating, bringing vast numbers of wading birds to feed on the exposed patches of sand. One of the joys of this walk, I am about to discover, is how the marine life subtly shifts and changes with each day. Here I’ve got great piles of razor clam shells and limpets, tomorrow will be yellow periwinkles, cockles and mussels.Past the wooded point and a fine field of kale perched on a cliff, I come to one of the highlights: theElie Chain Walkat Kincraig Point. No one seems quite sure how this unusual, and adventurous, coastal feature started, but now there are eight shiny steel chains to help any nimble person clamber down, across and up the jagged coastal cliffs. It should only be done around low tide and, be warned, one chain is rather short and attached to a wobbly bolt. The reward is access to a secret world of crashing waves, sea arches and mysterious caves.Beyond lies the village of Elie, a beguiling mix of ancient stone houses and fun: there are foil surfers out on the water and abeachside saunawith a curl of wood smoke emerging from the chimney. I book myself in. There is also an excellent pub, theShip Inn, famed for hosting cricket matches on the sands.At the sauna, I meet Judith Dunlop who kickstarted the hot box (portable sauna) on the beach idea around here, siting a converted horse trailer in her home town of Elie. Now she has two further locations up the coast andcompetitorstoo. It is possible, I calculate, to walk most days and finish, or start, with a dip in the sea and a sauna.View image in fullscreenWalkers tackle the Elie Chain Walk.Photograph: Richard Newton/AlamyNext day, I press on through the fishing villages of St Monans and Pittenweem (good cafe stops available atBowhouseandCocoa Tree) to meet artistJulie Brookat Anstruther. Julie wants to take me to see the location of an artwork called Tide Line that she is soon to begin building. Along with several other commissioned artworks around the UK, it will be a feature of the Beach of Dreams festival.Anstruther itself is a hive of activity and well worth exploring. By the recently refurbishedDreel Halls, a historic church and town hall, there are two shell houses, buildings rendered with millions of sea shells.Anstruther connects to another fishing village, Cellardyke, where there is a fine tidalswimming pool(and a sauna), and about a mile further along Julie points across the rocky inter-tidal zone, now being exposed by the retreating sea. “We’ll build it in there, a pathway that leads out into an area that is normally too slippery and hazardous for most people.”I can imagine a youthful Alexander Selkirk, dabbling his bare toes in the waves and dreaming of escapeWork will be carefully timed, ending each day with the arrival of the sea. We wander out and Julie is immediately assessing certain rocks for their possibilities. “It’s amazing what can be done with levers and human strength – I think I might build a causeway across that pool and skirt that outcrop.”Her enthusiasm and vision are infectious. I want to get started immediately. “Will you bring the path back to land over there?” I ask, ever practical. A path must lead somewhere.But Julie shakes her head. “No. It will end in the sea.” That’s the artist. A path can go nowhere, and still mean something. I can imagine a youthful Alexander Selkirk standing on the last stone, dabbling his bare toes in the waves and dreaming of escape.View image in fullscreenIt’s possible to finish each day’s walk with a sauna, like the one at Elie beach, made from a converted horse box.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyEventually, I say goodbye to Julie and head along the coast, reaching the pretty harbour of Crail and a hot bowl of soup in the Harbour gallery and tearoom. After an uninspiring yomp through a holiday park, I’m soon back to wild rugged rocks and the mournful keening of curlews. There are some great tidal pool dips to be had, but now I’m sauna-adapted, I can’t face it. Around the point of Fife Ness, the coastal scenery changes subtly again. The drifts of sea shells are covered in kelp, testament to the power of the north-easterly gales.At Kingsbarns I enjoy dinner at theInn, a short walk up from Cambo Sands beach – where there is yet another lovely sauna. The Inn is a successful example of a community-enterprise, well-run and friendly with good food and rooms.My final walk takes me into St Andrews for a last sauna at East Sands with a sociable crowd of locals. A British sauna culture seems to be emerging: chattier than the Germans, hotter than the Scandinavians, and definitely not naked. I wonder what Selkirk would have made of it. In 1709, when he was finally rescued from his Pacific island after over four years, his rescuer, Captain Woodes Rogers, noted: “How much a plain and temperate way of living conduces to the Health of the Body and the Vigour of the Mind … one may see that Solitude and Retirement from the World is not such an insufferable state of life.” Once back in Scotland, Selkirk missed his lonely island, but found a spot that reminded him of it: at Kincraig Point where the Elie Chain Walk now exists.Further information atVisit Scotland.Sawdaysoffers accommodation along the route of the walk atThe Crusoe in Lower Largo(from£123),the Ship Innin Elie (from£100) andMaybell Cottagein Pittenweem (from£175).Inn at Kingsbarnshas doubles from £175.

It’s a dish that originates from the royal kitchens of the Begum of Bhopal in the 19th century and, as such, has always been a bit of a culinary statement – both a creative experiment and a showcase of refined taste, though, despite its unusual spice profile, the method is simple and unpretentious. The moreish crunch of the cabbage side, meanwhile, lifted by crisp cashews and warming spices, balances the chicken’s tangy richness beautifully.Acharimurgh, or north Indian chicken curry (pictured top)Prep10 minCook1 hr 30 minServes66 tbsp vegetable oil1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced¼ tsp each fennel, black mustard, nigella and cumin seeds⅛ tsp fenugreek seeds1 tsp garlic paste1 tbsp ginger paste1kg skinless chicken thighs on the bone½ tsp ground turmeric1 tsp ground coriander½ tsp kashmiri red chilli powder1kg plain yoghurt1 tsp salt(or to taste)1 fresh green chilli, slit lengthways down the middle, plus a little extra green chilli, chopped, to garnish1 handful chopped coriander leavesPut the oil in a deep saucepan on a high heat. Test it’s hot enough by dropping in a piece of onion – if it sizzles immediately, the oil is ready. Add all the onion, fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until golden brown, then lift out with a slotted spoon and spread on a plate to cool.Add all the spice seeds to the hot oil in the pan, then, once the mustard seeds pop, stir in garlic and ginger pastes, and cook for 30 seconds or so, until they smell fragrant – if they start to stick to the pan, deglaze and loosen by adding a few splashes of cold water. Add the chicken thighs, fry for a few minutes on all sides, just to sear, then stir in the three ground spices.Crush the cooled caramelised onions, stir them into the yoghurt, then add to the chicken pan. Add the salt, bring to a boil, then cover and leave to simmer for 30 minutes. Uncover, add the whole slit chilli and cook, stirring, for another 30 minutes, until the sauce is really clinging to the meat.Adjust the seasoning to taste, garnish with the chopped chilli and coriander, and serve with riceor rotis, salad and the following cabbage stir-fry.Cabbage with tomatoes and cashewsView image in fullscreenAsma Khan’s cabbage with tomatoes and cashews.This versatile dish pairs beautifully with rice or flatbreads, adds a satisfying texture to all kinds of wraps and works very well as an all vegetable side, too.Prep10 minCook40 minServes64 tbsp vegetable oil150g raw cashews2 dried red chillies1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp ground turmeric400g tinned chopped tomatoes, or 3–4 fresh tomatoes, chopped½ tsp chilli powder1½ tsp salt750g white cabbage,trimmed and shredded2 tbsp fresh dill, or other fresh herbs, chopped, to garnishPut the oil in a wok or deep pan over a medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the cashews, stir-fry until lightly browned all over, then lift out with a slotted spoon (discard any burnt nuts, because they’ll be unpleasantly bitter).Reheat the oil in the pan over a medium heat, then add the dried chillies and cumin seeds, and stir until the chillies darken. Add the turmeric, then stir in the tomatoes, chilli powder and salt. Turn down the heat to medium-low and leave to cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the oil separates at the edges of the tomato mixture.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Add the shredded cabbage, mixing it in so it gets coated with the spiced tomatoes, then turn up the heat to medium-high, cover the pan and cook for four to five minutes if the cabbage is finely shredded, and for six to eight minutes for thicker slices. Take off the lid, then stir-fry for two minutes more.Check the seasoning, then stir in the roasted cashews, garnish with the chopped dill and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Monsoon: Delicious Indian Recipes for Every Day and Season, by Asma Khan, published on 6 March by DK RED at £26.
