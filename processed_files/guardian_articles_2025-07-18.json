It has also left some in the TV world wondering if the show requires a wider refresh.Before a long-waited report on the allegations over his behaviour, Wallace’s five-page post included an admission he had used inappropriate language, but he claimed to have been “cleared of the most serious and sensational accusations”. He also revealed a recent autism diagnosis and complained offacing an “incredible injustice”.Report on Gregg Wallace’s behaviour upholds 45 claims against ex-BBC presenterRead moreAt Banijay’s dinner, its boss, Patrick Holland, made no attempt to dodge Wallace’s outburst, instead emphasising the amount of work that had gone into the lawyer-led report. As they made small talk over the crab salad, his executives already knew the show was about to be plunged into deeper peril.Wallace’s fellow presenter, John Torode, was also the subject of a substantiated complaint in the report. He wasn’t named, but given the furore it seemed unlikely his identity would be kept under wraps for long.When the report finally arrived on Monday,it substantiated 45 allegations against Wallace. Meanwhile, Torode opted to reveal he was the subject of a substantiated complaint overthe use of racist language, which he believes never happened.Richard Osman, whose House of Games show is part of the Banijay stable, said on his The Rest Is Entertainment podcast this week that Torode had been accused of using “the worst racial slur there is”. The Sun reported Torode used the word when he repeated lyrics from Kanye West’s track Gold Digger at an after-work gathering six or seven years ago. He denies the incident took place.BBC bosses concluded Wallace could not change his behaviour and wrote to him telling him so. Banijay and theBBCopted not to renew Torode’s contract. However, Torode will continue to be something of a spectre at the feast for the rest of the year, having already filmed Christmas specials.“It’s been a complete mess,” said the TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan. “This is a show which features judges reviewing food. How could it result in the loss of two presenters from a really big, well-known programme so quickly? To lose one presenter is bad enough. To lose two this quickly feels shocking and surprising.“Particularly in light of everything that’s happened, this is an opportunity for both the BBC and Banijay to wipe the slate clean. When a show starts with a new lineup of presenters, it does attract new audiences who would want the show to feel fresh.”A mess it may be, but the overwhelming feeling in the television world is that even such a high-profile crisis will not dislodge the show’s status as a broadcasting behemoth.View image in fullscreenGrace Dent, who became a judge on Celebrity MasterChef alongside John Torode, is one of a pool of potential presenters who could replace him on the main show.Photograph: BBC/PAThe safety of its long-term status is down to its undimmed appeal, producing multiple new adaptations every year even after three decades. Four new versions were launched globally in 2024, according to analysis by K7 Media, with 25 existing versions returning to screens last year. There have so far been more than 60 versions of the show launched globally. It is a major money-spinner, even spawning its own line of kitchenware.For the BBC, meanwhile, it is a cornerstone of traditional schedules. In any given week, it is more likely than not that some version of the show is on the airwaves. As a result, the appetite for doing something radical – either a break or an overhaul – is low.Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, has already thrown his weight behind the show – the corporation is tied to production until 2028. It has also invested in moving production to Birmingham, where it is now filmed in the old Banana Warehouse building in Digbeth. The move has helped its claims to be driving jobs out of London, something the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, is watching closely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saturday Kitchen Live’s Matt Tebbutt is regarded as a frontrunner for one of the roles.View image in fullscreenThe BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, is backing the show, which will stay in production until 2028.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersIf the long-term future of the show looks safe enough, the BBC is still left with a knotty short-term problem. The latest series of MasterChefhas been delivered, but not shown. Wallace appears in all of it apart from the final – Torode appears throughout.The BBC has already been speaking to contestants about what to do with the series. Davie is very keen to press ahead, given the effort they have put in. Figures close to the show are also pushing for it to be shown, arguing the presenters have never been the core of the title.“The programme is filled with warmth, support and leaves a legacy of life-changing proportions for the contestants,” said one. “The headlines really don’t share the love that there is across the incredible team and family of winners and finalists who adore and care passionately about what they do.”There could be one last unwelcome flurry before things improve for MasterChef’s makers. Comments from Wallace’s social media missive that began the barrage of bad news still hang over them. He made it clear he “will not go quietly”.While an updated post from Wallace no longer includes those remarks, both Banijay and the BBC are braced for a further media outing from one or both of their former presenters.Perhaps at that point they can once again focus on the programme’s strengths. As one despairing and perplexed MasterChef insider observed at the end of a bruising fortnight: “The star of the show was always the food.”Explore more on these topicsMasterChefGregg WallaceBBCTelevisionFood TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now we know whyMargaret SullivanThe president is reportedly ‘on a warpath’ over a story in the Wall Street Journal – controlled by Trump’s top media allyFri 18 Jul 2025 15.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 18.53 EDTShareFor days before theWall Street Journalpublished its story about Donald Trump’s salacious friendship with Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday, the president was frantically working the phones.He reportedlyput pressure on the paper’s top editor, Emma Tucker, and even Rupert Murdoch, who controls the paper’s business side, claiming that the alleged facts behind the story were nothing but a hoax, and threatening to sue the paper if it forged ahead.(Following publication of this article,Trump filed a suitagainst the paper and Murdoch.)How worked up was he? “On a fucking warpath,” one administration officialtold Rolling Stone magazine.Now that thestory has been published– appearing on the Journal’s print-edition front page, no less – and picked up everywhere, it’s easy to see what Trump was so upset about. And equally easy to see why trying snuff it out in advance became such a high priority.It’s notjustthat the 50th birthday card he reportedly penned for the future convicted child-sex offender is so damning in itself, with its bawdy sketch and references to shared secrets and “enigmas” that “never age”.It’s notjustthat Trump has been denying a tight friendship with Epstein – who died in jail in 2019 – for some time, and that this would clearly put the lie to that.It’s notjustthat he really, really wants this scandal to go away since it has been turning swaths of his normally cult-like base against him.No, there’s another element – and a brutal one for the president. It’s where the story was published: in the Wall Street Journal, whose conservative opinion side has often backed him and whose news side has a reputation for ensuring that explosive stories are bulletproof: accurate in their facts and fully prepared to stand up under legal scrutiny.What’s more, the newspaper is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s most important media ally.Murdoch’s rightwing propaganda outfit, Fox News, has been Trump’s cheerleader and alter ego for years and played a crucial role in getting him elected twice. (Fox News has been much more docile in recent days, doing Trump’s bidding by almost shutting down its reporting and commentary on Epstein and Trump.) And Murdoch’s right-leaning tabloid the New York Post tends to stand by Trump, too.The Journal is widely perceived as right of center politically, with a reputation for pin-striped rectitude. In short, they don’t make things up.When the paper has taken a big swing at exposing wrongdoing – do you remember John Carreyrou’s exposé of the blood-testing company Theranos, by any chance? – their reporting holds up.All of that made JD Vance’s complaints ring awfully hollow after the birthday card story ran.“Forgive my language, but this story is complete and utter bullshit,” Vance posted on X shortly after it published. “Does anyone honestly believe this sounds likeDonald Trump?”And it made Trump’s vehement denials and threats look absurd. Even in the Maga mind, the Journal is not the third-rate rag he tried to make it out to be.One part of Trump’s denial efforts fell hilariously flat after he claimed that it was not his style to draw sketches. (“I never wrote a picture in my life,” he claimed.) The internet was soon flooded with his signed doodles and drawings over many years.Granted, Trump has had a lot of success in recent months in his various suits against big news organizations – in particular CBS News, whose parent company, Paramount Global, recently settled a worthless case for $16m.Capitulation and cowering has run rampant. And each one of the settlements makes it easier for Trump to start the next court battle with every expectation that he’ll prevail, well before a suit ever reaches a courtroom.This, I suspect, will be quite different. A lawsuit won’t make this damning story go away.And I doubt that Trump really wants to put himself through legal discovery, with all the ugliness that might be exposed.Will this be an element of Trump’s long-awaited downfall? Few are willing to go that far, after all the scandals that have come and gone, too numerous to detail and each one regarded as the final straw.But at a time when Magaworld is finally having its doubts about their dear leader and savior, this one really hurts.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingJeffrey EpsteinWall Street JournalNewspapers & magazinesNewspaperscommentShareReuse this content"

Ageing is not easy, and “forever young” is not a plan. Regardless of how many burpees you can do or protein smoothies you chug, the passing of time brings challenges. Roles that you relished change, words on menus seem to shrink, necks sag, diagnoses arise.On the other hand, ageing is not the downhill slide that people believe it is. A multibillion-​dollar anti-ageing industry profits when you feel awful about yourself and fear ageing like the plague. The tragedy of ageing is not that we will all grow old and die, but that ageing has been made unnecessarily, and at times excruciatingly, painful and humiliating. Ageing does not have to be this way.I taught geriatric medicine and gerontology for 19 years at the University of California, Irvine school of medicine. At UCI’s senior health center, I had a front-​row seat to observe people, and their families, navigate old age. What struck me most was the radical differences in how people experienced their own ageing process. For some, it is a frustrating, degrading, painful trajectory of ever-increasing decline. For others, there is visible delight, spirituality and joy in occupying their eighth, ninth, and 10th decades.View image in fullscreen‘Joyspan, or the experience of well​being and satisfaction in longevity, matters because without it, long life is a drag.’Photograph: Cat Gwynn/Getty ImagesWhen it comes to longevity, the primary focus has been lifespan, the length of life. More recently though, the scope has expanded beyond years of life to years of life in good health, or healthspan. This is a welcome shift, because we all want to live as healthily as possible for as long as possible. But there’s a catch. A long life, even a long life in good health, doesn’t mean much if you don’t like your life. As geriatrician Dr Louise Aronson observes: “We’ve added a couple of decades, essentially an entire generation, on to our lives, and we haven’t figured out how to handle that.”To thrive in old age means to live a fulfilling, purposeful and satisfying life despite the challenges that accompany ageing. It involves maximizing physical health, cognitive function, emotional wellbeing, social connections, and a sense of meaning. Thriving doesn’t mean being free of all health problems or challenges; rather, it emphasizes resilience, adaptability and the ability to find joy and value in life. People don’t thrive in longevity by mistake or luck. People who thrive in longevity actively maximize the quality of their lives. But how?I scoured the findings of 35 years of empirical testing on psychological well​being in longevity. The deeper I dug into the findings, the more I recognized a profound underlying pattern. The hundreds of predictors found in thousands of studies on what is necessary to thrive in longevity consistently group into four essential elements.Grow:They continue to expand and explore.Connect:They put time into new and existing relationships.Adapt:They adjust to changing and challenging situations.Give:They share themselves.Each of these elements is non-negotiable for wellbeing in longevity, and you can improve in each area. What we’ve been missing is a practical vocabulary and approach to maximizing the quality of our long lives. It’s not enough to have a long lifespan and healthspan; we want what I call a long joyspan.Joyspan, or the experience of well​being and satisfaction in longevity, matters because without it, long life is a drag. The American Psychological Association defines joy as the feeling that arises from a sense of well​being or satisfaction. Experiencing joy is different from feeling happy. Happiness comes and goes and is often dependent on external circumstances. Joy can be experienced even in adverse situations.More akin to contentment than to ecstasy, joy may show up in the form of a smile, but many times it does not. You cannot always ascertain someone’s joy by observing them. One older woman looking at the trees through her window may be lonely and miserable, while a different older woman looking at the same trees may be experiencing great joy.Regardless of your current age, you hold one of two mindsets: ageing as decline or ageing as continued growth.The decline mindset believes everything gets worse as you grow older and then you die. Sadly, this mindset is the most prevalent. The growth mindset sees ageing as a time of continued progress in becoming who you are. This mindset recognizes not only the challenges and losses of growing older but also the opportunities and strengths.A nuanced approach to ageing, sex and gender | LettersRead moreTake my neighbor Dee, who is 81. A few days ago, I saw her on her front porch while I was walking the dogs, and she waved me over so she could tell me all about her sore hands, the “absolute drivel” on TV, and how bad the hot weather makes her feel. Because Dee sees her life as a downward freefall, she’s stopped showing up for it. She does not pursue her former interests, reach out to friends, or challenge herself. The long hours spent in her recliner have seriously weakened her legs, which she blames on the curse of being old.Our conversations never have room for topics beyond her discomfort. Despite our many conversations, Dee doesn’t know anything about me other than the fact that I have two golden retrievers. There isn’t any space for me to share my life, because her life, as miserable as she finds it, is the topic that dominates her mind. Dee definitely holds a decline mindset.I often run into another neighbor, Joan, who walks the same loop I do. I absolutely love it when I run into Joan. She is 82 and just radiant. Soon after our middle daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumor, I saw Joan and she noticed right away that something was off. She asked me what was going on in a way that felt safe for me to share. She listened intensely, then suggested ways to adjust to this “new normal”. Joan has had so many new normals. Always very interested in something – a new plant she’s potted, a new recipe, an interesting book, an upcoming art exhibit – Joan has a growth mindset.Growing older is about, well, growing, about becoming. Joan knows that interior strengths can continue to develop throughout life. I once told Joan how much I admire her attitude, and she laughed, saying: “I find life fascinating. I’m still growing now, just as I have in every other phase of my life.”This is an adapted excerpt fromJoyspanby Dr Kerry Burnight.

Why are you so obsessed? Yours, Donald J TrumpMarina HydeIt’s the bonfire of the Maga hats. The real mystery is where their wearers got the idea of a paedophile conspiracy from in the first placeFri 18 Jul 2025 06.53 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareYou have to feel for Donald Trump’s Maga base. The one huge secret theydidn’twant disclosed was that he actually really hates them. All populists despise their people, obviously – but please, Mr President, respect the playbook! You’re supposed to do it quietly. Regrettably, no one could accuse Trump of hiding his spite under a bushel after a week in which hedescribed those of his supporterswho want him to simply do what he repeatedly promised, and release the so-called Epstein files, as “weaklings” and “stupid people”. This is quite the (public) volte face from the guy who originally swept to office declaring “I love the poorly educated”.Most of you are unlikely to need a recap at this stage, but Jeffrey Epstein is the sex-trafficking financier and socialite, who conveniently died in jail while awaiting trial, apparently by suicide. A woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted of conspiring with him to sexually abuse minors, and is currently serving 20 years in a low-security Florida prison. But no big-hitting or even small-hitting male associate in the US has so much as been arrested for participating in what I believe the dead paedophile would have encouraged us to call his “lifestyle”. This secondTrump administrationdidn’t just sweep to power while repeatedly screaming about the “cover-up” of this story, but it spent a good portion of its early months assuring its ravenous base that Epstein’s supposed “client list” was on a desk waiting for release approval. Yet now, Trump and his associates say there is no list. Nope. Never even was a list. Where did these weakling idiots get that idea? To summarise his administration’s position: “We took a look at the deep state and it turns out to be very shallow. Seriously, I’m standing in it right now and it doesn’t even come up to my knees.”Understandably, a significant proportion of the Maga crowd are not taking this well at all. One of the key takeouts of Trump’s rise has been that as long as you tell people that up is down or black is white in an engaging or sufficiently discombobulating fashion, truth is an extremely low-status commodity in contemporary politics. But, contrary to perceived trends, it seems that there do still exist some subjects on which you can only push even your own people so far. Maybe the ancient political adage still holds true: live by the paedo conspiracy, die by the paedo conspiracy.Late on Thursday, as footage ofpeople burning Maga hatsspread online, a palpably frustrated Trumpannounced that he was instructing the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to seek release of the Epstein grand jury testimony, “based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein”. Though you’ll note the president failed to add the two key words: “by me”. Still, it’s good to hear Trump characterising what’s currently happening as “publicity”, confirming that he sees even the desire to see justice served on a suspected paedophile sex-trafficker and his associates as a form of limelight – which, like all limelight, should by rights be his.It feels harder to sustain the idea that there is nothing to see here, especially when leading wingnuts such as the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, far-right activist Laura Loomer, Fox host Laura Ingraham, talkshow queen Megyn Kelly, Maga whisperer Steve Bannon and even the US House speaker, Mike Johnson, are out there pushing the base conviction that, actually, there might well be something to see here. “It’s definitely a full reversal on what was all said beforehand,” observed Marjorie in a once-in-a-career alignment with fact, “and people are just not willing to accept it.”We have to take our laughs where we can, meanwhile, so do please consider the cavalcade of podcasters and Maga influencers who got jobs like “director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation” and “deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation” and are now discovering that life comes at you fast. FBI chief Kash Patel spent the election campaign pushing Epstein conspiracies, and is now believed to be hiding under his big important desk wetting his pants. “Listen,” his deputy, Dan Bongino, used to instruct his podcast listeners. “ThatJeffrey Epsteinstory is a big deal, please do not let that story go. Keep your eye on this.” Will do, Dan. Incidentally, a lot of people spent the weekend speculating feverishly that Bongino would sensationally quit his job – but in the end, he just came into work a bit late on Monday. What a tough guy. Make America Deep State Again!Other developments? That are perhaps not unrelated? TheWall Street Journal reportsthat Trump had served as a contributor to some kind of cursed 50th birthday scrapbook for Epstein, compiled by Maxwell, for which he’d sent a “bawdy” letter. This missive was reportedly typed inside a drawing of a naked woman’s silhouette, in which the famous Trump signature served as a kind of scribble of pubic hair. So far, so FDR. Unfortunately, particularly in the circumstances, the letter itself is said to conclude: “Happy birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Alas, the current president isnot thrilled by this report, denying it completely, adding that he has never in his life “wrote a picture”. (It goes without saying that all Donald Trump statements, always, are very much [sic].) Much more promisingly, Trump is furious with the WSJ owner, Rupert Murdoch, and threatening to “sue his ass off”. Oh please don’t, Mr President! His ass is 94 years old and incredibly wrinkled. Also, half of Britain’s political class still lives up it. Then again, perhaps Trump v Murdoch is very much the desiccated-dick-waving contest the world … wants? Needs? Will have to endure? Unclear which of those applies at this stage, but let’s hold out for the possibility that both men are wholly – and indeed literally – consumed by it.Angles-wise, however, there are already signs that the Wall Street Journal might just be the common enemy the Magas need as an off-ramp for their civil war, allowing people who are obsessed with paedophiles to find common cause both with people who don’t care about paedophiles, and also with people who may actually have been close personal friends with paedophiles. There’ll probably only be one casualty, and it’ll probably be Pam Bondi. Women are great at taking these falls. Furthermore, the whole conflagration would once more pit a billionaire president against one of his billionaire buddies – exactly the kind of better world his supporters voted for, and a true testament to how truly, truly deeply he values them.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is a humid, muggy day. “You don’t often hear people use the word ‘muggy’ now,” Morgan says, when I mention it. “How many people do you hear saying that, on a daily basis?” A pause. “Under the age of 85, I mean.”Morgan is famous for her deadpan style, which she has honed to perfection as the mockumentary hostPhilomena Cunk, and has put to use all over British TV, from the dour Liz inMotherlandto Kath in Ricky Gervais’s sitcomAfter Life, with a recent stint as the reporter Onya Doorstep inWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Over a lovely looking cheese-free salad, she admits that she is becoming more of a hippy as she gets older. “As I’m cascading towards the grave,” she laughs.View image in fullscreenComing up roses … Diane Morgan.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianMorgan is here to talk about the surreal, anarchicMandy, which she created, writes and stars in.

One of them became Mandy. Mandy first made an appearance on Craig Cash’s short-lived 2016 sitcomRovers. When the BBC asked Morgan if she had any ideas for a new comedy, Mandy staged a comeback. They filmed a 15-minute pilot, in which Mandy covets a white leather sofa, leading to a Princess Di makeover that clashes with an experimental medical trial. “I never thought they’d pick it up, and I think that’s why it was so mad,” she says. “I had the freedom to do whatever I wanted.”It went out in 2019, and was soon picked up for a full series. “I thought, fantastic, made it, and then thought, oh shit.” She was so nervous about it airing that she almost phoned the BBC and asked them to pull it. “It felt really personal, in some ways,” she explains. In the new series, Mandy vomits ice-cream on to a small child’s head and gets “rancid lamb fat” injected into her backside. How personal are we talking? “I felt like people were going to go, what the hell is that? And I’m sure a lot of people did. It’s just what I felt like doing at the time, as a reaction to all those Fleabaggy dramas.Fleabag’s brilliant, but because it was so successful, there were loads of other shows that were a bit like that.”View image in fullscreenSweet treat … Morgan as Mandy, who has tried countless different jobs – and failed at all of them.Photograph: Richard Harrison/BBCMandy is not like that. Instead, it was inspired by more grotesque physical comedies such as Bottom. “Where they’re just beating each other up repeatedly. I couldn’t think of a woman that had done that.” She wonders whether women don’t want to make themselves look disgusting. “I’ve not got a problem with that,” she laughs. “Because that’s what I want to see.”In the first proper episode, Mandy gets a job in a banana factory, squashing spiders. I think about it every time I pick up a bunch at the supermarket. “I was told that was an actual job in Bolton,” she insists. “They would hand you a mallet and if the spider ran out, you’d just clobber it. That was a job! Otherwise, what do you do? Just let them run free?”Morgan has done quite a few of the jobs that Mandy tries, it turns out. “Chip shop, telesales, Avon lady, dental nurse, packing worming tablets. All kinds of stuff. I’ve been pretty terrible at all of them.” She grew up near Bolton, and had always wanted to act, but for a while, struggled to get into drama school. At one point, she and her friend Maxine Peake decided to have elocution lessons. “We thought the reason we weren’t getting into drama school was because we were so broad,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I started doing standup, and then I started getting acting parts, and they were always miserable northerners.” It finally occurred to her that what she had been trying to suppress was exactly what people found funny. “The flat, miserable noise of my voice.”Morganhas playedPhilomena Cunk for over a decade, and in the past, she has said that the two are very similar. “Basically the same,” she nods, today. But it sounds like there’s more crossover with Mandy than you’d think. “There’s a lot of overlap there. I’m probably more like Cunk, because Mandy’s quite brazen. I haven’t got [Cunk’s] social skills, because I didn’t go to public school. She doesn’t care, whereas I do care. That’s the big difference.”She will freely admit, though, that she loves an awkward moment. “I’m completely happy in silences, as you can probably tell from Cunk. I revel in them, almost.” When she interviews experts for what looks like minutes on screen, she might have been talking to them for hours, waiting for the perfect response to the often mindless questions. “Basically, it’s an improvised conversation, because you never know when they might go, ‘what do you think?’” She has to second guess what they might say, and work out where she might take it from there. “If they completely fall into the trap I’ve set, it’s like feeding strawberries to a donkey. It’sgreat.”Philomena Cunk is unexpectedly massive in the US. “Oh my god, yeah, they love it.” Morgan has done the rounds on the late night talk shows; she got a standing ovation when she walked out on to the Stephen Colbert stage. “It sounds ridiculous, saying it,” she laughs. “I felt like one of the Beatles.” Cunk is so big on social media that people don’t always realise she’s a character from a TV show. Sometimes, when they meet Morgan, they call her “the TikTok lady”From 2016 to 2022, Morgan played Liz in the hectic parenting comedy Motherland. Have they asked her to be in its spinoff,Amandaland? “No.” She leaves one of those perfect silences. “Bit awkward,” she jokes. “No, I think it would be weird if we’d all gone back into it, and called it Amandaland. It’s a different show.” She hasn’t seen it, solely for the reason that she doesn’t watch much comedy. “It feels too close to home. I can’t switch my brain off from going, oh, I see what you did there. I just ruin it, because I can’t enjoy things.” She prefers documentaries. “I find documentaries really funny, especially ones from the 70s. There’s one that’s purely about people who have got struck by lightning. It’s just superb.”View image in fullscreenMorgan with Paul Ready, Anna Maxwell Martin, Philippa Dunne, Lucy Punch and Tanya Moodie in Motherland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/MermanSurely Philomena Cunk has ruined documentaries for everyone? “But they’re still making them, exactly the same,” she says. “They make shows and you think, this is exactly like Cunk! How can you do this?” Morgan recently appeared on the celebrity genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, which was surreal for a number of reasons. First, because Mandy had already done a spoof of it called Who Are You, Do You Think, and second, because it is full of Cunk-like documentary tropes. Morgan leans into the daftness of it, doing those long, distant walking shots, and pleading not to have to look over her shoulder for the opening credits. “My mum said to my auntie, ‘Diane’s done Who Do You Think You Are, are you going to watch it?’ And my auntie said, ‘Depends what else is on’. Swear to God.Depends what else is on. None of them give a shit. Keeps me very grounded.”Morgan loves Mandy’s 15-minute episodes. “You’re in, you’re out, you’ve got your life back. I don’t want anything that’s like, oh, this is 47 seasons and it doesn’t get going until episode 16.” But she will soon be returning to half-an-hour with Ann Droid, the new comedy she has written withSarah Kendall. A year ago, Morgan read an article about the possibility of robot carers for child-free older people in Japan. “I thought, I don’t have any kids. Shit, that’ll be me, ending up with a robot.” It made her laugh so much that they sent the idea to the BBC, who said yes. “Then we had to write it.” Worse, she has cast herself as the robot. “It didn’t occur to me that it would be difficult, over six weeks, to move like this,” she says, lifting her arms stiffly. She is currently in training with a movement coach. “I spend an hour a day, walking around the house like a robot.” I can’t believe your family don’t care about what you do, I say. “I know! They don’t ask,” she shrugs. “Not bothered.”Mandy returnson Monday21 Julyat 10pm on BBC Two.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDiane MorganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was speaking to Andy Farrell this week and I was getting goosebumps just thinking about it. Running out on to the field, the noise, the energy, the stakes – it’s completely different from anything those players will have experienced before. It’s a new chemical stimulus and in conversation with Farrell I was immediately transported back to Durban and 2009.For all the sports psychology, visualisation and every bit of preparation you can do, it’s still different. It changed the way I warmed up. I made sure I got out on to the field early just to be able to absorb it. You are not a spectator when the whistle goes, you’re not looking around thinking: “This is cool”. That’s for the fans, so I would go out early to feel it, to sense it and just get used to it.Ellis Genge primed to summon spirit of 2022 as he runs into Australia againRead moreIt’s relevant because so many of this Lions team will be sampling that atmosphere for the first time. Only Tadhg Furlong and Maro Itoje have played Lions Test matches in front of supporters. For the rest, it’s a brand-new experience but you can’t approach it as if it’s brand new. You have to own it and convert all of that energy into something that provides fuel.The Lions are heavy favourites to win the first Test and in my opinion, whoever wins this one will win the series. It’s also worth noting that the five occasions when the Lions won the first Test against Australia – in 1904, 1950, 1959, 1966 and 2013 – they’ve gone on to win the series.It’s inconceivable that anyone from the Lions camp would be talking about a 3-0 victory if this was a tour of New Zealand or South Africa but that is a demonstration of where Australian rugby is at the moment. We see it all the time during the Six Nations or during World Cups, teams fighting for the underdog status. Let’s be honest, it’s not much of a fight at the moment, it’s been gift-wrapped for Australia and understandably Joe Schmidt has leant into that somewhat.The Lions are the clear favourites and that’s a tag they’ll have to wear but I think it’s one they’ll be really comfortable with. The Lions were the favourites before we saw the squad, even bigger after the team announcements. They’re not shying away from it, there are 40,000 fans rocking up, expecting a team to win and I don’t think they’ll be disappointed.View image in fullscreenJoseph Suaalii is one of Australia’s biggest hopes for this Lions series.Photograph: Jono Searle/AAPWhen I arrived in Brisbane earlier this week, all I kept hearing at the airport was talk of whitewashing the Wallabies. While that would be a brilliant result, it’s not good for the tour. What I like as a fan is jeopardy, the level of uncertainty but before a ball has been kicked in a Test match the jeopardy is just not as high. The competition is not as strong.Australia have been on this really weird journey with Schmidt coming in this time last year, trying loads of different things in the Rugby Championship, but you could see they were building as a team. They looked to have been complete by November,they were fantastic against Englandand probably should have beaten Ireland, but six months on it feels like there’s more uncertainty.One of the fundamental aspects that the Lions have to get right is a fast start. The next thing is territory. With the half-backs for the Lions and the Wallabies, there’s a significant gap in experience there. So I expect the Lions to be able to control territory and control the pace of the game better. I think the Australians are wanting to play unstructured, to make everything frantic. I think the Lions want to keep it in structure. They’d be happy to go from set piece to set piece. They can play a quick game, particularly, with the familiarity they have at 10-12-13 but I think the Lions will look to use their structure and only break out of it when they get the right opportunities in the right areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So is Harry Potter by the way and I’m expecting a big performance from him on Saturday. The Lions will have to be careful with the depth of their kicking, too. If they kick long then the chase needs to be on point because Tom Wright at full-back is the most unheralded world-class player in rugby. If you look at the compilation of tries he scored last year, if you had that across your whole career you’d be very happy and I think he’s exceptional.Another key battleground will be the head to head between the centres. Len Ikitau and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii together are magic but I’m not sure they’ll get the same service that Sione Tuipulotu and Huw Jones will be getting to have an impact. Australia will want to break the game up and use their individual star power to be able to give them footprints into the game and that is how they increase the influence that Suaalii can have on proceedings. It feels like it’s going to be a match where pretty much everything is going to have to go right for the Wallabies, though. The Lions are comfortable wearing the favourites tag and they are going to take some stopping.Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025British & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s the challenge with politics. Everybody wants something mañana. It’s like, gotta have it immediately.”In an interview with the Guardian as MPs prepared to break for the summer recess, Rayner also said she was unafraid of Nigel Farage, that tough action against rebellious Labour MPs was “justified” and thatfixing the “awful” Send systemfor children was an urgent priority.NHS to Send: four key areas Labour wants to improve before next electionRead moreShe said it was a “moral mission” for Labour to bring down child poverty, she would feel personally wounded if the government did not hit its1.5m new homes targetand that it was determined to “break the doom loop” of low economic growth and high taxes suffered for years.However, speaking in her office in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Rayner made clear she expected her colleagues, from Keir Starmer down, to do a better job of arguing for what they believed in. “We all have to step up and make that case. It’s the job of all of us in the wider Labour movement,” she said, citing achievements such as falling NHS waiting lists, funding increases for housing and rising wages.“I often go to Labour fundraisers and joke that the Tories will do 4% of their manifesto, and then go on about that 4% as if they’ve delivered the whole lot. In our Labour movement, we’ll do 96% of it, but we’ll go on about the 4% that we never managed to achieve.“It’s a mindset that we have … We’re always thinking about what we didn’t get, as opposed to all the huge achievements that we’re making. Our whole movement is message carriers. And if we’re not going to talk about these huge achievements, then who is?”Labourhas characterisedReform UK as its main opposition at the next election, even though it has just four MPs. Rayner said they had to be “held to account” for making “wild promises” to the public they would not be able to deliver on, calling Farage a “snake oil salesman”.“Politics can make a real difference to people’s lives, but it takes time to change, to bring about that fundamental change that people are so desperate to see. That’s what this Labour government is doing,” she said. “It’s not short-termism on the back of a fag packet, on some billboard. It’s actually the fundamental reforms that will get Britain back on track … instead of people feeling at the moment like everything is broken and nothing can be fixed.”View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner in her office at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianRayner defended the decision tostrip the Labour whipfrom four “persistent” rebel MPs, even though No 10 had said it would try to improve relations with backbenchers after they forced it into a major U-turn over welfare cuts. “I think it’s justified. If you’re constantly organising against your Labour government then that’s a whipping issue for the chief whip, and that’s as old as time,” she said.But she acknowledged the government had to find ways of giving MPs “opportunities to air concerns” and be part of the collective decision-making process. Labour MPs are concerned that ministers will approach plans for children’s special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in the same way as they did changes to welfare, which were presented as a cost-saving move.But Rayner, who has two children who have been through the Send process, said the system was “awful” for parents and had to be fixed, adding that she knew the government needed to bring families, schools and MPs with them on the difficult path to change.Her own department has an additional interest because councils, which provide much of the support, were granted two further years until March 2028 to keep Send deficits off their books, giving them a strict deadline.“Can we do it in the time? We have to, because so many young people are being let down at the moment, because the system is not catching people’s needs early on. That system is awful for parents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve got to fix this. Often we’re spending huge sums of money and we’re still not delivering the outcomes for those young people.”Labour MPs are also desperate for the government to deliver on its pledge to tackle child poverty, with Starmer understood to be keen to liftthe two-child benefit capif affordable, although that has been made harder because ofthe welfare U-turn.Rayner said it was a “moral mission” and “absolutely critical” for a Labour government to bring down child poverty, but despite experts suggesting scrapping the cap would be the most cost-effective way to do so, she said there was “no single lever” to address problem.She has announced a near doubling ofgovernment spending on affordable housingin England, up to £40bn of grants over 10 years, and bringing its target to build 1.5m new homes by 2029 closer. She said she would feel wounded if the target was not hit, even though experts say it will be extremely difficult. “I would be wounded, even though it is a real stretch target. Everyone says it’s really difficult to get there, but I’m determined to,” she said.Just months after Raynerurged Rachel Reeves to consider a series of wealth tax rises, underscoring unease over the chancellor’s tight spending plans, she said the country needed to get out of the “doom loop” of low growth and high taxes it had seen under the Conservatives.While she refused to be drawn on whether it was inevitable that taxes would have to rise this autumn, when asked about her leaked memo to the chancellor, she said the country “can’t continue” as it is. “I think we will get there. But we can’t continue on this doom loop of, you know, low, low growth and high taxes, we have to find a way through this,” she added, highlighting capital investment and trade deals which both supported the economy.“That’s how you grow the economy in the long run, and where people feel better off as a result of it. That’s the turnaround that we’re doing that the previous government didn’t do, and why we’ve been in this constant doom loop.”BeforeDonald Trump’s second state visitto the UK this autumn, Rayner, who has previously called the US president “a buffoon” who had “no place in the White House”, said she respected the mandate of elected politicians but was prepared to “challenge respectfully”.A week afterUnite the trade union voted to suspend her membershipand rethink its ties with the Labour party over the Birmingham bin strikes, Rayner said that while she was proud of her trade union roots, she answered to working people and her constituents. “That’s my test.

People are running out of everything,” said Stephan Sakalian, the head of ICRC’s delegation in Syria.“Hospitals are increasingly struggling to treat the wounded and the sick, and families are unable to bury their loved ones in dignity.”The latest violence erupted on Sunday after the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant by local Bedouin triggered tit-for-tat abductions, SOHR said.The Islamist-led government sent in the army, promising to put a halt to the fighting, but witnesses and SOHR said the troops sided with the Bedouin and committed many abuses against Druze civilians as well as fighters.The interim government has had strained relations with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities since it toppled longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.This week’s fighting marks the most serious outbreak of violence since government forces battled Druze fighters in Sweida province and around Damascus in April and May, leaving more than 100 people dead.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

In his mitigation argument, he said: “It is precisely because she does not look like someone who is involved in drug dealing that she was chosen to be part of the plot.”He added: “I submit that all of these individuals are expendable, without experience and without a lot of knowledge.”Demi Bright made a single trip in August 2023 that involved 60kg of cocaine. She took her two children with her on the two-day trip, which involved an overnight stay in a hotel.Lillie Bright was involved in 20 trips involving 195kg of cocaine. Her partner Chloe Hodgkin, 23, of Abbots Walk, Wye, Kent, is awaiting the birth of her baby and is to be sentenced at a date to be set.Reggie Bright’s 12 trips as part of the gang delivered at least 90kg and there were times he collected wages for the group. He usually took trips with his partner, Demi Kendall, 31, telling her “not to get the hump because we need the money”, the court heard.Tina Golding made four trips and delivered at least 75kg of cocaine, collecting at least £10,000 in wages.Anita Slaughter took part in a single trip, which amounted to 55kg across four drops, in October 2023.Roseanne Mason, 29, of Canonbury, north London, and Demi Bright, 30, of Ashford, Kent, were each sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment.Lillie Bright, 26, of Ashford, Kent, was sentenced to 13 years, and Demi Kendall, 31, of Staplehurst, Kent, was sentenced to 13 years and six months’ imprisonment.Reggie Bright, 24, of Staplehurst, Kent, was sentenced to 15 years, and Tina Golding, 66, of Ashford, Kent, was jailed for 10 years.Slaughter, 44, of Ashford, Kent, was sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment.Acting on intelligence,Metropolitan policeofficers used investigative techniques including extensive call data and conventional surveillance to track Deborah Mason and her couriers’ movements. Most of the gang were arrested in May 2024.DC Jack Kraushaar, who led the investigation, said: “This was a sophisticated operation which was extremely profitable for those involved.“Following months of work by the Met police to relentlessly pursue these perpetrators, we were able to arrest and eventually convict them, preventing more drugs flooding streets across the UK which leads to violence, antisocial behaviour and misery for communities.”Explore more on these topicsDrugsLondonMetropolitan policePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

All were reported between 4 June and 14 July 2025.“Investigations are ongoing but evidence so far suggests the use of an unlicensed Botox-like product,” UKHSA said, noting those affected by botulism poisoning had shown symptoms including difficulty swallowing, slurred speech and breathing difficulty requiring respiratory support.What is a deep plane facelift? Nipping into the buzzy cosmetic procedureRead moreAccording to the NHS, botulism is caused by toxins produced byClostridium botulinumbacteria that attack the nervous system. A purified form of these toxins is the active ingredient in Botox and similar products that are often used for cosmetic purposes, including to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.While rare, botulism can be life-threatening. Treatment often includes the use of anti-toxins as well as interventions to support the body.Dr Gauri Godbole, the consultant medical microbiologist at UKHSA, said symptoms of the condition can take up to four weeks to develop after a Botox-like treatment, and advised anyone experiencing signs, such as difficulties swallowing, to contactNHS111 and seek treatment.While UKHSA has told medical professionals to watch out for botulism among people who have recently had the cosmetic injections, it also warned the public to take care when seeking such procedures to ensure a qualified person is carrying them out and that they are using the correct jabs.“If you are considering having a cosmetic procedure, please make sure to check that your practitioner is using a licensed product,” said Godbole, noting there is further information on how to chose a practitioner on the NHS website.Prof Meghana Pandit,co-national medical director at NHS England, added the website also provides advice on the questions to ask, including making sure the person administering the injection is appropriately trained.“When these procedures go wrong, there is a risk of serious infections and permanent scarring, which is why only registered professionals like a doctor, a nurse or pharmacy prescriber should be prescribing these treatments,” she said.Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said buying Botox-like products in any other circumstances significantly increases the risk that it is either fake or not licensed for use in the UK.“Public safety is a top priority for the MHRA,” she said, adding that when unlicensed products were used it “means that there are no safeguards to ensure products meet the MHRA’s standards for quality and safety. As such, they can endanger the health of the people who take them,” she said.Explore more on these topicsPlastic surgeryHealthNHSHealthcare industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump had claimed that CBS News misleadingly edited an interview with Kamala Harris last fall during the presidential campaign.Citing the California state senate’s decision in May to launch an inquiry into Paramount’s $16m settlement with Trump as precedent, the unions said: “Given Paramount’s recent capitulation to President Trump in the CBS News lawsuit, the Writers Guild of America has significant concerns that The Late Show’s cancelation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”It continued: “Cancelations are part of the business, but a corporation terminating a show in bad faith due to explicit or implicit political pressure is dangerous and unacceptable in a democratic society. Paramount’s decision comes against a backdrop of relentless attacks on a free press by President Trump, through lawsuits against CBS and ABC, threatened litigation of media organizations with critical coverage, and the unconscionable defunding of PBS and NPR.”The unions called on James to launch an investigation into Paramount, saying that she is “no stranger to prosecuting Trump for illegal business practices”.“We call on our elected leaders to hold those responsible to account, to demand answers about why this beloved program was canceled and to assure the public that Colbert and his writers were not censored due to their views or the whims of the president,” the WGA added.A spokesperson for James’s office said the NYAG office is monitoring the situation.The cancellation comes after Colbert – who has long been a critic of Trump on his show –calledParamount’s settlement a “big fat bribe” on air on Monday.“As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended … I don’t know if anything – anything – will repair my trust in this company. But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16m would help,” he said.Echoing Colbert’s disapproval, Jon Stewart, who works for Comedy Central – which is also owned by Paramount – condemned the deal on air last week, calling it “shameful”.He added: “I would assume internally, this is devastating to the people who work in a place that pride themselves on contextual, good journalism?”Following Paramount’s announcement, numerous lawmakers have weighed in on the cancellation, casting skepticism at the company.The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warrenwroteon X:“CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery.”Similarly, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanderssaid: “CBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance. Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he’s fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.”In a statement on Thursday evening, CBS executivessaidthat the decision to cancel the show was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night”, adding that it was “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount”.The Guardian has contacted the WGAE for comment.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertUS unionsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Andy Byron has not put out any statement, reports saying otherwise are all incorrect,” the company said.Both Byron and Cabot were immediately placed on leave, a source familiar with the situation told Axios. Additionally, Astronomer’s delayed response has partially been because of Byron’s slow resignation and exit package negotiations, another source told the outlet.Byron has been the head of Astronomer since 2023. In 2024, Cabot joined the company as its head of HR. In an announcement about Cabot’s hiring, Byronsaid:“Kristin’s exceptional leadership and deep expertise in talent management, employee engagement and scaling people strategies will be critical as we continue our rapid trajectory.”Meanwhile, in the same press release, Cabot said: “I was energised in my conversations with Andy and the Astronomer leadership team about the opportunities that exist here.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsColdplayMassachusettsnewsShareReuse this content"

Whoever did it, thank you very much.”The mural of the 70-year-old is believed to have been pasted on to a wall near a chip shop in the centre ofDudleyon Wednesday. The reaction so far has been mixed.“It’s a bit odd as it doesn’t have a slogan or any words, but it brightens up the place,” said one man out shopping on Friday.A local worker, who asked not to be named and admitted he did not know who Big Sam was, described it as “the random-est thing I’ve ever seen”.He added: “Who is it? It’s just weird, it doesn’t make sense and it needs to go.”Allardyce, or Big Sam as he was and always will be known to football fans, is used to dividing the crowd.During his managerial career he became known as a survival specialist, taking charge at Bolton Wanderers, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, West Ham, Sunderland, Crystal Palace, Everton, West Bromwich Albion, Leeds United – as well asEnglandfor one match.He was never afraid to say what he thought. As were fans of clubs he managed.During a miserable 6-0 defeat at Manchester City, West Ham repeatedlychanted “fuck off Sam Allardyce”. In his memoir not long after Allardyce described West Ham fans as “brainwashed” and “deluded”.He once said he would win the league every year if got to manage a club like Real Madrid. Allardyce joked that the reason he would never manage one of the top four English clubs was becausehis surname was not Allardici.For some, the mystery of the new mural will be: who is the artist and why? For others it will be: what the heck are orange chips?There is a debate over the origin of orange chips – as in chips fried in an orange batter. Some say they have been around since the second world war and rationing. Others claim they date to the 1970s.What makes the batter orange is often a secret. Some think it might be best not to know.During lockdown,the Birmingham Mail published an orange chip recipefor people to try at home and the extra ingredients were paprika and orange food colouring.Explore more on these topicsDudleyEnglandSam AllardycenewsShareReuse this content"

River crossings that used to stay solidly frozen until spring now crack underfoot. Craters have begun erupting from thawing permafrost, and in the shallow waters where thick ice should be newborn reindeer calves are drowning. “Last December, the cold barely came,” said Shukin, a reindeer herder in the Russian Arctic.The Arctic is warming 2.5 times faster than the global average, and in Russia’s far north these effects are existential. “We’re the canary in the coalmine,” Shukin, 63, said. “We are the first to witness climate change in such a dramatic way. It’s no longer a distant threat. I hope the rest of Russia is paying attention.”The impact of the climate crisis is increasingly visible across Russia’s vast expanse of 11 time zones. Some of Shukin’s neighbours have had to abandon their homes as melting permafrost leads to huge cracks in the ground that swallow homes, pipelines and roads. Farther south, fire has scoured forests, with an area as large as Italy burnt in some of the largest wildfires in the country’s history.But the country remains the world’s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases and is often described as a laggard – or even an obstructionist – on climate policy. (Russia is thesecond largest emitter of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, but is not signed up to the global methane pledge.)Angelina Davydova, a leading Russian environmental expert, said: “Russia keeps saying that the climate is important, that international cooperation on climate change is important. But then Russia is not doing anything to combat it. I don’t think it’s a pressing issue; they are happy with the status quo.”This may be because, in no small part, Russia’s economic stability depends on the fossil fuels that are one of the root causes of the crisis.Vladimir Putin’s entry to power in the early 2000s, accompanied by a rise in domestic support, was closely tied to a rise in global energy prices, which fuelled rapid economic growth after the instability of the 1990s.As oil and gas revenues flooded in, Putin moved quickly to consolidate state control over key energy assets, framing himself as the guarantor of Russia’s newfound stability and prosperity. Energy wealth allowed the Kremlin to pay off debts, boost public sector wages and rebuild a sense of national pride – all of which underpinned Putin’s growing political dominance. Oil and gas were not just economic drivers; they became central to the regime’s legitimacy at home and its leverage abroad.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin (left) talks to the Rosneft president, Igor Sechin, during a signing ceremony in 2013 at the Kremlin in Moscow.Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersOn paper, Russia appears to be meeting some of its climate commitments. Moscow had little trouble fulfilling its pledge to cut emissions to 30% below 1990 levels – a target technically achieved years ago, not through climate policy, but due to the economic collapse that followed the Soviet Union’s breakup.But throughout Putin’s rule since 2000, the climate has consistently remained a low priority. The climate crisis was left out of the list of national goals for 2024 and omitted from key strategic documents, including the 2020 energy strategy to 2035.In October 2023, the government did announce a new climate doctrine, but while it acknowledges the risks the climate crisis poses to Russia and reaffirms the country’s already weak emissions targets, it pointedly avoided any mention of fossil fuels as a cause of global heating. References to the link between fossil fuel combustion and greenhouse gas emissionswere quietly removed.Russia’s international reputation as a blocker of action on the climate crisis has only deepened in recent years. In 2021, it vetoed what would have been a historic, first-of-its-kind UN security council resolution calling theclimate crisis a threat to international peace and security.Russia’s emissions from fossil fuels and industryAt the 2023 Cop28 in Dubai, while many nations pushed for language calling for a full phase-out of fossil fuels, Russia was among the countries that resisted firm commitments, advocating instead for more flexible interpretations that would protect its oil and gas exports. Moscow’s efforts to get “transitional fuels” recognised in the final Cop28 agreement succeeded, helping to dilute calls for a complete phase-out of fossil fuels and allowing continued reliance on natural gas and other hydrocarbons. A year later, at COP29 in Baku, Russia sent a large delegation dominated by oil and gas lobbyists, whose primary focus appeared to be securing new energy contracts rather than advancing efforts to combat the climate crisis.According to the Climate Action Tracker, an independent initiative assessing countries’ compliance with the Paris agreement, Russia’s climate policies are “highly insufficient” for meeting the 1.5C (2.7F) goal. If every country followed Russia’s path, the world would be on track for more than 4C of warming.Still, Davydova noted that in the years leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the issue of climate change – and how to address it – was beginning to gain “unprecedented traction” among the general public and the business elite.But Putin’s decision to send troops into Ukraine appears to have put Moscow’s climate plans on ice. The fighting has had a devastating impact on the environment and climate. The climate cost of the first two years of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was greater than the annual greenhouse gas emissions generated individually by 175 countries,exacerbating the global climate emergencyin addition to the mounting death toll and widespread destruction,according to a study on conflict-driven climate impacts. Throughout the war, Russia has deliberately targeted energy infrastructure, generating major leaks of potent greenhouse gases.Russia’s invasion has also wiped out any incentive to invest in alternative energy, while, sanctions or no, fossil fuels have become even more central to the Russian economy. In 2022, oil and gas exports accounted for a greater percentage share of the economy than they did before the war, according to a recent study onRussia’s climate policy after the war in Ukraine.Sanctions, combined with the near-total collapse of cooperation between Russian and western scientists, are likely to further hamper the country’s ability to innovate in green technology. According to the Institute of Economic Forecasting at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia’s capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could halve by 2050, primarily due to technological constraints.But Russia’s elite seems largely unfazed by the climate crisis, instead framing it as an economic opportunity. Last month, Kirill Dmitriev – a close Putin ally – described the Northern Sea Route at a Russian conference on Arctic development as having “interesting prospects” because of global heating, adding rising temperatures in the region could enhance access to untapped reserves of oil, gas and minerals.The Arctic has become a central focus in discussions of potential cooperation between the Kremlin and the Trump administration – with both having shown little concern for the climate crisis. Moscow and Washington have already held two meetings in Saudi Arabia to explore joint Arctic energy projects. The Kremlin wants to capitalise on its Arctic resources, and the US interest in them, to seek long-desired relief from sanctions and use the region as a springboard for rebuilding relations with Washington.For some, this is a worrying prospect. “The Russian government has no alternative to offer its citizens except the destruction of nature for profit and war,” said the climate activist Arshak Makichyan, who has built a reputation as the Russian answer to Greta Thunberg.Oil and gas remain hugely important for Russia’s budgetThe problem is in authoritarian Russia, public opinion holds little sway over the Kremlin’s agenda – and on the climate crisis, the government sees even less reason to act, Makichyan admits. Russia’s war in Ukraine and western sanctions appear to have overshadowed Russians’ concerns about the environment, with polls now showing that most view it as a distant issue. A 2024 survey by the independent Levada Center ranked environmental problems 12th among societal worries, far behind economic issues such as rising prices. By contrast, in 2020 48% of Russians listed “environmental degradation” as the greatest threat to the planet.And the few environmental voices that have spoken out have been swept up in the broader crackdown on anti-war sentiment and political dissent; the state has outlawed local branches of the WWF and Greenpeace International, while also jailing dozens of environmental activists across the country.“The environmental movement currently has no means to speak to a wide audience of Russians about the dangers of climate change,” said Makichyan, who was expelled from Russia in 2022, stripped of his Russian citizenship and now lives in Berlin. “It’s dangerous to have no means of raising awareness about climate change because, while the Putin regime will eventually fall, the climate crisis isn’t going anywhere.”Source of figures at top:World Economic OutlookExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisThe big emittersVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We painted, sang songs, read books and lived peacefully,” Kutina said, according to Indian media reports.Then the police arrived.The story of how the 40-year-old Russian woman and her daughters, aged six and four, came to be living in a damp cave in the state of Karnataka has gripped the country.The family was discovered by police on 9 July during a patrol of the hilly forest area, which is popular with tourists, when officers spied a curtain of red saris hanging in the trees. Moving closer, they realised it was covering the entrance of a cave.Meet Kerala’s ‘rainforest gardeners’ creating a Noah’s ark for endangered plantsRead moreA statue of a Hindu god was visible, as were scattered items of clothing. Then a blond child emerged. Behind her, the police were astonished to find Kutina, asleep with another child by her side.Kutina told officers she had moved to the cave for meditation and prayer, and to get herself and her children away from modern urban life and into nature.She had cooked vegetable curries and roti on a small gas stove and they had bathed in waterfalls and slept on plastic mats.Police believe she had been there for at least a week when they found her and had spent several stints living in the cave over the past nine months.Kutina dismissed the officers’ warnings that it was a highly dangerous place to live, especially during the monsoon, telling police that “animals and snakes are our friends” and that it was only humans who were dangerous.Despite her objections, police insisted on removing the family from the cave and taking them back to the town, where they were placed in a shelter after Kutina had a hospital checkup. M Narayana, a local superintendent of police, said Kutina appeared “deeply disillusioned with human society, yet still compassionate and spiritually grounded”.Kutina messaged a friend after being taken from her “big and beautiful cave”, saying her family had been “placed in a prison without sky, without grass, without a waterfall, with an icy hard floor on which we now sleep for ‘protection from rain and snakes’…. Once again, evil has won.”According to immigration records cited by Indian officials, Kutina first travelled to India in 2016, ending up in Arambol Beach, in Goa, a destination popular with Russian travellers. A year later, she had begun a relationship with an Israeli man, Dror Goldstein. After overstaying her visa in 2018, Kutina was deported to Russia and travelled to Ukraine, where she had their first daughter. She already had two older sons from a previous relationship.In 2020, Kutina returned to India with her children. She reunited with Goldstein in Goa and became pregnant again, making money as an art and language teacher.According to Goldstein, who spoke to Indian media, Kutina began withdrawing from him and would disappear for long periods with their two daughters. Then, in October last year, her eldest son, 21, was killed in a motorcycle crash in India. After Goldstein travelled to Nepal to renew his visa, he returned to Goa to find Kutina and their daughters had disappeared.He filed a police report in December but had heard nothing until reports of their discovery emerged this week.Asked by journalists why she had remained in India without any valid documents, Kutina said there were “many complicated reasons”.“First, there were multiple personal losses – not just the death of my son, but also a few other close people. We were constantly dealing with grief, paperwork and other problems,” she said.Kutina claimed her son’s ashes were among the belongings removed from the cave.With no valid documents to remain, the family were moved to a detention centre and police are arranging for Kutina’s deportation to Russia.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has seen several notable explosions in popularity over the years. The effects of the 18th-century “gin craze” were famously immortalised in Hogarth’s satirical artwork Gin Lane – though some might say worse crimes have been committed in the name of gin more recently.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A centuries-old ban on small-scale distilling was finally lifted in the UK in 2009, fuelling a huge boom in “craft gin” and record sales between 2015 and 2019. It also led to an incredible variety of bottles, flavours and colours, which were sometimes more weird than wonderful: Vegemite or Jaffa Cake gin, anyone?So, what is gin? Unlike scotch whisky, there are few legal requirements for a spirit to be sold as gin. Essentially, it needs to be made from a neutral spirit (usually derived from grain); it must have a predominant juniper flavour and must be bottled at 37.5% ABV minimum.These loose criteria give distillers plenty of room to play around with ingredients, infusions and distillation methods – creating a huge range of gin styles. And there are myriad ways to enjoy them: whether your go-to is the classic G&T, a martini, negroni or another cocktail, gin’s versatility means it’s no surprise it has endured.As a long-term member of the mother’s ruin fanclub – and having written about drinks for almost a decade – I have collected and tried hundreds of different gins. For this test, I revisited my home-bar favourites as well as trying many new-to-me gins to bring you this selection of delicious and interesting gins for your drinking delectation. I considered 50 gins from 40 brands, testing each one for aroma, before sipping it straight and drinking it in a gin and tonic with ice and lemon. If the brand suggested a specific serve, I tried that too.Making my way through a refreshing gin flight in my garden (during a heatwave), I was once again struck by gratitude that this is classed as actual work – but work it is, and I hope my thorough testing results in more gin enjoyment all round.These gins are mostly British, which wasn’t intentional; there are fantastic Scandinavian, Japanese and Italian gins, and bothPapa SaltandFour Pillars Bloody Shirazfrom Australia almost made the list. Ultimately, though, classic British ingredients and techniques still hold their own. So ice at the ready: here are the 10 best gins to enjoy a summer of beautifully botanical serves.The best gins in 2025Best sustainable ginView image in fullscreenBullards Coastalgin, 70cl£45 at JarroldsFrom Norwich comes this clean, citrussy gin filled with the saline seaside flavours of the Norfolk coast. Infused with hand-foraged sea purslane, marsh samphire and Douglas fir, this is a bracing, salty joy to drink in a gin and tonic. Bullards suggests serving with blackberries and a twist of fresh lime, but a sprig of samphire is even better, in my opinion. This gin edged ahead thanks to its innovativeeco-pouch format: buy a bottle for life and top up with more affordable pouches of gin, made from sugarcane, to reduce its carbon footprint – why don’t more brands do this? The brand’sStrawberry & Black Pepper ginis also wonderful with only a touch of sweetness, a sensible 40% ABV and a hefty thwack of warming black pepper.Best pink ginView image in fullscreenThat Boutique-y Gin Company Proper Pinkgin, 50cl£26.95 at Master of Malt£35.89 at AmazonThe definition of pink gin has become a little muddled in recent years. Traditionally, it refers to a navy-strength gin with added Angostura bitters (which gives the pink hue), but it’s evolved to include any pink-coloured gin – whether that’s due to colouring, berry or rhubarb flavours, or spangly mermaids. Not in my book – or That Boutique-y Gin Company’s. Its Proper Pink gin is a throwback to the 18th century: a 46% concoction of gin, lemon and vacuum-distilled Angostura, finished with even more Angostura. This is sophisticated stuff, best enjoyed in a martini with a twist.Best Old Tom ginView image in fullscreenHernö Old Tomgin, 50cl£34.50 at Master of Malt£35.99 at Drink SupermarketSweden’s award-winning gin distillery Hernö was named gin producer of the year in 2024 at the prestigious International Spirits Challenge. Hernö’sJuniper Cask gin(the first gin to be matured in juniper wood) andSix Rivers gin(with an aroma of verdant Icelandic moss) are both standout – but the brand’s Old Tom gin is a shining example of this category. Old Tom gins are named after the black cat symbol that signalled an 18th-century illegal distillery, and are sweeter than London dry, with sugar traditionally added to offset the harsher base spirit used in bootleg gin. The style proved popular, and Hernö’s naturally sweet botanicals – including vanilla, honey, lingonberries and generous amounts of almondy meadowsweet – give it a fresh update. It’s sweet and smooth enough for sipping, or perfectly at home in a Tom Collins.Best aged ginView image in fullscreenRenais Grand Cru Cask-Agedgin, 70cl£75 at the Spirit CoActor Emma Watson’s family have been winemaking in Burgundy for more than 30 years, and Renais – a grape-based gin – is the creation of Emma and her brother, intended to show off the estate’s viticultural heritage. Pressed grape skins from winemaking are repurposed to create the Renais base spirit and limit waste (Renais is carbon-neutral and B Corp-certified), before infusing with botanicals showcasing the terroir: linden flowers, grains of paradise (aromatic citrussy, peppery seeds) and acacia honey mingle with juniper. This Grand Cru Cask-Aged gin is then rested for a year in French oak Chablis casks, giving it a divinely silky finish and layer upon layer of vanilla-spiced complexity. It felt sacrilegious to mix this into supermarket tonic, so I’d suggest trying theRenais Old Fashioned. Only 720 bottles were produced for the UK market, so be quick.Best London dry ginView image in fullscreenGordon’s London Drygin, 1l£25.50 at Waitrose Cellar£20.50 at AmazonWhen you want a classic gin and tonic with no surprises or messing around, it’s hard to beat the refreshing taste of Gordon’s and tonic. It’s deservedly the category leader in gin, and the one many top bartenders reach for when mixing a G&T (they also invariably recommendSchweppes tonic– and never slimline). Made since 1769, its juniper-forward recipe is crisp, citrussy and the quintessential example of a London dry gin, winning it a swathe of spirit industry medals and a Great Taste award too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This coastal dry gin from Edinburgh Gin (now the UK’s seventh-biggest gin brand) is abundant with bladderwrack seaweed and Scottish marine plants, and well balanced with spiciness from coriander seed and cardamom. Subtle breezy seaside flavours emerge in a gin and tonic, but the natural saline tang of this gin makes an epic dirty martini. Honourable mentions to the entireSalcombe Ginrange,Fishers Original GinandSkagerrak Nordic Dry, who also deserve a place on your bar cart.Best low-alcohol ginView image in fullscreenCotswold Dry Gin Essence, 100ml£17.50 at Master of Malt£18.50 at Cotswolds DistilleryI love the standard higher-alcoholCotswold Dry gin– a worthy Great Taste award winner with its natural woodiness, zingy grapefruit, lime and fresh floral flavours of Cotswold lavender – but I love the Cotswold Gin Essence version even more. Housed in a cute 100ml apothecary-style bottle with pipette, just five drops of this concentrated botanical essence in 200ml of tonic makes for a lighter but equally satisfying serve, with just 14 calories, 0.23 units of alcohol and all the natural flavour intact. If you like this approach,Hayman’s Small ginis also delicious – and comes with an adorable thimble for measuring out your gin.Best flavoured ginView image in fullscreenBathtub Gin Grapefruit & Rosemary, 70cl£34.95 at Master of Malt£34.45 at AmazonFlavoured gin has a well-deserved bad reputation. From bizarre juniper-jarring flavours to synthetic ingredients, there are plenty of bad examples to fall foul of. But not Bathtub’s Grapefruit & Rosemary: here, the natural botanical components of Bathtub Gin – which already has a punchy herbaceous citrus profile – are amplified by the extra infusion, so the bold grapefruit is extra zesty and the rosemary greener and more woodsy. This gin is creamy, vibrant and perfect for a G&T, with a sprig of rosemary and a dried grapefruit slice. (Agnes Arber’s Pineapple ginandSipsmith’s Chilli & Lime Ginwere close runners-up in this category.)Best gin for sippingView image in fullscreenStill GIN, 70cl£31.25 at the Whisky Exchange£34.99 at Master of MaltYou’re allowed to be sceptical about Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre making a gin – but brilliantly, it’s decent. Designed to be smooth enough to drink straight up (though surely they’d approve of some juice), this is a very gentle, harmonious gin, with a soft balance of orange citrus fruit, jasmine flower and angelica root, dialling down on the juniper. It’s copper pot-stilled, which distils more slowly and evenly – accounting for the extra smoothness. I genuinely enjoyed sipping it straight with plenty of ice (go for bigger ice cubes to avoid dilution) and a garnish of orange peel.Best unusual ginView image in fullscreenHendrick’sgin, 70cl£33 at Waitrose Cellar£25.98 at AmazonIs Hendrick’s unusual? Not so much these days, now craft gins are doing all sorts of things – but it was one of the first to do things a bit differently. The brand still occupies this space, and it does it well. Hendrick’s is made in an unusual way too: two base spirits are created in different stills – one rich, one delicate – before both are infused with classic gin botanicals, along with less classic ingredients such as chamomile, elderflower and cubeb berries (like allspice). The spirits are then blended and steeped in rose and cucumber, which provide the prominent top notes of the finished product. The original serve – with tonic and sliced cucumber – continues to hold up, and is still the most refreshing G&T for summer.Joanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Certainly his creepingly explosive turn in Shaan Sahota’s debut drama is unmissable. It carries this first play, almost eclipsing its imperfections.Better known for his screen work, he shone darkly inBenedict Andrews’ The Cherry Orchard last year as Chekhov’s peasant-stock merchant with a chip on his shoulder, Lopakhin. Angad, a British-Sikh politician hungry for the top job, is a self-made man too, or so he insists, even if he went to Harrow and Oxford: he calls himself the son of an immigrant baggage handler although his father went on to become a property magnate (and slum landlord, it is suggested) before his unexpected death.That death hails in the explosions of this drama. Angad has also inherited all his father’s wealth in a will that leaves nothing to his two sisters, Malicka (Shelley Conn) and Gyan (Thusitha Jayasundera), the latter having been the most dutiful of the siblings.Akhtar rises into his part, first unassuming and then viper-like, to loom over this family drama cum political play. The action first swivels between the two, with Chloe Lamford’s set rearranging itself from the casual opulence of Angad’s home to the white-collar functionalism of his office.It is exciting writing, fast and funny in its political satire, if clunky in plotting, with interludes of drum‘n’bass (music composed by Asaf Zohar) that captures the throb and power-hunger of Angad’s ambition. Snappily directed by Daniel Raggett, there are brilliant performances across the board.But there is too much stuffed in, jostling for air. Angad’s sisters dispute their father’s will, urging their brother to split the inheritance equally as he once promised. Angad resists, engaging in his own political battles. Slowly, their father’s toxic legacy is exposed and the wrangle over his will comes to signify misogyny, control, betrayal.Political satire in the Commons captures the cut and thrust of political scheming but in approximate, over-familiar ways. Parliamentarians are referred to by the name of their Oxford college, Angad’s communication’s adviser (Helena Wilson) is amusing but derivative, while the bullying whip, Ralph (Humphrey Ker), seems to be doing an impression of Peter Capaldi in The Thick of It. It is funnier in the gurdwara where a funeral becomes a political opportunity.View image in fullscreenAdeel Akhtar (Angad), Thusitha Jayasundera (Gyan) and Shelley Conn (Malicka) in The Estate at the National Theatre.Photograph: Helen MurrayBut the biggest hole is that none of it resembles the politics of today. Angad’s race is vaguely referenced but there is no mention of the big issues of our day, including immigration and the connection between race and Britishness, with all the undertones that brings. So it becomes hard to suspend disbelief as Angad rises and rises to power.His final speech is rousing and magnificently delivered. It interrogates whether we hold the self-serving politician of colour to different,better, values. Do we need Angad to hide his ambition in order to be acceptable? This question is lost in the tangle of other themes while some characters seem under-conceived, especially Angad’s wife (Dinita Gohil) – the play ducks out from showing us what makes her tick.The scandal on which the political plotline pivots is naive too. There is an equivalence set up between the rule of primogeniture in hereditary peerages and biases against women in Punjabi culture in order to show the double-standards employed against Angad. But the fact that the party gets in a spin over his refusal to overturn his father’s will rings a false note.Still, it is a sensational debut, and if the best kind of failure is one that bears too much ambition, there is an admirable kind of over-reaching here, and a great playwright in the making.At the Dorfman theatre, London, until 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreNational TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s in the form of fruity shots or powdered supplements, this structural protein is being touted as the secret to youthful skin and glossy hair.Celebrities are also singing the praises of a collagen-boosting procedure called NeoGen, with the actorLeslie Ashclaiming earlier this week that it had “taken 10 years off her”.But amid the glowing endorsements and glossy marketing, a fundamental question remains: can anything else really boost collagen – and is it desirable to do so?Collagens are a group of proteins that provide structural support and mechanical strength to the gel-like extracellular matrix in skin, cartilage and other body tissues. There are various types, each comprising long chains of amino acids that wind together to form strong fibres called fibrils.Viewed under an electron microscope, these fibrils form a basket-like mesh in young, healthy skin. But as we age, the amount of collagen declines and its structure becomes more cross-linked and fragmented.“In younger skin, the fibres tend to be longer and more flexible, but in older skin, they’re shorter and more rigid, primarily as a result of UV damage,” said Prof John Connelly, who studies skin repair and regeneration at Queen Mary University of London.Collagen is not the only protein that keeps skin looking youthful. Elastin allows skin to stretch and spring back, while other structural proteins help to organise and stabilise collagen. Long sugar chains known as glycosaminoglycans – including the popular skincare ingredient hyaluronic acid – play a key role in hydratingthe tissue. Like collagen, these components degrade and change with age, contributing to sagging, reduced plumpness and wrinkles.Yet collagen continues to dominate the spotlight. Many skincare products list it as an ingredient but “these proteins are very large, so they don’t easily cross the skin barrier when applied topically”, saidProf Tanya Shaw, a spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation and expert in wound healing at King’s College London. That said, collagen in creams may help draw moisture to the skin’s surface, providing a temporary plumping effect.Collagen drinks are the latest plot twist. Their aim is to supply the raw materials for fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for collagen production. There was also evidence that fragments of extracellular matrix proteins might act as signals, stimulating fibroblasts to produce not just collagen but also elastin and hyaluronic acid, said Dr Jonathan Kentley, a consultant dermatologist at the Montrose clinic in London and Chelsea and Westminster hospital.Most collagen supplements use fragments derived from chicken, fish or pork, which are absorbed through the gut and transported to the skin via the bloodstream. However, many are probably broken down further during digestion and it is unclear whether otherdietary proteins would offer similar building blocks, according to Connelly and Shaw.Even if some fragments do reach the skin, they would be working in a damaged environment. “If you start to make new collagen, where does it go, and how does it interact with the existing collagen?” saidDr Mike Sherratt, a skin mechanics expert at the University of Manchester. Also, “if it gets into the bloodstream, it’s not only going to affect the skin, but presumably other organs and tissues as well”.Animal studies offer some support for collagen supplements: radio-labelled collagen fragments have been shown to reach the skin and boost gene activity linked to collagen production in mice. “Mouse studies have also shown reduced wrinkle formation following UV exposure,” said Kentley.Some human trials have also reported improved hydration, elasticity, and fewer wrinkles after consuming fish collagen. But most of these were industry-funded and a recentmeta-analysisof 23 studies found that only those receiving funding from companies showed significant effects. Kentley said: “When the studies were separated into high-quality and low-quality studies, the high-quality studies showed no skin benefits. So, these results must be interpreted with extreme caution.”What about medical procedures such as NeoGen? It uses high-frequency radio waves to covert nitrogen gas into plasma (ionised gas), which delivers controlled heat to deeper layers of the skin. Animal studies suggest this controlled thermal damage alters collagen structure, causing skin tightening, and promotes the shedding of surface layers, improving tone and texture.“Small clinical studies on patients have also shown an improvement in skin tone and wrinkling,” said Kentley. “However, as this is a relatively new technology there is relatively little evidence other than a handful of small studies.”Other procedures such as microneedling also induce tiny, controlled injuries to the skin, triggering a wound healing response, while injectable “biostimulators” – such as Sculptra – create a foreign body response that stimulates fibroblasts.While all these procedures have some clinical evidence supporting their ability to stimulate new collagen, the quality is variable and no head-to-head trials have pitted these products and procedures against each other.Kentley said: “Given that aesthetic medicine is so highly personalised and each product or procedure will have its own benefits and risks, the best way to know what is right for you is by seeing a qualified physician who is not conflicted by the quest for profit.“In terms of topical treatments, there are decades of evidence to support the use of tretinoin [a prescription-strength retinoid] to boost collagen production and reduce other signs of skin ageing such as pigmentation.”Although celebrity endorsements and dramatic before-and-after pictures can be persuasive, it is also worth remembering that these procedures are not a permanent fix for skin ageing – they require continuing treatments, which can be costly. The most effective long-term strategy to protect and preserve your collagen is to minimise UV exposure from an early age, through consistent use of sunscreen.Sherratt showed me a photo of him duringBritain’s 1976 heatwave, when he was nine. Unlike the proteins inside our cells that are regularly renewed, he said, type I collagen in the dermis had a half-life of about 15 years and elastin was thought to be meant to last a lifetime. “These proteins accumulate damage over time. So, it’s highly likely that some of the extracellular matrix proteins in my face and forearm still carry damage from that 1976 holiday.”For those of us who did not faithfully apply sunscreen in our youth, it is worth being realistic about how much even the most advanced treatments can achieve. While they may temporarily firm and smooth the skin, the deeper biological damage has already taken place – and much of it may be irreversible.Explore more on these topicsSkincareMedical researchBeautyHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mike Shinoda and Emily Armstrong discuss backlash and rebirthFri 18 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 06.55 EDTShareIt’s been almost 25 years sinceLinkin Parkreleased their debut album, Hybrid Theory. An irresistible fusion of metal, hip-hop, electronica, industrial rock and infectious pop melody, it established the Californian sextet as instant nu-metal icons and laid the groundwork for the group to become, by many metrics, the biggest US rock band of this millennium: Hybrid Theory ended up the bestselling album of 2001; its follow-up, Meteora, would also go on to rank as one of the bestselling albums of the 21st century.It’s been just 36 hours, however, since the band played their biggest headline gig to date, at a steamy and rapturous Wembley stadium. Outside, it’s still scorching, but in an icily air-conditioned hotel overlooking the Thames, Linkin Park’s co-founder, co-vocalist and chief songwriter,Mike Shinoda, is reflecting on the show. “For any band that’s been around a long time, it’s really easy to start heading into heritage territory,” says the 48-year-old. “You’re just playing that old stuff.”Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda on life after Chester Bennington: ‘I cope by staying in motion’Read moreLinkin Park did of course play the old stuff, crescendoing with a stone-cold triad of belt-along hits – Numb, In the End and Faint – that have 6bn Spotify streams between them. But this was no greatest hits showcase. The band’s eighth album,From Zero– which reached No 1 in 13 countries (including the UK) last November – also received an ecstatic response, and its lead single was one of the very rare hard rock songs to reach the UK Top 5. “This tour and this album are one of our most successful of all time. That, for me, isinsane,” marvels Shinoda. “That is way beyond my hopes and dreams for what this whole thing could be.”This triumphant second act is all the more miraculous considering Linkin Park are not the band they used to be. In 2017, the group’s lead vocalist,Chester Bennington, took his own life, having struggled with depression and addiction for decades. Sitting next to Shinoda today is 39-year-old Emily Armstrong, who now fronts Linkin Park alongside him (she sings, Shinoda raps).Bleach-blond hair, dark shades, an acid yellow oversized jersey and a voice that travels from pop croon to gruff, guttural scream: on stage, Armstrong appeared every inch the nu-metal maven. Yet while performing to 75,000 adoring fans would be the ego trip of a lifetime for most rock stars, as Bennington’s replacement, it’s not quite the same. On songs such as the Grammy-winning Crawling, Armstrong’s role was more singalong facilitator than central attraction. “There’s so many fans that have been wanting to seeLinkin Parkfor so long, you know?” she says, brandishing an enormous bottle of electrolyte-orange water. “So I look at it as: this is your moment to sing. And you sing it better than I do at this point!”View image in fullscreen‘Introspective’ … Linkin Park in 2017.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyAfter Bennington’s death, Shinoda paused Linkin Park and found refuge in Post Traumatic, a raw and emotional solo album that detailed his struggle to process his grief. Bennington died two months after the release of the band’s seventh album, One More Light, which they were about to take on tour. Shinoda partly “wanted to make Post Traumatic as a diary of how I felt for myself”, but also had the urge to play live “to provide an area for fans to commune and go: ‘Oh, Mike is still here. We didn’t lose everybody.’”The Post Traumatic tour was cathartic “in the beginning”, he says. “And then towards the end it was exhausting. I had started to … I don’t want to say move on. ‘Move on’ to some people means not looking back and forgetting – that’s completely not how I felt. I felt like I was coping well and I was able to get up in the morning and not think about it, and I was evolving from the terrible stuff that had happened. Then I would go to the show and spend 90 minutes with half the crowd crying. And I’m like, this is fucking exhausting. You know how therapists see patients all day and help them, but then they need therapy themselves? That’s how I felt.”Shinoda founded Linkin Park at 19, alongside his schoolmates Rob Bourdon (drums) and Brad Delson (guitar). His college friends Dave “Phoenix” Farrell (bass) and the turntablist Joe Hahn joined soon after; Bennington was a later addition after a record label executive insisted they recruit a new vocalist. After Post Traumatic, Shinoda spent the next half-decade figuring out how to bring back the band that had defined his entire adult life. “I sort through information very logically,” he says. He approached the group’s future “from a puzzle-cracking point of view”, he explains, entertaining options like hiring a mini choir for live shows or relying on a rotating cast of famous vocalists.To begin with, Shinoda invited a few musicians – including some big names, such as the viral soul singer Teddy Swims – down to the studio to write material. He didn’t tell them this was part of a potential Linkin Park comeback, and things could get awkwardly vague. “Two hours into the session, they’d be like: ‘Hey, can I ask you a question? What’s going on here? Who are we writing for?’ And we’d be like: ‘Yeah, we don’t know.’” Sometimes it felt like these collaborators were “angling” to be Linkin Park’s new vocalist. “Like, ‘look how good I can sing!’ It was such a turn-off.”Armstrong was the tunefully raspy frontwoman of Dead Sara, a bluesy LA punk outfit who were initially hyped (in 2013, Dave Grohl insisted they “should be the next biggest rock band in the world”) but never really made it. She got an invite too. Those sessions never felt like a “Linkin Park tryout”, she says; she was simply “excited to write with Mike Shinoda”.He laughs: “I love when you use my full name.” The first time she met the band was in 2019, but it wasn’t until she returned to the studio in 2023 that something clicked. Performance and personality-wise, Armstrong – who has sassy little sister energy around Shinoda – seemed like a natural fit.Shinoda also felt reassured that Armstrong and the drummer Colin Brittain – who replaced Bourdon around the same time – weren’t just using Linkin Park to grow their profiles. “There’s a lot of people for who it’s all about follower count. It’s a very greedy way to live. And these guys aren’t that way.” He appreciates that the pair never took any “sneaky pictures” of Shinoda’s home studio for clout.View image in fullscreenA new legacy … Linkin Park today.Photograph: Warner Records“We had a high level of respect,” nods Armstrong, before stifling a smile. “Wedid havea high level of respect.”Shinoda looks mock-wistful. “Ah, to go back to those days.”Armstrong was never going to turn down the opportunity to front Linkin Park. “I’ve been in a band for 20 years and I could only dream of this kind of success,” she says, then makes a face. “That sounded lame.” But she was scared at the prospect of stepping into such big shoes. “Why do I think I can do this?” she wondered, telling Shinoda that she didn’t want to “ruin” Linkin Park. “I’m like, you guys are a legacy band – you guys are so important.”Shinoda drolly encourages the ego massage: “Oh, goon– tell me more!”Once the new lineup was complete and From Zero finished (much of it was already written when Armstrong joined the band), it was time to tell the world. The responsewasn’t entirely positive. Bennington’s mother said she felt “betrayed” by Shinoda’s decision to reform the band without consulting her, while Bennington’s son expressed dismay at Armstrong’s links to Scientology and her attendance at a hearing insupport of Danny Masterson, an actor and Scientologist who was eventually convicted of rape – something that was also widely reported in the press and discussed by fans. I have been told that Armstrong will not discuss Scientology today. She did, however, release a statement at the time, explaining that she had severed all ties with Masterson and condemned his crimes.View image in fullscreenChester Bennington in 2008.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesWas Armstrong braced for that kind of reaction? “Not this. No, not this,” she says quietly. “I was a little bit naive about it, to be honest.” Even pre-Linkin Park, she tended to avoid social media “for mental-health purposes”, and coped with the clamour by getting offline. “If there was something really, really pressing, I think our PR would talk to us about it. But I’m old enough to know the difference between real life and the internet.”Shinoda takes a different tack to public criticism, but ends up in the same place. After the Wembley show, he posted a picture of himself in a T-shirt emblazoned with the opening lines of a snide news story about the band’s decision to downsize the venue of their LA show. “There are times when I’m not above being a little petty,” he grins. The T-shirt was “not meant to be mean at all”, he clarifies, and the music outlet in question “are not the only ones who’ve said it. Lots of people have said this band is fumbling: ‘Look how stupid they are, look how bad they’re doing.’ Well, according to the data, we’re not, but you can believe whatever you want to believe.”When it came to Armstrong, Shinoda felt people’s complaints were also disingenuous. “There were people who lashed out at Emily and it was really because she wasn’t a guy.” Fans, he thinks, were “used to Linkin Park being six guys and the voice of a guy leading this song. They were just so uncomfortable with what it was that they chose a ton of things to complain about. They’re pointing in 10 different directions saying: ‘This is why I’m mad, this is why the band sucks.’”In the months since Linkin Park 2.0 launched, the reaction from fans has softened and Armstrong has been widely embraced. But devotees are still clearly looking for traces of Bennington in the band’s work. Many interpreted Let You Fade, a bonus track on From Zero’s deluxe edition, as a tribute to the singer, but “it wasn’t written that way,” says Shinoda. “People even pulled out the fact that there’s numbers in the song [that align with] Chester’s birthday. I was like: whoops. That’s not intentional.”At any rate, From Zero does hark back to the band’s original sound: rock-rap fusion vocals, hip-hop record-scratching, highly accessible melodies and enough gristle (grinding guitar and screaming; anxious and indignant lyrics) to both intensify and offset them. Serendipitously, nu-metal is back in a big way, “thanks to TikTok, the Y2K revival and, of course, enduring teenage angst”, as per theNew York Times, with bands such as Deftones enjoying a massive resurgence and acts including Fontaines DC, 100 gecs and Rina Sawayama incorporating the genre into their work.View image in fullscreen‘We did this first!’ … Emily Armstrong performs during the From Zero tour.Photograph: Variety/Getty ImagesFor millennials such as Armstrong, the sound of nu-metal provides nostalgia-coated comfort. She was a fan in her early teens, and feels “like a child again” when she performs Linkin Park’s old tracks. The era’s garb – voluminous shorts, pulled-up sports socks, chunky jewellery, wraparound sunglasses – is also back in style, which reminds Armstrong of her teen self’s beloved Adidas T-shirt and camouflage combats combo. “We did this first!” she laughs. “I’m old as shit!”But Shinoda doesn’t look back with rose-tinted spectacles. In the early 2000s, Linkin Park did “a bunch of metal tours and played with Metallica – the energy there was very masculine, bro energy. We were immersed in a culture where it was like an arms race for who could make the most macho music.”With peers including Korn, Slipknot and System of a Down, the nu-metal cohort was novel and outrageous enough to precipitate a mild moral panic – yet sexist lyrics in the work of groups like Limp Bizkit really were a problem. Linkin Park always seemed less aggressive and intimidating than their peers, and Shinoda always disliked the macho aspect. “Chester connected with it a little more than the rest of us did, but not by much.” His band, he feels, featured “more lyrics that were introspective. It wasn’t like: ‘Hey, I’m gonna kick your ass.’ It was like: ‘Somebody kicked my ass and I’m so frustrated.’ In high school, I wasn’t kicking anybody’s ass. That was not happening.”Nowadays, nu-metal’s aesthetic has been freed from its more unsavoury elements by a streaming generation who simply don’t remember it; it’s just another fun retro style to rehabilitate. Even Shinoda is less disgusted. “Genres are so blended and music is so all over the place, I don’t hate nu-metal any more.”The female pop stars channeling nu-metal’s rageRead moreWhether down to this defanged nostalgic comeback, the quality of the band’s back catalogue or the incredibly catchy new material, it’s clear from the Wembley show that Linkin Park have a whole new generation of obsessive young fans. The delight in the crowd was palpable – an energy Shinoda is deliberately cultivating, especially after the mental exhaustion of the Post Traumatic tour. “I think we all wanted our show to be really good vibes,” he says. “I want you walking away feeling like, this was such a wonderful, special, fun night.”Inevitably, this means certain songs are off the setlist. There are a couple that Shinoda would “feel weird playing”, including One More Light, the title track of the band’s last album with Bennington. It was originally written “for a woman at the label that we worked with who passed away. Then after Chester passed, the world decided that it was about him. And so that’s just too sad to play.”Linkin Park tour the US from 29 JulyExplore more on these topicsLinkin ParkMetalPop and rockChester BenningtoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

A new exhibition brings these so-called Black Paintings to life – and shows why they still resonate todayDale Berning SawaFri 18 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareIn Modern Nature, his journals, published two years before his death in 1994,Derek Jarmandescribed the time his friend David arrived for lunch at Prospect Cottage, Jarman’s home, some time in the summer of 1989. David was carrying an enormous block of pitch.The cottage and its boundless garden sits on the shingle at Dungeness, a place of immeasurable strangeness and beauty on the Kentish coast. “After swimming,” Jarman wrote, “we built a brick hearth, lit a bonfire, and melted the pitch in an old tin can.” The two men then rushed back and forth between the studio and the pot, fetching brushes, gloves, pillows, barbed wire, crucifixes, prayer books, bullets, a model fighter plane and a telephone and set about tarring and feathering objects and affixing them on to canvases. “The hot tar splashed everywhere and set like shining jet,” he observed, with a childlike enthusiasm.The artworks in question are part of a series known as the Black Paintings, now the subject of a two-part chronological survey at Amanda Wilkinson Gallery in London. Jarman started working on these precious miniatures – most are only a forearm in width – in 1984. He used oils and found objects, building up from scarlet and gold underlayers. The red and sparkle seep through the impastoed black that encrusts and overwhelms everything on the surface. Broken glass, plastic figurines, a crushed Coca-Cola can, a model boat. When he was nominated for the Turner prize in 1986, Jarman exhibited about a dozen of the Black Paintings. The prize went to Gilbert and George, but Jarman remained focused, filming The Last of England in 1987 and The Garden in 1990, and gradually swapping oils for tar in his paintings.‘Sometimes he cast spells over them’: the raging beauty of Derek Jarman’s black paintingsRead moreJarman’s journals open with his exhilaration at the boundless possibility Dungeness clearly proffered (“there is more sunlight here than anywhere in Britain”) and the panic he experienced at the onset of the Great Storm of October 1987 (a neighbouring fisher’s hut disintegrated, “80 years of tar and paint parting like a rifle shot”). He had been diagnosed with HIV just months earlier. The works in the show, like the entries in the book, duly trace his alchemical art-making and the pain and outrage of his reckoning with that generational cataclysm. Motifs including Christ’s crown of thorns and blood surface in the works’ iconography.“He didn’t think of himself as a film-maker or a gardener or a painter or a political activist,” Wilkinson says. “He wasn’t a queer artist. He was an artist. All of that was his art.” Fabled punk chronicler Jon Savage, who was close to Jarman, recently emphasised to the gallerist how crucial this point is. “You mustn’t pin Derek down,” he said. “You can’t pin Derek down. You can’t put him in any box. He would always resist it.”Former lovers and friends often refer to Jarman’s agitated energy, his enthusiasm. He was the most colourful man they had ever met, someone who had crazy ideas every day, an interlocutor with whom conversation remains, in death, just as strong and empowering as it was when he was alive. And anyone who has one of these Black Paintings (there is no official tally; unknowns keep emerging) knows to treasure it deeply. “He just made everybody feel good,” Wilkinson says. “He was so charming and funny and charismatic. Everybody loved Derek Jarman.”The Black Paintings: A Chronology Part 2isat the Amanda Wilkinson Gallery, London, to13 SeptemberHis dark materials: five works from the exhibitionExit 1988 (main image)Jarman wasn’t afraid to be complex, Wilkinson says. And he remained resolute and bright-eyed at the end of his life. “I do not wish to die … yet,” he wrote in the summer of 1990, overwhelmed by the number of pills he has to take, his strength ebbing and flowing like the tide on the shingle outside. “I would love to see my garden through several summers.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Keith Collins Will Trust and Amanda WilkinsonDeath Is All Things We See Awake 1991Jarman’s films, writing and paintings are steeped in his reading.

It has an Arm. That’s what the harbour’s long walkway into the Channel is called. It is a suitably surreal, even grotesque setting for theFolkestone Triennialartworks that infest its salty nooks and crannies – or armpits and elbow crooks. Laure Prouvost has placed a mutant seabird, with three heads and an electric plug on its tail, on the adjacent concrete stump of the defunct ferry terminal. Surprising? Not really if you have just visited The Ministry of Sewers, an installation by Cooking Sections that documents and protests the poisoning of our rivers and seas.View image in fullscreenPoison pen-pushers … The Ministry of Sewers by Cooking Sections at Folkestone Triennial.Photograph: Thierry BalThere’s nothing like an exhibit on the scale of Britain’s water pollution to kick off a day at the seaside. It’s cloudy when I visit, the cliffs and sea swathed in white mist and the water under the Arm looking like a detergent soup. It all adds to the uncanny mood. And art doesn’t come much more uncanny than the sculpture by Dorothy Cross near the far end of the Arm. You have to go down soaking wet, concrete steps to a recess with a precipitous opening to the evil-looking sea. “Try not to fall in,” says the attendant, who stays up above. Here you find a massive block of blood-coloured marble, as if a giant tuna steak had been stashed here by fish smugglers. The sides are smooth, the top uneven and rough. Out of this earthy hulk Cross has carved several pairs of feet in hyperrealistic detail, nervously walking its beach-like surface. They face out to sea, as if about to make a bold leap into the blue-green water, to find a better life.Cross has made a monument to migrants. The marble she has used is from Syria, the feet pattering over it full of fear and hope. These lifelike appendages and the surface on which they stand echo Magritte’s surrealist 1934 painting The Red Model, of disembodied feet on red ground, while her use of massive, raw stone to suggest infinite sorrow - the weight of the world - shows she understands Michelangelo. This is a superb sculpture, brilliantly sited. It would be worth visiting Folkestone just to see it.But there’s more – if you fancy a walk. Up above the cliffs, on steep green downs guarded by Martello towers built to fend off invasion during the Napoleonic wars, are a string of thoughtful, often witty artworks. A monolith that looks as if it were made from glue and plastic stands alone on a mowed hill, facing the sea. Approaching, you read the words “Curse dissolved”. That’s heartening. The brochure describes this piece by South African artist Dineo Seshee Raisibe Bopape as “meditative” but it made me laugh. What is the curse? Who lifted it?View image in fullscreenInfinite sorrow … Red Erratic by Dorothy Cross at Folkestone Triennial.Photograph: Thierry BalI chew on this as I climb to a white circular tower inside which Katie Paterson also plays with magic. Paterson shows, on curving display tables inside the round room where red-coated soldiers once lived, a collection of mystic charms from different times and places. There are images of ancient Egyptian gods, Buddhist amulets and a tiny figure of the Mesopotamian demon Pazuzu who features in The Exorcist.Each replica is cast in materials that bear witness to planetary crisis, including space debris from satellites and plastic from the Mariana trench. Paterson has a track record of working with scientists to get her hands on such exotic materials.

It makes you look out to the sea below and imagine the threatened life it holds.There are jollities to be found in this seaside art trail – for the kids, Monster Chetwynd has started building an adventure playground, and down in the harbour you can get Emeka Ogboh’s “artist designed ice-cream”. But then I find huge burial urns littered in the high moorland overlooking the misty Channel. Sara Trillo has modelled these deathly objects on bronze age grave goods.

Simply to see visiting fans in red jerseys wandering down Queen Street in central Brisbane is to be thankful the whole enterprise has a beating heart once again, in contrast to South Africa four years ago when a Covid-disrupted, spectator-free experience sapped everyone’s spirits.Because a Lions tour is nothing without a human element, enticed back every four years by the fabled steepness of the challenge. “This is our Everest, boys,” growled Jim Telfer back in 1997 and, as usual, the master coach was right. On only three occasions in the past 50 years has a Lions squad returned home triumphant and, for now, a series win remains the holy grail for the professional egg chasers of England, Ireland, Scotland and, if selected, Wales.Johnny Sexton backs ‘flash’ Finn Russell to produce his best on first Lions startRead moreAs expectancy levels rise again, though, there is one nagging caveat which grows increasingly hard to sidestep. The Wallabies are currently languishing down at sixth in the World Rugby rankings and, consequently, nobody can recall a Lions squad being shorter-odds favourites anywhere, anytime. Beating Australia right now, some argue, would be less a case of scaling Everest than taking a leisurely amble along Bondi Beach.Even the Lions have been talking aloud about gunning for a 3-0 clean sweep and, in the process, creating a chunky slice of history. All their three series wins from their past 12 attempts have been by a margin of 2-1; it is necessary to scroll right back to 1974 to find a properly rampant Lions side who, in a four-Test series against South Africa, won three Tests and drew the last.All of which makes Saturday’s first Test particularly significant. If the Lions romp to a 30-point victory, it will inevitably stoke the debate about whether they should look at touring elsewhere in 12 years’ time. If, on the other hand, theWallabies replicate their Twickenhamboilover at England’s expense in November, fresh existential questions may start to be asked about the Lions themselves: are they now an overblown vanity project whose raison d’être, in the fast-changing modern world, is fraying?So, no pressure. If a Lions series really is the pinnacle of the sport then, bluntly, the quality of the on-field action needs to justify the billing. The Lions may have shrugged off theirpre-departure defeat to Argentinain Dublin but that result has been thrown into sharp relief by England’s recent2-0 away series win over the Pumas. Similarly, the Wallabies were on the brink of going down to Fiji earlier this month.Assessing the Lions’ tour games in Australia so far has been equally tricky: five wins from five outings, 32 tries scored, nine against, top-drawer opposition conspicuously absent. There have been flashes of excellence but not quite enough to guarantee a happy ending once the real stuff kicks off at the atmospheric Suncorp Stadium.View image in fullscreenTom Lynagh is the son of Australian rugby union great, Michael.Photograph: Darren England/AAPIt leaves both teams holding out for a hero. And if there is one showman equipped to dominate the stage it is surely Finn Russell, the Bath and Scotland fly-half now auditioning to be the Lions wizard in Oz. Some great 10s have worn the red jersey down the years and Russell has his chance to join the fly-half pantheon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since then he has become a catalyst who regularly shapes games to his personal will. Operating flat to the gainline, seeing space no one else can, fizzing out wide passes, dinking on the money cross-kicks to his wingers … the 32-year-old has become the complete package. To the point where if he was wearing gold this weekend the bookies’ odds would be much less definitive.And if that heaps still more pressure on the shoulders of the 22-year-old Tom Lynagh, making his first start for the land of his distinguished father, that is the harsh reality of elite Test rugby. Give Russell some quick ball, with his Scotland teammates Sione Tuipulotu and Huw Jones at his elbow, and the Lions really could ask some penetrating questions, with Tommy Freeman and James Lowe both ready to apply the finishing gloss.The Wallabies’ biggest challenge, then, will be to cut the supply lines to both Russell and Jamison Gibson-Park, his equally sharp partner in crime at half-back. And the longer they can do so, the more they will fancy their chances. It is no point pretending the loss of the injured Rob Valetini, Will Skelton et al is not a blow but Joe Schmidt is invariably a man with a plan and the presence on the bench of some potentially lively impact replacements is no coincidence.The Lions’ selection has been slightly more conservative, with the emphasis placed squarely on a forceful, physical start. History would suggest they need one; on their past three tours the widest margin either way in a Lions first Test has been five points. You also have to go back to 2001 and Jason Robinson sensationally skinning Chris Latham on the outside in this very city inside the opening three minutes for an example of a Lions team cutting loose from the outset.This one could be another slow burner unless, say, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii can jump high to steal an early restart and set the tone for a more frenetic kind of contest. The Lions defence has been well organised so far but Suaalii’s aerial ability is in another dimension.The Wallabies have also picked Jake Gordon at scrum-half for his tactical acumen while the new cap Nick Champion de Crespigny will be bursting to impress on the flank. If he goes well and Australia get over the line, brace yourself for the “Champion the Wonder Horse” headlines.It all lends this first Test a distinctly series-shaping feel. In South Africa the Lions won the opener only to surrender the remaining two, a pattern that feels unlikely this time around. The onus, accordingly, is on Australia to channel the power and the passion of Midnight Oil at their finest and make one or two Lions eat their confident words. In that event all those bullish pre-series predictions will be blown away like so many discarded pie wrappers. Farewell to Bondi and welcome back to Everest the hard way.More likely is a tense initial tussle, at least for the first hour. But what if Farrell’s team have been holding back their best? Or if the Wallabies cannot lay a glove on the artful Russell? Win the first Test well and, at the very least, the travelling sea of red will be up and roaring. At which point the idea of a 3-0 series outcome will morph from banter into a serious possibility.Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025British & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Imagine he really cared. Scottie Scheffler used media duties before the 153rd Open Championship to assess the pointlessness of golf in thegrand scheme of life. “If I win, it’s going to be awesome for two minutes,” Scheffler asserted. The world No 1 should already prepare for his 120 seconds of ecstasy. There is an air of inevitability about Scheffler cradling the Claret Jug with only half of this tournament gone. It will be a shock should he not win from here.Matt Fitzpatrick had the elements to contend with for spells on Friday afternoon. Next came Scheffler, marauding in the rear view mirror, which for a golfer is more troublesome than anything that drops from the sky. Fitzpatrick had only just signed his scorecard for a 66 and nine under total as Scheffler poured in a birdie putt at the 17th. Ten under par.‘Still not sure’: Shane Lowry casts doubt over two-shot penalty decision at OpenRead moreScheffler had the good grace to leave an opportunity from 15ft on the last just short of the jaws of the hole. Things are at least still mildly interesting. It was just that Scheffler’s 64, the lowest of this Open so far, felt ominous for pretenders to his throne.Fitzpatrick believes he reached a professional nadir at this year’s Players Championship. There, he was badly struggling for form and answers. His recent touch has been far more impressive and at least akin to the golfer who scaled theUS Open mountainat Brookline in 2022. Fitzpatrick’s only frustration arrived from a missed birdie putt, all 3ft of it, on the penultimate hole. Given Scheffler’s mood, that could prove significant.“I wouldn’t say I necessarily feel as much pressure,” said Fitzpatrick of a Saturday tee time with Scheffler. “He’s going to have the expectation to go out and dominate. He’s an exceptional player. He’s world No 1 and we’re seeing Tiger-like stuff. I think the pressure is for him to win the golf tournament. For me, obviously I hope I’m going to have some more home support than him but it’s an exciting position for me to be in given where I was earlier this year.”Fitzpatrick also addressed timekeeping, after rounds stretched to close to six hours on day one. “I do think it’s ridiculous,” he said. “The pace of play has been a combination of the way the golf course is, reachable par fives and all that normal stuff. But it starts with the players as well and starts with the rules officials.”Brian Harman had made the second-round running, his 65 putting him eight under atop the leaderboard at lunchtime. Li Haotong reached minus nine after 12 but was to tie Harman’s aggregate. Harmanwon the Open in 2023and has done precious little over the intervening 24 months. Cue further questions about Harman’s fondness for hunting; animals, not golf titles. Li’s victory in Qatar in February was his first for three years.View image in fullscreenMatt Fitzpatrick is a shot behind the leader Scottie Scheffler after a second round 66.Photograph: Oisin Keniry/R&A/Getty ImagesRory McIlroy was long gone by the time Fitzpatrick and Scheffler negotiated the closing stretch. The Masters champion has achieved his first target of Open week by surviving for the closing 36 holes, something he failed to accomplish here in 2019. McIlroy’s 69 for a three-under total has given hope to the vast galleries that have followed him. Saturday promises to deliver more of the Rory Roar.“I’ve been somewhat close to my best over the first two days in little bits here and there,” McIlroy said. “I’m going to need to have it all under control and have it sort of all firing over the weekend to make a run.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was 20 years ago that I played the North of Ireland here and never in my wildest dreams did I think that I’d be coming back as a grand slam champion with the support of a nation behind me trying to win an Open Championship. I count myself very grateful and very lucky that I’m in this position. I’m excited for the weekend.”So too is Keegan Bradley. While playing what he describes as the golf of his life, Bradley appears ready to play in and captain the US Ryder Cup team at Bethpage in September. This will be a dual role of genius or lunacy, depending on the result against Europe. Bradley is also three under. His 67 was bogey free. Chris Gotterup, who won the Scottish Open on Sunday, continues to ride the wave. He is five under in the company of Harris English, Bob MacIntyre, Rasmus Højgaard and Tyrrell Hatton.Nobody who has made the cut can be completely ruled out of winning this major. Should Scheffler have an unlikely stumble, that is. The leaderboard is the most congested thing in Portrush, which takes quite some doing. Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm and Viktor Hovland are even par. Tommy Fleetwood is one better off. The defending champion Xander Schauffele is two under. Bryson DeChambeau spent Thursday retrieving balls from the A2 to Coleraine yet blasted back to breeze into the weekend with a 65. Good old Bryson, never dull.Those to make an early exit from Northern Ireland included Cameron Smith, whose decline in this environment since making a move to the LIV Tour has been incredible, Adam Scott, Collin Morikawa, Padraig Harrington and Min Woo Lee.

It took until the 66th minute for the tournament favourites to find a way through, Athenea del Castillo and Clàudia Pina each striking in a five-minute, second-half spell to crush gentle rumblings of a possible upset.Are Spain pacing themselves or sleepwalking to a deafening alarm call?Read more“We managed to secure a spot in the semi finals, the team made history, these players made history,” said their manager, Montse Tomé.It had been a game of hope, Mariona Caldentey’s missed penalty and Livia Peng’s save from an Alèxia Putellas’s spot-kick sandwiching the goals that contributed to the feeling that something special might be on the cards.Special did not come, but so much more has in these two weeks. There is the embracing of a team and a tournament and then there is the embracing of women’s football as a whole, a collective opening up to the historic injustice of underfunding and a lack of support. Both have taken place in Switzerland. This is a country that has opened its eyes, and its hearts, to the battling “Nati” who have taken them on an emotional journey. The last-gasp equaliser against Finland to set up a quarter-final with the world champions was a moment of euphoric celebration that could be heard echoing from homes and bars up and down the country and inspired a huge fan walk of 25,000 to the Stadion Wankdorf.But this is also a country that wants more, that wants to back these women whose faces adorn all sorts of adverts and are emblazoned across the backs of shirts in greater and greater numbers every day. “Here to stay,” read one small banner in the red block behind the Swiss goal. “This is just the beginning,” read another.“We lost the game but we’ve won a positive attitude for women’s football,” said their manager, Pia Sundhage. “I’m very, very proud of Switzerland, if you look at the people coming to the games it’s been phenomenal, very very emotional, and they didn’t leave, they stayed.”It is the type of reaction and level of support Spain long for, their World Cup success celebrated back home in the immediate aftermath but failing to trigger a step-change in the cultural fabric of the country and its impact on attitudes towards women’s football. There was a nod to their struggles above the small section of Spanish fans, a banner reading: “Estamos con Jenni H” (“We are with Jenni Hermoso”) next to another which said: “Abuchea el sexismo! #seacabo” (“Down with sexism #itsover”), the legacy of the kiss forced on forward Hermoso by the then Spanish football federation president, Luis Rubiales, during the World Cup trophy presentation.View image in fullscreenMariona Caldentey can’t bear to look after missing a penalty inside the first 10 minutes for Spain.Photograph: Daniela Porcelli/Getty ImagesThe task in Berne was a big one for the hosts, the biggest perhaps. Spain had earned three large wins over the Swiss in 2023, scoring 17 and conceding twice, in the World Cup and then two Nations League games. Pia Sundhage’s side set up in a back five, with the Arsenal defensive midfielder Wälti between the centre-backs as an extra protection.Few had given Switzerland any chance of being able to compete with Tomé’s passing dynamos and they should have been behind in the eighth minute, Nadine Riesen’s late challenge on Mariona Caldentey conceding a penalty, but the Arsenal forward placed her spot-kick wide of the upright. It was the stroke of luck that the Swiss needed, the cow bells and drums drowned out by the thunder roll from the crowd as the ball thumped the hoarding.Wälti was magnificent for the Swiss, tirelessly shifting between the midfield and defence as they chased and harried and frustrated their opponents. That they reached half-time with the game goalless was a remarkable achievement. Irene Paredes’s header off the outside of the post shortly before the break was the closest the favourites would go.Athenea del Castillo profileThe crowd acting as the 12th man is a cliche, but in the cauldron of red, as every clearance, tackle, turnover, foul, even pass, received a deafening roar, it was hard not to feel that it was fuelling the players in white and adding to the frustrations of the Spanish. Spain were patient though, poking away at the wall of white, which they breached twice in the space of five minutes. “I was calm, I was confident, sometimes you have to fight,” said Aitana Bonmatí. It required a moment of magic from the two-time Ballon d’Or winner to set up Del Castillo. The second was a stunner too. Pina clipped the ball from the feet of Wälti, who was convinced she was fouled and paused to protest, and then fired into the top corner from 20 yards.There was drama late on, as Peng saved from Putellas after Beney conceded a penalty for a challenge on Del Castillo and Noelle Maritz was shown a red card in injury time, but it mattered little.Spain march into the semi-finals, ready to face the winner of Saturday’s quarter-final between Germany and France.“We accomplished our goal and now we have to keep improving,” said Tomé. Switzerland, though, march into an exciting future. “Football is important for society and women’s football is important for society,” said Sundhage. “Women’s football has changed Switzerland a little bit.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamSwitzerland women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

She told the Guardian she could scarcely watch the penalties.From penalty taker to physio: Lucy Bronze is England’s Swiss army knifeRead more“I’ve lost the charger for my Fitbit but if it had been on, I think my heart rate would have been through the roof,” she said. “I just kept hiding behind the people in front of me because I could not look. I was so nervous because, to fight back like that and then to have lost on penalties would have been so much more painful, after they’d done so much.“I didn’t even realise we’d won when it was over, because there had been so many missed penalties, so I didn’t realise until all the players ran over and jumped on Hannah [Hampton, the goalkeeper]. Then everyone was jumping on top of each other and it was pure joy. But I was crying at the same time because I was so happy. I could not believe that they had done it. I was so proud.”Another fan cheering on the Lionesses was Nathalie Durgnat, who was born and raised in Switzerland but supports Arsenal and England. Durgnat joined in with England’s fan walk to the stadium, during which the supporter favourites such as Neil Diamond’s Sweet Caroline were sung through the streets of Zurich. “It was really something,” she said. “I’ve been to a lot of football matches in my life because I’m over 40, but I have rarely experienced such drama. There was everything in that game. At first, everyone was kind of in disbelief, because Sweden were really good. Then, when England tied it to make it 2-2 with two goals in two minutes, it was absolute madness in the stands.“I have no words for what happened in the penalty shootout. I was so tense and so nervous, going through the rollercoaster of emotions. But I’m glad I was there. The resilience, the belief in themselves and the way they never give up, no matter what, feels very English to me.”England, the defending champions, will now meet Italy in Geneva on Tuesday for a place in the final. Holden-Morris, who has been following the Lionesses since the 2019 World Cup, said: “They’ve showed that champions, even when they don’t have their best day, can find a way to win. I’m hopeful we can get to a final and win it. If we can come back from last night’s situation, we can do anything.”The late-night drama attracted a peak audience of 7.4 million viewers on BBC One, the highest figures of Euro 2025 so far. That represented a 65% audience share and there were also nearly 3m online streams of the match across BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The team pays you to win, and there’s a big team behind me that supports me and that works every single day of their career to come to the Tour, to win the Tour. If there is an opportunity, you go for it. You can’t say no to a stage in the Tour.“When I finish my career, I will probably not speak to 99% of the peloton. I will focus on my close friends and family. You win and people start to already think about the next win, or you’re winning too much. You need to enjoy the moment, what you’re sacrificing for, and not care too much about what everybody else thinks.”The Slovenian has now opened a yawning divide between himself and the rest of the peloton thanks to back-to-back summit finishes.At Hautacamhe took two minutes and 10 seconds out of Vingegaard in 12km; as he crossed the line at the Pyrenean altiport, he had further distanced the Dane and now leads overall by four minutes and seven seconds. With Vingegaard three minutes ahead of the third-placed Remco Evenepoel, only six riders are now within 10 minutes of Pogacar.View image in fullscreenPogacar reacts as he crosses the finish line.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters“I didn’t have the legs I wanted,” a drained Evenepoel said. “Within a few minutes of starting, I just felt empty. I’m pretty disappointed.”Scotland’s Oscar Onley remains stubbornly in contention for a high finish, climbing up to fifth place, after finishing seventh on the stage. “I was suffering a bit after yesterday,” Onley said, “but we’re all suffering. With the steep runway at the end, you really had to hold back a bit. It wasn’t an easy time trial to manage.”With Pogacar almost out of sight, the real battle now may be for the podium. Primoz Roglic, who began the Tour saying his main interest was in getting to Paris and drinking champagne, is now progressing steadily up the overall standings. The 35-year-old, famously toppled by Pogacarin the 2020 Tour’s final time trialwhen on the verge of overall victory, set the best time on the 10.9km test until first Vingegaard, and then inevitably, Pogacar, surpassed him.Meanwhile, the French sprinter Bryan Coquard, the rider who collided with Jasper Philipsen on stage three and caused the Belgian sprinter to crash out of the race, has himself decided to quit the Tour after breaking bones in his right hand while trying to take his food bag from a team helper during Thursday’s stage to Hautacam.View image in fullscreenPrimoz Roglic is urged on during the stage.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesCoquard rode the time trial with his right hand heavily strapped and then stepped off the bike to leave the race and head home for surgery. “I wanted to ride the time trial today, but for the sake of safety, I can’t start tomorrow,” he said. “I can’t brake with my right hand, which isn’t an issue racing alone in an uphill time trial, but in the peloton, that’s obviously dangerous.”With Pogacar in such imperious form, the race organisation remains keen to emphasise that all is still to play for. The truth is that Vingegaard will need much more of a spring in his step if he is to stay even within touching distance of his rival.Pogacarwon the 2024 Giro d’Italiaby just under 10 minutes and also took six stages. The time trials may be done with, but with four summit finishes still to come, this could become the Slovenian’s most emphatic Grand Tour victory to date.Meanwhile, Roglic is not the only one already thinking of Paris. The dancers from the Moulin Rouge have announced that they will take to the street and dance the can-can as the peloton passes through Montmartre on the final stage. Maybe Roglic will jump off, raise a flute and join in.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceTadej PogacarCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Probably more than you would expect after a briefly absorbing quarter-final whose outcome was never seriously in doubt. The Swiss players performed the world’s slowest lap of honour. The Spanish players posed for a group photo, but it kept having to be retaken as more players arrived. OK, now one more with Aitana. Now one more with Irene. Now one with the staff. Now in portrait for the ’gram. Then the teams gave each other an honour guard off the pitch. At one point you would swear someone laid out some picnic blankets and Scotch eggs.Spain see off stubborn Swiss to reach semis despite two missed penaltiesRead moreFinally they left. And if there was a strangely ceremonial feel to the post-match perhaps it was because there was a strangely ceremonial feel to the match itself: more event than genuine contest, even as Switzerland held out for more than an hour, counted their blessings, fleetingly hoped. But there was always too much time on the clock. There were always Athenea del Castillo and Salma Paralluelo and Vicky López to come on. There was always one more attack to weather, one more shot to block, one more ricochet that had to bounce just right.Did the end vindicate Spain’s leisurely means? Certainly they appeared a good deal more relaxed than you might have imagined for a team who hadn’t qualified for the last four of this competition since 1997. And you can judge for yourself whether this is a source of reassurance or concern: a team imperiously pacing themselves, or one sleepwalking towards a deafening alarm call? For now, their supremacy has not been seriously challenged. France or Germany may have bolder ideas.You could even glimpse this languor in the buildup, a stark contrast with the fever and fervour of the host country.“It is the biggest game ever, it’s once in a lifetime,” said Switzerland coach Pia Sundhage.“We’ll have to be very alert,” said Spain’s Irene Paredes.“It’s indescribable, it’s incredible,” said Switzerland’s Noelle Maritz.“We know this is an important game,” said the Spain coach, Montse Tomé.View image in fullscreenClàudia Pina enjoys the moment after putting Spain 2-0 up in the second half against Switzerland.Photograph: Sports Press Photo/Getty ImagesThe Wankdorf is exactly how you would imagine a Swiss football stadium to be: a perfectly rectangular metal box plonked out by the motorway and fitted with comfortable ergonomic seating. But it was ideal for its one real job: noise retention, and for 65 increasingly intriguing minutes Spain too were being boxed in, thwarted, contained, by a home side gradually daring to believe.Mariona Caldentey’s early missed penalty set the tone, and though Switzerland were barely able to exit their own territory the game progressed with few other scares. Spain were simply not quick enough, not urgent enough, perhaps even a little dead behind the eyes. Too many aimless diagonals, too many speculative shots from the 20-yard range, and as half-time came and went a kind of simmering frustration, too. Caldentey ended the game without having created a single chance, Aitana Bonmatí just one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bonmatí’s sublime backheel for Del Castillo’s goal was the touch of genius of which she is always capable, the reason you can never sleep on her, the reason you can never sleep on Spain. On the touchline Sundhage stood a little sadly in her trackie top and shorts, looking as ever like a pensioner on the regional news protesting against the closure of her local leisure centre.Tomé, by contrast, was wearing the sort of immaculately tailored suit you see on someone who is about to sell you a very expensive perfume. And the arrival of the bench backup was the cue for Spain to turn on the class. Soon it was two through Clàudia Pina, and although Alexia Putellas’s late penalty miss kept the score down, it had long been evident that there would be no second Miracle of Bern.So ends Swiss Girl Summer 2025: a fiesta of packed stadiums and viral dances, last-minute goals and vivid dreams. Swiss television viewing figures on SRF have been staggering, the sort normally associated with Roger Federer in a Wimbledon final. There are new teenage stars to fete in Sydney Schertenleib and Noemi Ivelj and Iman Beney. And the progress of a proudly multicultural squad – half of whom have roots abroad – has captivated a nation bearing the same fraught relationship with immigration that you seem to find everywhere these days.So you can understand why they wanted to enjoy their moment. They lingered, they unfurled a thank-you banner to the fans, they beamed and waved, soaking up the last of this joy, the last of this shared energy. In many ways this was the easy part: the hard bit comes now, the tough and thorny and thankless work of actually building a sport in the foothills. The window of opportunity has closed for now. But with a little care and a little love, the light can still get in.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamSwitzerland women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

She was, in her words, “absolutely exhausted” in it, hairband round her neck, shirt crumpled, hair awry, the physical, emotional and mental pain of the preceding 90 minutes visible.That photo represents so much to Bronze, England’s stalwart right-back who no one has come close to replacing and likely never will. “I will give anything and I will give everything when I play in an England shirt,” she says of the image of her at her most broken. “I wanted all the girls to know that that’s my why. My why is to give everything for this team because I just love playing for England so much.”England go from shambles to euphoria as self-belief somehow sees off Sweden | Jonathan LiewRead moreOn Thursday night, at the Stadion Letzigrund that Bronze had spent the afternoon replicating in Lego with Michelle Agyemang, the veteran defender encapsulated her why, delivering for the Lionesses when it mattered most. Bronze was left with an array of new photos to choose from: standing arms wide in the first half, pleading for a diagonal ball that could unlock a path into Sweden’s half on the right; powering in her header from the substitute Chloe Kelly’s cross from the left to halve the two-goal deficit, then kicking an advertising hoarding in a show of emotion; taking tape out of the team doctor’s bag to tightly strap her own thigh deep into extra time before ripping the remains of the tape away; and dispatching England’s final spot-kick in thetensest and most chaotic of shootoutsat a speed of 102.51kph.“I just felt a little bit tight at the end of the game and I thought: ‘I just need to get through to make sure I can keep going,’” Bronze said of the self-treatment.“But then I thought: ‘It’s going to hinder me in a penalty.’ I didn’t expect it to go to the sixth penalty, so I didn’t take it off and then it was my penalty and I thought: ‘I need to take this off, I’m going to smack it.’”View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze’s collision with the advertising board after scoring for England against Sweden.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Getty ImagesBeth Mead said: “Lucy was chaotic. A lot going on. With her taping her leg up she became a physio, [then] she became a striker and nailed the best penalty of the day. She did it all. Lucy really showed her experience in those moments. She’s our most experienced England player and she was one of the players that very much got that determination out of us all today.”Bronze’s message to Hannah Hampton before she stepped up to take her spot-kick was concise. “I literally said to Hannah: ‘I’ll score this, you save the next one: game over,’” Bronze told Sky Sports, ice strapped to her right thigh, some kind of recovery device attached to a calf, as she marshalled Agyemang through the mixed zone, prompting her follow goalscorer to speak, coaching her through this high-interest new world after the 19-year-old’s phenomenal introduction to the senior side.It is not the first time Bronze has done this: it was the 33-year-old who virtually grabbed Lauren James by the scruff of the neck after the forward’s player-of-the-match performance in the 2023 Arnold Clark Cup and told her she had to speak to the press, doing the interview alongside her, encouraging her.It was also Bronze who stepped forward after the humbling2-1 loss to Francein England’s opening game of these Euros and rallied the side. She leaned into her Lionesses history to help the squad over the psychological hurdle of, in effect, being straight into knockout football by sharing that, after a loss to France in the opening game of the 2015 World Cup, the team went on to come third, their best finish in that competition up to then.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m a very lucky person that I’ve worked with so many incredible people and incredible football players, and there are so, so many, but what she does, her mentality, and how she took that penalty and the goal … She gets it in the net, but that’s not what defines her. What defines her is that resilience, that fight. I think the only way to get her off the pitch is in a wheelchair.”Turning 34 in October, Bronze is edging nearer to her career’s close, but she is fighting the end, forcing it further and further into the future with each exhilarating performance. But it is not just the performances that matter. Bronze’s experience and influence are significant and vital as the next generation comes through.

These were just some of the headlines that emerged in the aftermath of Germany’sbruising 4-1 defeatat the hands of Sweden in their final Group C match.In just a matter of days, the optimism surrounding Germany’s chances has seemingly dissipated. Despite qualifying for the quarter-finals with a game to spare, Christian Wück’s side have looked far from cohesive and defensively frail. They were also exposed by a Sweden attack that understood how to exploit their weaknesses. Carlotta Wamser’s red card was certainly a factor but there are long-standing structural issues that should be a cause for concern with an in-form France to come on Saturday in Basel.The loss to Sweden was the heaviest defeat Germany have suffered at a European Championship. As a result, the manager has found himself on the end of mounting criticism back home. Sportschau.de highlighted Wück’s failure to react to “the emerging disaster” while Bild pointed to the lack of world-class options in the squad. “The bitter truth is: we have postponed development and need to act urgently!” Robert Schreier wrote.Quick GuideFrance v Germany: last three meetingsShowGermany 2-1 France, 27 July 2022, Milton Keynes“I can’t put it into words … we threw everything in,” said the Germany captain, Alexandra Popp, after powering her side into the Euro 2022 final. Her double in Milton Keynes ended France’s run and continued her streak of scoring in every game she played in the tournament. Kadidiatou Diani led France’s response, her shot rebounding off the post and in off the goalkeeper Merle Frohms. A stunning save from Pauline Peyraud-Magnin kept France in it, and the defending was admirable, but Popp’s unstoppable header proved the difference.Germany 2-1 France, 7 October 2022, DresdenGermany kicked off their World Cup preparations with a show of strength in Dresden. Before kick-off, players huddled around Giulia Gwinn’s shirt - a nod to their injured teammate – and channelled that spirit into a dominant display. Popp rose for her 60th international goal, then slid in a second. France pulled one back from the spot, but Germany’s defence held firm. Surrounded by flags and home support, they looked sharp, united and ready.France 2-1 Germany, 23 February 2024, LyonFrance ended a five-year drought against Germany in front of a record 30,000 crowd in Lyon, edging a fierce Nations League semi-final. Diani opened with a thunderous strike from the edge of the box, before Sakina Karchaoui added a second from the spot. Germany pulled one back through Gwinn’s penalty, with Popp driving them forward, but France held on for a long-overdue win.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since he took over the reins after their bronze medal-winning run at Paris 2024, Wück has instilled a strong offensive style of play compared to his predecessor Horst Hrubesch. It has produced notable wins – the4-3 victoryover England at Wembley is just one example – while the 26 goals scored in their Nations League campaign caught the eye.So far this tournament, however, the German attack is yet to reach its devastating best even though Wück has a wealth of creative players to call on. There have been glimpses of their brilliance. Jule Brand’s opener against Sweden was an illustration of the pace and directness this side is built on, with her and Klara Bühl’s ability to stretch defences on show. Along with the instinctive goalscoring of Lea Schüller, they will be eyeing up the relatively young French central defensive partnership, particularly if Griedge Mbock remains absent.View image in fullscreenGermany were handed a heavy defeat by Sweden in Group C’s final match.Photograph: Francesco Farina/SPP/ShutterstockThe biggest concern for Germany before the meeting with their old rivals will be how easily they can be broken down while there are also concerns around the form of the goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. Polandgave them a scarein the opener but lacked end product.It was a different story against Sweden. Even before the sending-off, their problems were exposed for the world to see, particularly for Stina Blackstenius’s equaliser. With the left-back Sarai Linder caught high and the rest of the defensive unit following the ball in the initial phase, the striker had acres of grass to break into before punishing them with the finish.France’s ability in wide areas is one of their most potent weapons. With two goals and two assists, Delphine Cascarino has been a standout success and many will remember what she did to England’s left sidein the opener. Down the other wing, Sandy Baltimore will pounce on any weakness.Germany’s problems in these areas are compounded by the loss of their right-back and captain, Giulia Gwinn, to a knee injury and now the suspension of her back-up Wamser. It leaves Wück forced to move the pieces on the chessboard, shifting Linder out to the right with Franziska Kett the most likely option to come in on the other side. If so, it will be a huge ask of a 20-year-old who made just seven appearances in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFranziska Kett profileWhile Wück can rue his bad luck for Gwinn’s injury, Germany’s lack of defensive depth is largely of his own making. The high-profile dropping of the experienced left-back Felicitas Rauch – which she only discovered on social media – was a sign that all might not be completely well in the camp. The 33-year-old defender Sara Doorsun was told she would only be on the waiting list for the tournament and promptly retired.His apparent refusal to address the issues has added to the increased concern. While he shifted to three at the back in the second half against Sweden, that seemed more down to circumstances forcing his hand. “It would be wrong if we would say we only want to react and destroy,” he said afterwards. “I have the wrong players [for that]. It isn’t in the nature of the team to stand in the back [park the bus] and try to keep a clean sheet or a draw and not try anything up front”.Nevertheless, given his short time in the job, there is a feeling that he will survive whatever happens. The former goalkeeper and current ARD pundit Almuth Schult said: “I don’t think it’s going to be close for him yet”, in terms of his job being on the line. There is no doubt, however, that should they lose, the pressure will continue to escalate given the high expectations of a nation that has won this competition eight times.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballFrance women's football teamGermany women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their gazes are empty. There are tears running down several players’ cheeks. They embrace in an attempt to understand what has just happened. The disappointment cuts through like a knife.”England had been favourites going into the quarter-final but were second-best in the first half. Lauren Hemp did hit the bar for the Lionesses but the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton had to make several smart saves to prevent Sweden going 3-0 up.There was a lot of criticism for the selection of penalty takers with the 18-year-old Smilla Holmberg being asked to take the seventh for the Swedes. There were several more experienced players who had not taken one by that time. Holmberg missed and was reduced to tears.The former Sweden international Lotta Schelin, commentating on TV, felt the decision was inexplicable. “My first thought is that you should not put that pressure on an 18-year-old,” she said. “We had players such as Madelen Janogy and Lina Hurtig who could have stepped up. It feels very tough and unfair.”Holmberg was supported by all her teammates. “It is fantastic that she takes that responsibility, she should be proud,” said Rebecka Blomqvist while Janogy added: “It is very hard to see her so upset. We will just look after her and praise her because she is so incredibly cool.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a harsh and pitiless business and earlier this week, at the end of a long afternoon answering the same old questions in front of a line of television cameras, Usyk sat down with a small group of familiar faces who have written about him for years. During his last assignment for the day he opened up a little more as he spoke about the sacrifices boxing demands.He told us how much he wanted to see his wife, Yekaterina, as she had just flown into London and they would be reunited that evening. Three months had passed, in a gruelling training camp, since they had been together and Usyk spoke about missing her and their four children.Cherished champion and statesman: Usyk focuses on Ukraine before titlesRead more“It’s always been very difficult but I keep in mind that I have to be focused on training and I chose this path to be who I am now,” Usyk said before pointing out it was even harder for his family. “Sometimes we have to give away things to get even better things. And sometimes it’s the people around us, that are closest to us, who pay the price.”I asked Usyk if he was able to call or FaceTime Yekaterina most days while preparing forbattle on Saturday night with Daniel Dubois. “Yes, of course,” he said. “I’m always calling my wife early in the morning when our young daughter wakes up. She always wants to see her daddy. It’s in the morning and evening, sometimes even at lunchtime when there’s a break.”Usyk denied that such long and enforced separations from his family would influence his decision as to when he might retire. “It doesn’t impact my thinking,” he said. “When I was very little [and living in Simferopol, the Crimean city annexed by Russia in 2014] my family was quite poor and sometimes there would be no money to even buy some bread. Now I’m working so hard so that my kids will have not just bread but butter.”He smiled wryly, for Usyk has made so many millions out of boxing. But at the age of 38, the unbeaten world heavyweight champion is approaching the last days of his remarkable career. He admitted he might have only “two [more fights] left. This one and the next. I don’t know who that will be against because now my focus is only Daniel on Saturday.”Usyk is a highly intelligent man who is awarethis world title unification boutat Wembley Stadium is laced with jeopardy and an element of unpredictability. Dubois, who was gifted Usyk’s IBF version of his otherwise undisputed collection of belts by boxing politics last year, brings a new confidence and enduring power to the ring. He is also 11 years younger than Usyk and has improved greatly since the two men met in the ring for the first time in August 2023.Dubois looked formidable in his most recent fight 10 months ago when hebattered Anthony Joshuawith bludgeoning force and dropped him four times to the canvas before the referee rescued his more famous victim. So it would not be a complete shock if Dubois’ destructive force stopped an ageing Usyk in his tracks. But it would still be a surprise – especially asUsyk fights with such fervour on behalf of Ukraineduring an unremitting war against the Russian onslaught.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Usyk defeated Daniel Dubois in the ninth round in August 2023.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersThe hope, which has grown markedly amongst Dubois and his backers in recent months,centres on the one punchwith which he dropped Usyk in the fifth round of that first bout almost two years ago. Dubois unleashed a hard right hand that landed on the beltline. The referee ruled it an illegal blow and Usyk slumped to the canvas and took full advantage as he recovered for more than four minutes. But perhaps the Ukrainian would have risen to his feet before the count of eight had the referee seen it as the legitimate punch which Dubois, his corner and many neutral observers appeared to witness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDubois now believes he can capitalise and deliver punches of similar ferocity to both the head and body. Usyk, he insists, will crumple and relinquish his WBA, WBC and WBO titles. But if so much store is being placed in a single blow it seems right to pay equal attention to the rest of that first bout in Poland. Usyk, having dominated the early rounds, soon reclaimed his supremacy as he pummelled Dubois into a ninth-round submission. At that stage Usyk was far in front on all three scorecards – with two judges having him seven points ahead while the third saw a five-point difference.Usyk had simply been too intelligent, skilful and tough. He was obviously the superior fighter and it seems a stretch to imagine that so much will have changed in the intervening 23 months to allow Dubois to prevail. “Daniel has got better and now he has a championship belt,” Usyk acknowledged. “But I haven’t been staying in one place either. I’ve been growing too.”It should be remembered that Uysk endured two hard world title fights against Tyson Fury last year. Such ring wars drain even great fighters but Usyk’s sheer ringcraft, and savvy, mean that he is almost always better in rematches. He has a boxing brain like a computer and, having faced Dubois before, he will be attuned even more sharply to the dangers. Dubois, urged on by his trainer Don Charles who favours an aggressive, come-forward style, will seek to impose his size and power and hasten the end of Usyk’s fading days in the ring.But the suspicion remains that the Ukrainian master still has enough wizardry to repel the threat and win a clear decision. Usyk’s long and unbeaten career will reach a shuddering conclusion, eventually, but it’s unlikely to be against Dubois on a fevered night at Wembley.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsykfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is one of the reasons why Michael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track is yet to catch alight: the pay is great for the athletes, but a win or loss counts for little in the overall scheme of a season or career.The much-maligned Diamond League has fought against such (ir)relevance throughout its existence. In such a context, it is a notable achievement that the London leg of athletics’ premier season-long competition is a 60,000 sellout for what could turn out to be a thunderstorm-threatened Saturday afternoon.Those spectators bought tickets long before the inevitable drip, drip of high-profile withdrawals that is a common occurrence outside the major championships that define the sport.Marathon world record holder Ruth Chepngetich suspended over banned substanceRead moreTheBBC Sports Personality of the Year Keely Hodgkinsonwas slated to headline the meeting, but pulled out at the start of the week as she continues her recovery from a hamstring injury. She is yet to compete sincewinning Olympic 800m goldlast August. Joining her among the list of absentees is Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who was supposed to face off with 1500m rival and reigning world champion Josh Kerr. Distance-running great Sifan Hassan also withdrew from the mile a few days ago.The loss of such high-profile stars is not ideal in a week that has seen Kenyan marathon world record-holderRuth Chepngetich provisionally suspendedafter testing positive for a banned diuretic and masking agent. By the start of this month, Kenya had 139 people on the Athletics Integrity Unit’s banned list – more than double any country aside from India.However, withdrawals and suspensions are familiar territory for a capacity crowd who will make the London Diamond League the largest single-day athletics meet in the world by some margin. In return, they will still be treated to one of the strongest assemblies of athletes outside a global championships.Shorn of Ingebrigtsen, the men’s 1500m could, weather-depending, bring the curtain down on proceedings in spectacular fashion, with Kerr confirming the pacemakers have been instructed to reach halfway on track for a British record. Kerr facing up against his world champion predecessor Jake Wightman and newly installed second-fastest British runner ever George Mills is an intriguing prospect.“It’s the most incredible Diamond League out there and I’m just looking to put on something that’s worth everyone’s time in the last event,” said Kerr.“It’s going to be an awesome race. I’m looking to go out there, run something fast and put something on the leaderboard that will make me proud going into the world championships.“A British record would be a great way for me to run this week. No 1 priority is to win, and you’re going to get a good enough time from that. But I’m not here for a slow race. It’s not going to be boring.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In her absence, British trio Georgia Hunter-Bell, Jemma Reekie and Laura Muir will probably battle it out for the win.Elsewhere, Noah Lyles will race over 100m for the first time since winning Olympic gold last summer. He beat Botswana’s Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo over the longer distance in Monaco last week, and both men resume their rivalry in London, although Jamaica’s Oblique Seville is the fastest man in the field this year.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He revealed that Dejan Kulusevski, who underwent knee surgery on 14 May, would not be available for the start of the season.Noni Madueke will be unfazed by new Arsenal challenge and fans’ scepticismRead moreFrank was typically friendly, if a little nervous; the packed media auditorium was a far cry from what he was used to during his seven years at his previous club, Brentford. He appeared determined to keep his cards close to his chest, to sidestep the tricky questions but his wish to live in the moment and not look too far ahead did little to convince on Son.The 33-year-old Son, who ledSpurs to Europa League glory last season– his first silverware in 10 years at the club – has 12 months on his contract. There has been no indication that Son is ready to agree to fresh terms and the chair, Daniel Levy, would surely hate to lose him as a free agent.“Good question,” Frank said, when pressed on whether Son would remain captain. “I haven’t decided anything on that. I have a long list of bullet points I need to get through and I take them in the right order.”Frank said that Son would captain the team for one half of the Reading game, with Cristian Romero, one of the vice-captains from last season, wearing the armband for the other half. Romero has been tracked by Atlético Madrid, although there are doubts as to whether the Spanish club would be able to make a compelling offer for him, which would need to be at least £60m.Frank was asked whether Son had earned the right to decide his own future. “It’s always tricky, situations like that … if that happens,” Frank said. “Right now I have a player that is fully committed and training well and will play tomorrow. If a player has been at a club a long time, then there will always be a decision for the club to take.View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min celebrates with the Europa League trophy, the first silverware he has won in his 10 years at Tottenham.Photograph: Luis Tejido/EPA“Because there is something in it if someone wants to leave at a certain stage … then there can be something there. But the club will always decide in the end. First and foremost, he’s here now. I’m not worried too much about it. Let’s take that five or six weeks down the line. That will probably [be a question] I get the following week, so I’ll practise my answers. Right now, he’s here.”Frank fell back on more than one occasion on three buzz words: he wants his team to be brave, aggressive and attacking. And while he agreed with Levy’s assertion that the ambition had to be to win the Premier League and Champions League, Frank made clear that the most pressing goal was to be competitive in all four competitions – including the Champions League, to which Spurs have won a return.“What are the odds for us winning the Premier League this season?” he said. “I think we’re probably not the favourites. There are probably three teams at least ahead of us but we will do what we can to build a strong and competitive team.“The first aim is that we need to be able to compete in all four tournaments and do it on a consistent level. I think 2019 was the last season where the club managed to compete in more than one competition. If we can compete, there’s maybe a chance that you can hopefully end top. But we need to be able to build to compete first.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn the hot topic of fitness, Frank acknowledged the remorselessness of the schedule. But he said: “Hopefully the way we train, building layers, building robustness into the players, is going to be a big part and making the players more available through the season. Hopefully we can make good decisions, with feeling, with knowledge, with numbers, [about] when to rotate and when to rest. It’s a big thing as well.”Frank joked he made his “first rookie mistake” when he mentioned Arsenal and their Invincible season – “the team that we can’t mention [at this club]”. He did so in the context of an answer in which he said it was “100% sure” Spurs would lose league matches because virtually everybody did – apart from you know who. It was part of his overall expectation management sweep.Frank also got a few smiles when he considered how Spurs had sacked five managers in the time that he spent at Brentford. “Only five?” he said. “I like to challenge myself. I have the privilege that I have never been sacked before. That is one of the reasons why I took the job. I get a little bit more risk in my daily life.”The bottom line is that Frank will be under pressure, partly because he is succeeding a trophy-winning manager, who some of the fans did not want to see go; partly because of the talent in the squad, which will be supplemented during the transfer window. Frank made no comment on the ongoing pursuit of the £60m-rated Nottingham Forest midfielder, Morgan Gibbs-White.“It’s the easy part now – the honeymoon,” Frank said. “Everyone is happy, the sun is shining, we haven’t played a game yet. I think the honeymoon is five, six weeks of pre-season. Then it’s reality, no matter if we won [a trophy] last season or not. So, five, six weeks where you can do a lot of good stuff and then it’s reality. I look forward to that.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankHeung-min SonnewsShareReuse this content"

There are days when I fear that the death and devastation that has gone on for 650 days will never stop, that it will eventually settle into a constant, low-level attritional war inside the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict – a war within a war – that becomes a background hum to world affairs, the way the Troubles in Northern Ireland endured for 30 years. In this same nightmare, incidentally, I seeBenjamin Netanyahu, who has already sat in Israel’s prime ministerial chair for nearly 18 years, on and off, staying put for another 18 years or more, ruling the country until he is 100.Israelis don’t want either of those things to happen. Polls show that only a minority trust Netanyahu, while an overwhelming majority –about 74%– want this terrible war to end. As the leader of one of the ultra-orthodox, or Haredi, parties that this weekquit Netanyahu’s ruling coalition– over the government’s failure to pass a bill permanently exempting Haredi youth from military service–recently put it: “I don’t understand what we are fighting for there… I don’t understand what the need is.”If the supposed benefit of the war eludes even Netanyahu’s erstwhile partners in government, its cost is apparent to the entire watching world. Every day brings news of another 10 or 20 or 30 Palestinians killed in Gaza, often while queueing up for urgently needed food or water. The UN estimates that over six short weeksabout 800 people have been killedin or around food distribution points, most of those deaths in the vicinity of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the US-Israeli joint venture established after Israel decided that the UN could not be trusted to keep aid out of the hands of Hamas and whose brief record has been one of chaos and bloodshed. Even the most unwavering of Israel’s defenders do not pretend that those killed in these incidents were Hamas fighters or posed any kind of military threat. It’s just the utterly needless death of blameless civilians, day after day after day.InsideIsrael, a war without end means the deaths of Israeli soldiers – and, recall, almost every (non-Haredi) Jewish, Druze and Circassian 18-year-old is a conscript – and another day chained in darkness for the 20 living Israelis still believed to be held hostage by Hamas and its allies in Gaza. Which is why three in four Israelis want this war over, immediately.So why doesn’t it end? Some believe there may be movement towards a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in the coming days, with one US official saying it’s “closer than it’s ever been”. If that’s true, one contributory factor is worth explaining – because it is damning.Next week will see the end of the current session of the Israeli parliament, with the Knesset then in recess until October. During those three months, it is procedurally harder to bring down an Israeli government. So Netanyahu will soon be less vulnerable to the ultranationalists Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who have long threatened to leave his coalition should he do a deal that ends the war. Hence the speculation of an imminent move.Underpinning it is the assumption that until now Netanyahu has preferred the hostages to remain in their dungeons, and Palestinian civilians to keep dying, than to risk his hold on power. In other words, if a deal is done soon, it will be a deal that could have been done sooner – but which was delayed to keep Netanyahu in the prime minister’s seat.Confidence in ascribing such self-serving and amoral motives to Netanyahu is boosted by a comprehensive New York Times investigation into the past 21 months, which methodically confirms with hard evidence what has long been assumed by most analysts: that “Netanyahu prolonged the war in Gaza to stay in power”.The paper focuses on several key moments when a ceasefire was within reach, when Israel’s own military commanders were urging it, but when Netanyahu chose to walk away, fearing that if he did not, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would pull the plug on his government. Stripped of power, Netanyahu would lose much of the armour that protects him as he stands trial on corruption charges. Like his fellow nationalist would-be autocrat, Donald Trump, Netanyahu has a mortal fear of going to jail.So in April 2024, Netanyahu was poised to present a proposal for a six-week pause in the war to his cabinet. It would have brought the release of more than 30 hostages and negotiations for a permanent truce. The plan was written and ready to go. But cabinet minutes obtained by the paper show that, at the last minute, Smotrich, who, like Ben-Gvir, wants Israel to occupyGazaand to rebuild Jewish settlements there, warned that if Netanyahu were to sign the rumoured “surrender”, his government would be finished. The proposal was quietly shelved and the war went on.At that point, the death toll in Gaza stood at35,000. Today it is estimated at 58,000. Of course, it’s possible a deal would have fallen away in April 2024, that Hamas would have said no, or that it would not have lasted. But there was a chance – and it is at least possible that 23,000 lives might have been saved.That was not the last such opportunity. In July last year, international mediators gathered in Rome believing the stars were at last aligned for a ceasefire. But, according to the New York Times, Netanyahu suddenly introduced six new demands that scuppered any prospect of an agreement. Earlier, Ben-Gvir had barged into the PM’s office, warning him not to make “a reckless deal”. Once again, Netanyahu put his own political survival ahead of the lives of Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians.You would think that record would be enough to see Netanyahu repudiated by the Israeli electorate: the evidence against him is so devastating. But he will present himself at the next election, which could be just six months away, as the man who vanquished Israel’s mightiest enemies. Hezbollah no longer threatens Israel from the north; Bashar al-Assad is gone; and Iran has been humiliated, its air defences gutted, its nuclear ambitions dented. Hamas still exists, but Israel is no longer encircled by a “ring of fire” shaped by Tehran. Netanyahu says that success is all down to him, while the failures that led to the Hamas massacres of 7 October 2023 are the fault of everyone else. As an electoral pitch, it may even work.This week I spoke to the revered Israel journalist Ilana Dayan forthe Unholy podcast. She described how Israelis were stuck for so long in 7 October, but now “October 8th at least has dawned on us. We finally can ask, and have to ask, the tough questions with regard to our leadership, with regard to the tragedy in Gaza, with regard to this endless war. History will judge the leadership, but it will judge us too.”Israelis will indeed have to face a great reckoning for the destruction they have wreaked in Gaza. But the first to be judged should be Benjamin Netanyahu, who had the power of life and death in his hands and chose the death of others, so that his political career might live. He should bear the shame of it until his final breath.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Grant had provoked backlash from the Black press for discussing state-funded “voluntary repatriation” (a return of migrant and migrant descendant groups to their country of heritage) at a fringe event at the Labour party conference in 1993. Provided an opportunity by Howe to walk back on these comments, he doubled down, suggesting that Black people had “no future in Europe”.Howe viewed Grant’s position as retrograde, and questioned how a British MP could advocate for a future outside Britain. Grant would complain to Channel 4 about the programme, fearing that it had ruined his political career. But it did not. Despite being abandoned by his Black parliamentary colleagues and only finding mixed support against major rebuke, he remained a respected political figure, andLabourMP, until his death in 2000.The episode is an important reminder of something that used to exist in mainstream British discourse: important Black figures engaging in serious debate on a controversial – even, offensive – subject. Here was a mainstream platform where, gladiator-style, a discussion pertaining to race in Britain could be contested in all its messiness, ferocity and rigour. Where can we find such a space in the mainstream today?Perhaps if we were still committed to engaging in complex discussions of race, racialisation and Blackness today, with a public audience acting as a democratic mechanism of accountability,Diane Abbott’s commentswould have provoked curiosity and real engagement rather than panic and overreaction.The Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, first elected to her seat 38 years ago, was again suspended from the party on Thursday for comments in aBBC Radio 4 interviewdefending her previously revoked statements around the different experiences of racialisation between certain demographic groups. Where Abbott’s wording in her original letter to the Observer had been clumsy, this time she took the opportunity to clarify what she meant, saying: “Clearly, there must be a difference between racism which is about colour and other types of racism, because you can see a Traveller or a Jewish person walking down the street, you don’t know … but if you see a Black person walking down the street, you see straight away that they’re Black.”These comments strike me as true. In the same way that while my Blackness is immediately and unambiguously read, my sexuality (I am a gay man) could only be inferred by context, stereotypes or by my own confirmation. Similarly, you may not know that a white person is Irish until you infer it from their name, accent or simply ask them. That does not undermine the reality of anti-Irish (or antisemitic or anti-Traveller) discrimination, and yet it is plainly not the same as what can be visibly deduced before any kind of identifying context is introduced. But even if you disagree with these comments, as you may, why are they so unsayable to the point that Abbott has had the whip suspended? Why, instead, can there not be public discussion on the differing experiences of racialisation, even if they are provocative?In part, this is down to the decline of serious engagement with Black intellectual thought. Howe’s programme had its cheap moments. And yet in the mid-1990s you could turn on your television and witness thought-provoking debates around race without participants expecting to be served their P45. Equally, you might have been more used to the presence of Black intellectuals on television and radio – the likes of Stuart Hall and CLR James, who had their owninterview broadcaston Channel 4 in the 1980s where they discussed, among other things, the Gold Coast revolution and James’s Trotskyism. It is not that such intellectuals or their works no longer exist, but that they are undervalued or treated more tokenistically.Now, where Black academics and thinkers are called to discuss matters of race, they are largely reduced toshouting matcheswith the likes of Piers Morgan, with the preferred topics being culture-war fodder around the permissibility of praising Winston Churchill, or the latest development onMeghan Markle. No wonder when faced with a real, considered and provocative attempt to parse race and racialisation, the channels simply shut down. The warning signs for this decline were there: when Howe was interviewed by the BBC to discuss the 2011 riots, the anchor erroneouslysuggested that he had a history of rioting, to which he responded “Have some respect for an old West Indian Negro.”The last humanist: how Paul Gilroy became the most vital guide to our age of crisisRead moreThe clearest problem, to me, is that there is a lack of interest in the diversity of what Black people think, and how to respond when that may present a challenge. The Labour party has a persistent problem with it – and that includes when the MPRupa Huq describedthe former Conservative chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng as “superficially” Black. Patronising and opportunistic as ever, Keir Starmer, after failed attempts to deselect Abbott,praised her as a “trailblazer”upon becoming mother of the House following her re-election. Yet it is a safe conclusion that he has absolutely no interestin what she thinks or says. The same is true of Baroness Lawrence, whom he was all too happy to wheel out in the interests of campaigning, only to faceaccusations that he was not listening to herwhen she attempted to engage in dialogue about anti-Black racism.Our public discussions on race are utterly impoverished, and this is largely because our haughty institutions have developed a preference to either run scared or dismiss real discourse rather than challenge, engage and understand. If the answer to Britain’s first Black female MP parsing the lived experience of racism is to suspend her and confect another political controversy, then the message is that you may not ever say anything difficult at all.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

With the lifting of the superinjunction, we can all see where that has ledFri 18 Jul 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 07.40 EDTShareWhat odds on a public inquiry into theAfghan superinjunction? Gold-plated, judge-led, three years of fun and games, that is how British politics normally kicks an embarrassment into the long grass. And what odds on who will get off scot free – Tony Blair?The more we pick away at the stages of this fiasco, the more from the start one blunder seemed to follow inevitably from another. There was no reason for theBritish invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. If the US wanted revenge on the Kabul regime for harbouring al-Qaida after 9/11, it could have done what Donald Trump did last month to Iran. A savage retaliatory blow against the country’s rulers would have made the point.The invocationofarticle 5of the Nato treaty to justify an invasion of Afghanistan was ridiculous. America’s security was not remotely threatened by terrorism directed from Kabul, any more than was Britain’s. Other Nato powers, bullied into showing sympathy, limited themselves to minimal non-fighting roles. Once Kabul had been attacked and the Taliban had fled, caution and common sense indicated swift withdrawal. The US military command wanted no invasion.Blair was insistent inpressing Bush for “nation-building”, against considerable US scepticism. He wasdesperate for Britainto punch above its weight. In hisChicago speech in 1999, he had advocated the new Blair “doctrine of international community”,that of altruistic intervention. It was basically a call for more wars. Clinton’s office described Blair’s intervention in Kosovo as the prime minister “sprinkling too much adrenaline on his cornflakes”. When war duly arrived, Blair was insistent that British submarines fire thefirst barrage of missiles on Kabul. He told the 2001 Labour conference: “We will not walk away from Afghanistan, as the outside world has done so many times before … There is only one outcome: our victory not theirs.”Afghans have been betrayed yet again by this shocking UK data leak – and many don’t even know if they’re affected | Diane TaylorRead moreThere followed a full-scale British occupation that culminated, in 2006, in a reckless, failed attemptto suppress the Taliban in Helmand. One result was that for 20 years, a sizeable chunk of Afghanistan’s modest administrative class found themselves employed by western occupying powers, including Britain. As the Taliban filtered back, these people assumed, perhaps foolishly, that the good old British empire would not desert them.When the list of19,000collaborators in the British occupation was leaked, the danger was obvious. The Ministry of Defence was alerted that an anonymous member of a Facebook group had said he had the database and was threatening to post it in full. Not knowing if the list had been shared with the Taliban, the government acted to protect those named.The defence secretary at the time, Ben Wallace, understandably wanted to keep the fact a secret just in case. A judge understandably agreed, for a while. But neither decision would stand the test of time – or the mounting embarrassment. The Treasury cost of honouring the list was not millions but billions.The bulk of the blame must lie with the fact of the invasion and subsequent departure. The effort of the House of Commons this week to make the leak issue partisan was pitiful. Neither the cabinet nor parliament tried to stop Blair’s original occupation. In 2010, afternine years, it still voted overwhelmingly in favour of Britain’s presence continuing. Parliament was equally in favour of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. When in 2021 Boris Johnson finally joined the US in cutting and running, parliament washed its hands of the whole affair.In Afghanistan,457 British soldiers died. The cost of the war to the UK taxpayer was £30bn. Some 200,000 Afghans also died and29,700 were accepted for resettlementbetween 2021 and 2024. These figures are the bill for the outrage over 9/11 and were utterly unnecessary. No other European country joined the US on anything like the same scale as Britain. There has not been a word of inquiry into who should carry any degree of personal responsibility.Britain attempted to withdraw from its empire with dignity over the course of the 20th century. It did not always succeed. Yet, ever since, its rulers have seemed in a state of lingering regret. Like Blair, they have harboured a tarnished yearning for a Britain still playing a role on the world stage, a violent one if need be.Though Britain was never remotely threatened, Blair was almost always at war, in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. David Cameron was bitten with the same bug, intervening in Libya and trying to do so in Syria. He builttwo giant aircraft carriers, one of which Boris Johnson could not resistsending to the South China Sea. Why was never explained.If Trump has any virtue it has been in telling Europe that the old global interventionism is over. The US is fed up with being Europe’s policeman. The continent should be realistic and look after its own business. But even he could not resist the machismo of bombing Iran.The lesson of the leak is not that emails are never safe. That surely is known. The real lesson is that Britain should never have spent a quarter of a century trying to impose its rule onAfghanistanin the first place.

I worked for more than a decade as a lawyer advising high net worth individuals, and many of the people I worked with had assets worth more than £10m. It was commonplace to refer to their luxury apartments – usually in neighbourhoods like Kensington or Chelsea – as “safety deposit boxes in the sky”. My work involved advising them on how to pass on assets such as these pieds-à-terre and country piles in the home counties while minimising their taxes.Many of the super-rich have ties all over the world, decamping to homes in the south of France in the summer, or their Alpine chalets for ski holidays. Some have constructed more contrived connections to places like Singapore or Bermuda to reduce their tax bills. But regardless of their undeniable worldliness, the super-rich love living in the UK.There is a prestige to owning property in the UK. A bolthole in London allows you to visit the Frieze art fair in Regent’s Park or sit on Centre Court at Wimbledon. On the practical side, many are enticed by how easy it is to set up and conduct business in the UK. Of paramount concern to certain ultra-wealthy families is that the UK offers peace of mind in terms of affording them refuge from those who might otherwise see them as a target for kidnapping in other jurisdictions.Last week, the go-to British magazine for millionaires and wealth advisory professionals, Spear’s Magazine, published ajubilant articlecelebrating the influx of wealthy Americans to the UK. As it turns out, the UK is one of the top choices for Hollywood stars and Silicon Valley big shots looking for a comfortable life away from Donald Trump’s chaos.This hasn’t stopped the Times from publishing endless doomsday prophecies of a wealth exodus on an epic scale. The endlessly repeated trope is that the ultra-wealthy will flee at the first signs of higher taxes, taking their tax revenue and business investments with them, and having the overall effect of lowering growth. However,recent researchby Tax Justice Network, with Patriotic Millionaires and Tax Justice UK, discredited previous, similar claims as vastly overexaggerated.What isn’t overexaggerated are concerns of slow growth and declining living standards in the UK. British society is becoming ever more unequal, unfair and frankly unsustainable. If mid-career professionals earning £100k a yearstruggle to buy property in Londonand maintain a standard of life they’re happy with, while contributingmore than 60% of income tax receipts, what does that say of the vast majority of British residents who earn considerably less or are on universal credit?We have an economy in which work doesn’t pay – the income of people who work for a living is taxed at higher rates than that of those who earn money from simply having money. Before becoming a private wealth lawyer, I hadn’t realised that the way the ultra-wealthy earn their income is quite different from the majority of us. While the average person earns money from their daily work, the ultra-wealthy make eye-watering sums simply from owning assets. They generate wealth from investment funds and rent and sales profits from their property empires.Instead of addressing this unfairness, this week Rachel Reeves announced plans tofurther deregulatethe financial sector, giving another benefit to the already wealthy by boosting speculative capital and hoping it trickles down. Instead of taxing wealth or backing public investment, the chancellor’s Mansion House speech doubled down on prioritising the City of London over serious economic renewal in all sectors and areas of the UK. Councils will continue to be unable to meet the needs of their communities. NHS waiting lists will continue to rise. Government will fail to prepare for climate adaptation and mitigation.What is a wealth tax and would it work in the UK?Read moreI now work with people focused on giving away their wealth. It’s common for the ultra-wealthy to believe they deserve all the privilege they have and should “protect” it at all costs. Usually, this means avoiding tax. However, my current clients have broken free from such ideas. They recognise the privileges they have and acknowledge that they have benefited from a tax system that protects their wealth at the expense of ordinary people. Many of them tell me they see their responsibility of paying higher taxes on their wealth as merely practising good citizenship and contributing to the benefits of living in the UK. After all, the beautiful parks their children play in, and the unparalleled museums they enjoy, are funded by public money.The moral and pragmatic case for a wealth tax is clear. Those with the broadest shoulders can and should contribute more. An annual wealth tax of 2% on assets of more than £10m would affect only 20,000 people and would go part of the way to redressing the inequality between wealth and income. The revenue could be invested in local councils, schools, the NHS. And even help promote sustainable, green innovation to shelter us from the effects of the climate crisis. All while hardly making the slightest difference to the ultra-wealthy or their quality of life, as they often tell me.Themajority of the public supportshigher taxes on wealth – including Conservative voters. It’s time for Labour to start making political choices that benefit all those living in the UK.Stephanie Brobbey is founder and chief executive officer of the Good Ancestor MovementExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionThe super-richRachel ReevesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Now he’s trying to change the narrativeFri 18 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 13.55 EDTShareDonald Trump’s followers, and the conspiracist influencers turned government officials through whom he persuades them, have turned on the president and US attorney general after they declared an end to federal inquiries into Jeffrey Epstein’s death. But it would be a mistake to think that the investigation scandal is sui generis. It’s more like the culmination of a long-running trend, one in which Trump’s exploitation of the conspiracist fictions, distrust of institutions, and prurient fascinations of his base have finally come back to bite him.A pedophile ring at the center of power is a recurring theme in rightwing conspiracy theories of the Trump era. During the 2016 presidential election, supporters of Trump, then an outsider challenger for the Republican nomination, began to spread dark claims about his rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton. Online, far-right trolls and members of the population now called “low trust voters”– people who believe that something nefarious and conspiratorial is going on in the halls of American power, even if they don’t know exactly what – speculated that Clinton was at the head of a huge human trafficking and pedophilic abuse ring based inside Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington DC. There was no secret ring. But that didn’t stop a disturbed man from showing up with a gun.Pizzagate, as it was called, gave way to QAnon, the elaborate mass delirium in which Trump supporters believed that they were receiving secret messages from Q, a fictitious but supposedly highly placed security official. QAnon, too, centered around the notion that powerful people – Democrats, mostly, but also some Hollywood celebrities – were secretly running a vast pedophile network. In his dispatches, Q detailed Trump’s efforts to dismantle a deep state ring of child sex trafficking. None of that was true, either, but that didn’t stop thousands from believing in it.Trump exploited these fictions, nodding to them deliberately with varying degrees of enthusiasm and plausible deniability. They were useful to him, stories in which he was a hero, and his political opponents were maximally morally repulsive. The conspiracies helped paper over the gap between the near-messianic esteem in which Trump’s followers hold him, and the shambolic, incompetent and often cruelly sadistic character of his actual administration. And the content of the stories – dealing as they did in secrecy, power, helpless innocents and forbidden sex – made them potent tools, igniting the fiercest passions and darkest imaginations of his fans.To a man with a bottomless appetite for self-aggrandizement and no principles, the conspiracy theories’ emergence must have seemed like a great stroke of luck. Trump lies like he breathes, and the national media, his fellow politicians, and all manner of experts have lost both the ability and the will to correct the record. Over the past 10 years, through the force of his personality and with mounting attacks on universities, journalists and other outlets for knowledge building, fact-finding, and expertise, he has helped to accelerate a total epistemic collapse in national politics. Policy and public opinion alike are now unmoored from factual reality. What istrueis no longer whatmatters.Sexual violence represents an arena where a post-truth reality long predates TrumpThe story of Epstein, the dead financier and prolific sexual abuser of young women and girls who killed himself in a jail cell in 2019, was in retrospect always bound to become a central character in these vast fantasies. Part of the reason is because of the true horror of Epstein’s crimes, and the uncanny ways some of the facts of his story – as demonstrated in court transcripts, unredacted documents, testimony from his victims, and the dogged, years-long investigations of the Miami Herald’s Julie K Brown – mirror some of the darkest details of QAnon’s fever dreams. A billionaire investor with ties to a shocking number of prominent people across the political spectrum – prominently including Trump himself – Epstein carried out his abuse of dozens of teenage girls over the course of years, allegedly trafficking them for abuse on his private island and aboard his private plane, and, according to some of the girls, now women, who have testified about their experiences with him, pawning them off for abuse by his rich friends. He was a man who lived in tremendous luxury, who mingled with the rich and famous, and who treated human beings – girls – as objects to be consumed, with a kind of casual indifference to their will or wellbeing. He was evil – and, to those on the right who seem to understand both conspicuous consumption and the sexual abuse of women as markers of status, he was also darkly aspirational. In some of the breathless coverage of Epstein, particularly as it emerged on the podcasts and web forums of the conspiracist right, you could detect in the fascination with Epstein not only moral revulsion but an acute envy.It’s unclear why Trump is now trying to wrap up a conspiracy theory that has paid such dividends. Perhaps, as some are suggesting, Trump worries that sustained attention on Epstein’s case will draw more attention to his own abuse of women, though such revelations about Trump have been many, and have not hurt him before. Perhaps he just thinks that he cannot deliver, from his perch atop the federal bureaucracy that is so implicated in crimes and cover-ups in the imaginations of his supporters, the kind of earth-shattering revelations that the conspiracy theory’s narrative structures demand. Either way, Trump has turned abruptly and dramatically against the Epstein theory. He’s trying to reassert control over reality, trying to dictate which fantasies his movement adopts, and which they leave behind. It’snot working. The post-truth conspiracist world he helped to usher in is too unwieldy to be redirected at will.There’s a grim irony in the fact that it is a case of sexual violence that has underscored the dangers of epistemic collapse for Trump himself, because sexual violence represents an arena where a post-truth reality long predates him. No one knows better than sexual violence victims, who are routinely disbelieved, dismissed, or punished for telling the truth, what it means for the facts of your own life not to matter as much as the passions and prior commitments of your audience.What people tend to forget about Epstein’s life – clouded as it has been by all the speculation about his death – is that much of what he was doing to those women and girls was out in the open. Epstein had already been convicted and served prison time on charges pertaining to his sexual abuse; when he’d gotten out, he’d resumed his place among the rich and famous: his status was undiminished by the revelation of his violence. Maybe this is the real delusion at the heart of the conspiracy theories about Epstein and the other pedophile rings that populate the rightwing imagination: not that widespread sexual abuse happens, but that it is concealed, hidden, waiting to be unveiled by the righteous. For sexual abuse, at least, the real horror has always been this: that no one cares enough about the victims for the abusers to have to hide.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

So it was quite a twist this week to see the chickens of this particular rancid online conspiracy culture come home to roost in the form ofMaga faithfuls turning on Donald Trumpfor what the US president now refers to as the “Jeffrey Epstein hoax”.Epstein, a convicted child sex offender, killed himself in prison while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019, and Trump’s conspiracy-hungry supporters are now accusing the president of a cover-up. Specifically enraging to Trump fans is his decision to tread water on releasing the “Epstein files”, FBI files supposedly containing the names of the banker’s “client list”, which, last month, Elon Musk suggested Trump himself may appear on.Until very recently, theTrump administrationhad been happy to throw meat to the lions by suggesting it would release the files. But in recent weeks the president has dropped that promise and instead recommended that everyone “move on”. Meanwhile, the FBI issued a memo last week saying it did not have evidence that would justify interrogating further suspects.How the Jeffrey Epstein row plunged Maga world into turmoil – a timelineRead moreWell. Can you imagine? Across the US, the deep-state-is-lying-to-us klaxons went off like tornado warnings and before you knew it, the Maga megaphone Laura Loomer was calling for the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to resign, the Trump ally Steve Bannon demanded the dissolution of federal law enforcement, and Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, called the FBI memo a “cover-up”. Which brings us to the domino run of events this week: Trump coming out fighting against his followers, who he described on Truth Social as“weaklings” and “my PAST supporters”, who “have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker”. And a partial, 11th-hour climbdown when heordered Bondi to release testimonyfrom the Epstein grand jury. As Trump himself might say: beautiful.TuesdayWhat do tarantulas smell like? Not chocolates, apparently; a useful piece of information to have had at Cologne Bonn airport recently, where news wasreleasedthis week of a smuggling attempt thwarted by customs officials tipped off by a “noticeable smell”.Or rather, the notable absence of a smell: officials inspecting a large haul of cake boxes noted they didn’t smell chocolatey, and on further inspection turned out to contain, not confectionery from Vietnam, as the customs paperwork promised, but – what are the chances? – 1,500 baby tarantulas in individual plastic vials.Many of the tarantulas hadn’t survived the journey from Vietnam, which feels like the opener to a dark Pixar movie or the trigger for an odd conflation of responses: revulsion, fear and sympathy.View image in fullscreen‘I had it cast in bronze, and see: not so small! It’s a big beautiful hand.’Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/AFP/Getty ImagesWednesdayThe 2025Emmy nominationsare in and with them, more importantly,the snubs. At the top of the list is Keira Knightley, overlooked for her role in the very patchy Netflix show Black Doves (notable detail: Sarah Lancashire’s bored face in the pilot), followed by Tina Fey’s also really quite bad Netflix show, The Four Seasons, overlooked in every category bar a single nomination for Colman Domingo.Meanwhile, the parlousness of John Hamm’s suburban comedy drama, Your Friends & Neighbours, was recognised by Emmy voters with a nod for the theme music and nothing else. But while some media outlets pointed to Renée Zellweger being overlooked for her role in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy – which found itself in the TV movie category since it went straight to streaming in the US – this wasn’t quite right. For a movie, show or performer to count as having been snubbed, voters must have approached it with reasonably high expectations in the first place.ThursdayCrucial to Trump’s “Epstein hoax” about-face seems to be the existence of what, in astory broken by the Wall Street Journal, the newspaper described as a “bawdy” letter and cartoon, allegedly written by Trump to Epstein on the occasion of his 50th birthday and included in a special album compiled for Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell – names that fall like a fantasy dinner party list but where the object is to assemble the worst people in the world.It is the Journal’s attempt to describe Trump’s alleged cartoon-drawing skills that particularly arrests in this new twist: the president’s alleged sketch featured the naked silhouette of a woman in which, wrote the Journal, “a pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts,” (the choice of “denotes”, here, really raising the tone), and Trump’s “signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair”.The message, meanwhile, allegedly read: “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.” And while Trump jumped on Truth Social to call the note a fake and threaten the Journal with legal action, the rest of us could only sit back and marvel at the way life mimics pulp fiction – or rather, Alice in Wonderland, in which the president’s difficulties aren’t authored by a bold defender of Truth, but by the man who arguably bears more responsibility for his rise than any other: Journal proprietor and sudden hero of the hour, Rupert Murdoch.FridayIn a week of awkward missives, Pat Brennan has resigned from his post as a parish priest in Coventry and marked the occasion with what the Metrodescribedas a “sassy poem”. In his blog, Humble Piety, the priest posted a verse entry entitled Not I Lord Surely!, in which he blasted parishioners for being, among other things, “unfriendly”, “disdainful”, “bored”, “gossiping” and “tutting for a living”, and nailed a rhyme scheme in which he paired “holier too” with “you know who”, and “Lord’s own seal” with “it can feel”. We can only hope this style of critique catches on.View image in fullscreen‘I’m still thinking of cutting the ISA allowance, but don’t pass it on.’Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PAExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationEmmysUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

All centred on the idea that the “deep state” was lying to, and thus cheating, ordinary people. Mr Trump was their tribune.It’s hard not to feel schadenfreude now that he’s at the sharp end of a theory that heat times encouragedand allies eagerly pushed: claims that the prison death of the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein might not be suicide after all, and that wealthy and well-connected associates were trying to hush up connections to the financier. Mr Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, promised that “truckloads” of documents would help reveal the truth and claimed that a client list was “sitting on my desk right now”.Then, abruptly, the department of justice said that the financier’s death was not murder, that no more files on the investigation against him would be released, and that there was no list of “clients”. The administration says that Ms Bondi was referring to general files on the case. In short: many of those who promoted the idea that vast, vile secrets were being concealed now claim that there are no secrets at all – withno clear explanationfor their volte-face.The result has been uproar in the Maga movement, with far-right politicians and media figures including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Laura Loomer and Alex Jones among the unsatisfied. Mike Johnson, speaker of the House and a key ally, said that the justice departmentshould “put it out there”.Mr Trumpattempted to dismiss the storyas “boring”, before attacking his own supporters as “weaklings” for “[buying] into this ‘bullshit’”. Then, hours after a Wall Street Journal report that he sent a “bawdy” letter to Epstein – which he denies – hetold Ms Bondito seek the release of grand jury testimony on the sex-trafficking case.Epstein’s crimes are fact, not a “hoax”, and it’s also fact that he had repeated contact withhigh-profile figures, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton,Prince Andrewand Mr Trump himself – who onceremarked of the financier: “Terrific guy … It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” The files need not suggest, let alone confirm, any wrongdoing to embarrass anyone mentioned in them: highlighting the association is enough.At the heart of all Maga conspiracies lies another kernel of truth: that the rich and powerful often get away with exploiting vulnerable people through connections to the state. Yet Trump voters fail to see how that relates to the administration’s broader actions.They are unmoved by his reverse Robin Hood budget legislation, which snatches from the poor to give to billionaires – like those in his cabinet. It’s less visceral than Epstein’s crimes, and its brazenness may, counterintuitively, make it less viral. Many on the rightblame imaginary weather modification, rather than the global heating caused by fossil fuel dependence, for Texas’s deadly floods. Conspiracy theories give those who feel powerless a sense of power; of knowing something that others can’t see. Even so, the truth revealed by the Epstein scandal – that ordinary Americans are deeply angry at the unfairness and abuses created by elites – is worth heeding, and demands a better political and economic response.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They deserve to be celebratedFri 18 Jul 2025 12.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 14.06 EDTShareIf the mindless felling of the Sycamore Gap tree has taught us anything, it is that there is no such thing as“just a tree”, as one of the perpetrators,Adam Carruthers, told the jury. “It was almost as if someone had been murdered,” he said of the ensuing public outcry. For many it was.Animism runs deeply through our relationship with arboreal life. From Macbeth’s prophetic Birnam Wood to the towering Ents in The Lord of the Rings, trees have long been personified in literature. And, fromConstable’s bucolic SuffolktoDavid Hockney’s Yorkshire wold, they have helped shape Britain’s artistic landscape.This cultural heritage is being celebrated bythe Woodland Trust UK Tree of the Year 2025. The Sycamore Gap tree won in 2016. The shortlist, announced this week, brings together William Wordsworth and the Beatles, Virginia Woolf and Radiohead, all united by the trees they have helped put on the UK’s cultural map.The Tree of Peace and Unity in County Antrim, where the Good Friday agreement was signed in 1998, also makes the list of 10 culturally remarkable trees.British history is written in its trees: the ancientAnkerwycke Yewat Runnymede, where Henry VIII is rumoured to have courted Anne Boleyn; theRoyal Oakin Shropshire, which hid the future Charles II; and theTolpuddle Martyrs Treein Dorset.Like the rings in their trunks, over centuries trees become the keeper of stories. They also, of course, provide paper on which to read them. This is ingeniously encapsulated in TheFuture Libraryby the Scottish conceptual artist Katie Paterson. Starting with Margaret Atwood in 2014, each year a manuscript by a different novelist is buried in Oslo’s Nordmarka forest. In 2114, 100 books will be published out of the 1,000 specially planted pine trees.In fairytales and crime fiction, forests signal danger, but they are also places of sanctuary and renewal, hence the ancient Japanese practice ofshinrin-yokuor forest bathing. Peter Rabbit finds safety in a burrow at the bottom of a tree. They also promise adventure and character-building, as in Robin Hood and the ethos behindScandinavian forest schools.We learn to anthropomorphise arboreal beings from an early age: Enid Blyton’s Magic Faraway Tree and JK Rowling’s Whomping Willow are characters in their own right. Trees have veryhuman qualities: they can learn from past traumas, such as droughts, and they make good “parents”, allowing their seedlings just the right amount of sugar through their roots.But they cannot protect them from global heating and disease.New researchhas revealed that saplings in British woodlands have been dying at an alarming rate since 2000. As much as70% of ancient woodsin the UK have been lost or damaged in the last 100 years. After the destruction of the Sycamore Gap tree, andthe 500-year old oak in Enfield near a Toby Carvery restaurantthis year, the government has set out much-needed plans to give legal protection to older and culturally important trees in England.Our ancient woodlands are irreplaceable. We must protect them as they protect us. As Woodland Trust patronJudi Dench put it, our oldest trees “are as much part of our heritage as any literature”. They should be cherished and celebrated.

Last year it recorded 624 homicides, making it one of the most violent countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In May this year,local media reporteda 33% decrease compared with the same period in 2024 and 2023.But the country’s attorney general, John Jeremie, said on Friday there had been a resurgence of gang-related homicides and kidnappings. Responding to a question about the length of the state of emergency he said it would be for “as long as the security forces tell us that they need the additional legislative support”.The terms of the current state of emergency mirror those of one announced in December 2024 andextended for three monthsin January this year. There is no curfew in place, and citizens are free to move about. However, law enforcement officers now have enhanced powers, including the ability to enter premises without a warrant.The former Trinidad and Tobago police commissioner Gary Griffith called the declaration “ridiculous” and said the issue could have been resolved with better prison management.“There was a situation where there was a major criminal element in the Port of Spain prison, and three times in 24 hours, we seized a phone from that individual. As soon as we seized the phone, he got another one – because of prison officers on the take,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The review will recommend a new regulatory system.Cunliffe’s review was set up by the government amid growing public anger about record sewage spills and rising bills, as well as the fraying finances of some of the biggest utilities.It will be the largest review of the sector since its privatisation under Margaret Thatcher.At the launchof the review last year, the environment secretary, Steve Reed, said it would “shape new legislation to reform the water sector so it properly serves the interests of customers and the environment.”Critics have said Ofwat presided over a culture of underinvestment in water infrastructure and financial mismanagement by water companies since its creation in 1989. The most troubling case for the government is the UK’s largest water company, Thames Water, which is loaded with £20bn in debt andstruggling to stave off financial collapse.Thames Water is in talks with Ofwat over a takeover by creditors who hold much of its debt, and is trying tosecure leniency from fines and penalties. Should those negotiations fail, it is likely to fall intotemporary state ownership via the special administration regime.Cunliffe warned in his interim review that the current regulatory system, including Ofwat, had “largely lost public trust”.View image in fullscreenCustomers, MPs and campaigners protest outside a Thames Water bailout hearing in London earlier this year.Photograph: Victoria Jones/REX/ShutterstockIndustry leaders have also long bemoaned a lack of coherence in water regulation, with different regulators and agencies doubling up on areas of investigation. This has made it hard to have timely decisions, allowing investigations to drag on rather than prevent or address environmental harm and pollution.Cunliffe had also suggested “fundamental, structural options for integrating regulatory remits and functions”.

However, sources said they supported combining some different investigatory and punishment powers within one regulator – even if it cost them their jobs.One insider said “simply scrapping Ofwat would not be a quick fix”.“If this were an easy way to avoid puttingThames Waterinto special administration, I think the government would have done it already,” they added.A senior Whitehall source said they feared the politicisation of regulatory changes could make it harder to attract investment for the water industry in the short and medium term.“Investors need to know what they are buying,” the source said. “That includes regulation.”On Friday, it was revealedserious pollution incidentsby water companies were up by 60% last year compared with the year before.

EU member statesbought an estimated €21.9bn (£18.1bn) of Russian oil and gas in 2024.The new cap will apply from 3 September, meaning that companies – insurance brokers and shippers inside the EU and the UK – cannot act to facilitate sales above the cap.Risk of undersea cable attacks backed by Russia and China likely to rise, report warnsRead moreThe EU’s European affairs ministers applauded at a meeting in Brussels when the latest sanctions against Russia were finally agreed on Friday, after Slovakia gave up its veto.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is attending a meeting of G20 finance ministers in South Africa, said: “The UK and its EU allies are turning the screw on the Kremlin’s war chest by stemming the most valuable funding stream of its illegal war in Ukraine even further.“This decisive step to lower the crude oil price cap will target Russia’s oil revenues and ramp up the pressure on Putin by exploiting his biggest vulnerability – while keeping energy markets stable.”The UK government said it is “taking decisive action to cut off Putin’s oil supply pipeline” and that it has so far sanctioned more than 250 ships responsible for transporting Russian energy supplies.The original cap was introduced in December 2022 by the G7 group of countries, but Donald Trump’s government is not willing to sign up.The EU has also introduced a ban on investing in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines.Nord Stream 1 wasrendered unusable in September 2022after a series of underwater blasts for which no one has claimed responsibility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. The pipelines were added to the sanctions list to dissuade European investors from returning to the projects.The EU also imposed new measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet – poorly maintained tankers that enable the country to sell oil to countries such as India in defiance of western restrictions. After the G7 and EU introduced the original price cap, European shipping companies sold dozens of old vessels that could be re-registered abroad.As part of the latest sanctions package, a further 105 vessels were banned from accessing EU ports and services, such as insurance, in an attempt to stop the trade, bringing the total of sanctioned vessels to 447.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, welcomed the measures as“essential and timely, especially now, as a response to the fact that Russia has intensified the brutality of the strikes on our cities and villages”.Reuters reported Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying: “We have repeatedly said that we consider such unilateral restrictions illegal, we oppose them.“But at the same time, of course, we have already acquired a certain immunity from sanctions, we have adapted to life under sanctions.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionRussiaUkraineOilOil and gas companiesCommoditiesEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Another man wearing a T-shirt with the same slogan was charged with a similar offence last weekend at the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow Green.View image in fullscreenA man holding a sign that said ‘Genocide in Palestine, time to take action’ was arrested in Glasgow.Photograph: James ChapelardAs lunchtime shoppers passed by the scene of the small protest on Friday, police officers asked the man to stop displaying the sign, which he refused to do. He was then arrested and led away in handcuffs to chants of “let him go”. The incident was peaceful throughout.The ban on Palestine Action came into force on 5 July after a high court judge refused to grant the group’s co-founder Huda Ammori an injunction suspending it while a judicial review was pending.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, announced the ban late last month, days after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint.Cat Train, who attended the protest wearing a T-shirt with the slogan “mothers against genocide”, said: “I wore this T-shirt to remind police that we are witnessing genocide in Gaza, with women and children killed daily, while our freedom to draw attention to this is being massively quashed.”Train added that, while she believed the high court judge had offered reassurances that not all direct action relating to Gaza was proscribed, “there seems to be real confusion in how to enforce this”.This week a third man was charged with a similar offence. The 38-year -old was charged on Wednesday under the Terrorism Act for allegedly “displaying a poster expressing support for a proscribed organisation at a property in the Shawlands area of Glasgow”.A 55-year-old man was charged last Saturday outside the TRNSMT music festival, again in connection with an offence under the Terrorism Act, for allegedly “wearing a T-shirt expressing support for a proscribed organisation”.The T-shirts were produced by the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Their spokesperson, Mick Napier, who attended Friday’s protest, said: “We put this T-shirt out because we wanted to use the furore around the ban to draw attention to the genocide. The T-shirt is not about Palestine Action, it’s about genocide”.Napier said the 55-year-old, who had been leafleting at the festival before his arrest, had an “excellent response” from festivalgoers.“We’re getting a substantially different response from the public even than two months ago. The atrocious actions in Gaza are burning deep into the national and international psyche.”A Police Scotland spokesperson said of Friday’s arrest: “A 64-year-old man has been arrested in connection with an offence under the Terrorism Act for displaying a sign expressing support for a proscribed organisation.”Since MPs voted in favour of proscribing Palestine Action at the start of July, the ban has been condemned by UN experts, civil liberties groups, cultural figures and hundreds of lawyers as draconian and setting a dangerous precedent by conflating protest with terrorism.More than 70 people were arrested across the UK last weekend at demonstrations where references to Palestine Action were allegedly made.Explore more on these topicsUK newsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

It features drought-resistant flowers and trees from South America, Australasia and the Mediterranean.Where once there was just a grassy clearing, there is now a Garden for the Future full of purple and blue salvia, yellow aloes, palm and monkey puzzle trees, rare beeches and other exotic and subalpine plants.Historic English gardens are being forced by the UK’s changing climate to increase the resilience and diversity of their living collections and plant displays, and the results are fascinating. Next week, for example, visitors to the Royal BotanicGardensin Kew, London, will get a chance to see montpellier maples, beaked yucca, rare succulents and oriental hornbeams when the Carbon Garden opens there on 25 July.View image in fullscreenCrocosmia.Photograph: urbanglimpses/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe design also invites visitors to journey from a planting of cool purple and blue herbaceous perennials towards bright red crocosmia and achillea, to illustrate the dramatic rise in global temperatures over time, inspired byclimate stripes.It includes a dry garden and a rain garden, as well as wildflower meadows, grasslands and carefully selected resilient trees, such as Mediterranean cypresses and Persian ironwood.“We’re trying to be more positive in our thinking about how we adapt gardens and habitats to the threat of climate change and the carbon cycle, and highlight some of the solutions – or at least the mitigations – that we can make to manage some of the impacts of climate change,” said Simon Toomer, the curator of living collections at Kew.Strategies include growing more diverse and drought-resistant plants, prioritising water capture and biodiversity and using shade planting to shelter Kew’s most vulnerable flora and fauna. “The Carbon Garden will give us an opportunity to do that at a concentrated level,” Toomer said.View image in fullscreenThe director of Wakehurst in Sussex said prairie plants had been very happy in the 30C heat.Photograph: @RBG Kew August 2022Further south, Kew is already reaping the benefits of climate-resistant planting. In Wakehurst, formerly the grounds of an Elizabethan mansion and now home to Kew’s millennium seed bank, an “American prairie” of rare grasses, black-eyed susans and mountain mint is thriving this summer.It was planted with hundreds of thousands of wild prairie seeds from North America in 2020 as an experiment. Horticulturists say as many as 85 different species – well over 40,000 plants – are now successfully established in the Sussex landscape, boosting biodiversity in the area.Earlier this year, gardeners even discovered a prairie plantain – which has thick, rubbery leaves, is adapted to living in very dry conditions and can grow up to 1.5 metres (5ft) tall – flowering for the first time.View image in fullscreenIt is hoped the beauty of the flowers at Wakehurst will inspire visitors to plant prairie species in their own gardens.Photograph: Jim Holden/@RBG Kew August 2022Susan Raikes, the director of Wakehurst, said prairie plants had been “very happy” in the 30C heat this summer. “The root systems of most of them extend a meter underground, so they tap into the water table below, which makes them really resilient to the kind of hot summers we’re experiencing now. Their deep roots also mean they capture and store a lot of carbon in the soil.”She hopes the beauty of the flowers in the summer will also inspire visitors to plant prairie species in their own gardens. “Some are fabulous for pollinators. They are the sort of plants we’re going to need to plant in the future in this country to protect our pollinator population.”However, she warns that prairies die back in winter. “It isn’t a landscape that looks beautiful all year round.”In the future, historic gardens might have to separate their planting into winter gardens that could flourish in wet, cold and windy conditions and summer gardens that could survive hot, dry conditions, she said. “Plants are adapting, but we’re going to have to adapt as well. What we can expect from our gardens and landscapes will have to be different in the future.”A few miles away, the award-winning garden designer Joe Perkins used raised, mounded beds to address this problem when he created the Garden for the Future for the National Trust this summer, the first major change to Sheffield Park and Garden since the charity started looking after it in 1954. “It is predominantly heavy clay soil throughout the site and that poses real problems for the existing trees because it dries up and cracks in the summer, which splits apart their root system,” Perkins said. “And there’s no point planting very drought-tolerant plants in heavy clay, because they’re going to die in the winter, when the soil holds a lot of water.”Since plants that can cope with drought “don’t like sitting with their feet in the water during the winter” a lot of the plants in the new garden were in raised planting beds, he explained. “The soil we’ve put in those beds is a mixture of recycled, finely crushed brick, soil and compost, to make it very free-draining.”Historic English gardens should not be viewed as set in stone, they are a living part of our heritage and must be allowed to experiment and evolve to address the climate emergency, he argues. “They’ve got to be progressive – and places like Sheffield Park were always progressive. It was always a garden of exotic plants, and it needs to be able to adapt to the conditions we are facing.”Newly published scientific research into the trees that have the best chance of withstanding changes to the climate at Kew in the future has been used to inform the 35 new trees that have been planted in the Carbon Garden. Kew’s scientists also used cutting-edge light detection and ranging (lidar) technology to figure out which tree species are the best at capturing and storing carbon, with visitors invited to look through binoculars in the garden and view a 3D lidar model of a nearby tree.Toomer said: “There’s a high likelihood that up to half of the trees at Kew will be suffering and not thriving towards the end of this century. So we’re responding to that by planting different kinds of trees.”Perkins thinks it is vital that historic gardens, working with scientists, are open to such changes. “We need to experiment, to move our gardens forward, to be more resilient for the future,” he said. “If we don’t push boundaries, we won’t learn – and we need to learn fast.”Plants that work for gardens in a droughtView image in fullscreenEryngium, commonly known as sea holly.Photograph: Geoff Smith/AlamyParry’s agave, a flowering succulent perennial native to Mexico and Arizona.Beaked yucca, a tree-like shrub native to Texas and Mexico.Euphorbianiciciana, a semi-evergreen perennial with narrow, lance-shaped, wide-spreading, glaucous green leaves and clusters of yellowish to lime-green flowers.Verbena bonariensis, a herbaceous perennial that can grow to 2 metres tall.

You should treat any long-term revenue streams as politically and commercially unsafe.”In their letter, the Labour MPs asked Tice if he was aware that such contracts were not made with the government, but with the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a private company owned by the Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero.They said: “This means a potential futureReform UKgovernment would not have the ability to ‘strike down’ any contracts signed through this process, unless you are willing to destroy investor confidence in the whole of UK industry by ripping up contract law. Can you confirm if it is Reform UK policy to rip up contract law?”Speaking to the BBC on Thursday afternoon, Tice appeared to row back on the specific commitment to scrap AR7 contracts, saying a Reform government would only oppose “any form of variation” to them, something his letter did not appear to set out. Asked about the apparent change, Tice said “some people may have misread the wording of the letter”.The junior energy minister, Michael Shanks, said Tice’s letter and subsequent interview were indicative of “clown-car economics”.Scrapping clean energy projects could be politically risky for Reform given the number of jobs they support. The party’s mayor for Hull and East Yorkshire, Luke Campbell, haspreviously saidhe would back such plans if they create jobs in the region.The party’s wider stance on doubting human-created climate change and the need to tackle it is also at odds withmajority voter viewsin the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, the value of the windfarms, nine of which are operated by BP, is understood to be lower than the $2bn (£1.5bn) valuation estimated for BP’s onshore wind business in the past.The sale is part of BP’s plan to offload $20bn in assets “to simplify and focus the business” after a failed attempt to reinvent the oil multinational as a net zero energy company, and as it comes under pressure over its sluggish share price.BP said it was “no longer the best owners” to take the wind business forward. Renewable energy in the US has facedincreasing pressure under Donald Trump’s presidency.The deal emerged weeks afterone of the architects of BP’s failed green agenda, Giulia Chierchia, stepped down from her role as executive in charge of sustainability strategy to “pursue other opportunities” outside the company as it shifted back towards oil and gas production. She will not be replaced at BP, the company said.BP’s botched green ambitions have contributed to a collapse in the company’s share price over recent years, which has made the 120-year-old company easy prey.Shell was forced last month to deny market speculation that itplanned to snap up its smaller rival. Shell has lost almost a third of its market value in the past year and is now worth about £58bn.Its reported interest in BP emerged months after the activist hedge fund Elliott Management amassed a stake in the company to agitate for changes to BP’s strategy and its board.So far the turnaround plan spearheaded by BP’s chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, has failed to convince investors that the company can recover from a difficult few years during which its rivals have thrived by focusing on fossil fuels while global markets have been volatile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While it can sometimes keep workers safe by relieving buildups of pressure, the practice is routine in many countries because it is often cheaper to burn gas than to capture, transport, process and sell it.Global gas flaring rose for a second year in a row to reach its highest level since 2007, the report found, despite growing concerns about energy security and climate breakdown.It found that 151bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas were burned during oil and gas production in 2024, up by 3bcm from the year before.“Flaring is needlessly wasteful,” said Zubin Bamji, the manager of the World Bank’s Global Flaring and Methane Reduction partnership (GFMR), which wrote the report. “[It’s] a missed opportunity to strengthen energy security and improve access to reliable power.”Graph of gas flare volumes from 2019-24In many cases, observers complain, the rules to prevent needless flaring are weak and poorly enforced, and companies have little incentive to stop doing it because they do not have to pay for the pollution it causes.The report found that nine countries – Russia, Iran, Iraq, the US, Venezuela, Algeria, Libya, Mexico and Nigeria – were responsible for three-quarters of all gas flaring in 2024. Most of the worst offenders were countries with state-owned oil companies.Despite efforts to stop the practice, the intensity of flaring – the volume flared per barrel of oil produced – had remained “stubbornly high” over the last 15 years, the report found.Flaring intensity in Norway, one of the cleanest oil and gas producers, is 18 times lower than in the US, and 228 times lower than in Venezuela, according to the data.Andrew Baxter, an oil and gas expert at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, who was not involved in the report, said it was “deeply disappointing” to see a return to the gas flaring levels of 2007.“Such levels of flaring are an egregious waste of resources,” he said. “[They] are catastrophic for climate and human health.”The InternationalEnergyAgency has called for the elimination of all flaring except in emergencies by 2030. The value of gas flared last year, which would have been worth about $63bn at EU import prices for 2024, is more than half of the upfront costs that the IEA says are needed to stop the practice altogether.Jonathan Banks, a methane expert at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force, who was not involved in the report, said solutions were well known and often cost-effective. “What is missing is the political will and regulatory pressure to implement them at scale.”The report highlighted areas of progress, pointing to some oil and gas producers, such as Angola, Egypt, Indonesia and Kazakhstan, that had successfully reduced the amount of gas flared.Kazakhstan, which has levied steep fines on companies that break the rules, had reduced flaring by 71% since 2012.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

According to the report, countries that endorsed the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative have on average reduced their flaring intensity by 12% since 2012, though absolute volumes have fallen only slightly in that time, while countries that have not made the pledge increased their flaring intensity by 25%.“Reducing gas flaring is not without challenges,” said Bamji. “It requires upfront investment, adequate infrastructure, strong regulatory frameworks and sustained political will.”If those conditions were in place, countries could significantly cut flaring, “often while unlocking new sources of revenue and improving energy access”.This article was amended on 18 July 2025 to clarify that the 12% average reduction of flaring intensity since 2012 covers 36 jurisdictions in the GFMR, not just Norway, the US, and the UAE.Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsGasEnergyPollutionClimate crisisWorld BankAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “She was a wonderful, warm person with an infectious personality that lightened any room she entered.”He said the home had let down his daughter and Conroy. “He should never have been given the opportunity to murder Melissa. It was well known that he was at extremely high risk of murdering someone, particularly petite females, and he should never have been allowed to wander a care home, unsupervised.”In her conclusion, Voisin said: “A catalogue of failures resulting in his placement with no effective risk assessment in place resulted in the death of Melissa.”The coroner highlighted that Mathieson had said she thought Conroy, who was 18 at the time, was stalking her and was frightened of him. Some staff members had also flagged up concerns but no action was taken.In a narrative conclusion, the coroner said Mathieson “died as a result of unlawful killing caused by both the act of strangulation and also due to the acts and omissions by the home entrusted with her care”.She added: “The placing authority [the States of Guernsey], knowing this resident’s risk, should not have agreed to the care plan and package being offered; they failed to act when concerns were raised.”The inquest heard that Conroy had a troubled early childhood on Guernsey and was sent at the age of seven by the island’s government to the UK to be looked after.While living in care homes in England, he exhibited “extreme sexualised behaviour” and attacked three female members of staff.The most serious was in March 2013 aged 17 when he assaulted a staff member at Options Higford school in Shropshire.After trying to touch the staff member inappropriately, he put his forearm around her neck and squeezed until she lost consciousness.Conroy admitted to a forensic psychologist, Hilary Grant, that he wanted to kill the staff member and have sex with her body. The psychologist said he posed a high risk, especially to petite young women, and it was imperative he was “highly supervised” at all times. The report said that if he was not supervised tightly, it was “almost certain” he would attack again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The school told the States of Guernsey it could not continue to care for him. A consultant psychiatrist identified Alexandra House in Bristol on behalf of Guernsey as a potential new home.Conroy moved there at the end of August 2014 and was given much freedom.At night, the inquest heard, one staff member was awake and on duty monitoring 16 residents over Alexandra House’s three floors, meaning Conroy was allowed to “roam around” unsupervised. Mathieson told staff she felt he was always “lurking”.In October 2014 Conroy strangled Mathieson, planning to take her body back to his room and sexually abuse her.He was jailed for life.During the inquest, Yvonne Hin, the then manager of Alexandra House, said she did not see the crucial Grant report until after Mathieson was killed.John Duggan, the registered general manager of the home, accepted that the Grant report was “available” to Alexandra House from the beginning of August.He said changes had been made to how residents were assessed and supervised but the coroner said she would write to the organisation with remaining concerns about elements of how it was run.Conroy’s social worker, Sename Abotsi, a locum working for the States of Guernsey at the time, expressed surprise during the inquest when told there was only one “waking” staff member on duty at night. She said she had no experience of placing a high-risk person.The hearing was told that the States of Guernsey paid £1,800 a week for Conroy’s place at Alexandra House – less than half what the type of supervision he had been under at Options Higford would have been expected to cost.Dr Dominic Bishop, the clinical director of specialist mental health and adult disability services for Guernsey, accepted during the inquest there had been as series of “systemic difficulties”, but said the island had made wide-ranging changes to address the issues the case exposed.Joseph Morgan, a solicitor for the Mathieson family said: “The coroner’s findings are utterly damning.” He said: “It is desperately tragic that a young woman was deprived of her life as a result of these catastrophic, multi-agency failures.”Explore more on these topicsSocial careCrimeBristolGuernseyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A second person was arrested on Thursday night for failing to comply with orders given around dispersal and remained in custody.He said the “selfish criminality” began at after 6.30pm following a “peaceful protest”. The violent crowd eventually dispersed at 11pm.Hundreds of people had staged a demonstration outside the hotel in Epping, which has become a flashpoint for anti-immigration protest, days after two security guards were seriously assaulted during Sunday’s gathering.Hope Not Hate said it had identified several far-right activists involved in the protests.“Worryingly, some are calling for further unrest across the country, invoking ‘the lessons of Ballymena’ – referencing the anti-migrant violence in the Northern Irish town last month – and framing the Epping protests as the beginning of a “summer of disorder,” the group in a statement.Hooper urged people not to attend any future protests outside the hotel that have been discussed on social media. In reference to last year’s riots, he said: “If you are coming here with the intention of carrying out mindless thuggery, that is not acceptable and we will deal with that.“Whether it be our police vehicles being damaged, our officers being assaulted, we’ll make sure that those people feel the full force of the law.”Tensions were high before the latest appearance in court on Thursday of an asylum seeker who has been charged with three counts of sexual assault. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, who denies the offences, was remanded in custody before a two-day trial next month at Chelmsford magistrates court.Earlier on Thursday, an anti-racism demonstration took place near the town’s railway station. Later hundreds of people congregated outside the hotel, with a flat-bed trailer on a lorry bearing a banner that read: “Protect our kids.”Those present included people wearing T-shirts of the Britain First party. Far-right activists, who have a significant local presence, were central to the protest on Sunday and have been vocal on community Facebook groups.Hooper said: “It’s our place to make sure that, without fear or favour, we’re supporting the right to protest. And that’s what we tried to achieve last night.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Two children who were taken to Bristol Royal hospital for children by air ambulance also remain in hospital. The coach was the only vehicle involved, they added.The driver of the coach, which was carrying 60 to 70 people, is in hospital injured but in a stable condition, while school routes run by the coach company have been suspended. It is understood the children were divided between two coaches, with the first to leave the zoo making it back safely.Six schools, including Minehead middle school, which are all part of Beacon Education multi-academy trust, were closed on Friday as the community dealt with the aftermath of the crash that occurred between Wheddon Cross and Timberscombe.Teams from Avon and Somerset police, Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service and South Western ambulance service were all involved at the scene, supported by the National Police Air Service helicopter, as well as Devon air ambulance, and Dorset and Somerset air ambulance.Police said 24 volunteers from Exmoor search and rescue, a mountain rescue team, carried out first aid triage at Rest and Be Thankful pub at Wheddon Cross, which was set up as an official rest centre.The school’s headteacher, Laura Mackie, told ITV she was “completely heartbroken”.She said: “The loss is unimaginable and we keep the student we have lost in our hearts. I am thinking of the student that we lost, their family, their friends and all of their loved ones.“I am thinking of my staff team who are amazing and dedicated and all of our wonderful students that have been affected by this awful incident. It has just been horrific.”Keir Starmer paid tribute on social media. Posting on X, he said: “A heartbreaking update on the school bus crash in Somerset. There are no adequate words to acknowledge the death of a child. All my thoughts are with their parents, family and friends, and all those affected.”A steady stream of people have been laying flowers outside Minehead middle school, along the railing on Townsend Road.Staff from nearby Old Cleeve preschool wrote: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by this tragic incident.”Another said: “Thinking of everyone at this heartbreaking and devastating time. Our community is holding you all tight and surrounding you with love.”View image in fullscreenA message from Minehead town council said: ‘We share your sorrow.’Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA MediaSpeaking outside Minehead middle school, the Rev Philip Butcher, the vicar of Minehead, said: “It was absolutely numbing. There are no words to describe what happened yesterday. It’s an absolute tragedy, and one that’s still very much unfolding. We’re just standing firm with the school, with the families at this time, just to be with them in this time as a point of support.”The director of Ridlers Coaches, Peter Prior-Sankey, confirmed the driver was in a stable condition in hospital but with a number of injuries. “We are in contact with his wife and family and have offered ongoing support,” he said.Prior-Sankey said a decision had been made not to run any school routes into Minehead, and that discussions would continue over the coming days concerning any other affected routes or contracts.A statement from Exmoor zoo said: “We cannot believe that fate has been so cruel to such a lovely, lively, well-behaved group of children from Minehead middle school on their way home with their coach. All our thoughts, blessings and prayers go out to everybody involved. We cannot comprehend what the children, their families, teachers and emergency crews are all going through now.”Recovery of the vehicle and the collision investigation would be complex, police said, and the road was expected to remain closed for a “considerable” time. Avon and Somerset police asked for witnesses to contact 101.Explore more on these topicsSomersetEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It contained pages of classified adverts for public sector jobs and was a unique space for social policy reporting and commentary.The Society pages, which Dean edited for two decades, made their debut just four months after Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives were elected and had begun to dismantle the welfare state.The seismic importance of this was not lost on Dean, who noted in hisfirst Society columnthat decades of postwar optimism had led people to confidently assume that “society tomorrow” was always “going to get better”.He wrote: “But for the first time since the founding of the welfare state this is no longer true. If Mrs Thatcher proceeds with the cuts that she has threatened, society today looks far preferable to society tomorrow.”Dean had just returned to the paper after a one-year secondment as a special adviser to David Ennals, then Labour’s social services secretary. He was convinced that experiencing life from “the other side” would benefit his journalism.After retiring from the Guardian, Dean took up a two-year fellowship at Oxford’s Nuffield College, where he would draw on his journalistic experience to write a book,Democracy Under Attack: How the Media Distort Policy and Politics.He continued as aGuardian contributorand served on several national social policy working parties. He chaired a Joseph Rowntree Foundation commission on older people and was a founding trustee of theYoung Foundationthinktank.Dean, who died on Thursday, was born in Cheshire, the son of a village baker. He started as a local journalist and worked in the US Congress on a Harkness fellowship before attending Ruskin College, Oxford.Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

He suffered light injuries to his right leg.‘He felt our pain’: Catholic church in Gaza grieves Pope Francis’s deathRead moreIsrael resumed its strikes on Friday morning, with at least 14 Palestinians reported to have been killed acrossGaza.Pizzaballa and Theophilos, who last week travelled to the occupied West Bank after an attack on a Byzantine-era church blamed on Israeli settlers, met local Christians.As they entered the enclave, Pizzaballa received a call from Leo, who was elected as successor to Francis in May.“Pope Leo repeatedly stated that it is time to stop this slaughter, that what has happened is unjustifiable, and that we must ensure there are no more victims,” he toldVatican News.In a statement on Thursday, the pope had called for “an immediate ceasefire” in Gaza and expressed his “profound hope for dialogue, reconciliation and enduring peace in the region”.The Greek Orthodox patriarchate said the visit was “a powerful expression” of church unity and solidarity. Among the delegation were representatives from more than 20 countries, including Jordan, Russia, China, the EU, Japan and Canada.Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the group arrived with 500 tonnes of aid for local civilians.“The Italian government calls on Israel to stop military actions and to fully guarantee the safety of the two envoys in their important mission,” Tajani said.Both Italy and France called the strike “unacceptable” and Donald Trump called Netanyahu after having “not a positive reaction” on hearing about it, according to Karoline Leavitt, the US president’s press secretary.“It was a mistake by the Israelis to hit that Catholic church, that’s what the prime minister relayed to the president,” she told reporters.There are about 1,000 Christians among Gaza’s population of more than 2 million. Most are Greek Orthodox, with about 135 Catholics, according to the Latin patriarchate.Israel’s military says it does not target churches and religious sites but it has bombed mosques. The Jerusalem patriarchate said there had been “repeated assaults on Christian holy sites in Gaza”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelChristianityPope Leo XIVCatholicismnewsShareReuse this content"

The contraceptives are primarily long-acting, such as IUDs and birth controlimplants, and were almost certainly intended for women inAfrica, according to two senior congressional aides, one of whom visited a warehouse in Belgium that housed the contraceptives. It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.“It is unacceptable that the State Department would move forward with the destruction of more than $9m in taxpayer-funded family planning commodities purchased to support women in crisis settings, including war zones and refugee camps,” Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, said in a statement. Shaheen and Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii, have introduced legislation to stop the destruction.“This is a waste of US taxpayer dollars and an abdication of US global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths,” added Shaheen, who in June sent a letter to the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, about the matter.‘Profound alarm’: US veterans agency roiled by fight over anti-discrimination provisionsRead moreThe department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that prohibit sending US aid to organizations that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas, according to the state department spokesperson.Most of the contraceptives have less than 70% of their shelf life left before they expire, the spokesperson said, and rebranding and selling the contraceptives could cost several million dollars. However, the aide who visited the warehouse said that the earliest expiration date they saw on the contraceptives was 2027, and that two-thirds of the contraceptives did not have anyUSAIDlabels that would need to be rebranded.The eradication of the contraceptives is part of the Trump administration’smonths-longdemolitionof the Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for humanitarian and development aid in the world. After the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge)erased 83%of USAID’s programs, Rubioannouncedin June that USAID’s entire international workforce would be abolished and its foreign assistance programs would be moved to the state department. The agency will bereplaced by an organizationcalled America First.In total, the funding cuts to USAIDcould lead to more than 14m additional deaths by 2030, according to a recentstudypublished in the journal the Lancet. A third of those deaths could be children.“If you have an unintended pregnancy and you end up having to seek unsafe abortion, it’s quite likely that you will die,” said Sarah Shaw, the associate director of advocacy at MSI Reproductive Choices, a global family planning organization that works in nearly 40 countries. “If you’re not given the means to space or limit your births, you’re putting your life at risk or your child’s life at risk.”The fact that the contraceptives are going to be burned when there’s so much need – it’s just egregiousSarah Shaw, MSI Reproductive ChoicesMSI tried to purchase the contraceptives from the US government, Shaw said. But the government would only accept full price – which Shaw said the agency could not afford, given that MSI would alsohave to shoulder the expense oftransportingthe contraceptives and the fact that they are inching closer to their expiration date, which could affect MSI’s ability to distribute them.The state department spokesperson did not specifically respond to a request for comment on Shaw’s allegation, but MSI does provide abortions as part of its global work, which may have led the department to rule it out as an “eligible buyer”.In an internal survey, MSI programs in 10 countriesreported that, within the next month, they expect to be out of stock or be on the brink of being out of stock of at least one contraceptive method. The countries include Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Senegal, Kenya and Sierra Leone.Shaw expects the stock to be incinerated. “The fact that the contraceptives are going to be burned when there’s so much need – it’s just egregious,” she said. “It’s disgusting.” The Department of State spokespersondid not respond to a request for information on the planned method of destruction.The destruction of the contraceptives is, to Shaw, emblematic of the overall destruction of a system that once provided worldwide help to women and families. USAID funding is threaded through so much of the global supply chain of family planning aid that, without its money, the chain has come apart. In Mali, Shaw said, USAID helped pay for the gas used by the vehicles that transport contraceptives from a warehouse. Without the gas money, the vehicles were stuck – and so were the contraceptives.New York county clerk rejects Texas’s effort to fine doctor in abortion pill caseRead more“I’ve worked in this sector for over 20 years and I’ve never seen anything on this scale,” Shaw said. “The speed at which they’ve managed to dismantle excellent work and really great progress – I mean, it’s just vanished in weeks.”Other kinds of assistance are also reportedly being wasted. This week,the Atlantic reportedthat almost 500 metric tons of emergency food were expiring and would be incinerated, rather than being used to feed about 1.5 million children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Meanwhile, almost 800,000 Mpox vaccines that were supposed to be sent to Africa are now unusable because they are too close to their expiration date,according to Politico.The cuts to foreign aid are slated to deepen. Early on Friday morning, Congresspassed a billto claw back roughly $8bn that had been earmarked for foreign assistance.“It’s not just about an empty shelf,” Shaw said. “It’s about unfulfilled potential. It’s about a girl having to drop out of school. It’s about someone having to seek an unsafe abortion and risking their lives. That’s what it’s really about.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationContraception and family planningHealthWomenUSAIDUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The arrangement drew immediate blowback when Trump invoked an 18th-century wartime law to quickly remove men his administration had accused of belonging to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang.The Venezuelans have been held in a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or Cecot, which was built to hold alleged gang members in Bukele’s war on the country’s gangs. Human rights groups have documented hundreds of deaths and cases of torture inside its walls.Venezuelans deported by Trump are victims of ‘torture’, lawyers allegeRead moreThe release of the Venezuelans is an invaluable win for Maduro as he presses his efforts to assert himself as president despite credible evidence that he lost re-election last year. Long on the receiving end of accusations of human rights abuses, Maduro for months used the men’s detention in El Salvador to flip the script on the US government, forcing even some of his strongest political opponents to agree with his condemnation of the migrants’ treatment.The migrants’ return will allow Maduro to reaffirm support within his shrinking base, while it demonstrates that even if the Trump administration and other countries see him as an illegitimate president, he is still firmly in power.Venezuelan authorities detained nearly a dozen US citizens in the second half of 2024 and linked them to alleged plots to destabilize the country. They were among the dozens of people, including activists, opposition members and union leaders, that Venezuela’s government took into custody in its brutal campaign to crack down on dissent in the 11 months since Maduro claimed to win re-election.The US government, along with several other western countries, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won the July 2024 election by a more than a two-to-one margin.The dispute over results prompted immediate protests, and the government responded by detaining more than 2,000 people, mostly poor young men. González fled into exile in Spain to avoid arrest.Despite the US not recognizing Maduro, the two governments have carried out other recent exchanges.In May, Venezuela freed a US air force veteran after about six months in detention. Scott St Clair’s family has said the language specialist, who served four tours in Afghanistan, had traveled to South America to seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.St Clair was handed over to Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy for special missions, during a meeting on a Caribbean island.Three months earlier, six other Americans whom the US government considered wrongfully detained in Venezuela were released after Grenell met with Maduro at the presidential palace.Grenell, during the meeting in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, urged Maduro to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the US. Hundreds of Venezuelans have since been deported to their home country, but more than 200 deported from the US have been held since mid-March at the prison in El Salvador.Lawyers have little access to those in the prison, which is heavily guarded, and information has been locked tight, other than heavily produced state propaganda videos showing tattooed men packed behind bars.As a result, prominent human rights groups and lawyers working with the Venezuelans on legal cases had little information of their movement until they boarded the plane.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasEl SalvadornewsShareReuse this content"

Why 2025’s charts are so staleExperts say this year has produced the fewest new hit songs in US history – and it might signal the end of a singular seasonal smashSam WolfsonFri 18 Jul 2025 12.08 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 13.22 EDTShareA spectre is haunting America – the spectre ofShaboozey.Despite it coming out in April 2024, Shaboozey’s huge hit A Bar Song (Tipsy) is still, billions of streams later, at No 5 on this week’s Billboard chart. Its country-tinged refrain of “everybody at the bar gettin’ tipsy,” an interpolation from J-Kwon 2004 hit Tipsy, has stuck around well past closing time.It’s not the only one. It’s joined in this week’sBillboard Top 10 (which combines streaming and radio airplay data in the US from a given week) byTeddy Swims’sLose Control, which was released in June 2023;Bruno MarsandLady Gaga’sDie With A Smile, which was released in August 2024; and Luther byKendrick Lamarand SZA, which came out in November 2024.The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreChart analysts say that 2025 has produced the fewest new hit songs in US history. The mid-year report from Luminate, the company that produces the data for the Billboard charts, shows that of the top 10 most listened to songs so far this year in the US, only onewas released in 2025: Ordinary byAlex Warren. All the others are tracks from 2024 and 2023 – No 1 is Luther.As a result it kind of feels like this year’s song of the summer is sort of … nothing. Or just the same as last year’s? Despite a slew of recent releases from artists Lorde, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Miley Cyrus and Lil Wayne, nothing is really crossing the threshold of hit song.Obviously what makes a summer hit is a somewhat vibes-based determination that is hard to put an exact number on, but in the industry getting close to a billion global streams means you have had an unavoidably massive track - and only Ordinary, along with the two Bad Bunny songs DTMF and Baile Inolvidable that were mostly streamed outside the US, have managed that.Things were very different this time last year, when almost the entire Top 10 was filled with huge new hits: Not Like Us by Kendrick, Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, Beautiful Things by Benson Boone and the aforementioned Shaboozey – back when it was a new song. All of these reached the billion streams mark, with Chappell Roan and Charli xcx making multiple chart entries later on in the year.Of course there are thousands of smaller and medium-sized artists who are having great years, but why have things become so stale at the very top of the charts?We’re starting to notice a jump in people streaming recession pop and it does point to a sort of this communal yearning for things that bring comfort from the pastJaime MarconetteIn part it is because the overall volume of new music (defined as the songs released in the last 18 months) being listened to is down slightly year on year, around 3%, but it’s more pronounced in genres such as pop and hip-hop, where listeners are turning towards nostalgia and delving into back catalogues.Artists that have produced a lot of hype releases this year likeAddison Rae,LordeandHaimhave not produced radio songs that appeal to a mass audience, arguably putting more focus on creating an album and aesthetic that works for committed fans. Even stars such as Lizzo and Justin Bieber, who have topped a billion streams in the past, have made records with less obvious choruses and pop production.Some artists just are trying and missing. Carpenter, one of the most successful artists of last year, could nott quite recreate the magic this summer with Manchild, which was a small hit and did hit No 1 for a week before falling down the charts. Her album slated for release later in the summer might still provide a song with more chart staying power.It has long been the case that the pipes through which new music is discovered have become calcified. Less people listen to Top 40 radio, or watch late-night shows, meaning it’s harder for a band to have that one big moment when they break into the mainstream. And while TikTok does help certain songs filter into the consciousness, there’s still not a fail-safe mechanism for getting them off the app and into the charts.It does not help that the one song that is unambiguously a breakout mega hit this year, Ordinary by the 24-year-old California singer-songwriter Warren, is a little insipid and forgettable, a song desperately indebted to mid-2010s Hozier and Imagine Dragons. Hardly a feelgood song of the summer.But, as Jaime Marconette, the vice-president of music insights and industry relations at Luminate, says, this drift away from new music is not present in every genre.“It’s true that in some genres, like R&B and hip-hop, people are listening to less new music, whereas with Christian and country in particular, they’re actually gaining listeners to new music.”He points to Hard Fought Hallelujah, by Christian singer-songwriter Brandon Lake and country star Jelly Roll, as an example of the way the genres are combining to reach wider audiences. “Christian is the most current streaming genre right now [with the largest proportion of streams to new tracks]. These are genres where their fans were a little bit later to the streaming game but are now starting to really embrace it.”Marconette also says that this is not unprecedented - there have been other years, particularly during the Covid pandemic, when there were fewer new songs in the charts – after which new music bounced back.“In the Covid period, there was a lot of dramatic things happening in our world. So, it is interesting that now in a period where there’s uncertainty out there, we’re seeing it again,” he says. “Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but we’re also starting to notice a jump in people streaming recession pop [music released around 2008 with escapist themes from artists such as Taio Cruz and Nicki Minaj] and it does point to a sort of this communal yearning for things that bring comfort from the past.”It’s not all bad news: a couple of pop songs this year are streaming pretty well: Bad Bunny has had a string of huge hits outside of the US. Carpenter, Ty Dolla $ign, Maroon 5 and Drake all have records coming out this summer that might change things. Marconette also pointed to the return of K-pop group BTS and the success of the soundtrack to Netflix’s animated movie KPop Demon Hunters as big players for the second half of the year.Of course, there is plenty of superlative new music, filed away in millions of private playlists, that might be someone’s personal sound of the summer. The charts have never been guardians of taste or even vibes.But it is much harder for one such song to become a communal and inescapable hit. Whether this year is an anomaly or just another sign of ongoing cultural fragmentation remains to be seen.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockCountryHip-hopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Surrounded by rocks, he arranges himself in a sun chair on a small, raft-like deck. Breathing through a long curved tube, an oxygen tank tucked beneath his white shirt, he seems utterly self-sufficient, like a shipwreck survivor, lost in his thoughts.It is a startling opening to a 45-minute piece that would be called performance art in a gallery. On a bank of seats facing the three-metre-high glass tank, the small audience surveys the specimen in front of them. A dizzyingly inventive physical performer and director,Murfi often collaborateswith other theatre, dance and opera artists. Here his director is Kellie Hughes, with designers Sabine Dargent (set) and Sinéad Wallace (lighting). While it seems to flow dreamily, this arresting new work they have created with Loco & Reckless Productions and Galway international arts festival relies on pinpoint precision and skill.It is only when Murfi’s Robinson Crusoe-like character completes his fastidious weightlifting routine that he pays attention to the teeming life around him, as swarms of fish approach him – bream, wreckfish and starry smooth-hound sharks, according to the programme. To a soundtrack of honking traffic, he playfully conducts the fishes’ darting movement. Later he plays piano in the water, the accompanying music evoking memories that seem linked to a past loss. Face down, rolling and gliding like an astronaut, he is riding waves of grief.Declan Gibbon’s string and percussion score surges, as an agitated Murfi shines a torch through the glass at us, searchingly. As the tempest subsides, he undulates and floats, now with an affecting sense of surrender or acceptance. With the fish encircling him as he swims, he has undergone “a sea change, into something rich and strange”.At Galway international arts festival until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

She was settling down to a new life with the directorRoy Battersbyand looking to the future when she landed one of her best roles, in the seven-part romantic drama Yesterday’s Dreams (1987). As a divorcee in a new relationship with a mechanic, she is still being wooed by her former husband, a high-powered business executive. Her character, Diane, eventually decides to leave the past behind.Loe was also firmly fixed on the future, although she did not forget happy times with Beckinsale and their daughter. “We have striven towards the right balance, a way of keeping Richard still in our hearts while carrying on with our lives,” she told the TV Times magazine.Just five years after Beckinsale’s death, memories were stirred when Loe starred in the writer Roger Marshall’s drama serial Missing from Home (1984) as a mother-of-two who has to cope after her husband suddenly disappears.Her television breakthrough had come in 1970 in ITV’s children’s fantasy drama Ace of Wands, starring Michael MacKenzie as Tarot, a magician who uses his supernatural powers to defeat evil-doers from art thieves to Nazis. She appeared in the first two series as his stage assistant, Lulli (Lillian) Palmer, a telepathic orphan who communicates with him over long distances.Trevor Preston, who later created Out and Fox – hard-hitting dramas featuring those on the wrong side of the law – devised Ace of Wands as a crime series for children, although Loe later said that she regarded her role as largely “decorative … always having to be rescued by the man”.In the sitcom Goodnight and God Bless (1983), she was Celia Kemp, the neglected wife who hates the TV game shows hosted by her husband, Ronnie (Donald Churchill), who is not so genial off screen. It ran for only one series.A more rewarding comedy role came in Singles (1988-91), in which she played the recently separated Pam, perennially chased by men.Eric Chappelland Jean Warr’s sitcom of intrigue, lies and deception also starredRoger Rees(later replaced by Simon Cadell), Susie Blake and Eamon Boland as the other singletons embarking on relationships.View image in fullscreenLoe with her daughter Kate at the Charlotte Street hotel, London, 2001.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockFor the first three series of the drama The Chief (1990-92), Loe played Elizabeth Stafford, the GP wife of the fictional Eastland force chief constable (Tim Pigott-Smith) battling the Home Office and local bureaucracy. As Commander Kathryn McTiernan, in charge of a multinational crew, she headed the cast in the Sky sci-fi series Space Island One (1998).Then, in 2001-02, she was a semi-regular in the long-running hospital drama Casualty. She played Jan Goddard, who falls for the nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) – “a strong, intelligent woman” attracted to him “because of his sincerity and vulnerability”, she explained – then becomes his boss as chief executive officer of Holby city hospital. Loe took her character to the Casualty spin-off Holby City (2002-03), with the action focused on surgical wards rather than A&E.Born in Manchester, she was the daughter of Nancy (nee Jones), a department store assistant, and Norman Loe, a travelling sales rep, and attended Urmston grammar school. After gaining a degree in English and drama from Birmingham University, she acted in repertory theatre in Crewe (1968-69) – where she met Beckinsale – then Chester (1969).She made her West End debut with a nine-month run (1969-70) in the counterculture hippy musical Hair. It was able to open at the Shaftesbury theatre in 1968, with the cast completely nude in one scene, after the abolition of theatre censorship in Britain. Pointing out that the daring scene lasted only 10 seconds, Loe told the Liverpool Echo that the production was “neither titillating nor outrageous”, adding: “In the context of this show, it seems the natural thing to do.”From there, she made her television debut in Ace of Wands, and moved straight to peak-time drama with Man of Straw, starring Derek Jacobi in a 1972 adaptation of Heinrich Mann’s early 20th-century novel prophesying German military ambitions. Loe then played Alice Lee in the BBC’s 1973 Sunday teatime serialisation of the Walter Scott novel Woodstock, and Princess Mary of Teck (later George V’s queen consort) in ITV’s 1975 13-part period drama Edward the Seventh.As she became an established character actor, she switched effortlessly from comedy (Robin’s Nest, Ripping Yarns and The Upchat Line, all in 1977) to drama (When the Boat Comes In in 1981, The Gentle Touch from 1980 to 1981, and Boon in 1990). Her later television roles included Jessica Rattigan, the manipulative wife of the Anglican bishop in the late-night ITV soap Revelations (1994-95), co-created by Russell T Davies, and Adele Cecil, a singing teacher who comes closer than most women to sweepingJohn Thaw’s Oxford detective off his feet in Inspector Morse (1997-98). Loe’s last television appearance came in Fool Me Once (2024).She married Beckinsale in 1977, two years before his death. In 1997, she married Battersby after they had been together for 15 years; he died in 2024. She is survived by Kate and by six stepchildren: the actor Samantha Beckinsale from her first marriage, and Ben, Frank, Anna, Tom and Will with Battersby.Judy (Judith Margaret) Loe, actor, born 6 March 1947; died 15 July 2025Explore more on these topicsTelevisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

The multiverse is collapsing, timelines are unravelling, box office numbers are wobbling, theKang planis in tatters and Blade is on its ninth script. So, naturally, Marvel’s answer is to hand the reins to a stretchy man in sensible shoes who once broke the entire multiverse.Yes, according toThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsdirector Matt Shakman, the awesome foursome’s Reed Richards is being lined up as the new leader of Earth’s mightiest heroes. Or at least, he is (at times) in the comics, and it looks increasingly like he might be the only reality-straddling, buttoned up polymathable to take on this job on the big screen.“He goes from being the nerdy scientist who’s locked away in the lab, to the husband and the father who’d do anything to protect his family, to the guy who’s leading the Avengers,” Shakman told Variety,in a new interview ahead of the release of First Steps. “I realised that the version we were building had to have all of those elements.”With the Fantastic Four’s debut in theMarvelCinematic Universe now only a week away, it’s perhaps the right time to take a look at exactly what kind of man Marvel might be nudging into the empty chair. Let’s not forget that this is a mantle once sort of jointly held by Iron Man and Captain America.View image in fullscreenFrom nerdy scientist to man in charge … Pascal in Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Jay Maidment/20th Century Studios/Marvel StudiosReed Richards, by contrast, is less a natural leader than he is the kind of man who accidentally invents godhood before breakfast. In the comics, he’s a genius, a father, a sometimes war criminal, and very occasionally the most powerful being in existence. If Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark was all ego, charisma and self-loathing in a can, and Chris Evans’s Steve Rogers was apple pie and emotional repression with the ability to bench-press liberty, then Reed is the guy who treats collapsing timelines like a crossword puzzle and has, on more than one occasion in the comics, tried to solve galactic crises using charts.Perhaps the difference this time around (after two attempts to bring the Fantastic Four to the big screen during the 20th Century Fox era) is that Richards is now being played by Pedro Pascal, an actor who has already proven inThe Mandalorianthat he can project warmth, gravitas and reluctant-dad energy despite wearing a bucket on his head. If anyone can revive Marvel, it’s the guy who transformed what should have been another run-of-the-mill zombie video game adaptation (The Last of Us) into high-end post-apocalyptic art-house TV.Giving Reed Richards the top job also speaks volumes about where the MCU is right now. Gone are the days of heroes with moral codes, defined character arcs, and just one version of themselves per universe. We’re deep into the age of collapse and crossover, where no one knows who’s running what, where half the audience are Googling “Wait, who is that?” during every post-credits scene, and the only thing holding the multiverse together is the vague promise thatDowney’s Doctor Doomwill eventually reboot the franchise with the sheer force of his contempt.View image in fullscreenDad energy … Pascal with Bella Ramsey in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBO/APAll of which brings us tohints this week(denied by Shakman) that the metal-plated menace might make his first appearance in First Steps, before presumably following Marvel’s first family into the main MCU in next year’sAvengers: Doomsday. If Reed is Marvel’s reset button, Doom is its nuclear option — the character you deploy when you’ve run out of timelines, villains, and narrative excuses.The idea of Reed going up against a twisted variant of the previous Avengers figurehead – if this new Doom really is some kind of alternate-universe Tony Stark with a god complex and a cloak budget – has a certain multiverse-bending symmetry to it. So why not have Reed face him down as a new type of Avengers leader? They might just be from the same universe, and this is a battle that has been carried out countless times in print. Mister Fantastic is brilliant. He’s brave. And he’s got a pretty impressive track record of saving all of existence – which could come in useful when you’re facing the sort of supervillain who treats the fabric of existence like a mood board for his ego.Unlike Stark or Rogers, Reed doesn’t need a cool catchphrase, or a billion-dollar suit with built-in sarcasm. He just needs a quiet room, a few hundred monitors, and the freedom to quietly map the collapse of the multiverse.Explore more on these topicsMarvelWeek in geekPedro PascalSuperhero moviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He plays a mild-mannered CIA cryptographer sent on a bloodthirsty revenge quest after his wife is killed in a terrorist attack. What’s fascinating about this film is that, had the lead been any other actor, it would have devolved into generic pulp. But Malek, in the hands of director James Hawes, really leans into the character’s psychopathy. He has a dead-eyed stare throughout, the sort you’d usually expect to find on a film’s antagonist. Sure, this is a globe-trotting Bourne-style romp, but you’re never allowed to forget the ethical iffiness of, say, blowing someone up inside a swimming pool.Out now, Disney+Women TalkingView image in fullscreenLingers long after the credits roll … Ben Whishaw as August, Rooney Mara as Ona and Claire Foy as Salome in Women Talking.Photograph: Michael GibsonBased on the 2018 novel by Miriam Toews, which was in turnbased on true events, Sarah Polley’sWomen Talkingis startlingly unconventional. The story of a Mennonite community in remote Bolivia, whose women discover that they are being drugged and raped, Women Talking centres around the discussion of how they should react. Do they leave, do they fight back, or do they do nothing? With a world-beating cast (Rooney Mara, Jesse Buckley, Claire Foy and Frances McDormand), the film is light on action but will linger long after the credits roll.Tuesday 22 July, 11pm, BBC TwoEmmaView image in fullscreenLively … Mia Goth and Anya Taylor-Joy in Emma.Photograph: Focus Features/Moviestore Collection/AlamyThis2020 Jane Austen adaptationwas the directorial debut of photographer Autumn de Wilde, who brought all the experience of her old career to the table. The story of a wealthy woman who attempts to act as a matchmaker, with far-reaching consequences, has been told over and over again. What sets this version apart are the lively performances – from Anya Taylor-Joy, Josh O’Connor and Bill Nighy – and visuals that are modern enough to cut through all the period stuffiness.Wednesday 23 July, 11pm, BBC TwoTin SoldierView image in fullscreenIncredible … Jamie Foxx as The Bokushi in Tin Soldier.Photograph: Unified Pictures/AlamyWell, this is a weird one.Tin Soldieris a film where Scott Eastwood attempts to infiltrate a cult and overthrow its leader. What makes it weird, however, is how heavily this is overshadowed by its supporting cast. Robert De Niro features in a typically underpowered late-stage role as a kind of military advisor. But even he recedes into the shadows next to Jamie Foxx, playing the aforementioned cult leader. He has huge hair. He has silly glasses. He has questionable facial hair. His name is The Bokushi. None of it makes any sense. It’s sort of incredible.Wednesday 23 July, Prime Videoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Knocked by Sony’s repeated duff attempts to create a universe of Spider-Man baddies, none of which actually featured Spider-Man, the film was so poorly anticipated that the director was reduced to begging people to give it a chance. The good news is that Kraven the Hunter is actually a good film. It’s less silly thanMadame Weband less wild thanMorbius. Come expecting nothing more than a sturdy action film and you shouldn’t leave disappointed.Friday 25 July, 10.50am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereHappy Gilmore 2View image in fullscreenLoud and clear … Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore 2.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Netflix/AlamyThere is a huge portion of the world that treatsHappy Gilmorelike a foundational text. A 1996 sports comedy about a short-tempered ice hockey fanatic who finds a surprising affinity for golf, this is arguably the archetypal Adam Sandler performance; loud, profane, occasionally syrupy. Now, almost 30 years later, it’s time for the sequel. Here, Gilmore is forced out of retirement to pay for his daughter’s ballet school. Expect lots of shouting, a billion cameos and – most intriguing of all – a turn by Sandler’s Uncut Gems director Benny Safdie.Friday 25 July, NetflixBlade Runner 2049View image in fullscreenA maximalist spectacle … Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarIf you need to get acquainted with the man who’ll lead James Bond into the future, this is a decent place to start. Denis Villeneuve’ssequelto Ridley Scott’s original is monumental in every way. It moves slowly but loudly, and every frame is a maximalist spectacle. Here Ryan Gosling plays a replicant who discovers that his kind are able to biologically replicate, leading him down a dark path that will take him to the fringes of society and make him question his own identity.

She’s also the absolute antithesis of maternal so she hasn’t been looking forward to the arrival of her adult son Edward (Freddie Highmore), who is visiting her on the Greek island she calls home. Not that Edward is relaxed about it either – he wants information about his elusive family background. Julie is also a former assassin. Flashbacks suggest she was a ferociously efficient one too. But how retired is she really? When her past catches up with her and the pair’s prickly but sunny sojourn is interrupted by bloody chaos, they’re forced to go on the run. Brutal action set pieces and equally brutal dialogue makes for slick, nasty fun.Prime Video, from Friday 25 JulyWashington BlackView image in fullscreenEngaging … Sterling K Brown in Washington Black.Photograph: Chris Reardon/DisneyAdapted from Esi Edugyan’sBooker-nominated novelabout slavery and emancipation, this drama flattens out some of the book’s more fantastical edges and loses a little magic but it’s still nicely realised. It follows Washington as a child (Eddie Karanja), enslaved but under the wing of white saviour Titch (Tom Ellis), and the older Washington (Ernest Kingsley Jr) as a free man, obsessed with building a flying machine and in cahoots with Sterling K Brown’s Medwin Harris. The performances are engaging and it asks serious questions about freedom in a world where Black people are constrained by their history.Disney+, from Wednesday 23 JulyAcapulcoView image in fullscreenDelightful retro stylings … From left: Rafael Cebrián, Jessica Collins and Chord Overstreet in Acapulco.Photograph: Cate Cameron/AppleIt’s the fourth and final season of this bright and breezy flashbackcomedy dramawhich delights in its sunny setting and retro stylings.

There’s hysteria in the air that feels decidedly threatening. Sure enough, beneath the ecstatic veneer of these gatherings lurked sadistic boot camps, staged martyrdom drills and an apparent attempt to turn innocent teens into a fanatical army.Prime Video, from Wednesday23 JulyHitmakersView image in fullscreenUnstoppable main-character energy … Denisia ‘Blu June’ Andrews in Hitmakers.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixA strange hybrid of talent show and luxury porn hate-watch, this reality series follows 12 (already successful) songwriters and producers including Jenna Andrews and Sevyn Streeter as they gather at a writing camp – which looks more like a swish resort from a dating show – to write songs, have minor breakdowns and figuratively scratch each other’s eyes out.

For the rest of us though, she’s a revelation. Taking inspiration from all aspects of her heritage, you’ll find traces of Buddhism, the Mongolian countryside, Chet Baker and David Byrne woven through her songs in a sound that’s classic, old as the hills and refreshingly new all at once.Her standout track to date is Chintamani, the B-side toher 2025 single Selenge. Over three minutes and 32 seconds of bliss, Dessberg mixes theyatga(a traditional Mongolian zither-harp hybrid) with old-Hollywood vocal backing and a waltz rhythm that puts it somewhere between a chaste slow-dance at prom in the 50s and the feeling of stepping into a cool, clear lake in the blazing midday sun. In Dessberg’s hands, theyatgais playful, angelic and makes you want to use words like “frolicking”. Her voice is rich and often deep, but on Chintamani it has a childlike quality too: a wide-eyed awe at the beauty of her homeland.Last year’s EP Hödööis mostly in French and it feels much more nostalgic – close your eyes and you’ll see black-and-white Nouvelle Vaguewaifs swaying in your mind. But on both releases, the warmth of Dessberg’s voice is irresistible. Even if the last vestiges of GCSE French (or Mongolian) fail you, this is music that gets you right in the heartstrings.Kate SolomonThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenSudan Archives.Photograph: Yanran XiongSudan Archives – My TypeFar from her breakout stately cello-based music, here Brittney Parks is starry-eyed as she admires a carefree high-flyer, her romantic rapped verses giving way to a rapturous chorus swirl.Water From Your Eyes – Playing ClassicsDeadpan NYC club classicism and tight-jawed hi-NRG get dragged towards a ditch of distortion in a strangely addictive confection that couldn’t be by anyone but the Chicago duo.Olof Dreijer – IrisThe former Knife member’s solo material has grown increasingly mischievous and alive over several great EPs.

Starting with thin, wobbly Moldy Peaches-style anti-folk in his teenage years, the Pennsylvania native added lusher, twangier elements – Americana with a slacker twist – before introducing glitched beats, pitched-up vocals and copious vocoder. By 2022’s God Save the Animals he had a zealous cult following and was pushing at the limits of what indie singer-songwriter fare could be, melding acoustic strumming and sweet melody with distortion that ranged from unsettlingly inhuman to downright demonic.View image in fullscreenAlex G: HeadlightsOn Headlights, his 10th album, Giannascoli, 32, reins in the warp and abrasion: the sonic invention remains, but it is deployed with increased subtlety. Exceptional opener June Guitar has chipmunk backing vocals and a surging organ riff that strongly recalls Centerfold by the J Geils Band; Beam Me Up is haunted by a mid-century sci-fi sound effect and Louisiana begins with a revving engine – yet all serve the timeless, melancholic soft-rock rather than overpowering it.It means the best bits of Headlights are not the (still highly enjoyable) off-kilter details, but the incidental shots of melody – the languid “yeah, yeah, yeah” on Beam Me Up – and the crooked love song lyrics: on the shoegazey hyperpop-punk of Bounce Boy his heart is “in braces”; on June Guitar he insists “love ain’t for the young”. The album peaks with the seemingly totally analogue Real Thing: a simply and addictively beautiful tune built around a pan flute and a witty riff on the titular romantic cliche. Giannascoli may have found a middle ground, but he’s nowhere near the middle of the road.Explore more on these topicsMusicIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

Adieu Lovely Erin starts by evoking Broadcast swirling around a maypole; then it’s as if Cocteau Twins had been transported to a traditional music session. Its sweet, high female vocals also evoke the improvisations of sean-nós singing, while simmering, krautrock-like drums build drama.View image in fullscreenPoor Creature: All Smiles TonightPoor Creature comprises three musicians expert in heightening and managing atmosphere:Landless’s Ruth Clinton, Lankum’s Cormac MacDiarmada plus live Lankum drummer John Dermody. Their debut album steeps cowboy songs, Irish ballads, bluegrass and other traditional songs in a misty, playful lightness that somehow also carries an eerie power. Bury Me Not is a 19th-century American song about a dying sailor desperate not to be buried at sea, and Clinton delivers its lamenting lyrics with a bright, shining innocence. MacDiarmada leads Lorene, a rolling, country ballad by Alabama duo the Louvin Brothers, with a similarly soft, brooding magic. Singing as a boy desperate for a letter from his beloved, despite clearly knowing he’s being ghosted, the song’s melancholy slowly rises as voice and guitar mesh together.Preprogrammed beats from a Hohner Organetta (a mid-century table-top organ), the wails of an Otamatone (a 21st-century Japanese synthesiser, shaped like a musical quaver) and a theremin add childlike, hauntological flavours to much of this music. Meat and muscle are also built into Hicks’ Farewell, a Doc Watson song fed through a sturdy wall of shoegaze, and propulsive highlight, The Whole Town Knows. Within Clinton and MacDiarmada’s dense harmonies, Dermody’s drums and the track’s cacophonous final minutes, you sense folk rocketing somewhere poppy, wild and new.Also out this monthA folk duo who also work in cabaret, performance, and installation art,Lunatraktorscollect together six years of collaborative work on their new compilation,Quilting Points: Invitations and Open Calls 2019-2025 (self-released). A loud mix of salvaged songs, archival fragments, chaos and energetic ideas, its most intriguing tracks are the Korg-propelled ’Oss Girls, inspired by the Padstow May Day song, and The Truth of Eanswythe’s Bones, a twisted choral epic inspired by the discovery of a skeleton of a 7th-century saint. Clàrsach (Celtic harp) playerGrace Stewart-Skinner’sAuchies Spikkin’ Auchie (self-released)is a moving, textured exploration of the stories and dialect of her north-east Highlands harbour village, Avoch, mixing her playing with field-recorded conversations, fiddle, double bass and drums.Toby Hay’s gorgeousNew Music for the 6 String Guitar (The State51 Conspiracy)also further confirms him as a warm, 21st-century heir to the string-bending genius of John Fahey.Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk album of the monthFolk musicLankumreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ever playful, never linear, his new novel Death and the Gardener consists of vignettes of a beloved dying and dead father, told by a narrator who, like Gospodinov, is an author. Gospodinov has spoken publicly about losing his own father recently, and the novel feels autobiographical in tone. When we read “My father was a gardener. Now he is a garden,” it is not the beginning of an Archimboldiesque surrealist tale, but rather a more direct exploration of how we express and where we put our love.It is harder to write about fathers than about mothers, the narrator says. “The father is a different sort of presence – shadowy, mysterious, sometimes frightening, often absent, clinging to the snorkel of a cigarette, he swims in other waters and clouds.” The book attempts a remedy, capturing a gentle man whose passion is his garden, and the grief of losing him. Odysseus and the biblical Joseph are used as examples of elusive fathers, but not ones without heart. The novel references the episode in Homer’s Odyssey where Odysseus, after years away, watches his aged father, Laertes, tend to his garden, and this book is in a sense an expansion of that particular scene.Death and the Gardener is also a rebuff to the kind of toxic patriarchal culture that flourished under communist rule. The narrator recalls the story someone told him of a classmate who, when asked by a teacher where his father works, replies “the slap factory”, one of the book’s both sad and funny anecdotes.Communist party officials destroy the narrator’s father’s too-tight trousers and make him cut his own hair and the “Beatles-like” hair of his young sons. The father’s life is one of poverty and lost dreams, but he “managed to turn every place into a garden, every house into a home”.A few days after his father’s funeral, the late man’s mobile phone rings. A voice on the line says, ‘Hey Dinyo, hope you’re not sleeping …’As the father ages and sickens, the narrator develops a love-hate relationship with his garden. He loves the “buzzing Zen of the bees”, its beauty, the way it is a declaration of love in a culture where “it is not customary to say things likeI love you”,but he also thinks “there was some fatal connection, some Faustian deal, between them. I imagined it slowly sucking away his strength, feeding the fruit and roses within it, the rosier the cherries, tulips and tomatoes grew, the paler he became.”We sit with the narrator in the hospital and at his father’s deathbed. Overwhelmed by medical language – “suspected propagation in the cerebrospinal canal” – he muses that “until now I had known that Latin was a dead language. Now I know that it is the language of death.”As well as describing Bulgarian funerary traditions (eat boiled wheat by someone’s grave, and you will dream about them), the novel also captures how technology has changed our relationship to death. “After death the phone is a source of metaphysical horror.” A few days after his father’s funeral, the late man’s mobile phone rings. A voice on the line says, “Hey Dinyo, hope you’re not sleeping…” We are told of a woman who buries her dead husband with his phone, only to have it ring her a few days later. “I was scared, then I decided to call him back and he didn’t answer.” The narrator, too, keeps almost accidentally calling his father before remembering.Georgi Gospodinov: ‘There was a culture of silence – it was safer not to say what you think’Read moreThere are some cliches, and the luxurious jetsetting of the narrator grows tiresome, but the occasional slip is easily forgiven in such a warm and melancholic writer – the kind who also remarks, “I wonder whether flowers aren’t covert assistants to the dead who lie beneath them, observing the world through the periscope of their stems”. The book is endlessly quotable, and the narrator’s travel bragging is put into an empathetic context by the lack of travel allowed to Bulgarians under the Soviet regime. He tells us of his father’s one trip abroad to Finland, a reward from his agricultural collective for good work. The amount that Bulgarians are allowed to spend there is limited by the Communist party. Another man on the trip smuggles extra spending money, hiding it in hand-rolled cigarettes. In a fit of excitement over finally getting to travel, he accidentally smokes it.Death and the Gardener by Georgi Gospodinov, translated by Angela Rodel, is published by Orion (£18.99).

Nothing unusual there, you might think. But not only did Phillips not invite her husband or children, she didn’t consult them, instead simply informing them that she was leaving the following week. It was an impulsive decision that she hoped would lift her out of a depressive episode that was manifesting in brain fog and anxiety. But for her husband, TV editor Martin Frizell, it was another instance of Phillips behaving oddly, a sign that things “were not all they should be”.Remember When chronicles, with illuminating candour, the changes that culminated in Phillips’sdiagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’sin 2022, at the age of 61. Billed as a memoir by Phillips herself, owing to her decline during the three-year writing process, it’s really a co-production between her, her ghostwriter Alison Phillips (no relation) and Frizell, who provides fitful interjections. As such, it offers a rare account of the impact of Alzheimer’s not just from the person who has it, but from their primary carer too.Neither of them managed to join the dots of her symptoms until comparatively lateFrizell initially attributed his wife’s symptoms to the menopause, which can also present as low mood and memory loss. Both wondered if she had long Covid, having been infected with the virus during the first lockdown. It’s a reflection of the insidiousness of Alzheimer’s that neither of them managed to join the dots until comparatively late, even though Phillips’s mother and father had developed the disease in their 50s and 60s respectively. She had even made documentaries about her parents’ decline, and was an ambassador for Alzheimer’s charities.Yet, as this book makes clear, the memory loss that is intrinsic to Alzheimer’s makes it unfathomable to the sufferer. How can you pinpoint what is going wrong with your brain when the main symptom is confusion? Among the early signs, Phillips reflects, was a feeling of flatness. She recalls going for a walk on Clapham Common in early summer 2018 and looking at other Londoners enjoying the weather. “It was like looking through a double-glazed window on to another world of which I had no part. It was a strange sense of disconnection. Of seeing others laughing, enjoying the moment, while increasingly I felt, well, nothing. Just flat.”At this point in the book, Phillips presses pause on the story of her illness to trace her early years growing up in Canterbury and, later, Southampton. Along with her childhood, we get a whistle-stop tour of her career in journalism: after starting out in local radio, she began working for Sky News and later got a job reporting for GMTV from Los Angeles. On her return to the UK in 1997, she succeeded Anthea Turner as co-host alongside Eamonn Holmes, interviewing prime ministers and Hollywood stars.The intention of this determinedly breezy segment is clear: to let us know the fearless and successful person Phillips had been before Alzheimer’s did its worst. Yet it is also revealing about the impossible juggle of fronting Britain’s leading TV breakfast show and raising a young family, while caring for her parents through their own diagnoses. Her devastation at watching them disappear before her eyes is mirrored in Frizell as he observes his wife’s incremental withdrawal from the world.This sadness erupts into anger when he states: “I wish Fiona had contracted cancer … It’s a shocking thing to say, but at least then she might have had a chance at a cure, and certainly would have had a treatment pathway, and an array of support and care packages.” As it is, following diagnosis, the Alzheimer’s sufferer and their family are largely “left to their own devices. There is nothing more that can be done and you are left to cope alone.”By the end of Remember When, Frizell’s is the dominant voice, since Phillips no longer has the capacity to articulate her experience. Early in the book she says she doesn’t want to become an object of pity, or for her story to be viewed as a tragedy. But there can be no happy ending here, no endnote of hope. Capturing the loneliness and sense of loss that occurs when a loved one is alive but no longer fully present, Frizell simply says: “I miss her. I miss my wife.”Remember When by Fiona Phillips is published by Macmillan (£22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Paramount is seeking approval for a $8.4bn merger with Skydance, a company ran by David Ellison, son of close Trump ally Larry Ellison.Colbert called it a “big fat bribe” earlier this week and later announced to his audience that the show would be ending next year. “Let me tell you, it is a fantastic job,” he said. “I wish someone else was getting it. And it is a job I am looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months.”The end of Stephen Colbert’s Late Show is a concerning nail in the coffin for comedy | Jesse HassengerRead moreThe Late Show received an Emmy nomination earlier this week for talk series.“Sorry to hear @CBS is canceling one of the best shows they have,” the actor and director Ben Stillerwroteon X. “Wishing all the people who work so hard on that show all the best.”His Severance colleague Adam Scott also shared his sentiment. “Love you Stephen,” he wrote. “This is absolute bullshit and I for one am looking forward to the next 10 months of shows.”The writer and director Judd Apatow also wrote in response toColbert’s Instagram post: “My admiration and appreciation for you is bottomless. Excited to see what other brilliance you put into the world.”Broadcast journalist Katie Couric added: “I am so upset about this. I need more information.”The West Side Story and Evita actor Rachel Zegler wrote: “i am extremely sad. i adore you, stephen.”Jon Batiste, the Grammy-winning musician who used to lead Colbert’s band on the show, called him “the greatest to ever do it” on Instagram.The author Stephen King, known for being politically outspoken online,posted: “Colbert canceled? Please tell me it’s a joke.” Jamie Lee Curtis was asked for her thoughts during a red carpet interview and said “it’s bad” and that “they’re trying to silence people”.The actor John Cusackshareda clip of Colbert on social media and wrote: “He’s not groveling enough to American fascism – Larry Ellison needs his tax cuts – doesn’t need comedians reminding people they are not cattle.”Senator Bernie Sanders alsoexpressedsimilar ire. “CBS’s billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance,” he wrote. “Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he’s fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.”Andy Cohen, the TV personality who hosts late-night show Watch What Happens Live, called it “a sad day” both for late-night television and for CBS. “I’m stunned,” he said toDeadline. “He’s one of three late-night shows deemed worthy enough for an Emmy nomination. He produces a brilliant show.”Colbert’s late-night rivals also weighed in, sharing their frustration with the decision. In an Instagram story Jimmy Kimmel poked fun at the network’s much-ridiculed comedy shows, writing: “Love you, Stephen. Fuck you and all your Sheldons, CBS.” Jimmy Fallon wrote: “I’m just as shocked as everyone. Stephen is one of the sharpest, funniest hosts to ever do it. I really thought I’d ride this out with him for years to come.” Seth Meyers also added: “For as great a comedian and host he is, [Stephen Colbert] is an even better person. I’m going to miss having him on TV every night but I’m excited he can no longer use the excuse that he’s ‘too busy to hang out’ with me.”Trump has already taken a victory lap on Truth Social, writing: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertUS televisionTelevisionUS television industryCBSTelevision industryTV comedynewsShareReuse this content"

The statement said Bergman had, in recent months, suffered from respiratory issues “but continued to write songs till the very end”.The Bergmans married in 1958 and remained together until her death, in 2022. With collaborators ranging from Marvin Hamlisch and Quincy Jones to Michel Legrand and Cy Coleman, they were among the most successful and prolific partnerships of their time, providing words and occasional music for hundreds of songs, including movie themes that became as famous as the films themselves. Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Tony Bennett and many other artists performed their material, and Barbra Streisand became a frequent collaborator and close friend.Blending Tin Pan Alley sentiment and contemporary pop, the Bergmans crafted lyrics known by millions, many of whom would not have recognized the writers had they walked right past them. Among their most famous works: the Streisand-Neil Diamond duet You Don’t Bring Me Flowers, the well-named Sinatra favorite Nice ’n’ Easy and the topical themes to the 1970s sitcoms Maude and Good Times.Their film compositions included Ray Charles’s In the Heat of the Night from the movie of the same name; Noel Harrison’s The Windmills of Your Mind, from The Thomas Crown Affair; and Stephen Bishop’s It Might Be You, from Tootsie.The whole world seemed to sing and cry along to The Way We Were, an instant favorite recorded by Streisand for the 1973 romantic drama of the same name that co-starred Streisand and Robert Redford.Set to Hamlisch’s tender, bittersweet melody, it was essentially a song about itself – a nostalgic ballad about nostalgia, an indelible ode to the uncertainty of the past, starting with one of history’s most famous opening stanzas: “Memories / light the corners of my mind / misty watercolor memories / of the way we were.”The Way We Were was the top-selling song of 1974 and brought the Bergmans one of their three Oscars, the others coming for Windmills of Your Mind and the soundtrack to Yentl, the Streisand-directed movie from 1983. At times, the Academy Awards could be mistaken for a Bergman showcase. In 1983, three of the nominees for best song featured lyrics by the Bergmans, who received 16 nominations in all.The Bergmans also won two Grammys, four Emmys, were presented numerous lifetime achievement honors and received tributes from individual artists, including Streisand’s 2011 album of Bergman songs, What Matters Most. On Lyrically, Alan Bergman, Bergman handled the vocals himself. Although best known for their movie work, the Bergmans also wrote the Broadway musical Ballroom and provided lyrics for the symphony Visions of America.Their very lives seemed to rhyme. They didn’t meet until they were adults, but were born in the same Brooklyn hospital, four years apart; raised in the same Brooklyn neighborhood, attended the same children’s concerts at Carnegie Hall and moved toCaliforniain the same year, 1950. They were introduced in Los Angeles while working for the same composer, but at different times of the day.Their actual courtship was in part a story of music. Fred Astaire was Marilyn’s favorite singer at the time and Alan Bergman co-wrote a song, That Face, which Astaire agreed to record. Acetate in hand, Bergman rushed home to tell Marilyn the news, then proposed.Bergman is survived by a daughter, Julie Bergman, and granddaughter.Bergman had wanted to be a songwriter since he was a boy. He majored in music and theater at the University of North Carolina, and received a master’s from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he befriended Johnny Mercer and became a protege. He and Marilyn at first wrote children’s songs together, and broke through commercially in the late 1950s with the calypso hit Yellowbird.Their friendship with Streisand began soon after, when they visited her backstage during one of her early New York club appearances. “Do you know how wonderful you are?” was how Marilyn Bergman greeted the young singer.The Bergmans worked so closely together that they often found themselves coming up with the same word at the same time. Alan likened their partnership to housework: one washes, one dries, the title of a song they eventually devised for a Hamlisch melody. Bergman was reluctant to name a favorite song, but cited A Love Like Ours as among their most personal:“When love like ours arrives / We guard it with our lives / Whatever goes astray / When a rainy day comes around / A love like ours will keep us safe and sound.”Explore more on these topicsMusicLos AngelesCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Ever found yourself sitting through more encores than you’d bargained for, worrying about your last train? Or mid-symphony becoming desperate to stand up and stretch?What about the longest single piece of music? Opera-goers may or may not sympathise with Rossini’s quip about Wagner’s “good moments but awful quarters of an hour”, but there is no denying the monumental scale ofDie Meistersinger, for instance, which runs to about four and a half hours, not including intervals. And then there’s the same composer’s Ring cycle – about 15 hours in total, albeit split across four instalments; as close to a marathon as classical music usually gets.I thought I couldn’t possibly write seven hours of music, but it just grew and grew and grew.Tavener, in 2013, on his Veil of the TempleUsually. But there are also a number of utterly enormous compositions lurking on classical music’s periphery. Some are basic endurance tests. Clocking in at somewhere between 10 and 19 hours, Erik Satie’s Vexations involves 840 repetitions of the same motif. (It recently got its first live UK rendition by a single pianist whenIgor Levit performed it in collaboration with the artist Marina Abramović.) Others espouse what the 20th-century music expert Tim Rutherford-Johnson calls “an aesthetic of superabundance” – none more obviously thanKarlheinz Stockhausen’s seven-part, 29-hour opera cycle Licht, for which one stage demands “an orchestra in the shape of a face”; another, four airborne helicopters.View image in fullscreenMonumental scale … Bryn Terfel in Wagner’s Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg, staged at the Royal Opera House in 2017.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianFor sheer length, however, nothing matchesLongplayer. Begun on 31 December 1999, it is a millennium-long work for Tibetan singing bowls. And also,according to its creator, Jem Finer, “a living, 1,000-year-long process – an artificial life form programmed to seek its own survival strategies”. Crucially, its main performers are computers.After all, very long pieces of music pose different challenges once humans are involved. Especially if there are hundreds of them.The opening ofthis year’s Edinburgh international festival(EIF) will feature about 250 singers in a performance ofJohn Tavener’s eight-hour choral work The Veil of the Temple. It will be the piece’s first outing in the UK since itsworld premiere at London’s Temple churchin 2003. According to the festival director,Nicola Benedetti, the performance will be “a leap into extremity and a reckoning with the existential”. Written in five languages, structured in eight cycles and “representing four major religions”, Tavener’s work is “ultimately a story of our coming together in the face of our differences”, she says.At the work's premiere, time slowed and expanded until it didn’t matter what the clock said. The music was the world: you were just living in itBut what about the practicalities? “There’s a logistical side to the musical delivery that is quite something,” concedes EIF’s head of music, Nick Zekulin. “One of the biggest challenges is rehearsing it.” The individual choirs – the Edinburgh Festival Chorus,Monteverdi ChoirandNational Youth Choir of Scotland– all have their own rehearsal time, the headache is bringing together all the musicians with the staging, “without having 10-hour calls, which you just can’t do”.Tavener billed the work as an “all-night vigil”, but even he was taken aback by the original commission from the Temple Music Trust to compose a piece that lasted an entire night. “It wasn’t my mad idea,” he said in an interview some weeks before his death in 2013. “I thought I couldn’t possibly write seven hours of music, but it just grew and grew and grew.”View image in fullscreen‘An attempt to restore the sacred imagination’ … soprano Patricia Rozario in the first performance of The Veil of the Temple.Photograph: Nina Large/© The Temple Music FoundationThe extreme length of The Veil of the Temple is a nod to the expansiveness of certain religious rituals – particularly in the Orthodox church, to which Tavener converted in 1977. “I hope that the very long journey through the first seven cycles leads us to a peak of spiritual intensity,”Tavener wrote. “The Veil of the Temple is an attempt to restore the sacred imagination.”Thomas Guthrie is directing the work in Edinburgh – but he also sang in the first performance. “There was a real sense at the beginning that nobody knew how it was going to go or what to do,” he recalls. So how did he prepare for his own long solo at 2.30am? “Bananas. Someone told me they were the best food to give the body half a chance to stay alert enough to sing.” He giggles as he remembers the start of the eighth cycle, when he had to sing: “Awake thou that sleepest” – “and literally, you know, wake people up while carrying a candle”.Steven Poolereviewed that 2003 performance for the Guardian. “The overarching memory I have,” he tells me, “is of a sense of time slowing and expanding until it didn’t really matter what the clock said. The music was like the world: you were just living in it.” Does he have any tips for people planning to attend next month? “Bring blankets. And show no mercy to anyone looking at a phone.”Yet the EIF performance will be different from the premiere, for the performers and the audience: this take on Tavener’s all-night vigil will start at 2.30pm and wrap up by a bedtime-friendly 10.30pm. Doesn’t that risk losing something crucial? “We felt it was a compromise, but a valid one,” says Zekulin. “I think probably if this were on the festival’s closing weekend, we would have done the overnight. But if you do it for the opening and you’re expecting the audience to attend an 11 o’clock recital the next day, it’s asking a lot.” He’s confident this version will have its own atmosphere: “The purpose of the piece is the journey.”View image in fullscreenAre you sitting comfortably? … beanbag seating in the Usher Hall during last year’s Edinburgh international festival.Photograph: Andrew PerryWhile Guthrie confesses “it’s a shame” to lose the darkness-to-dawn trajectory, he is finding other ways to create the all-important sense of ritual. “Lighting, magic, and the music and that space on its own will carry it.” The Usher Hall may not be a religious space, but it has “its own kind of spirituality – the shows, the musicians, the audiences that have been there before”.For the conductor Sofi Jeannin, the main concern is stamina. “I’ve never encountered a piece that lasts eight hours before,” she admits. “I didn’t say yes without blinking, because I needed time to think: am I the right person for this? Can I pace it correctly?” Unlike the singers, who’ll have breaks, Jeannin will be “on” throughout. Is she really planning to perform for eight hours straight? “The closer we get to it, the less breaks I want,” she says, eyes shining. How will she cope? “I have to look at when the musicians really need me there. I don’t necessarily need to be very active all the time.”There will be breaks during the performance – three short ones, Zekulin assures me – and audience members will be encouraged to move around, and allowed to come in and out of the hall as needed. “We’ve even talked about having a couple of plants, as it were, who sort of create that little bit of freedom,” he laughs. The Usher Hall seating, Zekulin is quick to add, has recently been renovated and is now “very comfortable. If I’m honest, I’m not sure we’d have done this piece otherwise.” This performance will also see the stalls seating replaced with beanbags. Seriously? For eight hours? “They’re not as noisy as we might remember, says Zekulin. “They’re high-quality beanbags!”The Veil of the Temple is atUsher Hall, Edinburgh, on 2 AugustExplore more on these topicsClassical musicEdinburgh festivalEdinburgh festival 2025Nicola BenedettiJohn TavenerChoral musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So this week we’re doing just that, ending our recent miniseries on the culture of the past 25 years with a listicle spectacular.We’ve picked a piece of popular culture for each year of the 21st century so far. Which isn’t to say a definitive list of the best culture of the 21st century – the Guardian’s arts desk already did thatfar more conclusivelythan we ever could. Instead, we’ve selected 21st-century TV shows, films, plays, podcasts, artworks, albums and games that together hopefully help explain how culture has evolved in that time.It’s a hefty list, so there’s no room for our regulars this week, but at least a few of these will serve as recommendations. Normal service will return next week. Anyway, on with the list!View image in fullscreenCraig Phillips outside the Big Brother house after winning the first series.Photograph: Ferran Paredes/Reuters2000| Big BrotherChannel 4, what hast thou wrought! Reality TVhas loomed over pop culturefor the past 25 years, and Big Brother’s DNA can be found in every last Real Housewife or Love Islander. But, as bad as some of the TV that followed in its wake was, BB was – in its first outing at least – a genuinely radical social experiment. And great drama too, not least when Nasty Nick broke bad midway through the series.Also this year:Radiohead’sKid Abanishes guitars – and revitalises rock music;The Simsallows gamers to play God in both mundane and thrilling ways.2001| A Stroke of GeniusThe Guardian declared this mashup of Hard to Explain and Christina Aguilera’s Genie in a Bottlethe song that defined the 2000s, and 15 years later, it still feels predictive. Witness the way that someone like PinkPantheress inserts whole choruses from other songs into her thoroughly modern dance-pop – or head to YouTube, where you can find thousands of similarly inventivecut-and-shunts.Also this year:the gorgeousSpirited Awaykicks off Ghibli-mania in the west; Jeremy Deller re-enactsThe Battle of Orgreavein a giant piece of participatory art.2002| Russian ArkNiche it may be, but Aleksandr Sokurov’s film – which traces the modern history of Russia through the halls of St Petersburg’s Hermitage Museum – was also the first pebble that started an avalanche. Its single-take conceit, fresh in 2002, has since become the go-to cinematic trick shot for show-off directors, seen everywhere from bloody war sagas to Oscar-winning navel-gazes. But unlike many of those films, Russian Ark was authentically, mind-blowingly shot in one uninterrupted take.Also this year:Martin McDonagh’sThe Lieutenant of Inishmorebrings Tarantino-level violence to the West End;The Wiredebuts and makes the TV show novelistic.2003| The Weather ProjectSince it opened in 2000, Tate Modernhas upendedthe British public’s once wary relationship with contemporary art. None of its installations better demonstrates that than the giant, beaming “sun” installed by Olafur Eliasson in the Turbine Hall, which visitors thronged to gawp at en masse. An “almost psychotropic transformation of human social behaviour” was howJonathan Jones describedthe public’s gaga response at the time.Also this year:graphic novelPersepolisis the first of many great artworks about Iran this century; the White Stripes releaseSeven Nation Army, a track that first takes over indie dancefloors – and then moves on to the football terraces.2004|World of WarcraftThe massively multiplayer online role-playing game had been around for years before Blizzard Entertainment entered the fray, but this fantasy steampunk adventure soon dominated the scene. Effectively an online version of Dungeons and Dragons, it allowed players to create warriors, join clans and fight monsters as a team – and that’s pretty much what they’re still doing 20 years later. With an estimated 7.5 million players, the virtual world of Azeroth has a larger population than Denmark.Picked by Keith Stuart, Guardian games correspondentAlso this year:Matt Stone and Trey Parker puncture liberal pieties with puppets inTeam America;Strictly Come DancingandThe X Factorreinvent shiny-floored Saturday evening TV.2005|Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro’s poignant, sci-fi-tinged novel is emblematic of the collision of pop fiction and literary fiction that seemed to accelerate in the 21st century, as serious authors like Colson Whitehead or Emily St John Mandel dabbled effortlessly in genre. But more than that, Never Let Me Go is a novel that has been held close by a generation of readers enchanted – and devastated – by its raw coming-of-age tale.Also this year:Stewart Lee ushers in the age of deconstructed standup with90s Comedian;Gay cowboy romance Brokeback Mountain has audiences weeping in the cinema aisles – and again a year later, when it loses out on the best picture Oscar to the abysmal Crash.2006|Back to BlackA mark ofhow goodAmy Winehouse’s second album was – and still is – is that it remains enlivening to listen to even while its lyrics attest to – and predict –perhaps the bleakest celebrity rise and fall story of the past 25 years. Back to Black’s merging together of classic Motown soul and contemporary, deeply personal lyrics has influenced a generation of songwriters, and set Mark Ronson on the path to being the key producer of the 21st century – but the absence of the superstar at its centre is still painfully felt.Also this year:Planet Earthchanges the game for nature documentaries; theNintendo Wiibrings a new dimension to gaming with its motion controller – leading to plenty of smashed tellies.2007 |Punchdrunk: The Masque of the Red DeathPunchdrunk’s pawprints are all over theatre this century: immersive experiences litter the West End, and audiences have grown used to finding themselves, sometimes unwillingly, part of the play. Any number of Punchdrunk productions could slot neatly into this list, but this one, a bacchanalian adaptation of Poe’s short stories made in collaboration with the Battersea Arts Centre gets the nod as the Guardian critics’ favourite Punchdrunk production of the 21st century.Also this year:The Sopranosfinale cuts to black, raising the bar for TV endings; the haunted dubstep of Burial’sUntrueinspires endless downbeat dance imitators.2008|The Dark KnightThis was the year the soon-to-be-dominant superhero movie genre split off in two distinct directions: on one path, there was the shiny, quippy planet-smashing of Marvel’s Iron Man; the other, the darkness – in both look and outlook – of Christopher Nolan’s landmark second Batman film. That Dark Knight would inspire numerous less talented film-makers to make a succession of gloomy, self-serious superhero movies shouldn’t count against what is still arguably the best superhero movie of this era. Nolan, of course, would go on to parlay its success into a series of mad, ambitious original blockbusters.Also this year:groundbreaking doc102 Minutes That Changed Americatells the story of 9/11 through a collage of amateur footage, anticipating the YouTube age;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoois translated, bringing Scandi-noir to our shores.2009|Parks and RecreationThe mockumentary has become comedy’s default mode in the 21st century: if you want to make a workplace sitcom (in aschoolor ahospital, say), you had to pretend it’s a documentary, for some strange reason. 2009 was when this informal rule was established: this year The Office US enjoyed its highest ratings, and Modern Family debuted to enormous viewing figures. Better than both though – if not as popular – was Michael Schur’s lovely local government mockumentary, which would shake off the cynicism of 00s comedy to become the first in a wave of “nice” 2010s sitcoms (The Good Place, Brooklyn Nine-Nine).Also this year:Sandbox gameMinecraftinspires a generation of “chicken jockey”-screeching coders; Jez Butterworth’s “play of the century”Jerusalemdiagnoses Broken Britain.View image in fullscreenRobyn at The Warfield in 2010, San Francisco, California.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty2010|Robyn: Body TalkGiving the world Dancing on My Own and Call Your Girlfriend – the “crying-while-dancing” ur-texts – would alone be enough to secure a place on this list. But the institutional ripple effects of Body Talk are still being felt, too. It set the template for the heights an emancipated pop star could reach. Independence from a major label allowed the Swede to pursue an auteurist strain of pop that has since become the norm – think Charli xcx et al – and Body Talk’s unerring quality brought a generation of indie snobs in from the cold, becoming a poptimist set text.Picked by Laura Snapes, Guardian deputy music editorAlso this year:Christian Marclay’s video artworkThe Clockcreates a 24-hour timepiece out of film footage;The Great British Bake Offcooks up a cosier, kinder form of reality TV.2011| White Housecorrespondents’dinnerWere these the most consequential gags of the 21st century? Many have pinpointed the flurry of digs aimed – first by Barack Obama, then comedian Seth Meyers – at a glowering Donald Trump, at this event as the inciting incident inpersuading Trump to run for presidentand stick it to the elites that had laughed at him. Perhaps we shouldn’t look back on it too fondly then – though the gags still hold up: “Donald Trump often appears on Fox, which is ironic because a fox often appears on Donald Trump’s head,” deadpanned Meyers as Trump’s vulpine ‘do quivered angrily in the audience.Also this year:Game of Throneslops off its hero’s head, changing genre TV for ever;One Man, Two Guvnorsushers in the age of James Corden.2012|The VisitorsIn a grand, dilapidated mansion in upstate New York, nine Icelandic musicians (including the artist, playing the guitar in the bath) extemporise a gently melancholic song for more than an hour. So why is this nine-screen film installation so compelling? Named after Abba’s then-final LP, The Visitors captures the wistful end of youth, the sadness at the conclusion of a marriage, and the fragile optimism of liberal America (Obama had just been re-elected). It’s as gorgeous as the last golden hour of summer.Picked byAlex Needham, Guardian arts editorAlso this year:Psy’sGangnam Stylecomplete with preposterous horsey dance becomes the biggest viral hit of the decade; Danny Boyle wows the world with theLondon 2012 opening ceremony. (Props for smugglingFuck Buttonsin there, Danny.)2013|Breaking Bad: OzymandiasThe breathless Ozymandias has a decent claim to be the best episode of TV’s golden age, but its significance is even bigger than that: it helped set Netflix on the path toreplacing TV. This was the year that the streaming service first became indispensable – thanks in part to a series of buzzy originals (House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, the Arrested Development reboot), sure. But many of us signed up that year purely to watch every horribly tense moment of Breaking Bad’s final season.Also this year:Beyoncé’sself-titled fifth LP popularises two 21st-century trends – the visual album and the surprise release;Grand Theft AutoVpushes gaming to new heights (hurry up with the sequel, Rockstar!).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A key moment in the re-emergence of the Broadway musical, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hymn to disagreeing agreeably also felt perfectly timed for Trump’s first reign. A decade and endless stagings around the world later, few recent productions can be consideredas influential.Also this year:Ta-Nehisi Coates’sBetween the World and Meis an electrifying memoir for the BLM era; Kendrick Lamar’s dizzying, righteousTo Pimp a Butterflyplays a similar role for the album.2016| Pokémon GoCreated by innovative American studio Niantic, a specialist in augmented reality mobile phone games, Pokémon Go set Nintendo’s legendary monster collecting adventure free from consoles and thrust it into the real world. Suddenly, the likes of Pikachu and Jigglypuff could be located in your garden, local town centre or on holiday, and you could team up with pals and strangers to find them. An incredible experiment in location-based entertainment, sending millions of fans out into the sunshine.Keith StuartAlso this year:Barry Jenkins’ beautiful Oscar winnerMoonlightannounces the arrival of hipster studio A24;The Crownturns the lives of the Windsors into luscious, gourmet TV.2017|Get OutNearly a decade on, the decision not to give Jordan Peele’s timely race relations horror satire the best picture Oscar seems even more glaring than it did at the time. But no matter: its influence has been felt elsewhere, with it teaching a generation of directors (Ari Aster, Robert Eggers et al) that horror – far from a constrictive and formulaic genre – could be a blank canvas on which to splatter their wildest, goriest ideas.Also this year:David Lynch breaks the rules of TV – again! – with Twin Peaks revivalThe Return; Stormzy takes grime to No 1 with debut albumGangs Signs& Prayer.2018 |Normal PeopleMarianne and Connell’s will-they-won’t-they romance took a generation by storm, earning Sally Rooneythe title of“the first great millennial author”. Set in mid-2010s Ireland, Normal People captured the post-2008 crash anxieties of the era, looking at the possibilities of love under contemporary capitalism. It also put the Sad Girl Novel on the map, with books like Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation, Naoise Dolan’s Exciting Times and Megan Nolan’s Acts of Desperation riding the wave.Picked byElla Creamer, who writes the Guardian’s Bookmarks newsletterAlso this year:Red Dead Redemption 2takes the open-world sandbox game to eye-popping new heights;Successiondebuts and everyone says they can’t stomach watching such horrible people … then do exactly that for four seasons.2019|Blinding LightsOne of the many ways Spotify has changed music is in how we quantify a hit: where once we counted in millions, we now consider billions the benchmark. Blinding Lights, The Weeknd’s synth-pop tingler, is the most listened-to song on Spotify with 3.9bn streams. A scarcely fathomable number – it would take more than 27,000 years to listen to those streams one-by-one – but also sort of small: Spotify’s only less than two decades old, after all. What sort of streaming numbers will be the benchmark when we’re halfway through this century: hundreds of billions?Trillions?Also this year:Bong Joon-ho’s brilliantParasitebreaks down theone-inch barrier of subtitles; a brilliantNan Goldinretrospective hits London – right as Goldin is tearing up the art world with her protests against opioid scions (and major art benefactors), the Sackler family.View image in fullscreenMichaela Coel in I May Destroy You.Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy2020|I May Destroy YouIt feels like Michaela Coel’s one-series wonder has been memory-holed in recent years, the result perhaps of landing smack bang in the middle of that fuzzy, time-bending Covid era. Harsh, as IMDY was and remains a major piece of work. The culmination of a decade’s-worth of auteurist comedy-dramas often mislabelled as sadcoms (Girls, Master of None, Fleabag), it stretched that mini-genre intounpredictable new shapes, reckoning with sexual assault, racism, representation, financial precarity and everything else under the sun in its restless, experimental 12 episodes.Also this year:Fiona Apple’s singularFetch the Bolt Cuttersmanages aperfect 10 on Pitchfork; Hilary Mantel completes her Thomas Cromwell trilogy – and the final book of her lifetime – withThe Mirror and the Light.2021|Bo Burnham: InsideThis was released at the peak of the “lockdown art” era, where creative types with nowhere to go made ambitious work in their own front rooms. No one pushed that idea further than Burnham, who holed himself up in his LA guest room for a year devising a musical comedy spectacular that doubled up as a meditation on lockdown loneliness. Was it even standup comedy? No one was sure, but its invention sure put the frighteners up other comics: James Acaster saidit made him want to quit comedy.Also this year:gruesome TV megasmashSquid Gamecaps a period of Korean cultural dominance; Rebecca Frecknall’sCabaretat the Kit Kat Club marked the return of theatre post-Covid, with celebrity (Jessie Buckley, Eddie Redmayne) and cocktails.2022|Top Gun: MaverickBarbenheimer might get most of the plaudits for coaxing audiences back after Covid, but it was Tom Cruise and his F-14 that really bailed cinema out at its lowest point, with a blockbuster that demanded to be seen on the big screen, then sent audiences out of multiplexes high on the heady fumes of nostalgia. Released just weeks shy of Cruise’s 60th birthday, Maverick also underscored that action cinema had become a country for old-ish men: see also Brad Pitt in this year’s F1.Also this year:Severance, a puzzle-box mystery tailor-made for the Reddit age, debuts on Apple TV+; the gaming world is bowled over byElden Ring, a jaw-droppingly vivid fantasy adventure.View image in fullscreenA Swiftie takes a photograph at the Swiftie Steps and murals at Wembley Park, north west London.Photograph: Yui Mok/PA2023| The ErastourMore than 10 million attended across 149 dates, with $2bn raised in ticket sales – plus who knows how much more from a coordinated merch onslaught … This was the tour that obliterated all tours, confirming Taylor Swift’s place as the biggest artist of her age, and maybe any age. But it was also the crowning moment of a post-pandemic communion, as people all across the world returned giddily to gigging.Also this year:The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdombecame a true crossover event, with even casual gamers entranced by its imagination and humour; Steve McQueen’s haunting video art pieceGrenfelluses drones to silently bear witness to a British scandal.2024| All FoursIf autofiction was one of the big literary trends of this century – with novelists suddenly choosing to use their own life storiesrather than making things up– Miranda July was the movement’s megastar.

Growing up in Hong Kong, a city where competition is keen, I wanted to do well. That brought a lot of anxiety.I started to practise mindfulness in 2012. It helps a lot with my emotions, and I can think more clearly. As an educational psychologist, I see lots of mental health issues. I think bringing mindfulness into our schools is an important way to find moments of calm, especially in the fast-paced city of Hong Kong.That’s what drew me to the Space‑Out competition – a contest about doing nothing. I saw it advertised on social media last year. The founder, Korean artistWoopsyang, has said that there’s a lot of societal pressure to always be productive, so it’s important to appreciate downtime.Woopsyang started the Space-Out competition inSeoul in 2014. It was a performance-art piece that involved people competing to effectively do nothing and “space out” for 90 minutes. There have since been competitions all over the world, held several times a year.I entered one in Hong Kong last October. It was a hot afternoon and the event was held in an open space inside a busy mall in the centre of the city. There were many spectators chit-chatting. About 100 people took part, each sitting on a yoga mat that had been laid out neatly on the square.Every 15 minutes or so the judges would come to measure your heart rate. These approaches make you nervousWe were guided through a series of stretches before we settled down for the 90 minutes. You have to sit there without any significant movement; you cannot sleep, make any noise or check your phone.After the time is up, the final 10 participants are voted for by the spectators, likely based on our statements about why we joined the competition, and our expressions over the 90 minutes. The finalists’ heart rates are measured throughout – the one with the steadiest is the winner.Every 15 minutes or so the judges come to measure your heart rate. These approaches make you nervous. I could feel my heart beating faster, but I tried to see it as a way to practise acceptance – to notice those feelings of tenseness, and try not to force myself to relax.We all have wandering minds – my thoughts jumped from my family, to the sound of the wind in the trees, to the fan humming around us. But you just take note of them. You observe it, like seeing the clouds up in the sky and how they come and go.I paid attention to my breath, to the feelings in my body, and my thoughts and emotions. I focused on the sensation of the breeze across my skin, noticing subtle changes in the environment and how they affected my body.Though it was a “space out” competition, I was doing the opposite: actively practising mindfulness, observing my mind and my breath.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I dropped my glasses down my nose and sat like that for the next hour.When they announced the competition was over, I wanted to sit for longer. I have a busy life – alongside my job, I am studying, and have two kids, aged 11 and nine – so having this space was a luxury, especially in this world where our minds are stimulated all day long. Often we can get through a day and our mind might not have settled for even a second.I was surprised when I was announced as the winner. I understand that, for many people, sitting in silence for 90 minutes would be a nightmare, but I found it very enjoyable.I think it’s vital to take time to come back to ourselves. In many parts of the world, people live day in, day out, never stopping – it’s as if stopping is a kind of laziness. Although the event was just for 90 minutes, it gave us a way to just be ourselves, and I hope it reminds people that productivity isn’t always the most important thing.The trophy I won is based on Rodin’s The Thinker statue. It sits in my living room, and I see it as a reminder that we should all spare at least a few minutes a day to allow ourselves to do the things that nourish us, or just to have the space to do nothing. That is a gift.As told to Naomi Larsson PiñedaDo you have an experience to share?

So, dust off that bucket and spade, pull up a deckchair and dive in.The best activities to keep your children entertained during the school holidaysReady, steady, bake!Cooking with kids teaches them how food is made and helps them understand nutrition. It might even take the pressure off you, too. It can be messy, sure – but that’s part of the fun. Start with easy tasks such as scones and cupcakes, and then move on to pizzas, sandwiches and pasta. Make meals where they have choices – jacket potatoes and wraps are ideal – so your child can choose their own fillings. Don’t forget that they can be taught the importance of washing-up and tidying away, too, especially as they get older.There are some excellent kids’ recipe ideas onJamie Oliver’swebsite andGood Food.View image in fullscreenKids’ apron£9.34 at Debenhams£10.99 at B&QView image in fullscreenKids’ baking set£29.99 at Lakeland£29.99 at AmazonArty, crafty and messyMost of us have a drawerful of art supplies, so tip them out and let kids get creative. A roll of wallpaper makes a great canvas for potato stencils, hand prints or finger painting. Collect toilet roll tubes and egg boxes for Blue Peter-style craft projects; there are lots of ideas atHobbycraft. For messy or sensory play (on a wipe-clean surface of course!), use everyday ingredients such as sand, rice,homemade play doughandpapier mache, water and even mud. You might want to invest in a garden mud kitchen, such as this one from Janod, complete with pots to inspire little chefs. Sensory play can be particularly important for children with additional needs and early years education, as it engages all the senses.View image in fullscreenChildren’s play sand, 15kg£4.50 at ArgosView image in fullscreenJanod mud kitchen£117.99 at HamleysView image in fullscreenMud kitchen£45 at ArgosNever bored with board gamesIdeal for lazy and wet days, these can be enjoyed by all. Look for age-appropriate games and get stuck in – the noisier and more frenetic, the better. Bonus points for teaching skills such as counting and recognising shapes and colours, and for games that can be played without adult supervision. Blokus is a board game for ages seven and up where your child must get as many of their coloured blocks on to the board as possible, using their cunning to block other players. Combining building and gaming skills, Lego Monkey Palace can be played by children over 10, and it exercises their creativity, as they can build the set in different ways.Card games are fun too, and have the advantage of being small, so you can take them out with you. For four years and up, Remember, Remember is a matching game that encourages memory and observation. And for kids over seven, this Tom Gates card games set has two games that develop their counting and strategy skills – it can even be played in the car or on a train. If you’re out of the house but have a tablet, the BBC has lots of freeCBeebiesgames for children, and there are plenty of free games onGoogle Playfor keeping kids entertained at the airport.View image in fullscreenBlokus£20 at ArgosView image in fullscreenLego Monkey Palace£35 at Argos£42.99 at LegoView image in fullscreenRemember, Remember£7.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenTom Gates card games set£4.99 at Zatu Games£7.99 at StanfordsMaking memoriesBuy a cheap scrapbook and use it to record memories. Stick in souvenirs: we used to include bus and train tickets, sweet packets, museum leaflets, things we found, pressed flowers, postcards – anything to remind us of places we visited. The children can write their memories around the objects, and you can print and stick in photos, too. These are lovely to look back at in later years.View image in fullscreenBlack spiral-bound scrapbook£6.50 at John LewisView image in fullscreenDIY scrapbook kit£8 at Marks & Spencer£8 at the EntertainerIf you go down to the woods today …Days out don’t have to be expensive or require Nasa-level planning. Pack a picnic, a few toys and a blanket and head to a local forest. Take a long, slow ramble and allow your children to enjoy nature. Liat Hughes Joshi, author of5-Minute Parenting Fixes, says: “I am a huge fan of encouraging children to notice nature.

Create one from blankets and sheets draped over tables or chairs, fill it with cushions and toys and let the kids hang out inside it.

Any more than that will get expensive and won’t feel as special. If you’re going away for a week or two, that leaves just four or five to plan. Pick a destination that has plenty for kids and that is a manageable distance from you – you don’t want to spend the day travelling. Here are a few ideas:Visit a farm, petting zoo or animal sanctuary to help your children learn about the animals, what they eat and how they’re cared for.Museums are mostly free and have activities for kids. Don’t neglect small, specialist museums – some of the best are those with a tight focus, such as packaging, medicine or musical instruments.

Kids like having some downtime, as school days are long and busy. Joshi agrees: “Boredom is rare in modern childhood, because it’s easy to shove a device into a child’s hand – as if we’re afraid of letting them be bored.Research suggests that boredom could lead to creative thinking. Make sure they have toys that can be used in lots of creative ways and are not finite; my favourite isa big tub of Lego bricks.”Divide up their day. There’s a reason why school days are divided into times for learning, eating and play – it helps to structure the day, and kids get a rounded day of education and physical exercise, as well as some time off. Try to mimic these parts of the school day, as kids love routine and feel calmer when they know what to expect.Make sure they’re wellrested. While it’s tempting to allow your kids to sleep late in the morning and go to bed late, routine is still important. Certified baby, child and autism sleep coach Kirsty Dawson ofthe Child Sleep Therapistsays: “While it’s normal for routines to shift slightly during the summer, maintaining a consistent bedtime and wake-up time helps your child stay well rested, regulates their mood and prevents bedtime struggles or disturbed nights. A predictable sleep schedule supports their natural body clock, making it easier for them to fall asleep and stay asleep.” She continues: “A regular bedtime ensures you get your evenings back, too. In the last two weeks of the holidays, gradually shift back to school-time sleep routines.”Avoid meltdowns. You’ve booked a big day out and, in the middle of it all, your two-year-old throws a tantrum in the cafeteria queue. “Look out for basic needs; they may be hungry, tired or thirsty, so make sure you’ve packed snacks and water,” says Joshi. “Take a break and have some quiet time. Get down to your child’s level and be a calming influence. If they’re really disturbing people, such as in a packed restaurant, take them outside.”Plan mutual play dates. Don’t forget most parents at your kids’ school are in the same position, so set up some swaps. This can help you get on with work, and you’ll find they might play better with friends.Sidestep sibling rivalry. It’s easy for one child to feel left out, especially if they have a sibling who appears to be getting more attention. Joshi suggests: “Try not to compare your kids overtly; don’t allow one to be labelled as ‘the naughty one’ or ‘the good one’. It helps to allow your child time alone with you and your co-parent, if you have one. Set ground rules when they’re old enough to understand them, such as not being allowed to take the other’s toy and no hitting.”Sally JHall is a parenting and health journalist, writing about everything from pregnancyand childbirthtobabies’ developmentand the UK toy and nursery industry.She’s also brought up two children, now in their 20s, and entertained themduring the holidays while working from home (yes, even back then).A former editor of two of the UK’s biggest parenting websites and a contributor to many more,she is passionate about helping parents avoid expensive mistakes and has reviewed everything from cribs and pushchairs to nappiesExplore more on these topicsActivities for childrenThe FilterParents and parentingToysBoard gamesHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ta-da!Helen GohFri 18 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareThere’s a touch of theatre to a bombe Alaska: the soft swoops of toasted meringue, the hidden layers revealed at the slice, the contrast of cold and flame … This one takes its cue from lemon meringue pie, reimagined as an icy dessert with a gently tangy heart. The lemon ice-cream is no-churn, which makes it blissfully easy, and it softens into a mousse-like texture, rather than melting, so this is great for entertaining, when timing isn’t always precise. Underneath is a tender pistachio sponge for a little texture and subtle nuttiness, and it’s all wrapped in a satiny meringue, torched to golden. It’s a dessert that feels doable but celebratory, a little retro and entirely joyful.Lemon meringue bombe alaska with pistachio cakePrep10 minFreeze8 hr+Cook1 hr 30 minServes8-10For the pistachio cake40g shelled pistachionuts60g plain flour½ tsp baking powder⅛ tsp fine sea salt60g room-temperature unsalted butter60g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 lemon1 large egg, at room temperature½ tsp vanilla extract40ml milkFor the lemon ice-cream330g lemon curd(shop-bought or homemade)100g condensed milk100g plain, unsweetened yoghurt1tbsp lemon juice300ml double creamFor the meringue3 large egg whites(about 90g)150g caster sugar⅛ tsp cream of tartar1 tsp lemon juice1 tsp vanilla extractLine the base and sides of a 20cm round cake tin with baking paper. Put the pistachios in a food processor and process until finely ground. Add the flour, baking powder and salt, and pulse to combine; transfer to a small bowl.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Put the butter, sugar and lemon zest in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high for about two minutes, until lightened. Beat in the egg and vanilla, then, on low speed, mix in the pistachio flour in three stages, alternating with the milk. Once just combined, scrape the batter into the lined tin and spread out evenly (it’s a very shallow cake). Bake for 15-17 minutes, until light golden brown and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Transfer the tin to a rack for a few minutes, then unmould and leave to cool completely.Line a one- to one and a half-litre pudding bowl with a few layers of clingfilm, making sure there is a generous overhang all around. Whisk the lemon curd, condensed milk, yoghurt and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Beat the cream to soft peaks, then fold into the lemon curd mix; be gentle but thorough – there shouldn’t be any white streaks. Scrape into the lined pudding bowl, then place the cake on top. Fold over the overhanging clingfilm to cover, then freeze for eight to 12 hours, until firm.Once the ice-cream has frozen, make the meringue. Find a saucepan on which your electric mixer bowl will sit stably. Fill the saucepan a quarter of the way up with water and bring to a simmer. Put the egg whites and sugar in the bowl and set it over the pan, making sure the base isn’t touching the water. Whisk until the sugar dissolves and the mix is warm; rub a bit between your fingers: it’s ready when it feels smooth and not gritty. Transfer the bowl to the mixer, and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high for a minute. Add the remaining ingredients and beat for five minutes, until thick and glossy.To serve, invert the ice-cream bombe on to a serving plate. Gently tug at the clingfilm to release the ice-cream, then lift off the bowl and remove and discard the clingfilm. Spoon the meringue generously over the bombe to cover it entirely, using a small spatula to create swoops and peaks (at this stage, it can go in the freezer until ready to serve). Just before serving, use a blowtorch to caramelise the meringue until golden brown, then slice into wedges with a hot knife (dip it in a jug of hot water first, and wipe dry).Explore more on these topicsIce-cream and sorbetThe sweet spotDessertFoodBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

Put the vodka and oil in a blender, blitz to combine, then pour into a wide plastic container (a clean empty ice-cream tub would be ideal), seal and freeze overnight. The oil will separate, rise to the top and freeze, so simply lift it off, leaving only the vodka behind (thaw the oil, save a little for the garnish and use the rest in cooking). Leave the vodka to come up to room temperature, then pass through coffee filter paper into a bottle or jar. Seal and store in the fridge for up to three months, though it’s best used within a month.To build the drink, measure all the liquids into a shaker and fill with ice. Seal and shake hard until the shaker is very cold and coated in a light frosting of ice, then fine-strain into a chilled martini glass (if you like, first dip the rim or half-rim in lemon juice and then in flaky sea salt).Put three or five droplets of olive oil on the surface of the cocktail, and serve at once.Matt Maranzano, bar manager,Templar, London E20Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

Shoulder-grazing earrings. A straw hat the size of a bike tyre. Recently, however, there has been a shift. Like celebrity bodies on the red carpet, accessories are shrinking. Everything from bags to water bottles are noticeably downsizing.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In April, Uniqlo released a micro version of its mini shoulder bag. The original banana-shaped hit, which has become the brand’sbestselling bag of all time, measured 28cm by 17cm.Its £12.90 offspringhas been scaled down to 21.5cm by 11.5cm and, like a matryoshka doll, comfortably nestles inside its progenitor.Meanwhile, a bottle that holds just 200ml of liquid is also enjoying viral fame on TikTok. Similar to a Stanley cup, theMicro Hydro Mini flaskcan be customised and engraved. But unlike its predecessor, which can hold enough water for a full day’s intake of H20 and then some, the Micro Hydro Mini stores about 3.5 gulpfuls. The palm-sized bottle sold out within 24 hours when it was launched in February, and it has since sold out several times more.View image in fullscreenBear market … Pharrell Williams’s new collectible plush charms for Louis Vuitton.Photograph: Ludwig Bonnet/JavaEvenLabubu dolls, those plush monster charms you can dangle off your bag, are getting tinier. An original fuzzy monster stands at around 17cm, but duped keychain versions measure an easy-to-lose 2cm. And then there is what you might call “LaVuVu” charms, Pharrell Williams’snew series of 10cm-high bearsoutfitted in miniaturised versions of outfits from his collections for Louis Vuitton menswear. (At £915, the price is anything but small.)Of course, there’s a practical element to this diminishing effect. Unless you are going wild camping, do you really need to lug around an industrial-sized vat of water?The original Uniqlo bag was nicknamed “the Mary Poppins carry-all”, and fans posted videos of themselvesfilling it with everythingfrom packets of biscuits to digital cameras, perfume bottles and even a rotisserie chicken. The new, compressed version, though, is also deceptively roomy. “This is exactly what I needed to keep my phone, lipstick, key card and money on me all the time on holiday!” one shopper wrote in a review on on Uniqlo’s website. “I use it everyday as it’s the perfect size to hold my essentials. Saves me digging in my bag constantly,” wrote another.But this shrinking trend also hints at something bigger. Rather than clothing or branded bags with logos, low-key accessories have become the real status signifiers. The original Uniqlo round shoulder bag was named the most popular bag of 2023 by the shopping platform Lyst. Last year, demand for the Stanley Quencher cup caused lengthy queues andeven physical fightsbetween customers. Meanwhile, last May, the official stockist of Labubu, was forced topulls dolls from 16 of its stores in the UKdue to safety concerns of customers scrapping over them.“Stuff” has never been so significant and we are laden with it. Bags are “Birkenified” with keychains, scarfs and plushies. Shoes laces are adorned with charms spanning everything from miniature-shapedplastic croissantsto strings of pearls. Some fans of the mini Uniqlo bag and the Hydro mini flask are clipping them on to bigger bags or attaching them to their belts. Instead of resembling logoed billboards, we now stroll around like beach hawkers weighed down with gear. When even an accessory requires its own accessory, no wonder the micro-scale market is booming.Tiny things have always appealed to humans. In 17th-century Japan, traditional clothing did not come with pockets so instead men used tiny carved objects called netsuke to attach their belongings to their belts, which ranged from mushrooms to a3cm-tall wooden mouse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is also more helpless, and thus controllable – comforting and completely non-threatening due to its diminutive size. The miniature is so compelling because we can love it, and it cannot hurt us.”In the way that a favourite stuffed toy or worn blanket can comfort a child, given the state of the world, can anyone really blame a a twentysomething for wanting to soothe themselves with aNoodolldangling from their work bag?Langin-Hooper argues miniature objects are “a powerful tool for the subtle dissemination of social ideas and values”. In times of social upheaval they “offer the possibility of change – and the option of literally crushing that change, should it offend. What might be threatening to think about in the real-scale world can be more manageable and more conceivable in miniature.”Perhaps it’s not always that deep. When it comes to accessories, cuteness is a key factor of consumption. Fans of the Hydro Mini regularly refer to it as “my baby”, while plushie charms are stroked and fondled. As Catterall says: “Cuteness certainly makes us consume more. It’s kind of what makes it tick. It needs us to want it.”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterPharrell WilliamsLouis VuittonHandbagsAccessoriesnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The farm has some lovely showers and toilets, and nothing else apart from beautiful fields full of meadow grass. The swifts and swallows dart along the top of the grass to eat bugs at dawn and dusk. All day long you can hear beautiful birdsong from birds such as skylarks. The fields run alongside the beautiful coastal path, which has a hedgerow full of wildflowers and birds. This is the most beautiful place on Earth (when it isn’t raining). The numerous beaches are full of soft white sands. Our children have grown up playing free in the fields on their yearly holiday – no computers, just outdoor fun.EmHiking a Highlands mountainView image in fullscreenThe view near the summit of Lochnagar, a Munro in Aberdeenshire.Photograph: Scott Sim/AlamyFor a true taste of the Scottish Highlands, head to Ballater and hike the 1,155-metre (3,789 ft) peak of Lochnagar in the Grampians. The trail winds through pine forests and open moorland, the air crisp and alive. Be ready for the weather to change like pages in a book: sunshine, sudden rain, a flurry of snow on the summit, then blue skies again. On the way down, slip into the river, its water sharp as ice. Pack layers, bring snacks and take your time. It’s a walk that stays with you long after you leave the mountain behind.EvaWalking the Cotswold Way – inspired by Laurie LeeView image in fullscreenA view from the Cotswold Way at Crickley Hill country park, Gloucestershire.Photograph: Cotswolds Photo Library/AlamyAfter a family reading of Laurie Lee’sAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, my husband and I decided our two teens were ready to try a walking holiday in the Cotswolds. We set out with backpacks and a tent on theCotswold Way, starting just outside lively Chipping Campden and ending in Bath. Mobiles were limited to an hour a day in the evening and we did 10 miles a day – covering the walk in 10 days. We felt we were a part of a community of walkers as fellow hikers greeted us in passing, sharing drinks and tips with us along the way. We also learned about the Japanese idea ofshinrin-yoku– feeling free in nature under the canopy of trees, sky and stars – from a family from Tokyo. We returned fitter, more together and happier than when we set out.AnnProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

In fact I only needed some minor encouragement from the vampire; the area itself was my ally. The forests, flanked by brooding mountains, were exciting to hike through anyway (with the help of a local guide), with the presence of brown bears, wolves and lynx adding to the thrills as we marched along. We came across medieval towns and villages that are rich in traditional folklore. One highlight was sampling local cheese and singing songs with villagers in the Bârza valley. The boys were rewarded with a ride on a horse-drawn cart to the next village, near Dracula’s alleged abode – Bran Castle. Don’t miss the stiff climb up to Postăvarul peak (1,799 metres) for great views over the area.JoeWhere Austria’s hills are aliveView image in fullscreenBathers enjoy the jetty at Wolfgangsee, Salzburg.Photograph: Volkerpreusser/AlamySalzkammergut is the Austrian lake district. Lush meadows, forests and blue-green lakes make for endless days of swimming, biking and lying in the sun. No wonder that The Sound of Music was filmed here. Wolfgangsee has well-marked bike trails and opportunities to swim, alongside cafes serving deliciouskaiserschmarrn(fluffy pancakes) and schnitzel. The nearby Fuschlsee has an incredible water park right by the lake: swimming pools, slides and plenty of quiet water in which to swim. It’s excellent entertainment for the entire family. We stayed in the newly renovated Feichtingerbauer, which offers complimentary access to theFuschlseebad.NehaPaddleboarding in County DerryView image in fullscreenThe River Roe near Swanns Bridge, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Robert Morris/AlamyBy the end of the summer in 2021 we were at the end of our tether due to lockdowns and the lack of socialising opportunities. The kids had never been so quiet. My good friend Bob insisted we join his family at Swanns Bridge in County Derry for a paddleboard trip. Swanns Bridge is only a few minutes’ drive from the Atlantic beaches of Benone, but it makes use of the River Roe, rather than the ocean. After 20 minutes of trying to stay upright, something happened. For the first time in over a year we were distracted by something positive and by the beauty of the Roe. The only sound was water (mostly me falling in) and laughter. We’ve gone back since to be distracted for different reasons. It still works.Kieranskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Be it a weekend in the Peak District or Monday to Friday in the Lake District, it doesn’t have to cost a lot. You can pitch a tent in a campsite or get cheap accommodation in a youth hostel. My kids love scrambling up the hills, paddling in the streams that flow down them, spotting the ground-nesting birds, and tucking into the snacks that come with hiking. It teaches them so much about nature and personal safety, as well as about how quickly the weather can change in such places.RebeccaSearching for buried treasure on Ynys Môn (Anglesey)View image in fullscreenThe dunes at Newborough beach, North Wales, are the perfect location for a treasure hunt.Photograph: Shoults/AlamyOur best back-to-nature day out? A spontaneous treasure hunt through the dunes of Newborough beach on Ynys Môn (Anglesey). There’s no admission fee needed – just a hand-drawn pirate map, a flask of lemonade and plenty of imagination. The kids darted between marram grass and shoreline, hunting for shells and “buried treasure” (a biscuit tin full of sweets we’d hidden earlier). With views of Llanddwyn Island and a picnic under the pines, it was low-stress, big-memory magic. Just bring snacks, suncream and a good sense of adventure!Robert SerebriakoffCar-free and carefree on the Isle of ArranView image in fullscreenArran is an easy ferry ride away from mainland Scotland.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyWe had a lovely summer holiday staying on a farm on the Isle of Arran. It’s the perfect car-free holiday for families, with a very easy train ride from Glasgow to the harbour [at the mainland ferry port of Ardrossan]. We stayed on the organic farm, picking our own fruit and veg then cooking it on our camping stove on the beach. The accommodation is right on the beach and on our first morning we stepped out and saw an enormous pod of dolphins. Our days were spent walking up and down the beach playing in rock pools. Absolute heaven! The owner of the farm, who used to work in a Michelin-starred restaurant, cooks fresh lobster and seafood most nights. You can watch him and his daughter going out on their kayak to make their daily catch.GemmaRockpooling in East SussexView image in fullscreenThe Seven Sisters make a beautiful backdrop to walking, biking and crab-hunting.Photograph: Liliya Sayfeeva/AlamyOne of our favourite trips out in nature is to the beach at Seven Sisters, East Sussex. The walk to get there is lovely – it’s flat and a good size for our boys to ride their bikes along. It’s beautiful, with the cliffs and rivers winding along, and there’s even a little empty building to look inside, which is very exciting for small children. When at the beach, there is so much to do, including wading across the part where the river joins the sea with a pretty decent current; rock pooling in crystal-clear waters; and, on a good day, there’s the sludgy sand to get filthy in! Bonus fun is had by watching walkers wade across the river to get to the cliffs, teetering on the painful rocks, as they don’t want to get their walking shoes wet; or by finding crabs in the rock pools; and seeing little islands made as the tide goes in and out. It’s extra fun if you win the competition to find the most interesting stone or find some treasured sea glass. Chalk is fun too, but common enough not to count as an entry into the competition.LaurenView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysReaders' travel tipsUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysBeach holidaysCamping holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Add to that, many of the major suppliers of oil and gas – the Gulf petrostates for instance, plus Russia, Venezuela and a few others – are likewise authoritarian.Their outsize impact puts autocratic nations in the spotlight when it comes to global climate talks. How their governments decide to act will be crucial to the planet’s future. But while democracies are subject to the whims of electorates, which can often be unpredictable, autocratic nations tend to be far more inscrutable.Take the small handful of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, referred to as the “carbon majors”. They hold our future in their hands, and of the top 20 with the biggest carbon output globally, 16 are state-owned and were responsible for52% of global emissionsin 2023.But these companies are generally accountable only to the governments that own them. The great majority – including Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, China’s CHNEnergyand Jinneng Holding Group and the National Iranian Oil Company – are owned by autocracies or authoritarian governments. Among the top five biggest emitters, only Coal India belongs to a democracy.chartDoes this matter? For many years, climate diplomats took the pragmatic view that it did not. “When we were negotiating, I was not really thinking about where these governments came on the scale of democracy,” said Todd Stern, the US chief negotiator under Barack Obama, who helped craft the Paris agreement.But now the question has assumed a new significance. The power over the planet wielded by asmall number of autocratic statesis greater than ever. Their actions could effectively determine whether the world succeeds in limiting global heating to less than catastrophic levels.“The carbon majors [of all kinds] are keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels, with no plans to slow production, said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who presided over the 2015 Paris summit. “While states drag their heels on their Paris agreement commitments, state-owned companies are dominating global emissions – ignoring the desperate needs of their citizens.”Their position needs to shift. But how on earth can that be done? The chief executive of this year’s climate summit in Brazil, Ana Toni, said: “Climate is a topic that we can only solve in a multilateral way. And in that multilateral way, we have democracies and we have countries that have different political systems. We need to bring all of them along.”In the past, countries such as Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia – the world’s fourth, seventh and 10th biggest emitters respectively – kept a low profile, and other countries tended to allow them to do so in the hope of preventing them from disrupting an already fragile process. Recently, however, some of those countries have begun to take a more active role in blocking the negotiations.Russia is the source of vast quantities of online disinformation about the climate crisis, and Saudi Arabia has sought to derail and water down commitments at UN climate summits,including altering a key text last year.“They, and other petrostates, have gotten away with their morbid resource dependence, which is terribly harmful for the planet,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser.So can autocracies be persuaded to take action on climate change, and if so how? There is room for optimism, experts point out. Being state-owned, or operating within an authoritarian country or under a populist leader, does not prevent companies with high emissions from environmental progressiveness, according to Francis Fukuyama, a scholar of political systems and author of The End of History, a seminal work on democracy.Authoritarian states hold all the levers of power and can simply order their companies to shift to low-carbon technology. “If an authoritarian state wants to move on climate policy, whether for mitigation [cutting emissions] or adaptation, it can do so more easily because it does not face the kinds of entrenched interest groups that democracies deal with,” he said.China is a good example. Now the world’sbiggest producer of renewable energy, the country has registered record exports of electric vehicles, solar panels and other components of low-carbon technology. The director general of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, credits the far-sightedness of China’s leadership for the transformation. “You can have a situation in which an autocracy decides that this is the right thing to do because it’s existential, and I think China decided to do that,” she said. “I don’t believe that the nature of that autocracy necessarily stands in the way of being a responsible climate citizen. And I don’t think that we should be too proud that democracies are doing everything right.”View image in fullscreenElectric vehicles for export at a port in Hangzhou in eastern China’s Zhejiang province.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesBut the problem is that even the supposed advantages autocracies possess, in the form of command over the economy, can prove illusory on examination. Much research has been done on whether autocracies or democracies are more likely to take action on climate change and the results are unclear, according to Ross Mittiga, an associate professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London and author of arecent bookon the subject. “There is no strong evidence that democracies are better or worse equipped to address the climate crisis than non-democratic regimes,” he said. “Of the top emitters, some are democratic, others are not, but all are failing to do the minimum needed to avert catastrophe.”What are the issues that might deter autocracies from taking action? Internally, the lack of pressure from below is a major problem, and arguably – along with transparency – the biggest difference with democracies. Popular protest has been one of the main means by which environmental action has been achieved in the past. The economist Nicholas Stern points, for example, to thefirst Earth Day demonstrations in the US, on 22 April 1970, in which more than 20 million people are estimated to have taken part. Within a few years, the US had a Clean Air Act, a Clean Water Act and an Environmental Protection Agency – all brought in by the Republican president Richard Nixon, and maddeningly all nowgutted by the Republican president Donald Trump.Thomas Piketty, the French economist and author of several critiques of capitalism, wants to take this further. “We definitely need social protest and popular pressure to deliver climate action,” he said. “But formal democracy is not enough: we need equal voice, effective democratic participation, mass mobilisation and powerful collective organisations to curb money interests and to promote ambitious platforms of institutional transformation. This is how we were able to achieve substantial progress in social, economic and political equality in the past two centuries.”View image in fullscreenA student takes part in Earth Day protests in New York in April 1970.Photograph: APProtesting to urge climate action in countries where democracy is under threat is at best perilous, and can be fatal. In Georgia, where a fledgling democracy has taken a turn towards ultra-conservatism under Russia’s influence, Nugzar Kokhreidze, the co-founder of the Dialogue of Generations group describes the reality of activism: “Some have already left the country. Others keep fighting, but without funding and under constant fear of arrest or repression. This severely limits the space for activism and narrows the possibilities for action.”In many of these countries, fossil fuels represent a super-powered economic interest. In Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, they literally fuel the entire economy, and the erasure of protest means there is no counterbalance. “In autocracies that are deeply committed to fossil fuel development as part of their economic models, there is no real internal resistance to that,” said Mittiga.Bledsoe points to Russia, where leaks from oil and gas production are some of the worst in the world, and the government has refused to take any action to reduce themeven though it could be profitable to do so. “They haveinsanely high fugitive methane emissionsfrom their hydrocarbon production, and they have very little incentive to prevent it,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Shiran Victoria Shen, a senior research scholar at Stanford University, says, for example, that autocracies may plan to put positive environmental strategies in place, but “they often struggle with implementation due to information asymmetries – leaders may not always receive accurate reports from local enforcers and often lack alternative channels to verify information, making it harder to ensure compliance”.What about pressure from outside? Transparency, or the lack of it, is perhaps the most important issue. In 2016, for example, just after the Paris agreement had been signed,analysts said China’s emissions may have peaked, but it was a false hope. Despite forecasts of a plunge in coal use, China’s leadership took a decisive but covert turn back towards fossil fuels. The government hadappeared ready to cancel coal contracts, butsatellite images revealed coal-fired power stations being built. The country’s coal sector roared back to life, and in every year since, apart from a slight decrease in 2022,emissions have increased.chartWith an autocracy, there is no way of knowing quite how or why a decision has been made or whether it will be made again. China has pledged to produce a new national plan on emissions before the Cop30 UN climate summit in November. That single document will do more than any other political decision this year to determine whether the world canhold global heating to safe limits.But the country’s officials are under strict orders to be tight-lipped about its contents. “The plan is all in Xi Jinping’s head at the moment,” one veteran observer of Cops said. “We are finding that no one [in government] will talk about it.”China could double down on itshuge investment in renewables, or Xi could listen to the strong vested interests of the coal sector, deeply embedded in China’s economy and polity. “I would not rule out a return to coal,” said Li Shuo, the director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.Unlike companies quoted on stock exchanges, state-owned entities and some other forms of company headquartered in authoritarian states face few requirements to disclose their finances or activities. Saudi Arabia scaled back plans for a partial flotation of Aramco, partly to limit such disclosure. “In well-regulated democracies, you ought to be able to find out who [whether companies or branches of government] is doing what and where,” said Bledsoe. “That’s not the case with authoritarian states.”View image in fullscreenAn oil refinery in Saudi Arabia.Photograph: AlamyExternal pressure could be brought to bear by economic means. The EU, the UK and other developed countries have, for example,put forward carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), under which imported high-carbon goods such as steel would face stiff tariffs.But there are problems with this approach too. Many smaller developing countries are furious, fearing they will be penalised as well. Work has begun on the reporting stage of the EU’s CBAM, but it has not yet entered full operation.Before reaching for such a drastic tool – particularly in a world reeling from the impacts of Trump’s on-off-on tariffs – countries tend to try a more traditional approach. Before the 2015 Paris summit, France pioneered “360 degree diplomacy” – using every embassy, consulate and cultural institution in every country around the world as a channel to talk about climate. Brazil, as host of Cop30, is taking a similarly cooperative tack,appointing 30 special envoysfrom around the world to help with its mission.Sometimes the personal touch can win out against the apparent odds. John Kerry, a US climate envoy under Joe Biden, enjoyed such a warm rapport over many years with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, that beforeretiring within days of each other, the two men gave a last joint press conference at Cop28 in 2023, in which they shared anecdotes about the attendance of Xie’s young grandson at Kerry’s 80th birthday party. Their successors,Liu Zhenmin and John Podesta, tried to recreate some of that warmth a few months later at a cosy meal in the latter’s Washington home. Democracy being what it is, however, Podesta was ousted when Trump took over, and future US-China climate dinners are now unlikely.View image in fullscreenJohn Kerry with Xie Zhenhua in Beijing in July 2023.Photograph: Valerie Volcovici/ReutersThe fact is that many democracies are not faring much better. The US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement and the White House is dismantling domestic environmental regulations. Canada and Australia have both elected centrist leaders this year in free and fair elections. They gave pledged allegiance to the climate cause, but are actively pursuing fossil fuel expansion. Japan, the UK and the EU are are also still hooked on fossil fuels despite fine words and targets. The UK, where Labour was elected pledging to end new North Sea oil and gas licences, is considering giving the go-ahead to thevast Rosebank oilfieldon the technicality that it was already within the planning system.“Democracies are more hypocritical,” said Jayati Ghosh, an Indian development economist and professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts. “The problem with democracies is that capital can exert much more pressure than any other stakeholder.”Vera Songwe, a Cameroonian economist and executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, says governments can find ways of working together with a common motive. “We must try to meet countries where they are. Everyone is looking for growth and we must be able to demonstrate that green growth is possible.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisThe big emittersGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Almost all bore similar injuries: gunshot wounds and bodies shredded by shrapnel from nearby exploding artillery.“There were hundreds of wounded, no less than 200 bodies in the hospital. Many of them shot in the head, as if executed,” said Bahaa, a surgeon speaking of the events of this week in Sweida under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.Videos filmed inside the hospital showed hallways lined with corpses, rooms stacked with body bags and corpses piled up outside. A second doctor from the intensive care unit said bodies had to be placed outside the morgue for lack of space.The casualties, both civilian and military, were some of at least 516 civilians and fighters killed in four days of clashes in the Druze-majority province, according to figures given by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).At least 86 of those killed were field executions of Druze civilians by government fighters or allied militias, as well as three Bedouin civilians killed by Druze fighters, SOHR said.View image in fullscreenSyrian Bedouin fighters seen in Sweida province on Thursday.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersThe fighting, begun by a local dispute between Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters, quickly escalated and prompted Syrian government forces to intervene. Druze fighters resisted their entry into the province and clashes began with Syrian government forces.Residents described four days of terror as fighting quickly took on a sectarian flavour – the violence was the most serious threat to Syria’s stability since March, when 1,500 mostly Alawite civilians were killed after a failed attack on government forces.Syria’s president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has pledged to protect the country’s minorities since the toppling of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in December. He now leads a country riven by sectarian divisions after 14 years of civil war, without the resources to engage in the transitional justice needed to heal it.The president, a former al-Qaida leader turned statesman, has been welcomed on to the international stage but there are deep misgivings about him among Syria’s minorities back home.Map of Sweida and Deraa provincesAs theSyrian military withdrew from the cityon Wednesday, people began to emerge from their houses and take stock of their losses.At least 15 unarmed people were killed at a reception hall belonging to the prominent Radwan family in Sweida city on Tuesday, three members of the family told the Guardian. SOHR also reported the killings, though put the number of dead at 12.“They were sitting there drinking coffee when gunmen came in and just started shooting. There are no weapons allowed in the hall, it’s not like it’s a military base,” said Maan Radwan, a 46-year-old London resident whose relatives were killed in the shooting.Sweida residents blamed government-affiliated forces for the killings but witnesses said it was impossible to distinguish between state security forces and rogue militias. The Guardian could not independently verify who was responsible for the killings.An eyewitness said the attackers were wearing army fatigues but could not tell if they were from government-affiliated forces or a militia. “It’s impossible to tell who is killing us,” a 52-year-old teacher and relative of the Radwan family in Sweida told the Guardian by phone.Video of the aftermath of the shooting showed unarmed men strewn across a room lying in pools of blood. Family members said men in army fatigues prevented ambulances from reaching the reception hall, which they thought was meant to ensure the wounded died from blood loss.Bahaa received the bodies of those killed in the Radwan shooting at the hospital, some of whom he knew personally, and said that their bodies bore close-range gunshot wounds. He would recognise many more of the corpses that would later come through the hospital doors.Conditions in the hospital itself became desperate as fighters besieged the facility. Doctors hid in the hallways as bullets and artillery flew by, and the hospital itself was hit at least once. They began to ration medicine and other basic supplies.“We were trying to limit each wounded person to 2 or 3CCs of Tramadol and we would dilute it so it would last for everyone,” the doctor from the intensive care unit said.Al-Sharaa gave a speech on Thursday condemning the abuses against civilians and said there would be accountability. The Syrian defence ministry also said it was “adhering to rules of engagement to protect residents”.“We are determined to hold accountable anyone who wronged or harmed our Druze brethren. They are under the protection and responsibility of the state, and the law and justice guarantee the rights of all without exception,” the Syrian president said.On their private social media seen by the Guardian, two government forces members posted sectarian hate speech against Druze.One posted a video of him and two other soldiers driving through Sweida laughing as he said: “We are on our way to distribute aid,” while brandishing a machete to the camera. He filmed himself inside a house in Sweida ripping a picture of Druze spiritual leaders off a wall and trampling it with his boots.“If God grants you victory, none can defeat you … On behalf of the tribes, oh Druze and Alawites, we are coming for you with sectarianism,” he continued.Another fighter posted a video of him driving through the town of Sahwa Blata in Sweida province, pausing to gloat over two dead bodies on the sidewalk as he filmed.“These are your dogs, al-Hijri. Anyone who stands against the state this is what will happen to them,” he said, referring to the most staunchly anti-government of the three Druze spiritual leaders, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri.Yousef* recognised the two men in the video as his cousin and his cousin’s son. He had no idea prior that they were dead.“They called me at 7am that morning and most of the people had fled the village. They didn’t know what to do, and they didn’t have any guns at all,” said Yousef, a 25-year-old civil engineer in Sweida.View image in fullscreenArab Bedouins rest in the open with their belongings on 17 July near the town of Busra al-Harir in the countryside of the Daraa governorate after fleeing Sweida.Photograph: Ahmad Fallaha/EPADespite the ceasefire on Wednesday, intermittent violence seemed to continue. Rumours of another Bedouin attack on Sweida prompted a mass exodus of residents on Thursday. Yousef sent a video of him interviewing people as they fled. One had two body bags in the bed of his pickup truck. Unzipping the one of the body bags, Yousef showed the camera the body of a woman, her throat slit.The cycle of tit-for-tat violence which carried sectarian overtones threatens the unity of the new Syrian state, which authorities in Damascus were desperately trying to hold together. Mistrust between the Druze and the new authorities, and vice versa, has fallen to an all time low.Syrian state media reported on Thursday that there were now attacks on the small Bedouin communities in Sweida, prompting further displacement and what it called massacres by “outlaw groups”.Social media was flooded by another round of images of dead civilians, this time, they claimed, it was the Druze attacking the Bedouins. The Guardian could not independently verify the veracity of those videos.“So many of those killed were anti-Assad from the beginning. All of these killings after 14 years of war. What’s the point?” said Bahaa.(Names with an asterisk have been changed)Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Commissioners were chasing a $1m slice of federal funding made newly available to the state after a succession of flood disasters, includingHurricane Harveyin August 2017.Now-retired commissioner Tom Moser brought bad news, noting “about eight different counties” were selected, but “they didn’t select us,” according to minutes of the meeting stillviewable online.Tom Pollard, the county judge at the time, was incredulous.“They prioritized us lower?” he asked, the county’s many low-lying and therefore vulnerable youth summer camps immediately adjacent to the Guadalupe uppermost in his mind.“They did,” Moser replied solemnly.Without that funding from the state, the project foundered. No widespread gauge system was ever set up that would have given early warning of a life-threatening torrent of water further up the river; no sirens ever installed that would have warned Camp Mystic residents that their lives were in peril and they needed to get out immediately.The investigation will look at other missteps and lost opportunities along the way that might have brought a different outcome at the 99-year-old Christian-themed, all-girls camp that served as ajoyous rite of passagefor generations of young Texans.View image in fullscreenChairs lie inside a damaged room following flooding on the Guadalupe river, in Camp Mystic on 7 July.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersView image in fullscreenA view inside of a cabin at Camp Mystic on 5 July.Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty ImagesProminent among them will be this week’s revelation that the camp owner and director Dick Eastland, who lost his own life trying to ferry a group of his youngest campers to safety as the river rose towards a peak height of 37.5ft,waited more than an hour to issue an evacuation orderafter receiving a severe flood warning on his phone at 1.14am on 4 July.Yet it is to the eternal regret of Moser, a former senior Nasa engineer who had studied flood monitoring and alert systems installed inother nearby counties, that money was never found or spent, either then or later, to replace or upgrade a broken mechanism born from a near-identical tragedy for the sole purpose of saving lives in the future.“Not having the funds to accomplish it was not very satisfying to me but we tried,” Mosertold NPR. “That’s all we could do. We didn’t have the resources in the county operating budget to do that.”Moser, who did not return a message from the Guardian seeking further comment, had advocated for sirens, a proposal dropped from the state grant application when it became clear some residents and commissioners opposed them.“If sirens were there, clearly people would have known about it. Would it have saved everybody? I don’t think so. This was an event that’s probably one chance in a million,” he told the radio network.At Camp Mystic, like elsewhere in the county, residents were reliant on an outdated and patchwork early warning system of alerts. Some were from the National Weather Service (NWS), which Eastland’s family concedes he did receive. Other messages came from local authorities, some sent onlyafter an inexplicable delay, which others along the Guadalupe’s banks say they did not see in any case.View image in fullscreenBefore and after images showing how Kerrville, Texas, was affected by flooding.Photograph: NearmapInside the camp, with water rising fast, especially around dormitories closest to the river where the youngest campers, mostly aged eight and nine, were sleeping, there was chaos. Many of the teenage counselors left in charge of the dormitories were left to make instant life-or-death decisions on their own, having lost contact with adult supervisors.According to two counselors interviewed in the days following the disaster, campers were not allowed to bring mobile phones, and the counselorswere made to surrender theirs, leaving them cut off from any emergency alerts.Eastland, who had run the camp with his family since the 1980s and was a past director of the Upper Guadalupe River Authority that pressed for the original warning and alert system, was familiar with the danger of flash flooding from heavy rain.View image in fullscreenSearch and rescue workers dig through debris looking for survivors or remains of people swept up in flash flooding on 6 July in Hunt, Texas.Photograph: Jim Vondruska/Getty Images“I’m sure there will be other drownings,” Eastland told the Austin American-Statesman in 1990,reported by CNN. “People don’t heed the warnings.”In aWashington Post reportthat contained harrowing first-hand testimony from girls who were there, parents of some who were rescued from Camp Mystic said it was Eastland and his staff who ignored warnings on the morning of the disaster.Also under scrutiny will be why Eastland made, and was granted, repeated applications to remove dozens of Camp Mystic buildings from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s 100-year flood map, which allowed the camp to operate and expand in a known risk area.A review by the Associated Press found that 15 of at least 30 exempted buildings were at the Camp Mystic Guadalupe site where most, if not all of the campers and counselors lost their lives.Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, a climate risk assessment and modelling company, said the dormitories were in a known flood zone, which records show had been swamped numerous times in the camp’s near century of existence.“People that ran the camp had the ability to understand that the risk was close by, the risk was in the area, and maybe adapt the buildings. And there was no action there,” he said.“In fact there were letters of map amendments that were submitted instead.”But Porter said it was hard to place blame on any single person or entity: “A lot of that is just our overall risk psyche and understanding of what risk looks like, our expectation that these really rare events aren’t going to affect us and they’re not going to be as bad as we think they’re going to be.“The way we treat climate risk and flood risk in the country is really that, you know, if it happens, it’ll be something we’ll be able to rebuild, recover, and then it won’t happen again for 100 years.”The Guardian was unable to reach anybody at Camp Mystic for comment.Donna Gable Hatch, a writer and former staff editor at the Kerrville Daily Times, said she believed lives would have been saved at Camp Mystic with an early warning system, but city and county officials were not responsible for its absence.“If the funds had been made available in a timely and adequate manner, this catastrophe might have unfolded differently. But too often, those at the helm of small towns must wait for permission, wait for funding, wait for bureaucracy to catch up to reality,” she wrote ina guest editorialfor her former employer.“To accuse local leaders of negligence is to completely misunderstand who they are and what this place means. In Kerr county, heartbreak isn’t abstract. It has a name. A face. It’s a neighbor, a classmate, a church member or a childhood friend.View image in fullscreenSalvaged photographs of the Rich family are displayed on a table in their home after it flooded on 6 July in Center Point, Texas.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty Images“The truth will come out.

It shows that the police are either completely ignorant of the law or – more likely – that they are using the proscription of a peaceful, non-violent direct action group, Palestine Action, to try to criminalise the movement as a whole.What an indictment of our policing, and indeed this Labour government, that peaceful campaigning against a genocide in Gaza is now treated as a crime on a par with terrorist activity.On Saturday, tens of thousands will once again take to the streets of London in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Like all previous ones, the demonstration will be diverse, massive and peaceful. We refute any idea that protesting over Palestine is a crime. It is our right in a democracy and one that should be respected. Our civil liberties are under attack through arrests, bans and proscriptions, and that cannot be allowed to happen.Lindsey GermanConvener, Stop the War CoalitionExplore more on these topicsProtestIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesActivismPoliceStop the War coalitionUK security and counter-terrorismlettersShareReuse this content"

The example is inauspicious.While at the Met, the Leonardo was stored in a strongroom overnight. One night, a fire sprinkler malfunctioned and sprayed water over the picture for hours. Fortunately, it was face up and therefore the paint layers were protected by the glass cover. Had it been face down, its panel would have been saturated and warped, with horrendous consequences. The incident was covered up – and was only disclosed (unofficially) three decades later by the ex-Met director Thomas Hoving in hismemoir.Michael DaleyDirector, ArtWatch UKLast year, you published an item about Mia Hansson and the replica of the Bayeux tapestry she was making (Experience, 26 April 2024). I wonder if she has finished it yet?Tony MeacockNorwichI nearly covered myself in my breakfast porridge when I read that the Labour MP Helena Dollimore wants the Bayeux tapestry to be carted around the country like a collection of rolled-up sheets (Call for British Museum to take Bayeux tapestry to ‘1066 country’, 14 July). This is an ancient collection of threads that has survived for so much longer than most items of fabric and it must be treated with care, gentleness and caution. I have misgivings about it leaving its current home for even five minutes, but if the experts think it can travel across the Channel for one visit, then so be it. But one visit it must be, not a travelling circus.The visit is an opportunity to learn about the events leading up to the battle and perhaps to stop acting as though this country sprang into being in 1066, when it does in fact have a long and fascinating history that connects us to the countries of northern Europe.

In terms of the kind of “excitement” that is the hallmark of T20 and the ghastly Hundred (explosive batting, athletic fielding), the day was somewhat lacking. At times, play was slow, almost becalmed. However, at the end of the day she pronounced that it had been one of her favourite sporting occasions, and despite leaving England the next day, she practically begged me to consider taking her again as a guest next year.It turns out that generalising about a country or its people isn’t quite the slam dunk (to borrow a phrase from one of her favourite sports) that your editorial seems to think it is.Edward CollierCheltenham, GloucestershireI have an American wife and we live in Newport, Oregon. (As a too-early aside, one of the few places much rainier than the Rossendale Valley from where I hark.) Your opening sentence summed it up. My wife has become a fan of cricket and understands the rules better than I – to the point of knowing that it’s a five-point penalty if a ball hits a helmet laid on the ground. Nevertheless she could not understand the fascination of the last couple of sessions at Lord’s and departed to the kitchen where she was making baguettes, her comment being that watching yeast rise is more exciting (not that the yeast itself rises).By contrast, I was enthralled and on the point of tears when it was over, watching Mohammed Siraj being consoled. This was one for Wisden.David FarrellyNewport, OregonAndy Bull (Never mind Bazball, this was Bazbrawl: say goodbye to happy-go-lucky England, 14 July) rehearses rules at Lord’s, including that “you do need a tailored jacket, tie or cravat to get into the pavilion”. Strange, I’ve been admitted to the pavilion on several occasions with none of those items. Each time I was wearing a dress.Liz FullerLondonMethinks Barney Ronay’s reporting also comes from a “place of love, passion and cinematic personal obsession”.

The contraceptives are primarily long-acting, such as IUDs and birth controlimplants, and were almost certainly intended for women inAfrica, according to two senior congressional aides, one of whom visited a warehouse in Belgium that housed the contraceptives. It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.“It is unacceptable that the State Department would move forward with the destruction of more than $9m in taxpayer-funded family planning commodities purchased to support women in crisis settings, including war zones and refugee camps,” Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, said in a statement. Shaheen and Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii, have introduced legislation to stop the destruction.“This is a waste of US taxpayer dollars and an abdication of US global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths,” added Shaheen, who in June sent a letter to the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, about the matter.‘Profound alarm’: US veterans agency roiled by fight over anti-discrimination provisionsRead moreThe department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that prohibit sending US aid to organizations that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas, according to the state department spokesperson.Most of the contraceptives have less than 70% of their shelf life left before they expire, the spokesperson said, and rebranding and selling the contraceptives could cost several million dollars. However, the aide who visited the warehouse said that the earliest expiration date they saw on the contraceptives was 2027, and that two-thirds of the contraceptives did not have anyUSAIDlabels that would need to be rebranded.The eradication of the contraceptives is part of the Trump administration’smonths-longdemolitionof the Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for humanitarian and development aid in the world. After the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge)erased 83%of USAID’s programs, Rubioannouncedin June that USAID’s entire international workforce would be abolished and its foreign assistance programs would be moved to the state department. The agency will bereplaced by an organizationcalled America First.In total, the funding cuts to USAIDcould lead to more than 14m additional deaths by 2030, according to a recentstudypublished in the journal the Lancet. A third of those deaths could be children.“If you have an unintended pregnancy and you end up having to seek unsafe abortion, it’s quite likely that you will die,” said Sarah Shaw, the associate director of advocacy at MSI Reproductive Choices, a global family planning organization that works in nearly 40 countries. “If you’re not given the means to space or limit your births, you’re putting your life at risk or your child’s life at risk.”The fact that the contraceptives are going to be burned when there’s so much need – it’s just egregiousSarah Shaw, MSI Reproductive ChoicesMSI tried to purchase the contraceptives from the US government, Shaw said. But the government would only accept full price – which Shaw said the agency could not afford, given that MSI would alsohave to shoulder the expense oftransportingthe contraceptives and the fact that they are inching closer to their expiration date, which could affect MSI’s ability to distribute them.The state department spokesperson did not specifically respond to a request for comment on Shaw’s allegation, but MSI does provide abortions as part of its global work, which may have led the department to rule it out as an “eligible buyer”.In an internal survey, MSI programs in 10 countriesreported that, within the next month, they expect to be out of stock or be on the brink of being out of stock of at least one contraceptive method. The countries include Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Senegal, Kenya and Sierra Leone.Shaw expects the stock to be incinerated. “The fact that the contraceptives are going to be burned when there’s so much need – it’s just egregious,” she said. “It’s disgusting.” The Department of State spokespersondid not respond to a request for information on the planned method of destruction.The destruction of the contraceptives is, to Shaw, emblematic of the overall destruction of a system that once provided worldwide help to women and families. USAID funding is threaded through so much of the global supply chain of family planning aid that, without its money, the chain has come apart. In Mali, Shaw said, USAID helped pay for the gas used by the vehicles that transport contraceptives from a warehouse. Without the gas money, the vehicles were stuck – and so were the contraceptives.New York county clerk rejects Texas’s effort to fine doctor in abortion pill caseRead more“I’ve worked in this sector for over 20 years and I’ve never seen anything on this scale,” Shaw said. “The speed at which they’ve managed to dismantle excellent work and really great progress – I mean, it’s just vanished in weeks.”Other kinds of assistance are also reportedly being wasted. This week,the Atlantic reportedthat almost 500 metric tons of emergency food were expiring and would be incinerated, rather than being used to feed about 1.5 million children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Meanwhile, almost 800,000 Mpox vaccines that were supposed to be sent to Africa are now unusable because they are too close to their expiration date,according to Politico.The cuts to foreign aid are slated to deepen. Early on Friday morning, Congresspassed a billto claw back roughly $8bn that had been earmarked for foreign assistance.“It’s not just about an empty shelf,” Shaw said. “It’s about unfulfilled potential. It’s about a girl having to drop out of school. It’s about someone having to seek an unsafe abortion and risking their lives. That’s what it’s really about.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationContraception and family planningHealthWomenUSAIDUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The arrangement drew immediate blowback when Trump invoked an 18th-century wartime law to quickly remove men his administration had accused of belonging to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang.The Venezuelans have been held in a mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or Cecot, which was built to hold alleged gang members in Bukele’s war on the country’s gangs. Human rights groups have documented hundreds of deaths and cases of torture inside its walls.Venezuelans deported by Trump are victims of ‘torture’, lawyers allegeRead moreThe release of the Venezuelans is an invaluable win for Maduro as he presses his efforts to assert himself as president despite credible evidence that he lost re-election last year. Long on the receiving end of accusations of human rights abuses, Maduro for months used the men’s detention in El Salvador to flip the script on the US government, forcing even some of his strongest political opponents to agree with his condemnation of the migrants’ treatment.The migrants’ return will allow Maduro to reaffirm support within his shrinking base, while it demonstrates that even if the Trump administration and other countries see him as an illegitimate president, he is still firmly in power.Venezuelan authorities detained nearly a dozen US citizens in the second half of 2024 and linked them to alleged plots to destabilize the country. They were among the dozens of people, including activists, opposition members and union leaders, that Venezuela’s government took into custody in its brutal campaign to crack down on dissent in the 11 months since Maduro claimed to win re-election.The US government, along with several other western countries, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won the July 2024 election by a more than a two-to-one margin.The dispute over results prompted immediate protests, and the government responded by detaining more than 2,000 people, mostly poor young men. González fled into exile in Spain to avoid arrest.Despite the US not recognizing Maduro, the two governments have carried out other recent exchanges.In May, Venezuela freed a US air force veteran after about six months in detention. Scott St Clair’s family has said the language specialist, who served four tours in Afghanistan, had traveled to South America to seek treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.St Clair was handed over to Richard Grenell, Trump’s envoy for special missions, during a meeting on a Caribbean island.Three months earlier, six other Americans whom the US government considered wrongfully detained in Venezuela were released after Grenell met with Maduro at the presidential palace.Grenell, during the meeting in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, urged Maduro to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the US. Hundreds of Venezuelans have since been deported to their home country, but more than 200 deported from the US have been held since mid-March at the prison in El Salvador.Lawyers have little access to those in the prison, which is heavily guarded, and information has been locked tight, other than heavily produced state propaganda videos showing tattooed men packed behind bars.As a result, prominent human rights groups and lawyers working with the Venezuelans on legal cases had little information of their movement until they boarded the plane.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasEl SalvadornewsShareReuse this content"

Last year it recorded 624 homicides, making it one of the most violent countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In May this year,local media reporteda 33% decrease compared with the same period in 2024 and 2023.But the country’s attorney general, John Jeremie, said on Friday there had been a resurgence of gang-related homicides and kidnappings. Responding to a question about the length of the state of emergency he said it would be for “as long as the security forces tell us that they need the additional legislative support”.The terms of the current state of emergency mirror those of one announced in December 2024 andextended for three monthsin January this year. There is no curfew in place, and citizens are free to move about. However, law enforcement officers now have enhanced powers, including the ability to enter premises without a warrant.The former Trinidad and Tobago police commissioner Gary Griffith called the declaration “ridiculous” and said the issue could have been resolved with better prison management.“There was a situation where there was a major criminal element in the Port of Spain prison, and three times in 24 hours, we seized a phone from that individual. As soon as we seized the phone, he got another one – because of prison officers on the take,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In February last year,Bolsonaro spent two nightsinside the Hungarian embassy in the capital, Brasília, after federal police seized his passport.Fears that Bolsonaro may flee abroad have intensified in recent days after Donald Trump announced he wouldimpose 50% tariffs on Brazilas a result of what he called the “witch-hunt” against his rightwing ally. On Thursday, the US president published a letter to Bolsonaro on social media in which he denounced the “terrible treatment” he claimed his ally was receiving from the Brazilian government.Hours after the White House’s two-paragraph note of support, heavily armed federal police agents arrived outside Bolsonaro’s home in a palm-lined upmarket corner of the capital called Botanical Garden.Police confirmed the operation in a brief statement that said two search warrants had been executed and “preventative measures” imposed.View image in fullscreenJair Bolsonaro leaves the secretariat of penitentiary administration in Brasilia on Friday, where he arrived after the order to fit him with an electronic ankle tag.Photograph: Luis Nova/APThe statement made no mention of what those restrictions were, but local media reports said they included obliging Bolsonaro to wear a monitoring tag on his ankle, ordering him to remain at home between 7pm and 7am and on weekends, and forbidding him from speaking to foreign ambassadors or diplomats or visiting diplomatic compounds.Bolsonaro was also banned from using social media, where he has millions of followers.Bolsonaro denies coup plot but admits discussing ‘alternative ways’ to remain presidentRead moreThe television network TV Globo claimed police had found $14,000 (£10,400) in cash during their search of Bolsonaro’s two-storey villa. A USB flash drive that had allegedly been “hidden in the bathroom” was also reportedly seized.Federal police are investigating what role, if any, Bolsonaro had in convincing Trump to hitBrazilwith 50% tariffs in an apparent attempt to pressure Brazilian authorities into dropping the charges against Bolsonaro or pardoning him. His congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, travelled to the US in February and has reportedly spent recent weeks lobbying Trump administration officials to impose sanctions on Alexandre de Moraes, the high-profile supreme court judge presiding over the investigation into his father. Eduardo Bolsonaro celebrated Trump’s tariffs last week, tweeting: “THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP – MAKE BRAZIL FREE AGAIN.”But if Trump’s politically motivated trade war was designed to help the Bolsonaros, it appears to have backfired.Brazil’s president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva– whom Bolsonaro allegedly conspired against to stop him taking office – has enjoyed a bounce in the polls, which analysts have attributed to his handling of the crisis. On Thursday night, Lula gave a televised address to the nation in which he attacked Trump’s “unacceptable blackmail” and painted the politicians who supported it as “traitors to the nation”. “Trying to meddle in the Brazilian judicial system represents a serious attack on national sovereignty,” Lula said.Speaking to reporters after the raid on his home, Bolsonaro denied leading a conspiracy to prevent Lula taking power by staging a military coup. The ex-president also denied he was considering fleeing abroad. “I have never thought about leaving Brazil. I have never thought about going into a [foreign] embassy,” Bolsonaro said, although he admitted he had been planning to lunch with a group of ambassadors next week. “I won’t go any more,” he said, describing the police operation as “supreme humiliation”.In a statement, Bolsonaro’s lawyer, Celso Vilardi, voiced “surprise and anger” over the “severe” restrictions imposed upon his client.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We will not have a strong perspective about why protecting nature is so essential for our economic prosperity.”Henry this week drew a direct link between nature and the economy, casting a long-awaited fix tofederal environment protection lawsas the “most important” reform the Albanese government could pursue to lift stagnant productivity growth.Stasak said there would be a “lot of pressure” on Henry and independent MP Allegra Spender, another nature advocate invited, to use their presence at the forum to speak up for environmentalists.Guardian Australia understands Henry secured an invitation to the summit because of hisexpertise in tax reform, as well as his environmental advocacy.On Friday, Chalmers announced another 13 invitees to the three-day event in Canberra, including Henry, Spender and Wyatt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When she saw people trying to revive the occupant, she quickly led her two children away.Porto Sant’Elpidio’s mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said reports suggested Baumgartner could have suffered a sudden medical issue mid-air, and offered the town’s condolences over the death of “a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flights”.The Clube del Sole Le Mimose beachside resort where the crash occurred said in a statement that an employee who was “slightly injured” in the incident was in good condition. No guests were injured, and the pool has been reopened.View image in fullscreenFelix Baumgartner’s historic jump from the edge of space.Photograph: Red Bull Content Pool/Red Bull Stratos/ReutersBaumgartner, who was known as “Fearless Felix”, made headlines around the world in October 2012 when – wearing a specially made suit – hejumped from a balloon 38km (24 miles) above Earth, becoming the first skydiver to break the sound barrier.He made the historic jump over Roswell, New Mexico, reaching a peak speed of more than 1,343km/h, during a nine-minute descent on the 65th anniversary of the legendary American pilot Chuck Yeager’s flight shattering the sound barrier on 14 October 1947.Baumgartner never seemed to fear having to pay the ultimate price for his passion, stressing that it was all about doing your homework. “I hate it if someone calls me a thrillseeker or an adrenaline junkie because I am not. I like the whole planning,” he said before the 2012 stunt.8:03Felix Baumgartner makes record-breaking skydive from space – videoAt one point, Baumgartner went into a potentially dangerous flat spin while still supersonic, spinning for 13 seconds, his crew later said. “When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble,” he said after landing in the eastern New Mexico desert. “You do not think about of breaking records any more, you do not think of about gaining scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive.”Sporting a “born to fly” tattoo, Baumgartner, a former Austrian military parachutist, made thousands of daredevil jumps from planes, bridges, skyscrapers and landmarks around the world, including the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The self-styled “God of the Skies” started parachuting as a teenager before taking up the extreme sport of base jumping. Other feats included skydiving across the Channel and parachuting off the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Felix Baumgartner completes world’s highest skydive – coverage highlightsRead moreIn recent years, he had performed with the Flying Bulls as a helicopter stunt pilot in shows acrossEurope.In Austria he was also known for courting controversy with views that included expressing support for dictatorship as a system of government. Baumgartner was fined €1,500 (£1,300) after he punched a Greek truck driver in the face during a 2010 altercation that broke out in a traffic jam near Salzburg.Dividing his time between Switzerland and the US, Baumgartner eagerly joined the political fray and rubbed shoulders with Austrian far-right politicians. On social media, he mocked the fight against climate breakdown, actively speaking out against Green parties and LGBTQ+ rights.In 2016, he faced a storm of criticism when suggesting that Hungary’s anti-migration strongman prime minister,Viktor Orbán, should win a Nobel peace prize for protecting his country. Shortly before his death he sparked outrage again with a Facebook post in which he called out theSwiss footballer Alisha Lehmann for her calls to close the gender pay gap.Baumgartner argued “women don’t have the same audience ratings (as male players) so there’s less money”.His two childhood dreams were to be a skydiver and a helicopter pilot. “I always had the desire to be in the air,” Austrian media quoted Baumgartner as saying. “I climbed trees, I wanted to see the world from above.”Baumgartner said after his record-breaking jump in 2012 that travelling faster than sound was “hard to describe because you don’t feel it”. “Sometimes we have to get really high to see how small we are.”With Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsFelix BaumgartnerItalyAustriaEuropeExtreme sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is claimed that between 2008 and 2015 Montoro and 27 other accused, among them senior treasury officials, were paid at least €11m (£9.5m) by big energy companies.According to the police investigation led by the judge Rubén Rus, “the economic team received large commissions in return for its capacity to influence legislative and executive powers” under the government of the then prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, adding that “the office was merely a vehicle to access the finance ministry”.In his report the judge commented that gas companies “tried to influence legislation in accordance with their interests by using various lobbies but without success” and were only successful when the go-between was Montoro’s economic team.“Within a short period of time and for no apparent reason they obtained the desired legislative reforms,” principally in the form of lower tax liabilities, it concluded.It is also alleged that Montoro personally accessed the confidential tax records of political rivals in his own party, among them Esperanza Aguirre, the former president of Madrid, as well as several journalists and celebrities, including the tennis star Rafael Nadal, the art collector and socialite Carmen Thyssen and Jordi Pujol Ferrusola, the son of the former Catalan president Jordi Pujol, who was under investigation for corruption.It is said that Rajoy was warned about Montoro’s activities but no action was taken.Montoro resigned from the PP on Thursday and issued a statement saying “there is no proof of any of the accusations”.The allegations are a blow to the strategy of the PP leader, Alberto Feijóo, which has consisted of a relentless attack on Sánchez whose party is beinginvestigatedover a series of corruption charges.Feijóo said the revelations did not change his view that corruption must be rooted out, whoever is involved. “What needs to be investigated must be investigated,” he said.Pablo Simón, a political scientist at the Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, said: “This gives Sánchez a breathing space but it’s not the end of it as more is likely to emerge from the judicial investigations. This levels the playing field and it’s also a blow to Feijóo’s strategy as it puts him on the defensive.”Simón said the latest scandal would reinforce the view of many voters that Spain’s political parties, both left and right, were irredeemably corrupt. The only beneficiaries, he said, would be the far-right Vox party which, having never been in power, could claim to have clean hands.“It’s analogous to what happened in Portugal after the scandals involving the socialist and then the conservative governments which benefited the far-right party there,” Simón said.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

A trial ofdedicated “scarf bars”within stores have also gone well and the company plans to install 200 in total.“We are appealing to a much broader range of luxury consumers,” he said, with the change in marketing drawing in younger, high-spending extrovert consumers who want to stand out from the crowd, as well as more mature brand loyalists.Adam Cochrane, an analyst at Deutsche, said further growth was largely dependent on Burberry’s ability to “replicate the success” of its core products in other areas.The company said it was “still in the early stages of our turnaround” with aims to continue simplifying the business and improving productivity and cashflow.It expects to achieve £80m of its planned £100m cost cuts this financial year, with the remainder next year, and has already reorganised the business under four regional heads.The company said in May it wascutting up to 1,700 jobs, including an entire shift at its Yorkshire raincoat factory, in an effort to make £60m in cost savings on top of a£40m savings programmeannounced in November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before we get into the news of the day, a bit of housekeeping.I’ve been away from the newsletter for a few months, but this isn’t the grand return I’msureyou’ve all been eagerly awaiting. Instead, this will be my last First Edition (cue sad music). After three and a half years, I’m moving teams to join the Guardian’s international desk. So, farewell readers! It’s been real and a proper privilege to be the first port of call for many of you each morning. Apologies for the countless times I’m sure you’ve opened your inbox, bleary eyed, to be greeted by some alarming event. You’ll be in excellent hands with my brilliant colleagues Aamna Mohdin and Phoebe Weston over the summer.Now, back to business, one final time.Much attention has been focused on the US’s response to Israel’s bombardment and siege ofGaza. Activists, campaigners and human rights groups have been pushing hard for Washington to do more to pressure the Israeli government to comply with international law.But there’s another major player that could exert real influence: the European Union. The EU wasIsrael’s biggest trading partner in 2024, accounting for 32% of Israeli exports, and Israel ranks as the EU’s third-largest trading partner in the region, after Morocco and Algeria. Many have argued that this economic leverage gives the EU the means to press Israel to uphold humanitarian law. Yet for the past 21 months, the bloc has been criticised for standing by whileaccusationsofgenocide,warcrimesandcrimes against humanityhave been directed at Israel.Just last month, the EU released a review that found Israel is breaching its human rights commitments under the terms of their association agreement. Still, there was no move to suspend trade. The decision has been called a“cruel and unlawful betrayal”of Palestinians and European values.For today’s newsletter, I spoke with secretary general of Amnesty International,Dr Agnès Callamard, about the deep divisions within the EU. That’s right after the headlines.Five big storiesUK news| Thevoting age will be lowered to 16across the UK by the next general election in a major change of the democratic system. The government said the reform would bring in more fairness as 16- and 17-year-olds already work and are able to serve in the military.US news| Donald Trump said on Thursday he had directed his attorney general, Pam Bondi, toseek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking caseas he sought to tamp down controversy over a story published by the Wall Street Journal alleging he contributed a sketch of a naked woman to Epstein’s 50th birthday album.Israel-Gaza| An Israeli strike has hit the only Catholic church in Gaza,killing two people and injuring several others, including the parish priest, who used to receive daily calls from the late Pope Francis.Labour| Diane Abbott has beensuspended from the Labour party for a second timeafter saying she did not regret her past remarks on racism. In a statement to Newsnight on Thursday evening, Abbott said: “It is obvious this Labour leadership wants me out. My comments in the interview … were factually correct, as any fair-minded person would accept.”Sudan| Children in Sudan, caught up in what aid organisations have called the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and threatened by rising levels of violence, areincreasingly vulnerable to deadly infectious diseasesas vaccinations in the country plummet.In depth: ‘Failure to act breaches the EU’s own rules. It is spitting on your own constitution’View image in fullscreenPalestinians inspect the damage after an Israeli airstrike in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood this week.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael’s full blockade on Gaza imposed earlier this year, along with the expansion of the military campaign, prompted theNetherlands to launch an auditin May to assess Israel’s compliance with the human rights clause of the EU-Israel association agreement.Last month, much to thefrustration of the Israeli government, the EU concluded that Israel had breached its human rights obligations in both Gaza and the West Bank. The bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that if the situation did not improve, the EU could consider “further measures” in July.It now appears, however, that this was an empty threat. Earlier this week Kallas said the bloc would keep “options on the table” but will not be imposing any sanctions on Israel.What was on the table?The EU was presented with10 potential optionsfor sanctioning Israel, ranging from suspending academic cooperation and visa-free travel, to blocking imports from Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and ending political dialogue with Israel. None received the necessary support.A full suspension of the association agreement, which underpins economic and political cooperation between the bloc and Israel, would require unanimous approval from all 27 member states. That was always going to be highly unlikely, given the outspoken support for Israel from a number of countries. However, “suspending the trade chapter” of the agreement, which would strip Israeli products of preferential access to the EU market, could be passed by a qualified majority vote. Even that did not pass.“It’s absolutely clear that the failure to act breaches the EU’s own rules. It is legally bound to promote human rights in its external relations, including trade,” said Callamard. “This goes beyond a lack of political will. It is, in effect, spitting on your own constitution.”The EU has been hamstrung, in large part, by divisions among its member states. On one side, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden have, to varying degrees, pushed for greater pressure on Israel. On the other stand Hungary, Germany and the Czech Republic, Israel’s closest allies in the bloc.Because consensus is required for many of the most consequential policies, “multilateral institutions are paralysed and failing to grasp the historical significance of what we are confronting,” Callamard said. The tide appears to be turning, however, Brussels correspondentJennifer Rankinnotes in her report, as the Netherlands, the country that pushed for the review into Israel’s trade ties with the EU, has historically been a close ally of Israel.As the EU continues to trundle on, other avenues for pressuring Israel, whether symbolic or more substantive, are being explored. Ireland, for example, isthe first EU member to draft legislationthat would ban imports from illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.How much leverage does the EUactually have?The EU holds substantial economic leverage. The 30-year-old agreement represents atrade relationship worth €68bnbetween the bloc and Israel. Israel has also secured grants worth €831m as a member of the EU’s flagship science research programme, Horizon, since 2021. Any disruption from the bloc could place serious strain on Israel’s economy, already burdened by the escalating cost of the war in Gaza and the wider region.“There is a great deal of economic trade involving the occupied territories, so putting an end to trade with the occupied territories and the settlement economy will have a huge impact on the Israeli economy,” Callamard said.What is the rest of the world doing?Many of the world’s most powerful nations have done little to halt the catastrophe in Gaza. In fact, several have continued to support Israel, albeit with increasing caveats as the scale of the horror has become impossible to ignore or deny.But elsewhere, there has been some movement.The Hague Group, a coalition of countries from the global south that is seeking to hold Israel accountable for abuses in Gaza, was formed by South Africa and Colombia. It now also includes Algeria, Brazil, Spain, Indonesia and Qatar, among others.Callamard said that while it is encouraging to see these countries take action, they remain in the minority. “The Hague Group is a great initiative, and we have been supporting it from the very first meeting, but it’s not big or strong enough right now to balance out the silence, the cowardice or the complicity of other powerful countries,” she said. “There is no way around it. We absolutely need European countries to act in accordance with their own rules, in accordance with their history and in accordance with international law. Nothing is going to shift if we don’t see that happening.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenBuddhist monks at Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAThe sex scandal engulfingThailand’s Buddhist clergyhas shocked the country, and raised important questions about money, power and titles,writes Rebecca Ratcliffe and Navaon Siradapuvadol.AamnaThe flood ofanti-immigration policiesunder Donald Trump can be difficult to track, but this brilliant visualisation byRita Liu and Nina Lakhanipowerfully illustrates their impact on one specific industry in the US.NimoThisextraordinary joint investigation by my colleaguesdetails clearly how revenues from theGBU-39 bomb, which have killed children, generated by the US arm of MBDA flow through the UK – defying the ban on weapons sale to Israel.AamnaEmine Saneroffers a terrifying yet useful rundown of everyday items that areunexpectedly crawling with bacteria(and no, your toilet isn’t one of them).NimoTheAfghanistan data leakstory is mindboggling.

Alongside the weekly mysteries, the series delicately explores Book’s life as a closeted gay man in 1946, adding depth and warmth. Bookish is a fine piece of entertainment: meticulously worked, beautifully paced and decidedly moreish.Lucy ManganFilmFriendship | ★★★★☆Here is a goofy-surreal comedy from first-time feature-maker Andrew DeYoung, starring sketch comic Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd; it is potentially as divisive as a Vimto-Marmite cocktail. This is a shaggy dog tale of ineffable silliness, operating ostensibly on the realist lines of indie US cinema but sauntering sideways from its initial premise, getting further and further from what had appeared to be a real issue: how difficult it is for grown men to make new friends.Peter BradshawTheatreSara Pascoe: I Am a Strange Gloop | ★★★★☆This touring show finds Sara Pascoe staggering shell-shocked from the soft play area to the stage, with battle-hardened tales from motherhood’s frontline. Banished from the centre of her own life, she now endures an existence “that makes The Handmaid’s Tale look progressive”, cleaning up after sons, fielding poos and playing canvas for vomit. There’s also fine material on Sisyphus and capitalism, and a running joke about Paula Radcliffe.Brian LoganMusicJim Legxacy: Black British Music | ★★★★★Black British Music is brighter, poppier, bolder in its stylistic leaps, lurching without warning from idiosyncratic pop R&B to the alt-rock of ’06 Wayne Rooney. It feels like the work of someone who has grown up with the all-you-can-eat buffet of streaming, hurling contrasting ideas in a state of excitement. There are distorted Chemical Brothers-worthy beats, Frank Ocean hints in Legxacy’s vocals, and bedroom pop on Dexters Phone Call. It’s risky, but held together by Legxacy’s melodic production and songwriting.Alexis PetridisToday in FocusView image in fullscreenCaptain Muraal boarding a British military plane in Kabul for evacuation.Photograph: Ministry of Defence/PAWhy thousands of Afghans were secretly relocated to the UKA number of Afghans who had worked for British forces and applied for asylum in the UK were informed this week that some of their personal data “may have been compromised” – and that their asylum applications had been leaked.Helen Piddspeaks withDan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor, aboutwhat is likely the biggest – and most expensive – data leak in British government history, and with former Afghan judgeMarzia Babakarkhailabout how Afghans fear the data list could endanger their lives.Cartoon of the day | Ben JenningsView image in fullscreenOn Keir Starmer’s decision to suspend four Labour MPs.Illustration: Ben Jennings/The GuardianThe UpsideA bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all badView image in fullscreenSafa from Young People’s Action Group stands within Vesuvius in Eruption by Joseph Wright of Derby, one of the masterpieces featured at Frameless.Photograph: David Parry/ShutterstockIt’s no secret that the art world has an elitist air around it.

People are running out of everything,” said Stephan Sakalian, the head of ICRC’s delegation in Syria.“Hospitals are increasingly struggling to treat the wounded and the sick, and families are unable to bury their loved ones in dignity.”The latest violence erupted on Sunday after the kidnapping of a Druze vegetable merchant by local Bedouin triggered tit-for-tat abductions, SOHR said.The Islamist-led government sent in the army, promising to put a halt to the fighting, but witnesses and SOHR said the troops sided with the Bedouin and committed many abuses against Druze civilians as well as fighters.The interim government has had strained relations with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities since it toppled longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December.This week’s fighting marks the most serious outbreak of violence since government forces battled Druze fighters in Sweida province and around Damascus in April and May, leaving more than 100 people dead.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

He suffered light injuries to his right leg.‘He felt our pain’: Catholic church in Gaza grieves Pope Francis’s deathRead moreIsrael resumed its strikes on Friday morning, with at least 14 Palestinians reported to have been killed acrossGaza.Pizzaballa and Theophilos, who last week travelled to the occupied West Bank after an attack on a Byzantine-era church blamed on Israeli settlers, met local Christians.As they entered the enclave, Pizzaballa received a call from Leo, who was elected as successor to Francis in May.“Pope Leo repeatedly stated that it is time to stop this slaughter, that what has happened is unjustifiable, and that we must ensure there are no more victims,” he toldVatican News.In a statement on Thursday, the pope had called for “an immediate ceasefire” in Gaza and expressed his “profound hope for dialogue, reconciliation and enduring peace in the region”.The Greek Orthodox patriarchate said the visit was “a powerful expression” of church unity and solidarity. Among the delegation were representatives from more than 20 countries, including Jordan, Russia, China, the EU, Japan and Canada.Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the group arrived with 500 tonnes of aid for local civilians.“The Italian government calls on Israel to stop military actions and to fully guarantee the safety of the two envoys in their important mission,” Tajani said.Both Italy and France called the strike “unacceptable” and Donald Trump called Netanyahu after having “not a positive reaction” on hearing about it, according to Karoline Leavitt, the US president’s press secretary.“It was a mistake by the Israelis to hit that Catholic church, that’s what the prime minister relayed to the president,” she told reporters.There are about 1,000 Christians among Gaza’s population of more than 2 million. Most are Greek Orthodox, with about 135 Catholics, according to the Latin patriarchate.Israel’s military says it does not target churches and religious sites but it has bombed mosques. The Jerusalem patriarchate said there had been “repeated assaults on Christian holy sites in Gaza”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelChristianityPope Leo XIVCatholicismnewsShareReuse this content"

In 1986, the Israeli authorities declared the main residential area of Susiya an archaeological site and evicted all of its residents, according to Amnesty International.In March, settlerslaunched an attackon the Susiya home of Hamdan Ballal, one of the directors of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land.In 2016 the Charity Commission wrote to UK Toremet saying: “A donation to a school in the occupied territories would be a donation for the advancement of education and therefore on the face of it a legitimate grant for UK Toremet to make.”The former Conservative party chair Sayeeda Warsi said: “It’s appalling that any British national should be engaged in funding illegal settlements on occupied land – and it’s even more disturbing that this is being subsidised by all of us taxpayers.“I’m sure the vast majority of my colleagues in Westminster will share my outrage that the Charity Commission is greenlighting these donations. Serious action must be taken so that settlementswhich are illegal under international law, and at the heart of a regime of discrimination and displacement, cannot benefit from charitable donations.”View image in fullscreenSusya village, in the south of the occupied West Bank, with the city of Hebron in the background.Photograph: Mosab Shawer/AFP/Getty ImagesAndy McDonald, a Labour MP and a solicitor, said: “The government must urgently take the steps necessary to ban the use of funds originating from the UK being used to support any aspect of the illegal occupation and ensure the Charity Commission is in no doubt about its duty in preventing such transfers and having the powers to do so.“Donations to illegal settlements should invalidate charitable status and result in individual prosecutions. If legislation is needed, we must do it.”Concerns have previously been raised about charitable donations from the UK to Israeli settlements but this is believed to be the first time there has been a definitive paper trail of a major transfer of funds to an illegal settlement.In awritten answerin parliament in 2015, the government said the Charity Commission, which covers England and Wales, had written to UK Toremet’s trustees “and will be meeting them to review … [its] governance, policies, procedures and operational activity”.The following year the commission confirmed it had an “open case” and that UK Toremet had been issued with “an action plan” and its compliance was being monitored.The £5.7m of donations were made subsequently, between 2017 and 2021. When the law firm Hickman & Rose contacted the commission about them in 2022 it replied that the issues raised were not within its regulatory role as they involved allegations of war crimes and advised the solicitors to report the matter to the police.The lawyers accordingly approached the counter-terrorism command, SO15, about individuals within the two charities. SO15 responded in March this year that it would not be pursuing a criminal investigation, based on reasons that the lawyers plan to contest, but said it would be highlighting the UK position on illegal settlements to the commission “with our concerns”.A Charity Commission spokesperson said: “We know this is a highly contentious issue about which there are strongly held opposing views. The commission can only operate within our legal framework, and the fact that a charity operates in the occupiedPalestinian territoriesdoes not in itself constitute a criminal offence or breach of charity law.”It said it referred all potential criminal matters to the relevant law enforcement body, adding: “Given the complex legal issues in relation to international law we are in the process of seeking renewed specialist advice from the attorney general.”A UK Toremet spokesperson said it was “not driven by any political or ideological agenda: and grants were made within the scope of English charity law​”, highlighting the 2016 letter from the commission about educational donations.A KCT spokesperson questioned whether the settlement was illegal. Before ending the call, he said the donation was for a “religious school, not for settlement purposes”, denied KCT was in any way encouraging the settlement and said the commission had “cleared” the donations.Explore more on these topicsCharitiesWest BankIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Almost all bore similar injuries: gunshot wounds and bodies shredded by shrapnel from nearby exploding artillery.“There were hundreds of wounded, no less than 200 bodies in the hospital. Many of them shot in the head, as if executed,” said Bahaa, a surgeon speaking of the events of this week in Sweida under a pseudonym for fear of retribution.Videos filmed inside the hospital showed hallways lined with corpses, rooms stacked with body bags and corpses piled up outside. A second doctor from the intensive care unit said bodies had to be placed outside the morgue for lack of space.The casualties, both civilian and military, were some of at least 516 civilians and fighters killed in four days of clashes in the Druze-majority province, according to figures given by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).At least 86 of those killed were field executions of Druze civilians by government fighters or allied militias, as well as three Bedouin civilians killed by Druze fighters, SOHR said.View image in fullscreenSyrian Bedouin fighters seen in Sweida province on Thursday.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersThe fighting, begun by a local dispute between Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters, quickly escalated and prompted Syrian government forces to intervene. Druze fighters resisted their entry into the province and clashes began with Syrian government forces.Residents described four days of terror as fighting quickly took on a sectarian flavour – the violence was the most serious threat to Syria’s stability since March, when 1,500 mostly Alawite civilians were killed after a failed attack on government forces.Syria’s president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has pledged to protect the country’s minorities since the toppling of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in December. He now leads a country riven by sectarian divisions after 14 years of civil war, without the resources to engage in the transitional justice needed to heal it.The president, a former al-Qaida leader turned statesman, has been welcomed on to the international stage but there are deep misgivings about him among Syria’s minorities back home.Map of Sweida and Deraa provincesAs theSyrian military withdrew from the cityon Wednesday, people began to emerge from their houses and take stock of their losses.At least 15 unarmed people were killed at a reception hall belonging to the prominent Radwan family in Sweida city on Tuesday, three members of the family told the Guardian. SOHR also reported the killings, though put the number of dead at 12.“They were sitting there drinking coffee when gunmen came in and just started shooting. There are no weapons allowed in the hall, it’s not like it’s a military base,” said Maan Radwan, a 46-year-old London resident whose relatives were killed in the shooting.Sweida residents blamed government-affiliated forces for the killings but witnesses said it was impossible to distinguish between state security forces and rogue militias. The Guardian could not independently verify who was responsible for the killings.An eyewitness said the attackers were wearing army fatigues but could not tell if they were from government-affiliated forces or a militia. “It’s impossible to tell who is killing us,” a 52-year-old teacher and relative of the Radwan family in Sweida told the Guardian by phone.Video of the aftermath of the shooting showed unarmed men strewn across a room lying in pools of blood. Family members said men in army fatigues prevented ambulances from reaching the reception hall, which they thought was meant to ensure the wounded died from blood loss.Bahaa received the bodies of those killed in the Radwan shooting at the hospital, some of whom he knew personally, and said that their bodies bore close-range gunshot wounds. He would recognise many more of the corpses that would later come through the hospital doors.Conditions in the hospital itself became desperate as fighters besieged the facility. Doctors hid in the hallways as bullets and artillery flew by, and the hospital itself was hit at least once. They began to ration medicine and other basic supplies.“We were trying to limit each wounded person to 2 or 3CCs of Tramadol and we would dilute it so it would last for everyone,” the doctor from the intensive care unit said.Al-Sharaa gave a speech on Thursday condemning the abuses against civilians and said there would be accountability. The Syrian defence ministry also said it was “adhering to rules of engagement to protect residents”.“We are determined to hold accountable anyone who wronged or harmed our Druze brethren. They are under the protection and responsibility of the state, and the law and justice guarantee the rights of all without exception,” the Syrian president said.On their private social media seen by the Guardian, two government forces members posted sectarian hate speech against Druze.One posted a video of him and two other soldiers driving through Sweida laughing as he said: “We are on our way to distribute aid,” while brandishing a machete to the camera. He filmed himself inside a house in Sweida ripping a picture of Druze spiritual leaders off a wall and trampling it with his boots.“If God grants you victory, none can defeat you … On behalf of the tribes, oh Druze and Alawites, we are coming for you with sectarianism,” he continued.Another fighter posted a video of him driving through the town of Sahwa Blata in Sweida province, pausing to gloat over two dead bodies on the sidewalk as he filmed.“These are your dogs, al-Hijri. Anyone who stands against the state this is what will happen to them,” he said, referring to the most staunchly anti-government of the three Druze spiritual leaders, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri.Yousef* recognised the two men in the video as his cousin and his cousin’s son. He had no idea prior that they were dead.“They called me at 7am that morning and most of the people had fled the village. They didn’t know what to do, and they didn’t have any guns at all,” said Yousef, a 25-year-old civil engineer in Sweida.View image in fullscreenArab Bedouins rest in the open with their belongings on 17 July near the town of Busra al-Harir in the countryside of the Daraa governorate after fleeing Sweida.Photograph: Ahmad Fallaha/EPADespite the ceasefire on Wednesday, intermittent violence seemed to continue. Rumours of another Bedouin attack on Sweida prompted a mass exodus of residents on Thursday. Yousef sent a video of him interviewing people as they fled. One had two body bags in the bed of his pickup truck. Unzipping the one of the body bags, Yousef showed the camera the body of a woman, her throat slit.The cycle of tit-for-tat violence which carried sectarian overtones threatens the unity of the new Syrian state, which authorities in Damascus were desperately trying to hold together. Mistrust between the Druze and the new authorities, and vice versa, has fallen to an all time low.Syrian state media reported on Thursday that there were now attacks on the small Bedouin communities in Sweida, prompting further displacement and what it called massacres by “outlaw groups”.Social media was flooded by another round of images of dead civilians, this time, they claimed, it was the Druze attacking the Bedouins. The Guardian could not independently verify the veracity of those videos.“So many of those killed were anti-Assad from the beginning. All of these killings after 14 years of war. What’s the point?” said Bahaa.(Names with an asterisk have been changed)Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In his mitigation argument, he said: “It is precisely because she does not look like someone who is involved in drug dealing that she was chosen to be part of the plot.”He added: “I submit that all of these individuals are expendable, without experience and without a lot of knowledge.”Demi Bright made a single trip in August 2023 that involved 60kg of cocaine. She took her two children with her on the two-day trip, which involved an overnight stay in a hotel.Lillie Bright was involved in 20 trips involving 195kg of cocaine. Her partner Chloe Hodgkin, 23, of Abbots Walk, Wye, Kent, is awaiting the birth of her baby and is to be sentenced at a date to be set.Reggie Bright’s 12 trips as part of the gang delivered at least 90kg and there were times he collected wages for the group. He usually took trips with his partner, Demi Kendall, 31, telling her “not to get the hump because we need the money”, the court heard.Tina Golding made four trips and delivered at least 75kg of cocaine, collecting at least £10,000 in wages.Anita Slaughter took part in a single trip, which amounted to 55kg across four drops, in October 2023.Roseanne Mason, 29, of Canonbury, north London, and Demi Bright, 30, of Ashford, Kent, were each sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment.Lillie Bright, 26, of Ashford, Kent, was sentenced to 13 years, and Demi Kendall, 31, of Staplehurst, Kent, was sentenced to 13 years and six months’ imprisonment.Reggie Bright, 24, of Staplehurst, Kent, was sentenced to 15 years, and Tina Golding, 66, of Ashford, Kent, was jailed for 10 years.Slaughter, 44, of Ashford, Kent, was sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment.Acting on intelligence,Metropolitan policeofficers used investigative techniques including extensive call data and conventional surveillance to track Deborah Mason and her couriers’ movements. Most of the gang were arrested in May 2024.DC Jack Kraushaar, who led the investigation, said: “This was a sophisticated operation which was extremely profitable for those involved.“Following months of work by the Met police to relentlessly pursue these perpetrators, we were able to arrest and eventually convict them, preventing more drugs flooding streets across the UK which leads to violence, antisocial behaviour and misery for communities.”Explore more on these topicsDrugsLondonMetropolitan policePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the challenge with politics. Everybody wants something mañana. It’s like, gotta have it immediately.”In an interview with the Guardian as MPs prepared to break for the summer recess, Rayner also said she was unafraid of Nigel Farage, that tough action against rebellious Labour MPs was “justified” and thatfixing the “awful” Send systemfor children was an urgent priority.NHS to Send: four key areas Labour wants to improve before next electionRead moreShe said it was a “moral mission” for Labour to bring down child poverty, she would feel personally wounded if the government did not hit its1.5m new homes targetand that it was determined to “break the doom loop” of low economic growth and high taxes suffered for years.However, speaking in her office in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Rayner made clear she expected her colleagues, from Keir Starmer down, to do a better job of arguing for what they believed in. “We all have to step up and make that case. It’s the job of all of us in the wider Labour movement,” she said, citing achievements such as falling NHS waiting lists, funding increases for housing and rising wages.“I often go to Labour fundraisers and joke that the Tories will do 4% of their manifesto, and then go on about that 4% as if they’ve delivered the whole lot. In our Labour movement, we’ll do 96% of it, but we’ll go on about the 4% that we never managed to achieve.“It’s a mindset that we have … We’re always thinking about what we didn’t get, as opposed to all the huge achievements that we’re making. Our whole movement is message carriers. And if we’re not going to talk about these huge achievements, then who is?”Labourhas characterisedReform UK as its main opposition at the next election, even though it has just four MPs. Rayner said they had to be “held to account” for making “wild promises” to the public they would not be able to deliver on, calling Farage a “snake oil salesman”.“Politics can make a real difference to people’s lives, but it takes time to change, to bring about that fundamental change that people are so desperate to see. That’s what this Labour government is doing,” she said. “It’s not short-termism on the back of a fag packet, on some billboard. It’s actually the fundamental reforms that will get Britain back on track … instead of people feeling at the moment like everything is broken and nothing can be fixed.”View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner in her office at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianRayner defended the decision tostrip the Labour whipfrom four “persistent” rebel MPs, even though No 10 had said it would try to improve relations with backbenchers after they forced it into a major U-turn over welfare cuts. “I think it’s justified. If you’re constantly organising against your Labour government then that’s a whipping issue for the chief whip, and that’s as old as time,” she said.But she acknowledged the government had to find ways of giving MPs “opportunities to air concerns” and be part of the collective decision-making process. Labour MPs are concerned that ministers will approach plans for children’s special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in the same way as they did changes to welfare, which were presented as a cost-saving move.But Rayner, who has two children who have been through the Send process, said the system was “awful” for parents and had to be fixed, adding that she knew the government needed to bring families, schools and MPs with them on the difficult path to change.Her own department has an additional interest because councils, which provide much of the support, were granted two further years until March 2028 to keep Send deficits off their books, giving them a strict deadline.“Can we do it in the time? We have to, because so many young people are being let down at the moment, because the system is not catching people’s needs early on. That system is awful for parents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve got to fix this. Often we’re spending huge sums of money and we’re still not delivering the outcomes for those young people.”Labour MPs are also desperate for the government to deliver on its pledge to tackle child poverty, with Starmer understood to be keen to liftthe two-child benefit capif affordable, although that has been made harder because ofthe welfare U-turn.Rayner said it was a “moral mission” and “absolutely critical” for a Labour government to bring down child poverty, but despite experts suggesting scrapping the cap would be the most cost-effective way to do so, she said there was “no single lever” to address problem.She has announced a near doubling ofgovernment spending on affordable housingin England, up to £40bn of grants over 10 years, and bringing its target to build 1.5m new homes by 2029 closer. She said she would feel wounded if the target was not hit, even though experts say it will be extremely difficult. “I would be wounded, even though it is a real stretch target. Everyone says it’s really difficult to get there, but I’m determined to,” she said.Just months after Raynerurged Rachel Reeves to consider a series of wealth tax rises, underscoring unease over the chancellor’s tight spending plans, she said the country needed to get out of the “doom loop” of low growth and high taxes it had seen under the Conservatives.While she refused to be drawn on whether it was inevitable that taxes would have to rise this autumn, when asked about her leaked memo to the chancellor, she said the country “can’t continue” as it is. “I think we will get there. But we can’t continue on this doom loop of, you know, low, low growth and high taxes, we have to find a way through this,” she added, highlighting capital investment and trade deals which both supported the economy.“That’s how you grow the economy in the long run, and where people feel better off as a result of it. That’s the turnaround that we’re doing that the previous government didn’t do, and why we’ve been in this constant doom loop.”BeforeDonald Trump’s second state visitto the UK this autumn, Rayner, who has previously called the US president “a buffoon” who had “no place in the White House”, said she respected the mandate of elected politicians but was prepared to “challenge respectfully”.A week afterUnite the trade union voted to suspend her membershipand rethink its ties with the Labour party over the Birmingham bin strikes, Rayner said that while she was proud of her trade union roots, she answered to working people and her constituents. “That’s my test.

He said: “She was a wonderful, warm person with an infectious personality that lightened any room she entered.”He said the home had let down his daughter and Conroy. “He should never have been given the opportunity to murder Melissa. It was well known that he was at extremely high risk of murdering someone, particularly petite females, and he should never have been allowed to wander a care home, unsupervised.”In her conclusion, Voisin said: “A catalogue of failures resulting in his placement with no effective risk assessment in place resulted in the death of Melissa.”The coroner highlighted that Mathieson had said she thought Conroy, who was 18 at the time, was stalking her and was frightened of him. Some staff members had also flagged up concerns but no action was taken.In a narrative conclusion, the coroner said Mathieson “died as a result of unlawful killing caused by both the act of strangulation and also due to the acts and omissions by the home entrusted with her care”.She added: “The placing authority [the States of Guernsey], knowing this resident’s risk, should not have agreed to the care plan and package being offered; they failed to act when concerns were raised.”The inquest heard that Conroy had a troubled early childhood on Guernsey and was sent at the age of seven by the island’s government to the UK to be looked after.While living in care homes in England, he exhibited “extreme sexualised behaviour” and attacked three female members of staff.The most serious was in March 2013 aged 17 when he assaulted a staff member at Options Higford school in Shropshire.After trying to touch the staff member inappropriately, he put his forearm around her neck and squeezed until she lost consciousness.Conroy admitted to a forensic psychologist, Hilary Grant, that he wanted to kill the staff member and have sex with her body. The psychologist said he posed a high risk, especially to petite young women, and it was imperative he was “highly supervised” at all times. The report said that if he was not supervised tightly, it was “almost certain” he would attack again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The school told the States of Guernsey it could not continue to care for him. A consultant psychiatrist identified Alexandra House in Bristol on behalf of Guernsey as a potential new home.Conroy moved there at the end of August 2014 and was given much freedom.At night, the inquest heard, one staff member was awake and on duty monitoring 16 residents over Alexandra House’s three floors, meaning Conroy was allowed to “roam around” unsupervised. Mathieson told staff she felt he was always “lurking”.In October 2014 Conroy strangled Mathieson, planning to take her body back to his room and sexually abuse her.He was jailed for life.During the inquest, Yvonne Hin, the then manager of Alexandra House, said she did not see the crucial Grant report until after Mathieson was killed.John Duggan, the registered general manager of the home, accepted that the Grant report was “available” to Alexandra House from the beginning of August.He said changes had been made to how residents were assessed and supervised but the coroner said she would write to the organisation with remaining concerns about elements of how it was run.Conroy’s social worker, Sename Abotsi, a locum working for the States of Guernsey at the time, expressed surprise during the inquest when told there was only one “waking” staff member on duty at night. She said she had no experience of placing a high-risk person.The hearing was told that the States of Guernsey paid £1,800 a week for Conroy’s place at Alexandra House – less than half what the type of supervision he had been under at Options Higford would have been expected to cost.Dr Dominic Bishop, the clinical director of specialist mental health and adult disability services for Guernsey, accepted during the inquest there had been as series of “systemic difficulties”, but said the island had made wide-ranging changes to address the issues the case exposed.Joseph Morgan, a solicitor for the Mathieson family said: “The coroner’s findings are utterly damning.” He said: “It is desperately tragic that a young woman was deprived of her life as a result of these catastrophic, multi-agency failures.”Explore more on these topicsSocial careCrimeBristolGuernseyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But the court heard how this only applies to third or subsequent children, leaving some women unable to utilise this exception if, for example, their first two children are conceived after rape but they have further children in consensual relationships.The women, whose claim was against the Department for Work and Pensions, were supported by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), which describes the benefit rules as “inhumane”.The judge said the two women endured abusive relationships that included rape. “They are chilling accounts of appalling domestic abuse,” she said. “Vulnerable girls barely out of childhood themselves caught in toxic relationships, or repeating cycles of such relationships, in which their personal, reproductive and family autonomy is acutely compromised by the physical, sexual and emotional violence of controlling perpetrators.”She said the women were “among the most harmed and vulnerable” members of society while as mothers they were “making an important and valuable” contribution to it.Scrapping two-child benefit limit ‘would still leave 100,000 young Britons in poverty’Read moreThe judge said CPAG had brought a legal challenge to the two-child cap before. “That made its way to the supreme court, which, in 2021, firmly returned the matter to the political realm.”She said she had reached the same place as the supreme court did before, saying it was “a policy question dealing in social, economic, moral and ethical subject matter” and a “political law-reform question”.The judge added: “The law does not compel a government, or a parliament, to provide the answer the claimants seek. This claim is dismissed accordingly.”In a statement after the ruling, the mother named EFG said: “All of my choices were taken away from me for years by my abuser before I fled. I’ve fought hard to get on with my life for me and my kids. But the two-child limit makes it more difficult.“The government says that the exceptions are to protect people who – like me – didn’t have a choice about the number of kids in their family, but the rape clause doesn’t do that. The rules need to change to protect families like mine. The result today is disappointing but I will keep going and fight this to the end.”The other mother, LMN, said: “I want to keep going with the case as I feel like it’s against my human rights. When my oldest came back to live with me from care and before I got the exception for my youngest, we had to survive on less money. That stopped me doing things with the children – I never planned on having the children but that’s not their fault.”Claire Hall, a solicitor at CPAG who represented the women, said they would look at appealing against the decision, but in the meantime, “all eyes are on the government which has the chance to do the right thing and abolish the inhumane two-child limit in the autumn child poverty strategy”.Hall added: “Our clients have provided their children with safe and loving home environments but the rules have failed to protect them and their children from the impacts of the two-child limit.”A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Violence against women and girls is a national emergency – and our mission is to halve it within a decade. Victims of rape and coercion should be treated with dignity and respect.“This court decision is about whether a policy – designed by the previous government – was being implemented lawfully. This policy will be considered along with all other levers including social security reform by the child poverty taskforce. The group will publish the child poverty strategy in the autumn.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareUniversal creditBenefitsChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Two children who were taken to Bristol Royal hospital for children by air ambulance also remain in hospital. The coach was the only vehicle involved, they added.The driver of the coach, which was carrying 60 to 70 people, is in hospital injured but in a stable condition, while school routes run by the coach company have been suspended. It is understood the children were divided between two coaches, with the first to leave the zoo making it back safely.Six schools, including Minehead middle school, which are all part of Beacon Education multi-academy trust, were closed on Friday as the community dealt with the aftermath of the crash that occurred between Wheddon Cross and Timberscombe.Teams from Avon and Somerset police, Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service and South Western ambulance service were all involved at the scene, supported by the National Police Air Service helicopter, as well as Devon air ambulance, and Dorset and Somerset air ambulance.Police said 24 volunteers from Exmoor search and rescue, a mountain rescue team, carried out first aid triage at Rest and Be Thankful pub at Wheddon Cross, which was set up as an official rest centre.The school’s headteacher, Laura Mackie, told ITV she was “completely heartbroken”.She said: “The loss is unimaginable and we keep the student we have lost in our hearts. I am thinking of the student that we lost, their family, their friends and all of their loved ones.“I am thinking of my staff team who are amazing and dedicated and all of our wonderful students that have been affected by this awful incident. It has just been horrific.”Keir Starmer paid tribute on social media. Posting on X, he said: “A heartbreaking update on the school bus crash in Somerset. There are no adequate words to acknowledge the death of a child. All my thoughts are with their parents, family and friends, and all those affected.”A steady stream of people have been laying flowers outside Minehead middle school, along the railing on Townsend Road.Staff from nearby Old Cleeve preschool wrote: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by this tragic incident.”Another said: “Thinking of everyone at this heartbreaking and devastating time. Our community is holding you all tight and surrounding you with love.”View image in fullscreenA message from Minehead town council said: ‘We share your sorrow.’Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA MediaSpeaking outside Minehead middle school, the Rev Philip Butcher, the vicar of Minehead, said: “It was absolutely numbing. There are no words to describe what happened yesterday. It’s an absolute tragedy, and one that’s still very much unfolding. We’re just standing firm with the school, with the families at this time, just to be with them in this time as a point of support.”The director of Ridlers Coaches, Peter Prior-Sankey, confirmed the driver was in a stable condition in hospital but with a number of injuries. “We are in contact with his wife and family and have offered ongoing support,” he said.Prior-Sankey said a decision had been made not to run any school routes into Minehead, and that discussions would continue over the coming days concerning any other affected routes or contracts.A statement from Exmoor zoo said: “We cannot believe that fate has been so cruel to such a lovely, lively, well-behaved group of children from Minehead middle school on their way home with their coach. All our thoughts, blessings and prayers go out to everybody involved. We cannot comprehend what the children, their families, teachers and emergency crews are all going through now.”Recovery of the vehicle and the collision investigation would be complex, police said, and the road was expected to remain closed for a “considerable” time.

In many ways the board is equally to blame!” he wrote.At its most recent meeting the Fed held interest rates at a level between 4.25% and 4.5%, with Powell citing the likely impact of the president’s import tariffs on inflation as one of the main reasons.US inflationaccelerated to 2.7% in June, up from 2.4% in May, according to the consumer price index, with business leaders blaming tariffs on imported goods for the increase in prices.Trump has consistently attacked Powell and hinted that he could take the unprecedented decision to sack him, although the White House budget director, Russell Vought,saidon Thursday that the president was unlikely to fire the Fed boss.The supreme court recentlysuggestedthat the president could not fire the Fed chair.Vought said the administration wanted to have an on-site inspection of theFed’s troubled$2.5bn building renovations. “I think the president was pretty clear … he’s unlikely to fire the chair, but he has substantial concerns with regard to how he’s managed the Fed,” he said, indicating that Powell could see out his term of office, which ends next May.Christopher Waller, one of seven governors on the Fed board, said he would accept the job of Fed chair if asked by Trump. His intervention, the first by one of Powell’s colleagues, came just hours after he joined the president in calling for a rate cut this month.Waller said: “In 2019 the president contacted me and said: ‘Would you serve?’ And I said yes. If the president contacted me and said ‘I want you to serve’, I would do it. But he has not contacted me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You should lower the rate – by a lot!” Trumpwroteto Powell.In his latest social media post, he wrote: “‘Too Late’ and the Fed, are choking out the housing market with their high rate, making it difficult for people, especially the young, to buy a house.“The USA is Rockin’, there is VERY LOW INFLATION, and we deserve to be at 1%, saving One Trillion Dollars a year on Interest Costs. I can’t tell you how dumb Too Late is – So bad for our Country!”A meeting of finance ministers from the G20 gave Powell implicit backing by saying it was crucial to protect the independence of central banks.The final communique on Friday after two days of meetings in Durban, South Africa, attended by the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, stressed the importance of central banks being allowed to achieve their mandates without political interference.It said: “Central banks are strongly committed to ensuring price stability, consistent with their respective mandates, and will continue to adjust their policies in a data-dependent manner. Central bank independence is crucial to achieving this goal.”The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, was missing from the event after a disagreement with Cyril Ramaphosa’s South Africa administration, which Trump has accused of failing to tackle the killing of white farmers – without providing evidence to support the claim.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpJerome PowellUS interest ratesInterest ratesUS economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The prize is a stake in the prolific Stabroek Block off the coast of Guyana that holds more than 11bn barrels of oil and is one of the fastest-growing oil provinces in the world.“This merger of two great American companies brings together the best in the industry,” Wirth said in a statement.Exxon and the China National OffshoreOilCorporation (CNOOC), Hess’s partners in Guyana, had filed arbitration disputes that claimed they held a pre-emptive right to purchase Hess’s stake, which delayed Chevron’s closure of the Hess acquisition for over a year.BP agrees to sell US onshore wind business as it shifts back to oilRead more“We disagree with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) panel’s interpretation but respect the arbitration and dispute resolution process,” Exxon said in a statement.“Given the significant value we’ve created in the development of the Guyana resource, we believed we had a clear duty to our investors to consider our pre-emption rights to protect the value we created through our innovation and hard work at a time when no one knew just how successful this venture would become,” the company added.CNOOC said it was also disappointed with the ruling.There is no appeals process at the International Chamber of Commerce, the court that oversaw the arbitration case.Even as it awaited the arbitration verdict, Chevron was making preparations so it could close the deal with Hess quickly, Reuters previously reported.Information technology workers from Chevron and Hess have met regularly to plan the integration, and Hess employees were informed that they could request a severance package following the deal’s close.In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Wirth said converting technology and combining employees from both companies would take a few months.Shares of Chevron and Exxon were marginally lower in morning trading.Explore more on these topicsOilCommoditiesMergers and acquisitionsChevronExxonMobilOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualisation and shot planning work, and certainly visual effects. I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen, and that is endlessly exciting.”His comments came after Netflix reported $11bn revenue for the quarter to the end of June, a 16% year-on-year increase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Imagine he really cared. Scottie Scheffler used media duties before the 153rd Open Championship to assess the pointlessness of golf in thegrand scheme of life. “If I win, it’s going to be awesome for two minutes,” Scheffler asserted. The world No 1 should already prepare for his 120 seconds of ecstasy. There is an air of inevitability about Scheffler cradling the Claret Jug with only half of this tournament gone. It will be a shock should he not win from here.Matt Fitzpatrick had the elements to contend with for spells on Friday afternoon. Next came Scheffler, marauding in the rear view mirror, which for a golfer is more troublesome than anything that drops from the sky. Fitzpatrick had only just signed his scorecard for a 66 and nine under total as Scheffler poured in a birdie putt at the 17th. Ten under par.‘Still not sure’: Shane Lowry casts doubt over two-shot penalty decision at OpenRead moreScheffler had the good grace to leave an opportunity from 15ft on the last just short of the jaws of the hole. Things are at least still mildly interesting. It was just that Scheffler’s 64, the lowest of this Open so far, felt ominous for pretenders to his throne.Fitzpatrick believes he reached a professional nadir at this year’s Players Championship. There, he was badly struggling for form and answers. His recent touch has been far more impressive and at least akin to the golfer who scaled theUS Open mountainat Brookline in 2022. Fitzpatrick’s only frustration arrived from a missed birdie putt, all 3ft of it, on the penultimate hole. Given Scheffler’s mood, that could prove significant.“I wouldn’t say I necessarily feel as much pressure,” said Fitzpatrick of a Saturday tee time with Scheffler. “He’s going to have the expectation to go out and dominate. He’s an exceptional player. He’s world No 1 and we’re seeing Tiger-like stuff. I think the pressure is for him to win the golf tournament. For me, obviously I hope I’m going to have some more home support than him but it’s an exciting position for me to be in given where I was earlier this year.”Fitzpatrick also addressed timekeeping, after rounds stretched to close to six hours on day one. “I do think it’s ridiculous,” he said. “The pace of play has been a combination of the way the golf course is, reachable par fives and all that normal stuff. But it starts with the players as well and starts with the rules officials.”Brian Harman had made the second-round running, his 65 putting him eight under atop the leaderboard at lunchtime. Li Haotong reached minus nine after 12 but was to tie Harman’s aggregate. Harmanwon the Open in 2023and has done precious little over the intervening 24 months. Cue further questions about Harman’s fondness for hunting; animals, not golf titles. Li’s victory in Qatar in February was his first for three years.View image in fullscreenMatt Fitzpatrick is a shot behind the leader Scottie Scheffler after a second round 66.Photograph: Oisin Keniry/R&A/Getty ImagesRory McIlroy was long gone by the time Fitzpatrick and Scheffler negotiated the closing stretch. The Masters champion has achieved his first target of Open week by surviving for the closing 36 holes, something he failed to accomplish here in 2019. McIlroy’s 69 for a three-under total has given hope to the vast galleries that have followed him. Saturday promises to deliver more of the Rory Roar.“I’ve been somewhat close to my best over the first two days in little bits here and there,” McIlroy said. “I’m going to need to have it all under control and have it sort of all firing over the weekend to make a run.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I count myself very grateful and very lucky that I’m in this position. I’m excited for the weekend.”So too is Keegan Bradley. While playing what he describes as the golf of his life, Bradley appears ready to play in and captain the US Ryder Cup team at Bethpage in September. This will be a dual role of genius or lunacy, depending on the result against Europe. Bradley is also three under. His 67 was bogey free. Chris Gotterup, who won the Scottish Open on Sunday, continues to ride the wave. He is five under in the company of Harris English, Bob MacIntyre, Rasmus Højgaard and Tyrrell Hatton.Nobody who has made the cut can be completely ruled out of winning this major. Should Scheffler have an unlikely stumble, that is. The leaderboard is the most congested thing in Portrush, which takes quite some doing. Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm and Viktor Hovland are even par. Tommy Fleetwood is one better off. The defending champion Xander Schauffele is two under. Bryson DeChambeau spent Thursday retrieving balls from the A2 to Coleraine yet blasted back to breeze into the weekend with a 65. Good old Bryson, never dull.Those to make an early exit from Northern Ireland included Cameron Smith, whose decline in this environment since making a move to the LIV Tour has been incredible, Adam Scott, Collin Morikawa, Padraig Harrington and Min Woo Lee.

But his poise, defense and winning mentality confirmed his billing as a generational talentClaire de Lunein Las VegasFri 18 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 04.35 EDTShare“Iwould say that might be one of the worst games of my life,” Cooper Flagg told reporters last Thursday night. “But we got the win, so that’s what really matters to me.” It was a telling statement from the 18-year-old basketball phenom afterhis first Las Vegas Summer League game. The No 1 overall pick in this year’s NBA draft – taken by the Dallas Mavericks after a one-and-done college career at Duke – didn’t have nearly as disastrous a debut as he made out. Though he struggled to shoot the ball, Flagg still managed to flash his playmaking and defensive range. Clearly hyperaware to the moment and the hype surrounding his technical NBA debut, he looked determined to put on a show: aggressively hunting his shot and seeking out highlight-reel dunks at every opportunity.Cooper Flagg: the 17-year-old ‘cold-ass white boy’ breaking the basketball discourseRead moreHe bounced back with 31 points in his second (and ultimately final) Summer League appearance on Saturday. But it was the second-half of his comment after Thursday night’s game that encapsulates why Flagg isone of the most hyped teenage prospectsin decades: the kid is a winner.The buzz around Flagg began in his native Maine, where he became the first freshman to win the state’s Gatorade Player of the Year award. He transferred to Montverde Academy in Florida after his first year of high school in search of stiffer competition, and the accolades continued to accumulate: McDonald’s All American, Gatorade National Player of the Year, evenUSA Basketball’s Male Athlete of the Year, the youngest to earn the honor since the award’s inception in 1980. Long compared to Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum for his two-way skillset and relentless work ethic, Flagg reclassified to enter college a year early – and did the same a second time to reach the NBA sooner. With every challenge cleared, he’s sought the next one with even greater urgency.Ina 2024 feature on Flagg for the Ringer, J Kyle Mann described the 6ft 9in, 205lb Swiss army knife as “running toward the grind”, a sentiment longtime Mavericks beat writer Tim Cato echoes in Vegas this week when I ask for his assessment of the teenager. “What really stands out to me about Cooper is he has always ascended,” Cato says. “He loves to cite a quote from his mom, ‘If you’re the best player in the gym, you need to find a new gym.’ And I just think that shows up in every aspect of his career.”View image in fullscreenDallas Mavericks forward Cooper Flagg, right, drives the ball against Los Angeles Lakers guard DaJaun Gordon during the second half of an NBA Summer League game last week in Las Vegas.Photograph: David Becker/APThat dogged commitment to improvement has made Flagg both more polished and more reserved than many of his peers. The Tatum comparisons, one could argue, are as apt behind the microphone as they are on the court. His answers can feel a little too polished, the jagged edges sanded down. He lacks the off-the-cuff charisma of an Anthony Edwards or the unfiltered snarl of a Garnett. There’s little brashness, no “face of the league” bravado – just focus. When I asked him after his monster second Vegas appearance, where he punctuated what felt like every five minutes of playwith a poster dunkand looked every part the budding superstar, what he dreams about when he lets his imagination run wild over the potential of his NBA career, he had an aw-shucks answer seemingly in the can. “I’m not getting too far ahead of myself. I haven’t really thought about that too much,” he said. “I’m kind of just focused on each individual day and just trying to get better. I know I have a really long way to go, and a lot to improve on.”Cooper Flagg will go No 1 in the NBA draft. He also broke the Duke supervillain stereotypeRead more“That focus is what stands out most about Cooper,” says Cato. “Sometimes even to his detriment. When he says stuff like ‘I’m not really into music,’ he just seems like a guy solely consumed with basketball and challenging himself to reach new heights.”Flagg could do a lot worse than ending up a rough equivalent of Tatum, of course: an arguable top-five player who is a year removed from an NBA championship. He would probably be quite pleased with that trajectory (and, it’s worth noting, the New Englandergrew up a Celtics fan). But some insiders see an even loftier ceiling. One NBA executive told me Flagg was “the most skilled and hardest-working prospect in either of his Summer League games”, adding: “He has a pretty strong case as the most complete 18-year-old player since LeBron James.”What impressed most in Flagg’s debut wasn’t any single element. It was the totality: the aggression, the poise, the basketball IQ, the defense, the size, the athleticism. Flagg is poised to make his formal regular-season debut in October as a ready-made, plug-and-play contributor with superstar upside. Against all odds, a Mavericks organization just months removed fromthe Luka Dončić sagaappears, indeed, to have hit the lottery.Explore more on these topicsCooper FlaggDallas MavericksNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a harsh and pitiless business and earlier this week, at the end of a long afternoon answering the same old questions in front of a line of television cameras, Usyk sat down with a small group of familiar faces who have written about him for years. During his last assignment for the day he opened up a little more as he spoke about the sacrifices boxing demands.He told us how much he wanted to see his wife, Yekaterina, as she had just flown into London and they would be reunited that evening. Three months had passed, in a gruelling training camp, since they had been together and Usyk spoke about missing her and their four children.Cherished champion and statesman: Usyk focuses on Ukraine before titlesRead more“It’s always been very difficult but I keep in mind that I have to be focused on training and I chose this path to be who I am now,” Usyk said before pointing out it was even harder for his family. “Sometimes we have to give away things to get even better things. And sometimes it’s the people around us, that are closest to us, who pay the price.”I asked Usyk if he was able to call or FaceTime Yekaterina most days while preparing forbattle on Saturday night with Daniel Dubois. “Yes, of course,” he said. “I’m always calling my wife early in the morning when our young daughter wakes up. She always wants to see her daddy. It’s in the morning and evening, sometimes even at lunchtime when there’s a break.”Usyk denied that such long and enforced separations from his family would influence his decision as to when he might retire. “It doesn’t impact my thinking,” he said. “When I was very little [and living in Simferopol, the Crimean city annexed by Russia in 2014] my family was quite poor and sometimes there would be no money to even buy some bread. Now I’m working so hard so that my kids will have not just bread but butter.”He smiled wryly, for Usyk has made so many millions out of boxing. But at the age of 38, the unbeaten world heavyweight champion is approaching the last days of his remarkable career. He admitted he might have only “two [more fights] left. This one and the next. I don’t know who that will be against because now my focus is only Daniel on Saturday.”Usyk is a highly intelligent man who is awarethis world title unification boutat Wembley Stadium is laced with jeopardy and an element of unpredictability. Dubois, who was gifted Usyk’s IBF version of his otherwise undisputed collection of belts by boxing politics last year, brings a new confidence and enduring power to the ring. He is also 11 years younger than Usyk and has improved greatly since the two men met in the ring for the first time in August 2023.Dubois looked formidable in his most recent fight 10 months ago when hebattered Anthony Joshuawith bludgeoning force and dropped him four times to the canvas before the referee rescued his more famous victim. So it would not be a complete shock if Dubois’ destructive force stopped an ageing Usyk in his tracks. But it would still be a surprise – especially asUsyk fights with such fervour on behalf of Ukraineduring an unremitting war against the Russian onslaught.View image in fullscreenOleksandr Usyk defeated Daniel Dubois in the ninth round in August 2023.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersThe hope, which has grown markedly amongst Dubois and his backers in recent months,centres on the one punchwith which he dropped Usyk in the fifth round of that first bout almost two years ago. Dubois unleashed a hard right hand that landed on the beltline. The referee ruled it an illegal blow and Usyk slumped to the canvas and took full advantage as he recovered for more than four minutes. But perhaps the Ukrainian would have risen to his feet before the count of eight had the referee seen it as the legitimate punch which Dubois, his corner and many neutral observers appeared to witness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDubois now believes he can capitalise and deliver punches of similar ferocity to both the head and body. Usyk, he insists, will crumple and relinquish his WBA, WBC and WBO titles. But if so much store is being placed in a single blow it seems right to pay equal attention to the rest of that first bout in Poland. Usyk, having dominated the early rounds, soon reclaimed his supremacy as he pummelled Dubois into a ninth-round submission. At that stage Usyk was far in front on all three scorecards – with two judges having him seven points ahead while the third saw a five-point difference.Usyk had simply been too intelligent, skilful and tough. He was obviously the superior fighter and it seems a stretch to imagine that so much will have changed in the intervening 23 months to allow Dubois to prevail. “Daniel has got better and now he has a championship belt,” Usyk acknowledged. “But I haven’t been staying in one place either. I’ve been growing too.”It should be remembered that Uysk endured two hard world title fights against Tyson Fury last year. Such ring wars drain even great fighters but Usyk’s sheer ringcraft, and savvy, mean that he is almost always better in rematches. He has a boxing brain like a computer and, having faced Dubois before, he will be attuned even more sharply to the dangers. Dubois, urged on by his trainer Don Charles who favours an aggressive, come-forward style, will seek to impose his size and power and hasten the end of Usyk’s fading days in the ring.But the suspicion remains that the Ukrainian master still has enough wizardry to repel the threat and win a clear decision. Usyk’s long and unbeaten career will reach a shuddering conclusion, eventually, but it’s unlikely to be against Dubois on a fevered night at Wembley.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsykfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I hope this will allow the NFLPA to maintain its focus on its player members ahead of the upcoming season.”Howell has come under scrutiny since ESPN reported he has maintained a part-time consulting job with the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that holds league approval to seek minority ownership in NFL franchises.That followed the revelation that the NFLPA and the league had a confidentiality agreement to keep quiet an arbitrator’s ruling about possible collusion by owners over quarterback salaries.The latest issue wasan ESPN reportThursday that revealed two player representatives who voted for Howell were not aware that he was sued in 2011 for sexual discrimination and retaliation while he was a senior executive at Booz Allen.“I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish at the NFLPA over the past two years,” Howell said. “I will be rooting for the players from the sidelines as loud as ever, and I know the NFLPA will continue to ensure that players remain firmly at the center of football’s future.”Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

You never know when it’s your last day on the Tour.“I will say it honestly. The team pays you to win, and there’s a big team behind me that supports me and that works every single day of their career to come to the Tour, to win the Tour. If there is an opportunity, you go for it. You can’t say no to a stage in the Tour.“When I finish my career, I will probably not speak to 99% of the peloton. I will focus on my close friends and family. You win and people start to already think about the next win, or you’re winning too much. You need to enjoy the moment, what you’re sacrificing for, and not care too much about what everybody else thinks.”The Slovenian has now opened a yawning divide between himself and the rest of the peloton thanks to back-to-back summit finishes.At Hautacamhe took two minutes and 10 seconds out of Vingegaard in 12km; as he crossed the line at the Pyrenean altiport, he had further distanced the Dane and now leads overall by four minutes and seven seconds. With Vingegaard three minutes ahead of the third-placed Remco Evenepoel, only six riders are now within 10 minutes of Pogacar.View image in fullscreenPogacar reacts as he crosses the finish line.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters“I didn’t have the legs I wanted,” a drained Evenepoel said. “Within a few minutes of starting, I just felt empty. I’m pretty disappointed.”Scotland’s Oscar Onley remains stubbornly in contention for a high finish, climbing up to fifth place, after finishing seventh on the stage. “I was suffering a bit after yesterday,” Onley said, “but we’re all suffering. With the steep runway at the end, you really had to hold back a bit. It wasn’t an easy time trial to manage.”With Pogacar almost out of sight, the real battle now may be for the podium. Primoz Roglic, who began the Tour saying his main interest was in getting to Paris and drinking champagne, is now progressing steadily up the overall standings. The 35-year-old, famously toppled by Pogacarin the 2020 Tour’s final time trialwhen on the verge of overall victory, set the best time on the 10.9km test until first Vingegaard, and then inevitably, Pogacar, surpassed him.Meanwhile, the French sprinter Bryan Coquard, the rider who collided with Jasper Philipsen on stage three and caused the Belgian sprinter to crash out of the race, has himself decided to quit the Tour after breaking bones in his right hand while trying to take his food bag from a team helper during Thursday’s stage to Hautacam.View image in fullscreenPrimoz Roglic is urged on during the stage.Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty ImagesCoquard rode the time trial with his right hand heavily strapped and then stepped off the bike to leave the race and head home for surgery. “I wanted to ride the time trial today, but for the sake of safety, I can’t start tomorrow,” he said. “I can’t brake with my right hand, which isn’t an issue racing alone in an uphill time trial, but in the peloton, that’s obviously dangerous.”With Pogacar in such imperious form, the race organisation remains keen to emphasise that all is still to play for. The truth is that Vingegaard will need much more of a spring in his step if he is to stay even within touching distance of his rival.Pogacarwon the 2024 Giro d’Italiaby just under 10 minutes and also took six stages. The time trials may be done with, but with four summit finishes still to come, this could become the Slovenian’s most emphatic Grand Tour victory to date.Meanwhile, Roglic is not the only one already thinking of Paris. The dancers from the Moulin Rouge have announced that they will take to the street and dance the can-can as the peloton passes through Montmartre on the final stage. Maybe Roglic will jump off, raise a flute and join in.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceTadej PogacarCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

It took until the 66th minute for the tournament favourites to find a way through, Athenea del Castillo and Clàudia Pina each striking in a five-minute, second-half spell to crush gentle rumblings of a possible upset.Are Spain pacing themselves or sleepwalking to a deafening alarm call?Read more“We managed to secure a spot in the semi finals, the team made history, these players made history,” said their manager, Montse Tomé.It had been a game of hope, Mariona Caldentey’s missed penalty and Livia Peng’s save from an Alèxia Putellas’s spot-kick sandwiching the goals that contributed to the feeling that something special might be on the cards.Special did not come, but so much more has in these two weeks. There is the embracing of a team and a tournament and then there is the embracing of women’s football as a whole, a collective opening up to the historic injustice of underfunding and a lack of support. Both have taken place in Switzerland. This is a country that has opened its eyes, and its hearts, to the battling “Nati” who have taken them on an emotional journey. The last-gasp equaliser against Finland to set up a quarter-final with the world champions was a moment of euphoric celebration that could be heard echoing from homes and bars up and down the country and inspired a huge fan walk of 25,000 to the Stadion Wankdorf.But this is also a country that wants more, that wants to back these women whose faces adorn all sorts of adverts and are emblazoned across the backs of shirts in greater and greater numbers every day. “Here to stay,” read one small banner in the red block behind the Swiss goal. “This is just the beginning,” read another.“We lost the game but we’ve won a positive attitude for women’s football,” said their manager, Pia Sundhage. “I’m very, very proud of Switzerland, if you look at the people coming to the games it’s been phenomenal, very very emotional, and they didn’t leave, they stayed.”It is the type of reaction and level of support Spain long for, their World Cup success celebrated back home in the immediate aftermath but failing to trigger a step-change in the cultural fabric of the country and its impact on attitudes towards women’s football. There was a nod to their struggles above the small section of Spanish fans, a banner reading: “Estamos con Jenni H” (“We are with Jenni Hermoso”) next to another which said: “Abuchea el sexismo! #seacabo” (“Down with sexism #itsover”), the legacy of the kiss forced on forward Hermoso by the then Spanish football federation president, Luis Rubiales, during the World Cup trophy presentation.View image in fullscreenMariona Caldentey can’t bear to look after missing a penalty inside the first 10 minutes for Spain.Photograph: Daniela Porcelli/Getty ImagesThe task in Berne was a big one for the hosts, the biggest perhaps. Spain had earned three large wins over the Swiss in 2023, scoring 17 and conceding twice, in the World Cup and then two Nations League games. Pia Sundhage’s side set up in a back five, with the Arsenal defensive midfielder Wälti between the centre-backs as an extra protection.Few had given Switzerland any chance of being able to compete with Tomé’s passing dynamos and they should have been behind in the eighth minute, Nadine Riesen’s late challenge on Mariona Caldentey conceding a penalty, but the Arsenal forward placed her spot-kick wide of the upright. It was the stroke of luck that the Swiss needed, the cow bells and drums drowned out by the thunder roll from the crowd as the ball thumped the hoarding.Wälti was magnificent for the Swiss, tirelessly shifting between the midfield and defence as they chased and harried and frustrated their opponents. That they reached half-time with the game goalless was a remarkable achievement. Irene Paredes’s header off the outside of the post shortly before the break was the closest the favourites would go.Athenea del Castillo profileThe crowd acting as the 12th man is a cliche, but in the cauldron of red, as every clearance, tackle, turnover, foul, even pass, received a deafening roar, it was hard not to feel that it was fuelling the players in white and adding to the frustrations of the Spanish. Spain were patient though, poking away at the wall of white, which they breached twice in the space of five minutes. “I was calm, I was confident, sometimes you have to fight,” said Aitana Bonmatí. It required a moment of magic from the two-time Ballon d’Or winner to set up Del Castillo. The second was a stunner too. Pina clipped the ball from the feet of Wälti, who was convinced she was fouled and paused to protest, and then fired into the top corner from 20 yards.There was drama late on, as Peng saved from Putellas after Beney conceded a penalty for a challenge on Del Castillo and Noelle Maritz was shown a red card in injury time, but it mattered little.Spain march into the semi-finals, ready to face the winner of Saturday’s quarter-final between Germany and France.“We accomplished our goal and now we have to keep improving,” said Tomé. Switzerland, though, march into an exciting future. “Football is important for society and women’s football is important for society,” said Sundhage. “Women’s football has changed Switzerland a little bit.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamSwitzerland women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In truth she had been fortunate to see 70 minutes ofthis quarter-final, and for all the nightmarish apparitions of the first half perhaps the last few minutes were the loneliest of all. Marooned at the back, 30 yards behind the rest of the team while England forced set pieces and pushed for a route back into the game: a last line of defence that had proved to be very little defence at all.Esme Morgan would replace her to add some extra heft and the entire system wouldneed to be rejiggedto a back three. Carter would watch the excruciating last hour from a seated position, reflecting bleakly on the sort of performance that scars international careers, perhaps even defines them. “You’re feeling nothing and everything at the same time,” she said afterwards. “It’s a turbulent experience. I feel like it’s the first time I’ve smiled since the game.”The first thing to be said is that it wasn’t entirely Carter’s fault. England’s anomie in the first hour was above all a collective failing, a mass panic that seemed to infect the entire team like a bad illness. Keira Walsh also gave the ball away for Sweden’s first goal, Alex Greenwood was bypassed too easily for the second, and Hannah Hampton was having an exceptionally fraught game before spectacularly redeeming herself later.‘A massive contribution’: Wiegman heaps praise on England hero HamptonRead moreAcute problems at the back are often the symptom of more chronic issues further up the pitch. And England’s sketchy press, their utter inability to gain a foothold in midfield and their unfortunate habit of colliding with the referee presented Sweden with a sitting target on their favoured right flank. Even so, right from the opening minute England’s defence gave the impression that they might be in for a long night.Carter’s first act on the ball was to receive a rushed pass from Leah Williamson and punt it straight out of play while trying to funnel it on to Greenwood. Her second act was to give the ball away on the edge of her area. Her third was to pluck the ball defiantly out of the net and punt it back towards the centre circle while her shellshocked teammates surveyed the wreckage around her.In a way, this encapsulated the confusion that seemed to overcome England after their early setback: the complete absence of a unifying strategy for getting back into the game, 11 players in 11 entirely separate headspaces. Do you try and weather the storm, string a few passes together for confidence, sit a little deeper to squeeze the spaces in behind? Or do you get stuck in, recommit to the original gameplan, try to pile the pressure back on Sweden.Everyone seemed to have a different answer to this question. While Georgia Stanway and Lauren James went hunting for the ball, and Lucy Bronze went roaming up the right to try and stretch the play, Greenwood dropped a few yards for security and Walsh retreated to the comfort of the back line. The result was space opening up all over the pitch, severed connections and massive underloads that again left Carter isolated against the marauding Stina Blackstenius for the second goal.And whether in the centre or at left-back, Carter is always a defender who has thrived on those connections, who needs clarity and support, and whose game – based on poise and superior reading rather than pace, height or brute strength – seems to suffer disproportionately when those elements are missing.View image in fullscreenJohanna Rytting Kaneryd and Alex Greenwood battle for the ball in their quarter-final.Photograph: Harry Langer/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockWhen she arrived at Gotham FC last summer she started working with their coach Juan Carlos Amorós, who told her that she would need to rewire her defensive mindset completely. “You’ve shown what you can do on the ball, but you don’t do it consistently enough,” he said. What he wanted, in essence, was for Carter to start concentrating on the process instead of worrying about outcomes.“My weakness has always been my technical ability, my consistency in that,” Carter told Sam Mewis on the Women’s Game Podcast in May. “And now I’ve never been so out of my comfort zone, playing for a team where you always have to play forward, be brave. He [Amorós] would rather me lose the ball 10 times trying to play forward, trying to create something, than just going back to the keeper or going long.” For Carter, reared on the tough love of Emma Hayes at Chelsea, this was the polar opposite of what she had always been taught.“At Chelsea we were a very direct team – successful with it, but we weren’t a possession team at all,” she told Mewis. “Coaches have told me they want me to be better on the ball. But when we played direct it kind of went out the window a little bit, so … I didn’t need to bethatgood.” But the mindset of playing centre-half for England in a tournament knockout is of an entirely different order to an evening runout at Utah Royals in 35C heat. Here it really does matter if you lose the ball 10 times in a row trying to play forward. Here the outcome matters infinitely more than the process. And perhaps Carter’s skittish inconsistency suggests a player trapped between two contradictory instincts, while also being switched between two very different positions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Given the way Blackstenius and Delphine Cascarino got the better of Carter, Cristiana Girelli and Sofia Cantore would certainly relish a chance to run at her in Tuesday’s semi-final. Morgan and Niamh Charles impressed when they were introduced from the bench, and the smart money is on at least one of them coming in for the Italy game.England 2-2 Sweden (Eng won 3-2 on penalties): Euro 2025 player ratingsRead moreThe potential ankle injury to Williamson complicates matters, particularly while Wiegman bafflingly continues to see Maya Le Tissier as little more than a training mannequin. If Williamson cannot start, then Wiegman may opt for the safety of a back three with Charles on the left, Morgan and Greenwood in the centre and a reprieved Carter given one more chance alongside them in her preferred system.Recently Rachel Daly was reminiscing about the Euro 2022 quarter-final win over Spain, a game she described as “the worst of her life”. Given a torrid evening at left-back, put on her backside by Athenea del Castillo, at breakfast the next morning Daly was still reeling from the experience, questioning everything, wondering whether she was really cut out for the job. Millie Bright’s response was curt. “Let it go,” she said. Daly kept her place, and two games later was a European champion.Point being: these experiences do not have to define you. Social media, where Carter was being gleefully scapegoated on Friday morning, will always be a place of absolutes and extremes, of gods and demons. But for all her current difficulties, she is a multiple league winner, a continental champion for club and country, a World Cup finalist and above all a far better player than she showed on Thursday night. Whether she gets another chance to prove it, of course, is another matter.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She told the Guardian she could scarcely watch the penalties.From penalty taker to physio: Lucy Bronze is England’s Swiss army knifeRead more“I’ve lost the charger for my Fitbit but if it had been on, I think my heart rate would have been through the roof,” she said. “I just kept hiding behind the people in front of me because I could not look. I was so nervous because, to fight back like that and then to have lost on penalties would have been so much more painful, after they’d done so much.“I didn’t even realise we’d won when it was over, because there had been so many missed penalties, so I didn’t realise until all the players ran over and jumped on Hannah [Hampton, the goalkeeper]. Then everyone was jumping on top of each other and it was pure joy. But I was crying at the same time because I was so happy. I could not believe that they had done it. I was so proud.”Another fan cheering on the Lionesses was Nathalie Durgnat, who was born and raised in Switzerland but supports Arsenal and England. Durgnat joined in with England’s fan walk to the stadium, during which the supporter favourites such as Neil Diamond’s Sweet Caroline were sung through the streets of Zurich. “It was really something,” she said. “I’ve been to a lot of football matches in my life because I’m over 40, but I have rarely experienced such drama. There was everything in that game. At first, everyone was kind of in disbelief, because Sweden were really good. Then, when England tied it to make it 2-2 with two goals in two minutes, it was absolute madness in the stands.“I have no words for what happened in the penalty shootout. I was so tense and so nervous, going through the rollercoaster of emotions. But I’m glad I was there. The resilience, the belief in themselves and the way they never give up, no matter what, feels very English to me.”England, the defending champions, will now meet Italy in Geneva on Tuesday for a place in the final. Holden-Morris, who has been following the Lionesses since the 2019 World Cup, said: “They’ve showed that champions, even when they don’t have their best day, can find a way to win. I’m hopeful we can get to a final and win it. If we can come back from last night’s situation, we can do anything.”The late-night drama attracted a peak audience of 7.4 million viewers on BBC One, the highest figures of Euro 2025 so far. That represented a 65% audience share and there were also nearly 3m online streams of the match across BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He revealed that Dejan Kulusevski, who underwent knee surgery on 14 May, would not be available for the start of the season.Noni Madueke will be unfazed by new Arsenal challenge and fans’ scepticismRead moreFrank was typically friendly, if a little nervous; the packed media auditorium was a far cry from what he was used to during his seven years at his previous club, Brentford. He appeared determined to keep his cards close to his chest, to sidestep the tricky questions but his wish to live in the moment and not look too far ahead did little to convince on Son.The 33-year-old Son, who ledSpurs to Europa League glory last season– his first silverware in 10 years at the club – has 12 months on his contract. There has been no indication that Son is ready to agree to fresh terms and the chair, Daniel Levy, would surely hate to lose him as a free agent.“Good question,” Frank said, when pressed on whether Son would remain captain. “I haven’t decided anything on that. I have a long list of bullet points I need to get through and I take them in the right order.”Frank said that Son would captain the team for one half of the Reading game, with Cristian Romero, one of the vice-captains from last season, wearing the armband for the other half. Romero has been tracked by Atlético Madrid, although there are doubts as to whether the Spanish club would be able to make a compelling offer for him, which would need to be at least £60m.Frank was asked whether Son had earned the right to decide his own future. “It’s always tricky, situations like that … if that happens,” Frank said. “Right now I have a player that is fully committed and training well and will play tomorrow. If a player has been at a club a long time, then there will always be a decision for the club to take.View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min celebrates with the Europa League trophy, the first silverware he has won in his 10 years at Tottenham.Photograph: Luis Tejido/EPA“Because there is something in it if someone wants to leave at a certain stage … then there can be something there. But the club will always decide in the end. First and foremost, he’s here now. I’m not worried too much about it. Let’s take that five or six weeks down the line. That will probably [be a question] I get the following week, so I’ll practise my answers. Right now, he’s here.”Frank fell back on more than one occasion on three buzz words: he wants his team to be brave, aggressive and attacking. And while he agreed with Levy’s assertion that the ambition had to be to win the Premier League and Champions League, Frank made clear that the most pressing goal was to be competitive in all four competitions – including the Champions League, to which Spurs have won a return.“What are the odds for us winning the Premier League this season?” he said. “I think we’re probably not the favourites. There are probably three teams at least ahead of us but we will do what we can to build a strong and competitive team.“The first aim is that we need to be able to compete in all four tournaments and do it on a consistent level. I think 2019 was the last season where the club managed to compete in more than one competition. If we can compete, there’s maybe a chance that you can hopefully end top. But we need to be able to build to compete first.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he said: “Hopefully the way we train, building layers, building robustness into the players, is going to be a big part and making the players more available through the season. Hopefully we can make good decisions, with feeling, with knowledge, with numbers, [about] when to rotate and when to rest. It’s a big thing as well.”Frank joked he made his “first rookie mistake” when he mentioned Arsenal and their Invincible season – “the team that we can’t mention [at this club]”. He did so in the context of an answer in which he said it was “100% sure” Spurs would lose league matches because virtually everybody did – apart from you know who. It was part of his overall expectation management sweep.Frank also got a few smiles when he considered how Spurs had sacked five managers in the time that he spent at Brentford. “Only five?” he said. “I like to challenge myself. I have the privilege that I have never been sacked before. That is one of the reasons why I took the job. I get a little bit more risk in my daily life.”The bottom line is that Frank will be under pressure, partly because he is succeeding a trophy-winning manager, who some of the fans did not want to see go; partly because of the talent in the squad, which will be supplemented during the transfer window. Frank made no comment on the ongoing pursuit of the £60m-rated Nottingham Forest midfielder, Morgan Gibbs-White.“It’s the easy part now – the honeymoon,” Frank said. “Everyone is happy, the sun is shining, we haven’t played a game yet. I think the honeymoon is five, six weeks of pre-season. Then it’s reality, no matter if we won [a trophy] last season or not. So, five, six weeks where you can do a lot of good stuff and then it’s reality. I look forward to that.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankHeung-min SonnewsShareReuse this content"

Even I’m telling him: ‘You need one rest day, a couple of days.’ But Noni is so driven. He understands the importance of working hard – the more you put in, the more you get out. The reality is that he wants to do more.”Madueke was spotted letting his hair down with Jadon Sancho at the Wireless festival in north London’s Finsbury Park last weekend, which was understandable given the week he had. Having been used sparingly by Enzo Maresca during Chelsea’s first five games at the Club World Cup, the 23-year-old flew back from the US last Friday, before the final, after an agreement was struck for him to become the sixth player Mikel Arteta has signed from Stamford Bridge since the Spaniard became the Arsenal manager in late 2019. Kepa Arrizabalaga trod the same pathat the start of this month.Of the previous four arrivals fromChelsea, perhaps only Kai Havertz can be described as having been a success. Willian, Jorginho and Raheem Sterling – who endured a disappointing loan spell last season – largely failed to impress. That may explain the opprobrium from some Arsenal fans that greeted news of Madueke’s impending switch. Supporters even launched a petition entitled #NOTOMADUEKE, though that had struggled past the 5,000 mark by the time the transfer was confirmed on Friday. Madueke, who has signed a five-year contract, is understood to have cost £48.5m plus up to £3.5m in bonuses.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke played in Chelsea’s Club World Cup semi-final against Fluminense but was back in England ready to join Arsenal before the final.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesAccording to Isaksson-Hurst, who first met Madueke when the player had just broken into PSV’s first team as a teenager, the noise is unlikely to have an impact on someone he describes as a “mentality monster”.“Noni is very single-minded – he knows his quality,” he says. “Anyone who’s involved in football and development particularly knows what a talent he is. He’s still a young player and his potential is limitless. He’s one of the most exciting young attacking wide players in Europe. I don’t think it bothers him. [Criticism] is part and parcel of the sport, unfortunately – it’s water off a duck’s back.”The speed that Madueke fell out of favour at Stamford Bridge is understood to have surprised many in his camp, especially after he made his England debut last year. He scored the first senior hat-trick of his careeragainst Wolves in Augustbut managed only another four goals in the Premier League from a further 26 starts.With the signings Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens, Estêvão and João Pedro adding to Maresca’s attacking options, Madueke sensed his opportunities would be limited and was understood to have been keen to join Arsenal, where Arteta is hoping he will provide much-needed cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and push Gabriel Martinelli to start on the left. “It’s difficult – he wants to play like any young player,” says Isaksson-Hurst. “He needs to go somewhere where he’s appreciated and he’s playing regularly.”Joining a new London club will be nothing new for Madueke. He was spotted by Crystal Palace when he was nine and travelled across the capital from the family home in Barnet for three years. His father, Ify, who also acts as his agent and invested in a pedigree race horse called Princess Chizara that competed at Ascot in 2023, is said to have been relieved when Tottenham snapped up Madueke in 2014 given the shorter journey that also allowed his son to attend the prestigious St Columba’s college private school in St Albans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sancho had swapped Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund the previous summer.“That’s a big, bold move going abroad when you’re that age,” says Isaksson-Hurst. “Noni went there because he knew that like a lot of the young guys who go abroad now, they have more chances of playing first-team football. And he had several opportunities to come back earlier [than when he joined Chelsea in January 2023], but he just wanted to stay because he wanted to make sure he was playing.

A fee of £65m will be paid up front and a further £6m could follow in add-ons.The Cameroonian, who scored 20Premier Leaguegoals last season, has been a key target for Ruben Amorim. United first made an offer for Mbeumo six weeks ago and had a number of bids rejected. Mbeumo made clear he wanted to move to Old Trafford despite interest at Tottenham from his former head coach Thomas Frank, and personal terms are not thought to be an issue.Mbeumo is in line to become United’s third signing of the summer after the Brazilian forwardMatheus Cunha, who cost £62.5m from Wolves, and the Paraguayan full-back Diego León. Mbeumo is likely to be used by Amorim in one of the two No 10 spots in a 3-4-3 formation. United are also eager to sign a striker and maintain an interest in Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Mbeumo is due to join United’s tour to the United States, which starts next week, allowing time for the 25-year-old to integrate and understand Amorim’s demands and style.The fee is an impressive profit forBrentford, who signed Mbeumo from Troyes in 2019 for £5.8m. He spent two seasons in the Championship before winning promotion and scoring 42 goals in 136 Premier League appearances.Considering the summer’s outlays, United will want to secure fees for five players who are not part of Amorim’s plans.

These were just some of the headlines that emerged in the aftermath of Germany’sbruising 4-1 defeatat the hands of Sweden in their final Group C match.In just a matter of days, the optimism surrounding Germany’s chances has seemingly dissipated. Despite qualifying for the quarter-finals with a game to spare, Christian Wück’s side have looked far from cohesive and defensively frail. They were also exposed by a Sweden attack that understood how to exploit their weaknesses. Carlotta Wamser’s red card was certainly a factor but there are long-standing structural issues that should be a cause for concern with an in-form France to come on Saturday in Basel.The loss to Sweden was the heaviest defeat Germany have suffered at a European Championship. As a result, the manager has found himself on the end of mounting criticism back home. Sportschau.de highlighted Wück’s failure to react to “the emerging disaster” while Bild pointed to the lack of world-class options in the squad. “The bitter truth is: we have postponed development and need to act urgently!” Robert Schreier wrote.Quick GuideFrance v Germany: last three meetingsShowGermany 2-1 France, 27 July 2022, Milton Keynes“I can’t put it into words … we threw everything in,” said the Germany captain, Alexandra Popp, after powering her side into the Euro 2022 final. Her double in Milton Keynes ended France’s run and continued her streak of scoring in every game she played in the tournament. Kadidiatou Diani led France’s response, her shot rebounding off the post and in off the goalkeeper Merle Frohms. A stunning save from Pauline Peyraud-Magnin kept France in it, and the defending was admirable, but Popp’s unstoppable header proved the difference.Germany 2-1 France, 7 October 2022, DresdenGermany kicked off their World Cup preparations with a show of strength in Dresden. Before kick-off, players huddled around Giulia Gwinn’s shirt - a nod to their injured teammate – and channelled that spirit into a dominant display. Popp rose for her 60th international goal, then slid in a second. France pulled one back from the spot, but Germany’s defence held firm. Surrounded by flags and home support, they looked sharp, united and ready.France 2-1 Germany, 23 February 2024, LyonFrance ended a five-year drought against Germany in front of a record 30,000 crowd in Lyon, edging a fierce Nations League semi-final. Diani opened with a thunderous strike from the edge of the box, before Sakina Karchaoui added a second from the spot. Germany pulled one back through Gwinn’s penalty, with Popp driving them forward, but France held on for a long-overdue win.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since he took over the reins after their bronze medal-winning run at Paris 2024, Wück has instilled a strong offensive style of play compared to his predecessor Horst Hrubesch. It has produced notable wins – the4-3 victoryover England at Wembley is just one example – while the 26 goals scored in their Nations League campaign caught the eye.So far this tournament, however, the German attack is yet to reach its devastating best even though Wück has a wealth of creative players to call on. There have been glimpses of their brilliance. Jule Brand’s opener against Sweden was an illustration of the pace and directness this side is built on, with her and Klara Bühl’s ability to stretch defences on show. Along with the instinctive goalscoring of Lea Schüller, they will be eyeing up the relatively young French central defensive partnership, particularly if Griedge Mbock remains absent.View image in fullscreenGermany were handed a heavy defeat by Sweden in Group C’s final match.Photograph: Francesco Farina/SPP/ShutterstockThe biggest concern for Germany before the meeting with their old rivals will be how easily they can be broken down while there are also concerns around the form of the goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger. Polandgave them a scarein the opener but lacked end product.It was a different story against Sweden. Even before the sending-off, their problems were exposed for the world to see, particularly for Stina Blackstenius’s equaliser. With the left-back Sarai Linder caught high and the rest of the defensive unit following the ball in the initial phase, the striker had acres of grass to break into before punishing them with the finish.France’s ability in wide areas is one of their most potent weapons. With two goals and two assists, Delphine Cascarino has been a standout success and many will remember what she did to England’s left sidein the opener. Down the other wing, Sandy Baltimore will pounce on any weakness.Germany’s problems in these areas are compounded by the loss of their right-back and captain, Giulia Gwinn, to a knee injury and now the suspension of her back-up Wamser. It leaves Wück forced to move the pieces on the chessboard, shifting Linder out to the right with Franziska Kett the most likely option to come in on the other side. If so, it will be a huge ask of a 20-year-old who made just seven appearances in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The high-profile dropping of the experienced left-back Felicitas Rauch – which she only discovered on social media – was a sign that all might not be completely well in the camp. The 33-year-old defender Sara Doorsun was told she would only be on the waiting list for the tournament and promptly retired.His apparent refusal to address the issues has added to the increased concern. While he shifted to three at the back in the second half against Sweden, that seemed more down to circumstances forcing his hand. “It would be wrong if we would say we only want to react and destroy,” he said afterwards. “I have the wrong players [for that]. It isn’t in the nature of the team to stand in the back [park the bus] and try to keep a clean sheet or a draw and not try anything up front”.Nevertheless, given his short time in the job, there is a feeling that he will survive whatever happens. The former goalkeeper and current ARD pundit Almuth Schult said: “I don’t think it’s going to be close for him yet”, in terms of his job being on the line. There is no doubt, however, that should they lose, the pressure will continue to escalate given the high expectations of a nation that has won this competition eight times.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballFrance women's football teamGermany women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In January 1998, under-10 pair Mickleover Lightning Blue Sox and Chellaston Boys faced off in the Derby Community Cup. After the regular game finished 1-1, a total of 56 penalties failed to break the deadlock, with referee Peter Shieff even moving the spot two yards closer and offering a coin toss to decide the result (which the sides declined). Despite saving 31 consecutive spot-kicks in the sudden-death decider, Chellaston Boys’ goalkeeper Ben Hodder ended up on the losing side as Blue Sox romped home 2-1, after a grand total of 66 kicks had been taken, a world record verified by David Barber, the FA’s official statistician. A thought, then, for the parents that day 27 years ago, stood on the sidelines, outwardly encouraging their youngsters while internally being tortured and scorched with the fires of a thousand flamethrowers.A similar feeling engulfed England and Sweden on Thursday night: after an abysmal first half left them 2-0 down, the Lionesses mounted a late comeback for the ages to force extra-time and penalties. Twice in the subsequent shootout Sweden had kicks to win the game but twice they came up short, withEngland somehow prevailing 3-2. Before we properly get into the drama – and oh, we will – it should be said that the actual game was as dramatic as it was full of quality. Sweden’s front two of Kosovare Asllani and Stina Blackstenius were outstanding and took their goals expertly. England’s Lauren James was moving like Zizou in the No 10 role – Football Daily hasn’t seena roulette that devastatingsince our last trip to Las Vegas. Chloe Kelly’s wingplay was game-changing, providing both assists as England clawed their way back into the game.Unfortunately the same could not be said for the shootout, as nerves, fatigue and excellent goalkeeping from both England’s Hannah Hampton and Sweden’s Jennifer Falk ensured that just five of the 14 penalties found the net. Ultimately, it was the brilliant and bloodied Hampton, along with Lucy Bronze – who scored England’s first goal, soldiered on with knack through extra time and smashed home the decisive penalty – who were England’s heroes. “Lucy Bronze is just one of a kind, I have never, ever seen this before in my life,”roared England manager Sarina Wiegmanafterwards. “What defines her is that resilience, that fight. I think the only way to get her off the pitch is in a wheelchair.”Fair play to England then, who – against all odds – found a way to win, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. As for those penalties, plenty of elite performers have failed to convert at major tournaments, from Roberto Baggio to Bukayo Saka to Diana Ross, and there is plenty of time now to practise before Tuesday’s semi-final against Italy. Leah Williamson succinctly summed up how most were feeling as the dust settled on England’s win, in a quote that could easily have also come from a Derbyshire-based parent in 1998: “That was awful to watch at the end. [Penalties] are the easiest and the hardest thing in the world.” Amen to that.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Sarah Rendell from 8pm BST for MBM coverage of Spain 0-0 Switzerland (aet; 4-2 on pens) in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals.QUOTE OF THE DAYThere is such a feeling of sadness and disbelief around this awful tragedy that we wanted to make this tribute of our own as soon as we could.

She has scored three goals in Zambia’s Wafcon campaign, with the first coming 58 seconds into the tournament’s opening game, against hosts Morocco. Banda, who doubles as the Copper Queens captain and attacking pivot, alongside the equally lethal Racheal Kundananji, can finally breathe a huge sigh of relief.“It really means a lot for me to be here and to be a part of the team. And being with the team. We have a good feeling,” the reigning African women’s player of the year tells the Guardian at the Larbi Zaouli stadium, where Zambia will face Nigeria’s Super Falcons, the nine-time African champions, for a place in the semi-finals on Friday.Wafcon offers spectacular songs and goals – but where is the next generation?Read more“It’s good to have a [personal] title, being the African Player of the Year,” the 25-year-old says. “But my main motivation is to keep working so hard to get more titles for myself and especially for my teammates. Without them, I will not have these titles. Everything comes from their support and encouragement. Putting on this [national team] shirt, putting on this [Zambia] badge, means everything to me … I need to show people why I am here.”Banda’s sterling form at the Wafcon, however, has not enabled the striker to completely drop her guard and express true feelings about how painful it has been to be accused of being a man in a woman’s game.After her selection as the 2024 BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year, JK Rowling, the renowned author, described the award to Banda, in a tweet, as spitting “directly in women’s faces”. There were reports that she had failed gender eligibility tests, prompting her withdrawal from the 2018 and 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. But the Confederation of African Football have said she did not take a sex eligibility test and was withdrawn by the Football Association of Zambia.Banda says: “I don’t think I would say much [about these remarks] because, at the end of the day, it’s football that we are playing,” she says. “Whatever comes, we are hoping for the best, for each African women’s team, to progress and to get that respect that you are talking about. It starts step by step.”The Nigeria defender Ashleigh Plumptre, who has the job of keeping Banda quiet during the quarter-final in Casablanca, praised the Copper Queens captain for weathering the storm of controversy while still displaying great form for NWSL side Orlando Pride.View image in fullscreenBarbra Banda in action for Zambia against Morocco at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations.Photograph: Shengolpixs/Alamy“Even though I do not know her personally, I have a lot of respect for her, because I can imagine that anybody going through that would find it very tough,” Plumptre says. “But she has been able to silence everybody as she continues to come out and perform, even with a smile on her face. You can see that her team and country gets behind her. The women’s football world got behind her as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their support keeps on pushing us.”During the pre-match press conference the Zambia coach, Nora Hauptle, was asked to describe the importance of Banda to her team. Hauptle turned towards Banda and said: “It is strange for me to talk to you about Barbra, who is sitting next to me … For me, Barbra is an absolutely top athlete but also a top human [being]. I was also curious when I came to Zambia, because I didn’t know who she was and I needed to get a feeling for her. She is one of the top athletes in the world, in terms of her behaviour, on and off the pitch … I have never seen Barbra display an arrogant attitude. She is very professional and she never complains.”Looking directly at Banda, Hauptle added: “I think you’re on course to win, one day, the Ballon d’Or.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

When she saw people trying to revive the occupant, she quickly led her two children away.Porto Sant’Elpidio’s mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said reports suggested Baumgartner could have suffered a sudden medical issue mid-air, and offered the town’s condolences over the death of “a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flights”.The Clube del Sole Le Mimose beachside resort where the crash occurred said in a statement that an employee who was “slightly injured” in the incident was in good condition. No guests were injured, and the pool has been reopened.View image in fullscreenFelix Baumgartner’s historic jump from the edge of space.Photograph: Red Bull Content Pool/Red Bull Stratos/ReutersBaumgartner, who was known as “Fearless Felix”, made headlines around the world in October 2012 when – wearing a specially made suit – hejumped from a balloon 38km (24 miles) above Earth, becoming the first skydiver to break the sound barrier.He made the historic jump over Roswell, New Mexico, reaching a peak speed of more than 1,343km/h, during a nine-minute descent on the 65th anniversary of the legendary American pilot Chuck Yeager’s flight shattering the sound barrier on 14 October 1947.Baumgartner never seemed to fear having to pay the ultimate price for his passion, stressing that it was all about doing your homework. “I hate it if someone calls me a thrillseeker or an adrenaline junkie because I am not. I like the whole planning,” he said before the 2012 stunt.8:03Felix Baumgartner makes record-breaking skydive from space – videoAt one point, Baumgartner went into a potentially dangerous flat spin while still supersonic, spinning for 13 seconds, his crew later said. “When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble,” he said after landing in the eastern New Mexico desert. “You do not think about of breaking records any more, you do not think of about gaining scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive.”Sporting a “born to fly” tattoo, Baumgartner, a former Austrian military parachutist, made thousands of daredevil jumps from planes, bridges, skyscrapers and landmarks around the world, including the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The self-styled “God of the Skies” started parachuting as a teenager before taking up the extreme sport of base jumping. Other feats included skydiving across the Channel and parachuting off the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Felix Baumgartner completes world’s highest skydive – coverage highlightsRead moreIn recent years, he had performed with the Flying Bulls as a helicopter stunt pilot in shows acrossEurope.In Austria he was also known for courting controversy with views that included expressing support for dictatorship as a system of government. Baumgartner was fined €1,500 (£1,300) after he punched a Greek truck driver in the face during a 2010 altercation that broke out in a traffic jam near Salzburg.Dividing his time between Switzerland and the US, Baumgartner eagerly joined the political fray and rubbed shoulders with Austrian far-right politicians. On social media, he mocked the fight against climate breakdown, actively speaking out against Green parties and LGBTQ+ rights.In 2016, he faced a storm of criticism when suggesting that Hungary’s anti-migration strongman prime minister,Viktor Orbán, should win a Nobel peace prize for protecting his country. Shortly before his death he sparked outrage again with a Facebook post in which he called out theSwiss footballer Alisha Lehmann for her calls to close the gender pay gap.Baumgartner argued “women don’t have the same audience ratings (as male players) so there’s less money”.His two childhood dreams were to be a skydiver and a helicopter pilot. “I always had the desire to be in the air,” Austrian media quoted Baumgartner as saying. “I climbed trees, I wanted to see the world from above.”Baumgartner said after his record-breaking jump in 2012 that travelling faster than sound was “hard to describe because you don’t feel it”. “Sometimes we have to get really high to see how small we are.”With Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsFelix BaumgartnerItalyAustriaEuropeExtreme sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He’d hate it if I said ‘no’,” said Sexton. “But in the last couple of years he’s come into his own as a 10 and he’s been able to manage a team because ultimately that’s the main job that he’s got, to manage all the guys around him. And then his brilliance will come out, once he’s into the game.“He has been relaxed as always, you wouldn’t know it’s the week of a Test match. You can see the work he does, though. You have a perception of him from the outside and I would have said the same, in terms of he is a relaxed guy and just takes things in his stride. But he does a lot of work behind the scenes, and he’s been really good this week in prepping the team. ­Hopefully he’ll continue his form.View image in fullscreenJohnny Sexton (left) shows Owen Farrell and Finn Russell how it’s done during training last week.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images“Like everyone, I think in the last couple of years he’s really matured as a player.

He’s got his team over the line and he’s won a few trophies and he’s ­carried that form into here. We always knew, ­particularly when you’re ­surrounding him with the players he’s got around him, he’s going to bring the best out of them and they’ll bring the best out of him.”Sexton also praised Russell’s defensive capabilities with ­opponents seemingly targeting him as a weak link to date. “Well, he’s been probably our best defender in the backline on this tour so far, I would say,” added Sexton. “You always knew that was in there, he’s a feisty guy out there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lowry was adamant he did not see his ball roll backwards in rough at the 12th hole during a practice swing, with officials determining he was in breach of the rules of golf.Lowry was informed of a potential issue on the 15th before detailed discussion after he closed out on the 18th green. Lowry’s 70 became a 72, leaving him 10 adrift of the tournament leader, Scottie Scheffler, with his score on the 12th changed from five to seven.‘Three is the magic number’: Tyrrell Hatton says pints of Guinness can fuel Open gloryRead more“I was in there with the rules official and wasn’t arguing my case but I’m disappointed that they don’t have more camera angles on it,” Lowry said. “The one zoomed in slow motion … they’re trying to tell me if it doesn’t move from the naked eye, if you don’t see it moving, it didn’t move. I told them I definitely was looking down towards the ball as I was taking that practice swing and I didn’t see it move.“But I had to take the penalty. I’m still not sure, to be honest, whether it was or not, but I had to take the penalty because I can’t have my name talked about or tossed around like that and I just get on with it. It’s obviously very disappointing. I felt like I played really, really well today. That’s hard to take.”Of the post-round scene, Lowry said: “I think they had their decision made. If the ball moved and I caused it to move and it moved, it’s a two-shot penalty. The last thing I want to do is sit there and argue and not take the penalty and then get slaughtered all over social media tonight for being a cheat. If the ball moved, I would have called it on myself. My head was definitely looking down at the ball and I didn’t see it moving. But I’m out there signing for a 72 there now.”In a statement, the R&A said Lowry’s own vision was not relevant and explained why the penalty was of two shots. “The rules require three things to be assessed in such situations: 1. Did the ball leave its original position and come to rest on another spot? 2. Was the ball’s movement to another spot discernible to the naked eye? 3. If the ball did come to rest on another spot and the movement was discernible to the naked eye, is it known or virtually certain that the player’s actions caused the ball to move?“Assessing whether the movement of the ball was visible to the naked eye in such a situation assumes the player being in a normal address position for the stroke.“In Shane Lowry’s situation, the movement of the ball to another spot, including the movement of the logo, was discernible to the naked eye. The naked eye test is satisfied whether or not the player was looking at the ball when it moved.“It was clear that the ball moved immediately after the player’s club touched foliage close to the ball during a practice swing and that the player’s actions caused the ball to move.“In these circumstances there is a one stroke penalty and the ball must be replaced. However, as the ball was played from the spot where it was moved to, the player played from a wrong place and incurs a total penalty of two strokes.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Then he revealed he was off for three pints of Guinness to relax and ready himself for the business end of this championship.It sounds like a distinctly old-school approach. But the fact Hatton was smiling as he talked, spoke volumes. He is clearly happy and relaxed. And, just as importantly, now appears far better at flushing out the anger that erupts when he falls short of perfection or gets a bad break. And that makes him a live danger in Portrush.The Open 2025: big names chase leaders in second round at Royal Portrush – liveRead moreHatton didn’t think he played particularly well on day two. Yet he still finished it with a 69 to leave himself on -5 and a late start on Saturday.Asked how he planned to unwind, he then broke into a smile. “Normally a Guinness is a pretty good way to start. Certainly this week anyway.”Would he be having a couple on Friday? “It would be rude not to,” he replied. “I think three is the magic number. Well, two to three, because you’re definitely not close to a hangover and you still feel like you’ve got – hopefully I’ve got a late tee time tomorrow so I can have a lay-in, as well.”Encouragingly, Hatton hit 28 out of 36 greens in regulation, a success rate that put him only behind Jon Rahm in the tournament late on Friday afternoon. Yet if a body language expert had spent the best part of five hours solely watching him, they might have expected he had suffered a shocker.After every miss he angrily talked to himself, or whacked his back with his putter in an act of flagellation. But by the time the next shot came around he was ready to go again.Were you trying to cheer yourself up with your angry words between shots, Hatton was asked. “Oh, no,” he replied. “It was pretty negative stuff.”Do you want to share it with us? “No, it’ll get me in trouble,” he replied.Sports psychologists like to tell athletes the importance of using the benefits of positive self-talk to enhance motivation and performance. Hatton, though, likes to berate himself instead. This, of course, is nothing new. And as Hatton admitted afterwards it is getting late for him to become a model of calm on the course.“I’m 33. I think that ship has sailed, to be honest,” he admitted. “I’m not going to change. It’s just how I am, how I play.“I’ve always felt like even though I can be losing my shit, I can get over the next shot and still have a clear mind of what I’m still trying to achieve,” he added.“Although from the outside it looks like I’m completely gone, in my own mind I still know where I’m at.”Is he now better at finding a balance, he was asked. “I don’t know,” came the reply. “I was still pretty vocal. Maybe I’m just having to do it away from the microphone.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Hatton clearly wanted more in warm and sedate conditions that were good for scoring.“It felt like a pretty frustrating day,” he said. “I don’t think there was anything that stood out that was amazing. I was generally solid. But I didn’t hit it particularly close on many holes. I missed the green with a lob wedge into 14, which after a perfect tee shot was frustrating, and obviously ended up making bogey. That was a bit of a shame.”Yet the experience of Oakmont, where in his 40th major he was deep in contention on the Sunday for the first time, has left him believing he will be able to handle the heightened pressures if they come at Portrush.“I really enjoyed that experience in Oakmont,” he said. “I know it wasn’t the ending I’d liked, but how I dealt with everything there and even out on the golf course with the most pressure, I still feel like I hit some really good golf shots.“I kind of left feeling proud and happy with how I dealt with everything. I’d love to have another chance to win.”Could he do it at Portrush? “Potentially,” he says. “Time will tell, I guess. But overall I am in a decent position. But it’s been a solid couple of days. I’m happy with a few parts of my game. I’d like to be in the fairway more this weekend and hitting it a bit closer. But I can’t really complain too much.”And with that he was off to drink Guinness, to unwind – and, perhaps, to allow himself to dream.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The atmosphere around the links grew stickier, and sweatier, every minute, and soon enough everyone was peeling off the layers of waterproof clothing they would be hurrying to get back on when the big black clouds broke open midway through the afternoon. It finally happened roundabout the very moment Bob MacIntyre was walking off the 18th green to sign for his 66, five under for the round, and the championship, and three shots off the clubhouse lead.MacIntyre is 28, but an old hand around these links. He knew he needed to make birdies while the sun was shining and picked up six of them altogether, with just the one bogey at the 16th where his tee shot caught on the hillside by the green.The Open 2025: big names chase leaders in second round at Royal Portrush – liveRead moreHe was playing withBryson DeChambeau, who had a hell of a time himself. DeChambeau followed the 78 he made on the opening day with a 65, which meant he had put together his worst and best rounds at the Open on successive days. He was as perplexed by it as everyone else. “That’s links golf for you,” he said. “I didn’t feel like I played any differently. Today just kind of went more my way.”DeChambeau’s got a scientific mind, he said earlier in the week that his ideal practice ground would be a 400m-long tunnel in which he can control the wind, and he clearly finds the inconsistencies of the links completely infuriating.“When it gets as chaotic as this, with the wind going every which way, you have to be a golfer that pivots on demand,” he said. Which isn’t much good when you’re a man who likes to hit 400 balls in a single session on the range by way of practice for a major. He explained he had spent a day preparing for a left-to-right wind on 18, only to find, once he got there, that it was blowing the other way altogether. He did well to make the cut, and better to control his temper. “I was proud of the way I fought back and persevered through some emotionally difficult moments, and to hold myself together and not get pissed and slam clubs and throw things and all that like I wanted to.”MacIntyre might just have told him to let himself go. He threw plenty of silent oaths himself, most of them after putts that stayed up.View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau looks rueful after a missed birdie putt on the 8th green.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThey made an odd pair. DeChambeau, just over 6ft, square-shouldered, shaped like a linebacker, looks like he’s been carved out of marble. In between shots, his body seems to fall like it’s been positioned for him by a sculptor. MacIntyre, on the other hand, is built like the bloke working the till in the chippie. If you didn’t know already, you’d burn through a whole lot of guesses before you got to what he does for his living. He’s good at it though, especially out here on the links where he whistles the ball in, out and around the wind with that slouchy, left-handed swing of his.MacIntyre grew up playing this sort of golf around Oban, just the other side of the North Channel. Royal Portrush is one of his favourite courses, he finished sixth on his major debut here back in 2019, and the kinship between the two countries means the locals here love him like one of their own. He and DeChambeau hadn’t much to do with each other till they were drawn together this week, but they seemed to enjoy each other’s company, maybe because they are such contrasting characters. MacIntyre plays by feel, DeChambeau by theory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was out there playing with a 10-year-old three wood which he dug out of the back of a cupboard at home. “I actually thought that club broke in 2020 at Abu Dhabi,” he said. “But I was searching for a three wood and I went back into the cupboard and looked at the antiques.” Turns out it still works. DeChambeau, on the other hand, revealed after his round that he is currently working on a top-secret project to reinvent the golf ball. He said that his model “will be here, worst-case scenario, in September”.“He’s obviously got his way of doing it,” said MacIntyre. “But to be honest, golf’s going closer to his approach now, with all the science and biomechanics, and everything. But yeah, I’ll just keep playing golf my way.”Justin Rose made up the trio. These days he plays the sort of brisk, businesslike golf of a man who knows he’s on the clock and wants to make the most of the hours he has. He’s 44 now and, 12 years on from his victory in the US Open at Merion, has finished runner-up five times in the majors. But he is way back in this one, after his round was blighted by a triple-bogey at the 11th.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenBryson DeChambeauJustin RoseEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualisation and shot planning work, and certainly visual effects. I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen, and that is endlessly exciting.”His comments came after Netflix reported $11bn revenue for the quarter to the end of June, a 16% year-on-year increase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now we know whyMargaret SullivanThe president is reportedly ‘on a warpath’ over a story in the Wall Street Journal – controlled by Trump’s top media allyFri 18 Jul 2025 15.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 18.53 EDTShareFor days before theWall Street Journalpublished its story about Donald Trump’s salacious friendship with Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday, the president was frantically working the phones.He reportedlyput pressure on the paper’s top editor, Emma Tucker, and even Rupert Murdoch, who controls the paper’s business side, claiming that the alleged facts behind the story were nothing but a hoax, and threatening to sue the paper if it forged ahead.(Following publication of this article,Trump filed a suitagainst the paper and Murdoch.)How worked up was he? “On a fucking warpath,” one administration officialtold Rolling Stone magazine.Now that thestory has been published– appearing on the Journal’s print-edition front page, no less – and picked up everywhere, it’s easy to see what Trump was so upset about. And equally easy to see why trying snuff it out in advance became such a high priority.It’s notjustthat the 50th birthday card he reportedly penned for the future convicted child-sex offender is so damning in itself, with its bawdy sketch and references to shared secrets and “enigmas” that “never age”.It’s notjustthat Trump has been denying a tight friendship with Epstein – who died in jail in 2019 – for some time, and that this would clearly put the lie to that.It’s notjustthat he really, really wants this scandal to go away since it has been turning swaths of his normally cult-like base against him.No, there’s another element – and a brutal one for the president. It’s where the story was published: in the Wall Street Journal, whose conservative opinion side has often backed him and whose news side has a reputation for ensuring that explosive stories are bulletproof: accurate in their facts and fully prepared to stand up under legal scrutiny.What’s more, the newspaper is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s most important media ally.Murdoch’s rightwing propaganda outfit, Fox News, has been Trump’s cheerleader and alter ego for years and played a crucial role in getting him elected twice. (Fox News has been much more docile in recent days, doing Trump’s bidding by almost shutting down its reporting and commentary on Epstein and Trump.) And Murdoch’s right-leaning tabloid the New York Post tends to stand by Trump, too.The Journal is widely perceived as right of center politically, with a reputation for pin-striped rectitude. In short, they don’t make things up.When the paper has taken a big swing at exposing wrongdoing – do you remember John Carreyrou’s exposé of the blood-testing company Theranos, by any chance? – their reporting holds up.All of that made JD Vance’s complaints ring awfully hollow after the birthday card story ran.“Forgive my language, but this story is complete and utter bullshit,” Vance posted on X shortly after it published. “Does anyone honestly believe this sounds likeDonald Trump?”And it made Trump’s vehement denials and threats look absurd. Even in the Maga mind, the Journal is not the third-rate rag he tried to make it out to be.One part of Trump’s denial efforts fell hilariously flat after he claimed that it was not his style to draw sketches. (“I never wrote a picture in my life,” he claimed.) The internet was soon flooded with his signed doodles and drawings over many years.Granted, Trump has had a lot of success in recent months in his various suits against big news organizations – in particular CBS News, whose parent company, Paramount Global, recently settled a worthless case for $16m.Capitulation and cowering has run rampant. And each one of the settlements makes it easier for Trump to start the next court battle with every expectation that he’ll prevail, well before a suit ever reaches a courtroom.This, I suspect, will be quite different. A lawsuit won’t make this damning story go away.And I doubt that Trump really wants to put himself through legal discovery, with all the ugliness that might be exposed.Will this be an element of Trump’s long-awaited downfall? Few are willing to go that far, after all the scandals that have come and gone, too numerous to detail and each one regarded as the final straw.But at a time when Magaworld is finally having its doubts about their dear leader and savior, this one really hurts.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingJeffrey EpsteinWall Street JournalNewspapers & magazinesNewspaperscommentShareReuse this content"

All centred on the idea that the “deep state” was lying to, and thus cheating, ordinary people. Mr Trump was their tribune.It’s hard not to feel schadenfreude now that he’s at the sharp end of a theory that heat times encouragedand allies eagerly pushed: claims that the prison death of the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein might not be suicide after all, and that wealthy and well-connected associates were trying to hush up connections to the financier. Mr Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, promised that “truckloads” of documents would help reveal the truth and claimed that a client list was “sitting on my desk right now”.Then, abruptly, the department of justice said that the financier’s death was not murder, that no more files on the investigation against him would be released, and that there was no list of “clients”. The administration says that Ms Bondi was referring to general files on the case. In short: many of those who promoted the idea that vast, vile secrets were being concealed now claim that there are no secrets at all – withno clear explanationfor their volte-face.The result has been uproar in the Maga movement, with far-right politicians and media figures including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Laura Loomer and Alex Jones among the unsatisfied. Mike Johnson, speaker of the House and a key ally, said that the justice departmentshould “put it out there”.Mr Trumpattempted to dismiss the storyas “boring”, before attacking his own supporters as “weaklings” for “[buying] into this ‘bullshit’”. Then, hours after a Wall Street Journal report that he sent a “bawdy” letter to Epstein – which he denies – hetold Ms Bondito seek the release of grand jury testimony on the sex-trafficking case.Epstein’s crimes are fact, not a “hoax”, and it’s also fact that he had repeated contact withhigh-profile figures, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton,Prince Andrewand Mr Trump himself – who onceremarked of the financier: “Terrific guy … It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” The files need not suggest, let alone confirm, any wrongdoing to embarrass anyone mentioned in them: highlighting the association is enough.At the heart of all Maga conspiracies lies another kernel of truth: that the rich and powerful often get away with exploiting vulnerable people through connections to the state. Yet Trump voters fail to see how that relates to the administration’s broader actions.They are unmoved by his reverse Robin Hood budget legislation, which snatches from the poor to give to billionaires – like those in his cabinet. It’s less visceral than Epstein’s crimes, and its brazenness may, counterintuitively, make it less viral. Many on the rightblame imaginary weather modification, rather than the global heating caused by fossil fuel dependence, for Texas’s deadly floods. Conspiracy theories give those who feel powerless a sense of power; of knowing something that others can’t see. Even so, the truth revealed by the Epstein scandal – that ordinary Americans are deeply angry at the unfairness and abuses created by elites – is worth heeding, and demands a better political and economic response.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now he’s trying to change the narrativeFri 18 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 13.55 EDTShareDonald Trump’s followers, and the conspiracist influencers turned government officials through whom he persuades them, have turned on the president and US attorney general after they declared an end to federal inquiries into Jeffrey Epstein’s death. But it would be a mistake to think that the investigation scandal is sui generis. It’s more like the culmination of a long-running trend, one in which Trump’s exploitation of the conspiracist fictions, distrust of institutions, and prurient fascinations of his base have finally come back to bite him.A pedophile ring at the center of power is a recurring theme in rightwing conspiracy theories of the Trump era. During the 2016 presidential election, supporters of Trump, then an outsider challenger for the Republican nomination, began to spread dark claims about his rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton. Online, far-right trolls and members of the population now called “low trust voters”– people who believe that something nefarious and conspiratorial is going on in the halls of American power, even if they don’t know exactly what – speculated that Clinton was at the head of a huge human trafficking and pedophilic abuse ring based inside Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington DC. There was no secret ring. But that didn’t stop a disturbed man from showing up with a gun.Pizzagate, as it was called, gave way to QAnon, the elaborate mass delirium in which Trump supporters believed that they were receiving secret messages from Q, a fictitious but supposedly highly placed security official. QAnon, too, centered around the notion that powerful people – Democrats, mostly, but also some Hollywood celebrities – were secretly running a vast pedophile network. In his dispatches, Q detailed Trump’s efforts to dismantle a deep state ring of child sex trafficking. None of that was true, either, but that didn’t stop thousands from believing in it.Trump exploited these fictions, nodding to them deliberately with varying degrees of enthusiasm and plausible deniability. They were useful to him, stories in which he was a hero, and his political opponents were maximally morally repulsive. The conspiracies helped paper over the gap between the near-messianic esteem in which Trump’s followers hold him, and the shambolic, incompetent and often cruelly sadistic character of his actual administration. And the content of the stories – dealing as they did in secrecy, power, helpless innocents and forbidden sex – made them potent tools, igniting the fiercest passions and darkest imaginations of his fans.To a man with a bottomless appetite for self-aggrandizement and no principles, the conspiracy theories’ emergence must have seemed like a great stroke of luck. Trump lies like he breathes, and the national media, his fellow politicians, and all manner of experts have lost both the ability and the will to correct the record. Over the past 10 years, through the force of his personality and with mounting attacks on universities, journalists and other outlets for knowledge building, fact-finding, and expertise, he has helped to accelerate a total epistemic collapse in national politics. Policy and public opinion alike are now unmoored from factual reality. What istrueis no longer whatmatters.Sexual violence represents an arena where a post-truth reality long predates TrumpThe story of Epstein, the dead financier and prolific sexual abuser of young women and girls who killed himself in a jail cell in 2019, was in retrospect always bound to become a central character in these vast fantasies. Part of the reason is because of the true horror of Epstein’s crimes, and the uncanny ways some of the facts of his story – as demonstrated in court transcripts, unredacted documents, testimony from his victims, and the dogged, years-long investigations of the Miami Herald’s Julie K Brown – mirror some of the darkest details of QAnon’s fever dreams. A billionaire investor with ties to a shocking number of prominent people across the political spectrum – prominently including Trump himself – Epstein carried out his abuse of dozens of teenage girls over the course of years, allegedly trafficking them for abuse on his private island and aboard his private plane, and, according to some of the girls, now women, who have testified about their experiences with him, pawning them off for abuse by his rich friends. He was a man who lived in tremendous luxury, who mingled with the rich and famous, and who treated human beings – girls – as objects to be consumed, with a kind of casual indifference to their will or wellbeing. He was evil – and, to those on the right who seem to understand both conspicuous consumption and the sexual abuse of women as markers of status, he was also darkly aspirational. In some of the breathless coverage of Epstein, particularly as it emerged on the podcasts and web forums of the conspiracist right, you could detect in the fascination with Epstein not only moral revulsion but an acute envy.It’s unclear why Trump is now trying to wrap up a conspiracy theory that has paid such dividends. Perhaps, as some are suggesting, Trump worries that sustained attention on Epstein’s case will draw more attention to his own abuse of women, though such revelations about Trump have been many, and have not hurt him before. Perhaps he just thinks that he cannot deliver, from his perch atop the federal bureaucracy that is so implicated in crimes and cover-ups in the imaginations of his supporters, the kind of earth-shattering revelations that the conspiracy theory’s narrative structures demand. Either way, Trump has turned abruptly and dramatically against the Epstein theory. He’s trying to reassert control over reality, trying to dictate which fantasies his movement adopts, and which they leave behind. It’snot working. The post-truth conspiracist world he helped to usher in is too unwieldy to be redirected at will.There’s a grim irony in the fact that it is a case of sexual violence that has underscored the dangers of epistemic collapse for Trump himself, because sexual violence represents an arena where a post-truth reality long predates him. No one knows better than sexual violence victims, who are routinely disbelieved, dismissed, or punished for telling the truth, what it means for the facts of your own life not to matter as much as the passions and prior commitments of your audience.What people tend to forget about Epstein’s life – clouded as it has been by all the speculation about his death – is that much of what he was doing to those women and girls was out in the open. Epstein had already been convicted and served prison time on charges pertaining to his sexual abuse; when he’d gotten out, he’d resumed his place among the rich and famous: his status was undiminished by the revelation of his violence. Maybe this is the real delusion at the heart of the conspiracy theories about Epstein and the other pedophile rings that populate the rightwing imagination: not that widespread sexual abuse happens, but that it is concealed, hidden, waiting to be unveiled by the righteous. For sexual abuse, at least, the real horror has always been this: that no one cares enough about the victims for the abusers to have to hide.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The latest and possibly last such nail is the cancellation of The Late Show, theCBSlate-night talkshow hosted byStephen Colbertsince the fall of 2015, and originated by David Letterman when the network poached him from NBC in 1993. At this point, Trump hasn’t just made topical late-night comedy look outdated, hackneyed and an insufficient response to his reign of terror; he’s also made a chunk of it flat-out go away.There will be time to eulogize Colbert’s particular talkshow style later; the Late Show isn’t leaving the air for another 10 months, when his contract is up. Surely that leaves plenty more time to savage the president – and Colbert has been in this slot since right around the time Trump became a real contender in the presidential race, so why has this only now come to a head? Seemingly because the axing of the Late Show franchise follows the$16m settlementof afrivolous Trump lawsuitagainst CBS and their newsmagazine show 60 Minutes over the show’s editing of a 2024 interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Colbert madegreat funof his bosses’ payout as a cowardly “bribe” designed to appease the Trump administration, who are in the position to approve or deny the sale of Paramount, the corporate owners of CBS, to the company Skydance. In other words, the pre-merger nixing a comedian who regularly goofs on Trump on network TV seems like a convenient bit of timing – maybe even an unspoken bonus to go along with those millions of dollars.The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to end in 2026 as CBS cancels showRead moreThe network, of course, has characterized the decision as “purely financial” amid a period when most traditional late-night shows have struggled. As excuses go, it’s not entirely unconvincing. After all, Colbert isn’t being replaced with another host; The Late Show is simply going the same route as its short-lived companion series After Midnight (and The Late Late Show before it).CBSis surrendering the late-night block entirely. This represents a major retreat after the Letterman deal made the network a genuine player for the first time in ages. Presumably it’s back to reruns and old movies going forward.In that sense, this decision does transcend politics. CBS has ripped off a bandage that the big three networks have been applying to similar wounds for years. Late-night programming simply doesn’t mean as much as it used to, with smaller network lead-ins from primetime lineups and more audience choices for comedy, talk, music or even the dopey celeb games thatJimmy Fallonthrows together.Saturday Night Livehas retained some cultural cachet, thanks to a combination of lower commitment (20 episodes a year, on a night where many people don’t have work the next day, versus eight times as many, all airing on weeknights), legacy branding (it’s still known as a star showcase and political comedy go-to, no matter how wan those cold-open sketches get), and sketch comedy that travels well online. These days, it’s routinely one of the highest-rated network shows of the week when it airs a new episode, offering an encouraging sign that old time-slot rules about viewership no longer apply. It’s also extremely expensive to produce and difficult to replicate, which nonetheless looks more viable than the tired talkshow format.View image in fullscreenKamala Harris and Stephen Colbert.Photograph: Scott Kowalchyk/©2024 CBS Broadcasting Inc.Broadly, this could be a good thing for comic minds including Colbert or Conan O’Brien. Some comedians seem unable to resist the siren call of late-night talkshows, chasing the Tonight Show dream even when that actual job remained out of reach. O’Brien is a singularly brilliant comedy writer and performer; as great as his late-night shows could be, in retrospect should he have spent three decades primarily in that waning medium? Colbert, meanwhile, did his strongest political satire playing a parody of a conservative commentator on The Daily Show and its later spinoff The Colbert Report. His warmth and sometimes-sharp humor made him a good “real” talkshow host – and by most standards, a successful one. In recent matchups, his Late Show has been themost-watchedsuch program across the major networks. That he can face cancellation anyway should (alongside O’Brien losing his Tonight Show gig years ago) signal to newcomers that the rarified air of the national late-night talkshow host is also getting pretty thin, maybe unbreathable.Stephen Colbert on Paramount’s $16m settlement with Trump: ‘Big fat bribe’Read moreYet Trump has sucked up some of that oxygen, too. Even with the “challenges” cited by CBS, it’s difficult to believe that vanquishing a longtime issuer of Trump mockery wasn’t at least considered a side benefit of canceling The Late Show. Even if the decision was, as claimed, a financial one, it accompanies another financial decision: that Paramount could afford to pay Trump $16m rather than proceed with litigation that many seemed to think they could win. That’s precisely the kind of expense that could diminish how, say, your late-night talkshow attracts more eyeballs than The Tonight Show.Beyond Trump personally smudging up the balance sheets, he’s helped to hasten the demise of late-night comedy simply by being himself, seeming to provide the perfect target: a venal, dimwitted perma-celebrity with an army of devoted sycophants. But after two non-consecutive administrations have flooded the zone with grotesqueries, performing a lightly zinging monologue or sketches as a warmup act for good-natured interviews seems unlikely to entice either those craving anti-Trump catharsis, or those desperate to believe in his strongman powers.That Colbert took a somewhat less cutesy approach than his competitor Fallon seemed to be all that was necessary to mark him as a troublemaker. The thing is, Trump might have ultimately consumed him either way. By providing a ready-made caricature of himself, intentionally or not, the president has beaten the system again. It may not be worth mourning the hacky, presidential-themed jokes we might miss in a future with fewer talkshows than ever. But it does feel like the enforcement of one of Trump’s more minor cruelties: the ability to see himself as the only real star in the world.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertCBSUS televisionDonald TrumpTV comedyComedyTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

A man and woman visited my family’s home in Philadelphia – we had recently moved from Palestine – showed their credentials and asked to enter. My parents invited them in and a conversation about political views followed. They left soon afterwards but I knew we were suspect, and I understood why.At the time, I was in high school. Two or three years later, one of my sisters, who wore the hijab then, was confronted by an elderly white man at a department store. “What’s the significance of the trash you’re wearing on your head?” he asked.Just a few years ago I was traveling through JFK airport from a trip abroad. I was pulled out of line for a side conversation – a semi-regular occurrence – when a policeman with a bull face said: “Do you hate America?”Pure bait.Watching Zohran Mamdani’s treatment in the run-up to his commanding victory over the Democratic establishment caused me to reflect on these experiences.In Mamdani’s case, the frenzy started when an Andrew Cuomo-affiliated group lengthened anddarkenedhis beard in an ad.And there were clumsy efforts to associate Mamdani with antisemitism. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York, went on the radio toclaimMamdani had raised concern among Jewish New Yorkers and made “references to global jihad”, whatever that means. Democrats, activists and voters were outraged at the smear, and Gillibrand apologized.But it was Mamdani’s victory in the primary – and the national attention he has justifiably received – that caused the sluice gates to open.Brandon Gill, a representative from Texas, posted a video of the young democratic socialist eating biryani with his hand, appending anote, saying: “Civilized people in America don’t eat like this.”Andy Ogles, another Republican congressman, has called for Mamdani’s citizenship to bewithdrawn, a new front in the Republican war on everything. Meanwhile, Randy Fine, a Florida representative, has decried the emerging “caliphate” of New York. Comically – you have to have a sense of humor about some things – Marjorie Taylor Green posted apictureof the Statue of Liberty cloaked in the niqab.Nor have the Democrats relented, despite Gillibrand’s grassroots censure. The strategist James Carville hascommentedabout the “fact that [Mamdani] won’t denounce” the “intifada”: “Come on man,” he said, “just get it out your mouth.”Mamdani’s rise, which is a threat to a weak Democratic leadership, will only invite more racist attacks. This is Trump’s America now; bad faith arguments and unmasked bigotry have attained new heights in public discussions.ButIslamophobiahas deep institutional roots. The phenomenon, a messy amalgam of racist tropes ensnaring Sikhs, assorted south Asians and Middle Easterners, is durable and widespread. Hopes that Barack Hussein Obama’s election in 2008 would take the edge off were premature.It’s worth examining why.At an individual level, prejudice exists among all kinds of people: no one is immune to its effects, or to effecting it. I’ve encountered racism directed at white people, Black people, Indians, east Asians and just about everyone else.The psychologist Daniel Kahneman shed some light on prejudice in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow. He and his colleagues concluded through rigorous experimentation that people rely on intuitive systems and mental shortcuts in making certain kinds of quick decisions. Often, those intuitive beliefs are based on existing stereotypes and biases. You can’t contain all the information in the world in your head, so you rely on representations for things to navigate a complex and information-rich environment. Heuristics, in other words.But if all prejudice is created equal, it doesn’t stay that way for long. A powerful person’s racism exerts greater leverage than the ordinary prejudice of a recent immigrant who disapproves of interracial relationships.That’s because power is defined, in part, through the ability to participate in and shape institutions, which are themselves containers of cultural DNA. They reproduce assumptions that exist among a critical mass of their participants.It is institutions that form the basis for structural racism – a cohesive, majoritarian racism that devalues certain lives through a society’s ordinary operations. Structural racism is dangerous in a way that the personal prejudices of marginalized people cannot possibly be, if only because of how power is organized in society.A critic might argue that there is a basis for regarding Muslims with suspicion. People who serve in the national defense or security establishment, for instance, might perceive a real-world basis for adopting what might be considered biased or racist views.Consider the fact that all of the men who perpetrated the attacks on New York in September 24 years ago were Middle Eastern and Muslim. Heuristic thinking might suggest a travel ban that assumes all Muslim men, or even men from the Middle East, are a potential source of terror will secure the US. It’s a logical argument: preventing all Muslims from entering the US will prevent all the domestic crimes perpetrated by Muslims.But a corollary exists: all able-bodied white males between the ages of 11 and 70 are potential mass shooters or insurrectionists. We may protect our school-aged children and our constitutional democracy by preventing members of that group from accessing guns.The illogic of Islamophobia lies in the breach: the arguments, which are constructed along roughly similar lines, have very different chances of impacting policy in this country.That’s because the FBI and local law enforcement – and the leaderships of the Democratic and Republican parties – contain a complex and copious set of information about the range of behaviors that white men may participate in, as compared with Muslim men. Yes, white men kill children at schools, but they do a lot of other things besides.Mamdani, through his visibility, charm and unflagging cheerfulness presents a new source of information about Muslim men in America. The decision by Cuomo affiliates to try to exploit the gap in information about Muslims – to rely on a racist heuristic – by darkening Mamdani’s beard was a cynical one.But it failed through the superior communications of the candidate himself. Mamdani was visible and is likable. He succeeded in reaching voters on his own terms and new information has succeeded in short-circuiting old ideas, at least for now.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East PeaceExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionIslamophobiaIslamReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

The real mystery is where their wearers got the idea of a paedophile conspiracy from in the first placeFri 18 Jul 2025 06.53 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareYou have to feel for Donald Trump’s Maga base. The one huge secret theydidn’twant disclosed was that he actually really hates them. All populists despise their people, obviously – but please, Mr President, respect the playbook! You’re supposed to do it quietly. Regrettably, no one could accuse Trump of hiding his spite under a bushel after a week in which hedescribed those of his supporterswho want him to simply do what he repeatedly promised, and release the so-called Epstein files, as “weaklings” and “stupid people”. This is quite the (public) volte face from the guy who originally swept to office declaring “I love the poorly educated”.Most of you are unlikely to need a recap at this stage, but Jeffrey Epstein is the sex-trafficking financier and socialite, who conveniently died in jail while awaiting trial, apparently by suicide. A woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted of conspiring with him to sexually abuse minors, and is currently serving 20 years in a low-security Florida prison. But no big-hitting or even small-hitting male associate in the US has so much as been arrested for participating in what I believe the dead paedophile would have encouraged us to call his “lifestyle”. This secondTrump administrationdidn’t just sweep to power while repeatedly screaming about the “cover-up” of this story, but it spent a good portion of its early months assuring its ravenous base that Epstein’s supposed “client list” was on a desk waiting for release approval. Yet now, Trump and his associates say there is no list. Nope. Never even was a list. Where did these weakling idiots get that idea? To summarise his administration’s position: “We took a look at the deep state and it turns out to be very shallow. Seriously, I’m standing in it right now and it doesn’t even come up to my knees.”Understandably, a significant proportion of the Maga crowd are not taking this well at all. One of the key takeouts of Trump’s rise has been that as long as you tell people that up is down or black is white in an engaging or sufficiently discombobulating fashion, truth is an extremely low-status commodity in contemporary politics. But, contrary to perceived trends, it seems that there do still exist some subjects on which you can only push even your own people so far. Maybe the ancient political adage still holds true: live by the paedo conspiracy, die by the paedo conspiracy.Late on Thursday, as footage ofpeople burning Maga hatsspread online, a palpably frustrated Trumpannounced that he was instructing the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to seek release of the Epstein grand jury testimony, “based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein”. Though you’ll note the president failed to add the two key words: “by me”. Still, it’s good to hear Trump characterising what’s currently happening as “publicity”, confirming that he sees even the desire to see justice served on a suspected paedophile sex-trafficker and his associates as a form of limelight – which, like all limelight, should by rights be his.It feels harder to sustain the idea that there is nothing to see here, especially when leading wingnuts such as the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, far-right activist Laura Loomer, Fox host Laura Ingraham, talkshow queen Megyn Kelly, Maga whisperer Steve Bannon and even the US House speaker, Mike Johnson, are out there pushing the base conviction that, actually, there might well be something to see here. “It’s definitely a full reversal on what was all said beforehand,” observed Marjorie in a once-in-a-career alignment with fact, “and people are just not willing to accept it.”We have to take our laughs where we can, meanwhile, so do please consider the cavalcade of podcasters and Maga influencers who got jobs like “director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation” and “deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation” and are now discovering that life comes at you fast. FBI chief Kash Patel spent the election campaign pushing Epstein conspiracies, and is now believed to be hiding under his big important desk wetting his pants. “Listen,” his deputy, Dan Bongino, used to instruct his podcast listeners. “ThatJeffrey Epsteinstory is a big deal, please do not let that story go. Keep your eye on this.” Will do, Dan. Incidentally, a lot of people spent the weekend speculating feverishly that Bongino would sensationally quit his job – but in the end, he just came into work a bit late on Monday. What a tough guy. Make America Deep State Again!Other developments? That are perhaps not unrelated? TheWall Street Journal reportsthat Trump had served as a contributor to some kind of cursed 50th birthday scrapbook for Epstein, compiled by Maxwell, for which he’d sent a “bawdy” letter. This missive was reportedly typed inside a drawing of a naked woman’s silhouette, in which the famous Trump signature served as a kind of scribble of pubic hair. So far, so FDR. Unfortunately, particularly in the circumstances, the letter itself is said to conclude: “Happy birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.”Alas, the current president isnot thrilled by this report, denying it completely, adding that he has never in his life “wrote a picture”. (It goes without saying that all Donald Trump statements, always, are very much [sic].) Much more promisingly, Trump is furious with the WSJ owner, Rupert Murdoch, and threatening to “sue his ass off”. Oh please don’t, Mr President! His ass is 94 years old and incredibly wrinkled. Also, half of Britain’s political class still lives up it. Then again, perhaps Trump v Murdoch is very much the desiccated-dick-waving contest the world … wants? Needs? Will have to endure? Unclear which of those applies at this stage, but let’s hold out for the possibility that both men are wholly – and indeed literally – consumed by it.Angles-wise, however, there are already signs that the Wall Street Journal might just be the common enemy the Magas need as an off-ramp for their civil war, allowing people who are obsessed with paedophiles to find common cause both with people who don’t care about paedophiles, and also with people who may actually have been close personal friends with paedophiles. There’ll probably only be one casualty, and it’ll probably be Pam Bondi. Women are great at taking these falls. Furthermore, the whole conflagration would once more pit a billionaire president against one of his billionaire buddies – exactly the kind of better world his supporters voted for, and a true testament to how truly, truly deeply he values them.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So it was quite a twist this week to see the chickens of this particular rancid online conspiracy culture come home to roost in the form ofMaga faithfuls turning on Donald Trumpfor what the US president now refers to as the “Jeffrey Epstein hoax”.Epstein, a convicted child sex offender, killed himself in prison while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019, and Trump’s conspiracy-hungry supporters are now accusing the president of a cover-up. Specifically enraging to Trump fans is his decision to tread water on releasing the “Epstein files”, FBI files supposedly containing the names of the banker’s “client list”, which, last month, Elon Musk suggested Trump himself may appear on.Until very recently, theTrump administrationhad been happy to throw meat to the lions by suggesting it would release the files. But in recent weeks the president has dropped that promise and instead recommended that everyone “move on”. Meanwhile, the FBI issued a memo last week saying it did not have evidence that would justify interrogating further suspects.How the Jeffrey Epstein row plunged Maga world into turmoil – a timelineRead moreWell. Can you imagine? Across the US, the deep-state-is-lying-to-us klaxons went off like tornado warnings and before you knew it, the Maga megaphone Laura Loomer was calling for the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to resign, the Trump ally Steve Bannon demanded the dissolution of federal law enforcement, and Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, called the FBI memo a “cover-up”. Which brings us to the domino run of events this week: Trump coming out fighting against his followers, who he described on Truth Social as“weaklings” and “my PAST supporters”, who “have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker”. And a partial, 11th-hour climbdown when heordered Bondi to release testimonyfrom the Epstein grand jury. As Trump himself might say: beautiful.TuesdayWhat do tarantulas smell like? Not chocolates, apparently; a useful piece of information to have had at Cologne Bonn airport recently, where news wasreleasedthis week of a smuggling attempt thwarted by customs officials tipped off by a “noticeable smell”.Or rather, the notable absence of a smell: officials inspecting a large haul of cake boxes noted they didn’t smell chocolatey, and on further inspection turned out to contain, not confectionery from Vietnam, as the customs paperwork promised, but – what are the chances? – 1,500 baby tarantulas in individual plastic vials.Many of the tarantulas hadn’t survived the journey from Vietnam, which feels like the opener to a dark Pixar movie or the trigger for an odd conflation of responses: revulsion, fear and sympathy.View image in fullscreen‘I had it cast in bronze, and see: not so small! It’s a big beautiful hand.’Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/AFP/Getty ImagesWednesdayThe 2025Emmy nominationsare in and with them, more importantly,the snubs. At the top of the list is Keira Knightley, overlooked for her role in the very patchy Netflix show Black Doves (notable detail: Sarah Lancashire’s bored face in the pilot), followed by Tina Fey’s also really quite bad Netflix show, The Four Seasons, overlooked in every category bar a single nomination for Colman Domingo.Meanwhile, the parlousness of John Hamm’s suburban comedy drama, Your Friends & Neighbours, was recognised by Emmy voters with a nod for the theme music and nothing else. But while some media outlets pointed to Renée Zellweger being overlooked for her role in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy – which found itself in the TV movie category since it went straight to streaming in the US – this wasn’t quite right. For a movie, show or performer to count as having been snubbed, voters must have approached it with reasonably high expectations in the first place.ThursdayCrucial to Trump’s “Epstein hoax” about-face seems to be the existence of what, in astory broken by the Wall Street Journal, the newspaper described as a “bawdy” letter and cartoon, allegedly written by Trump to Epstein on the occasion of his 50th birthday and included in a special album compiled for Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell – names that fall like a fantasy dinner party list but where the object is to assemble the worst people in the world.It is the Journal’s attempt to describe Trump’s alleged cartoon-drawing skills that particularly arrests in this new twist: the president’s alleged sketch featured the naked silhouette of a woman in which, wrote the Journal, “a pair of small arcs denotes the woman’s breasts,” (the choice of “denotes”, here, really raising the tone), and Trump’s “signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair”.The message, meanwhile, allegedly read: “Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret.” And while Trump jumped on Truth Social to call the note a fake and threaten the Journal with legal action, the rest of us could only sit back and marvel at the way life mimics pulp fiction – or rather, Alice in Wonderland, in which the president’s difficulties aren’t authored by a bold defender of Truth, but by the man who arguably bears more responsibility for his rise than any other: Journal proprietor and sudden hero of the hour, Rupert Murdoch.FridayIn a week of awkward missives, Pat Brennan has resigned from his post as a parish priest in Coventry and marked the occasion with what the Metrodescribedas a “sassy poem”. In his blog, Humble Piety, the priest posted a verse entry entitled Not I Lord Surely!, in which he blasted parishioners for being, among other things, “unfriendly”, “disdainful”, “bored”, “gossiping” and “tutting for a living”, and nailed a rhyme scheme in which he paired “holier too” with “you know who”, and “Lord’s own seal” with “it can feel”. We can only hope this style of critique catches on.View image in fullscreen‘I’m still thinking of cutting the ISA allowance, but don’t pass it on.’Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PAExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationEmmysUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

So, what’s the state of the 2028 primary race now?Fri 18 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 13.32 EDTShareEvery American presidential campaign is many years in the making. So, what’s the state of the 2028 Democratic primary race now? The Democratic party’s most eligible candidates for the next election have been scheming, climbing, wheeling and dealing for their shot at the ticket for years. Plans were being hatched for the cycles ahead well before Biden garnered the nomination for himself in 2020.Like that race, 2028 promises another crowded and wide-open field of contenders ⁠– polls have taken the Democratic electorate’s temperature on as many as 20 potential candidates, from Kamala Harris, who is reportedly considering a run for California’s governor instead, to the sports pundit Stephen A Smith.The potential candidates, as is generally the case within the party, fall within two broad camps.On the one hand, you have Democratic centrists ⁠– certain, as ever, that the main culprits for the party’s woes are progressives, out of touch with the electorate, who have pulled it ever-leftward. “What happened the last election,” the Arizona senator Ruben Gallegosaidduring a conspicuous visit to Pennsylvania, “is that we got so pure, and we kept so pure that we started kicking people out of the tent.”One Democrat who wants back into the tent is the former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was functionally run out of town by voters over a series of scandals including his administration’s efforts to prevent the public from seeing video of Chicago police murdering a 17-year-old.He got himself a spread in the Wall Street Journal last week anyway. “He calls the party’s brand ‘toxic’ and ‘weak and woke,’” the Journal’s John McCormickwrote, “a nod to culture-war issues he thinks Democrats have become too often fixated on that President Trump has successfully used against them.” Democratic bigwigs in Iowa will get the chance to hear that message in person come September ⁠– per the Journal, Emanuel will be the guest of honor at a party fish fry.Of course, Gallego and Emanuel’s thoughts about whereDemocratsneed to go have been given more than a fair hearing since November. A consensus among Democratic consultants and the party’s most esteemed pundits has emerged that Harris ⁠– who challenged Trump for not being tough enough on immigration and was loth to even mention her own personal identity over the course of the race ⁠– ran a campaign that did too little to distance the party from the positions of progressive activists.Tack to the political center even more aggressively, the thinking goes, and the Democrats might have a chance not only at winning in 2028, but returning to competitiveness in red regions in the country that the party hasn’t contested seriously since the 1990s and 2000s. Ask this set what happened between the 1990s and 2016 to weaken the party in these regions in the first place, and you’re unlikely to get a coherent answer.The fact that so much of the recent erosion the party has seen with white working-class voters in particular happened under Barack Obama’s cautious, center-left, and rhetorically mainstream administration ⁠–beforethe resurgence of left identity politics that has swept the party since about 2015 ⁠– may be of interest to political scientists and historians. But it’s a wrinkle in the prevailing narrative professional Democrats are unwilling to consider ⁠– committed as they are to believing, or pretending to believe, that real moderation has never been tried.That’s not to say that there aren’t new or at least refurbished ideas moderates are pushing forward to revitalize the party. The book Abundance by journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson has been taken up by party centrists as a foundational text, thanks to its critiques of progressive groups and activists it argues have held up policy progress, especially in Democratic cities.“Former Vice President Kamala Harris and the U.S. Senate’s Democratic caucus are among the many politicians who have recently sought the authors’ counsel,” the Wall Street Journal’s Molly Ballreportedthis week. “Not one but two congressional caucuses have recently formed to push legislation advancing the ideas laid out in the book.”Read a particular way, the book’s arguments can be understood as bits of advice that might actually aid progressives in certain respects ⁠– it contends, for instance, cutting red tape might have bolstered parts of Biden’s economic agenda that the left liked, like investments in new clean energy projects. Still, Abundance has been set up ⁠– by progressives and centrists alike, as an alternative to the leftwing populism so influentially offered up by Bernie Sanders in the last two open Democratic primaries.That’s the second camp we can expect candidates in the next primary to align themselves with. Though it’s early on, there are a few signs the populists have won over a substantial proportion of the Democratic electorate. A poll ⁠– from the group Demand Progress ⁠–foundthat a 59% majority of Democrats preferred a progressive message about the need to “get money out of politics, break up corporate monopolies, and fight corruption” over an Abundance-influenced message about reducing “bottlenecks” that make it harder to produce housing, expand energy production, or build new roads and bridges.”In February, against arguments from the center otherwise, Gallup alsofoundthat a 51% majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the party to either remain the same ideologically or move further left as opposed to becoming more moderate.Sanders, now 83, won’t be the standard bearer for those majorities in 2028. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez might, and so too might the 2024 vice-president nomineeTim Walz, who argued colorfully that Democrats should be doing more to “bully the shit out of” Trump in an appearance in South Carolina and whose pick for the Democratic ticket in the last campaign encouraged progressives impressed by his record of signing policies like paid leave, free school meals, and police reforms into law as governor of Minnesota. Democrats, he has said, disappoint voters when they make grand promises only to “incrementally change things and … don’t do the big stuff.”True as that may be, it’s well worth asking why the Democratic left hasn’t been more electorally successful, even within party primaries. Though Democratic leaders and donors plainly try to stack the deck against progressive challengers in a variety of ways, those efforts, like the consolidation of support around Joe Biden in the 2020 primary to block out Sanders, wouldn’t pay off quite so well if the left had a broader and more reliable base of support among Democratic voters. As popular as some progressive ideas and candidates might be, progressive fortunes in 2028 and beyond will rest upon whether the left can actually close the deal with the Democratic rank and file.Beyond these two camps, we’ll see candidates hoping to transcend them or split the difference between them through political style. We might call that move “the Booker”. After holding forth for more than 25 hours straight in a seemingly impassioned jeremiad against the Trump administration at the end of March ⁠– the longest speech in Senate history, coming soon tobookstoresnear you ⁠– the New Jersey senator Cory Booker was the only Democrat to back the convicted felon Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, becoming our ambassador to France.Though he might be leaning on it more heavily than he can afford to, Booker’s instinct that a keyed up rhetorical register will matter in the race to come is probably correct, and he isn’t the only candidate hoping an aggressive posture now will help them stand out. The Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, for instance, is saying all the right things to fired-up Democrats at the moment: ⁠“These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,” hetolda crowd of Democratic insiders in New Hampshire in April. Come 2028, those activists will be giving some thought as to whether that tone compensates for the fact that Pritzker happens to be a billionaire.Maryland’s Wes Moore, yet another governor with his eyes on the prize, similarlyimpressedDemocratic politicos in a recent South Carolina speech. “If [Trump] can do so much bad in such a small amount of time, why can’t we do so much good?” he asked. “Now is the time for us to be impatient, too. Let’s not just talk about an alternative. Let’s not study an alternative. Let’s deliver the alternative.” Gesturing at what that alternative might be, Moore pointed to policies like raising the minimum wage and making apprenticeships more available. Will there be more by the time the primary rolls around?Whoever wins out in 2028 will obviously have their work cut out for them. The data firm Catalist’spostmortemof the 2024 election shows that Democrats lost ground not only with the young men who have been the focus of so much attention lately but across a broad swath of demographic groups. And structurally, population shifts are going to make winning both the electoral college and Senate all the more difficult for the party in the years ahead. The 2028 primary, in short, will be a contest to earn the privilege of steering a fast-sinking ship. It’ll take more than the right candidate to save it ⁠– though a decent pick and a campaign season of serious debates about the party’s future certainly wouldn’t hurt.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnist.

He, like his country, will face a reckoningFri 18 Jul 2025 13.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 14.06 EDTShareWill the war in Gaza last for ever? It’s not a wholly rhetorical question. There are days when I fear that the death and devastation that has gone on for 650 days will never stop, that it will eventually settle into a constant, low-level attritional war inside the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict – a war within a war – that becomes a background hum to world affairs, the way the Troubles in Northern Ireland endured for 30 years. In this same nightmare, incidentally, I seeBenjamin Netanyahu, who has already sat in Israel’s prime ministerial chair for nearly 18 years, on and off, staying put for another 18 years or more, ruling the country until he is 100.Israelis don’t want either of those things to happen. Polls show that only a minority trust Netanyahu, while an overwhelming majority –about 74%– want this terrible war to end. As the leader of one of the ultra-orthodox, or Haredi, parties that this weekquit Netanyahu’s ruling coalition– over the government’s failure to pass a bill permanently exempting Haredi youth from military service–recently put it: “I don’t understand what we are fighting for there… I don’t understand what the need is.”If the supposed benefit of the war eludes even Netanyahu’s erstwhile partners in government, its cost is apparent to the entire watching world. Every day brings news of another 10 or 20 or 30 Palestinians killed in Gaza, often while queueing up for urgently needed food or water. The UN estimates that over six short weeksabout 800 people have been killedin or around food distribution points, most of those deaths in the vicinity of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the US-Israeli joint venture established after Israel decided that the UN could not be trusted to keep aid out of the hands of Hamas and whose brief record has been one of chaos and bloodshed. Even the most unwavering of Israel’s defenders do not pretend that those killed in these incidents were Hamas fighters or posed any kind of military threat. It’s just the utterly needless death of blameless civilians, day after day after day.InsideIsrael, a war without end means the deaths of Israeli soldiers – and, recall, almost every (non-Haredi) Jewish, Druze and Circassian 18-year-old is a conscript – and another day chained in darkness for the 20 living Israelis still believed to be held hostage by Hamas and its allies in Gaza. Which is why three in four Israelis want this war over, immediately.So why doesn’t it end? Some believe there may be movement towards a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in the coming days, with one US official saying it’s “closer than it’s ever been”. If that’s true, one contributory factor is worth explaining – because it is damning.Next week will see the end of the current session of the Israeli parliament, with the Knesset then in recess until October. During those three months, it is procedurally harder to bring down an Israeli government. So Netanyahu will soon be less vulnerable to the ultranationalists Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who have long threatened to leave his coalition should he do a deal that ends the war. Hence the speculation of an imminent move.Underpinning it is the assumption that until now Netanyahu has preferred the hostages to remain in their dungeons, and Palestinian civilians to keep dying, than to risk his hold on power. In other words, if a deal is done soon, it will be a deal that could have been done sooner – but which was delayed to keep Netanyahu in the prime minister’s seat.Confidence in ascribing such self-serving and amoral motives to Netanyahu is boosted by a comprehensive New York Times investigation into the past 21 months, which methodically confirms with hard evidence what has long been assumed by most analysts: that “Netanyahu prolonged the war in Gaza to stay in power”.The paper focuses on several key moments when a ceasefire was within reach, when Israel’s own military commanders were urging it, but when Netanyahu chose to walk away, fearing that if he did not, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would pull the plug on his government. Stripped of power, Netanyahu would lose much of the armour that protects him as he stands trial on corruption charges. Like his fellow nationalist would-be autocrat, Donald Trump, Netanyahu has a mortal fear of going to jail.So in April 2024, Netanyahu was poised to present a proposal for a six-week pause in the war to his cabinet. It would have brought the release of more than 30 hostages and negotiations for a permanent truce. The plan was written and ready to go. But cabinet minutes obtained by the paper show that, at the last minute, Smotrich, who, like Ben-Gvir, wants Israel to occupyGazaand to rebuild Jewish settlements there, warned that if Netanyahu were to sign the rumoured “surrender”, his government would be finished. The proposal was quietly shelved and the war went on.At that point, the death toll in Gaza stood at35,000. Today it is estimated at 58,000. Of course, it’s possible a deal would have fallen away in April 2024, that Hamas would have said no, or that it would not have lasted. But there was a chance – and it is at least possible that 23,000 lives might have been saved.That was not the last such opportunity. In July last year, international mediators gathered in Rome believing the stars were at last aligned for a ceasefire. But, according to the New York Times, Netanyahu suddenly introduced six new demands that scuppered any prospect of an agreement. Earlier, Ben-Gvir had barged into the PM’s office, warning him not to make “a reckless deal”. Once again, Netanyahu put his own political survival ahead of the lives of Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians.You would think that record would be enough to see Netanyahu repudiated by the Israeli electorate: the evidence against him is so devastating. But he will present himself at the next election, which could be just six months away, as the man who vanquished Israel’s mightiest enemies. Hezbollah no longer threatens Israel from the north; Bashar al-Assad is gone; and Iran has been humiliated, its air defences gutted, its nuclear ambitions dented. Hamas still exists, but Israel is no longer encircled by a “ring of fire” shaped by Tehran. Netanyahu says that success is all down to him, while the failures that led to the Hamas massacres of 7 October 2023 are the fault of everyone else. As an electoral pitch, it may even work.This week I spoke to the revered Israel journalist Ilana Dayan forthe Unholy podcast. She described how Israelis were stuck for so long in 7 October, but now “October 8th at least has dawned on us. We finally can ask, and have to ask, the tough questions with regard to our leadership, with regard to the tragedy in Gaza, with regard to this endless war. History will judge the leadership, but it will judge us too.”Israelis will indeed have to face a great reckoning for the destruction they have wreaked in Gaza. But the first to be judged should be Benjamin Netanyahu, who had the power of life and death in his hands and chose the death of others, so that his political career might live. He should bear the shame of it until his final breath.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I understood from a young age that, as a girl,goodnesswould be my supreme achievement – my calling in life. But what that looked like or how I might embody its essence took time to decode.I remember being in the back seat of our brown HJ Holden when I was young, leaving a family party and being reprimanded by my parents for my “behaviour”. I was mystified. I had no idea what I had done that had caused them such embarrassment. Had I run when I was told not to? Or had I misunderstood an instruction? Was I a “bad girl”, I remember wondering.The ‘womanosphere’ is the latest cultural propaganda assault on young womanhood. Will it work? | Van BadhamRead moreAs powerful and incentivising as the idea of being a “good girl” was, the “bad girl” label was probably more powerful in the way it encouraged me to avoid it at all costs. I would have done anything to never be thought of as bad. I wasn’t clear in those early years on what being a bad girl entailed but the threat was powerful enough for me to remain strictly within a narrow set of ideas of how I needed to behave.I have a strong memory of some family friends having a “bad girl” stay with them for a while. Her mother was no longer around to care for her and her father was barely in the picture. I remember the warning that came with her before she arrived, that she was a kid who had done some “bad” things and I wasn’t to get too close. This all horrified me. So grand was the image of the bad girl in my psyche that I was immediately scared of what she might try to make me do. What sort of badness would she get up to?Only days after her arrival, I heard she had weed on the front lawn. She had simply pulled her pants down and peed. No one was sure why she hadn’t gone into the house to use the toilet, and everyone was confused and shocked. So I pretended to be shocked too. But I don’t think I was shocked – I think I was afraid. Afraid of her wildness. A wildness that I understood and felt inside me too but that had been pushed far down.While I performed the “good girl”, I never felt like one. The mere suggestion that goodness was judged by people on the outside of me was enough to send me into spirals of doubt and self-loathing. I would watch adults closely to see if I had made them happy. Had I said “thank you”? Had I smiled at the right time at their joke? Had I spoken sweetly enough? Had I agreed with the way they thought about the world, even if I didn’t?In writing my latest book, The Wisdom of Age, I wanted to find out from the elder women I interviewed if it was true that I might be able to grow olddisgracefully, as all the Hallmark cards are now suggesting. Was it going to be real disgrace? Or just a performance of disgrace? Would I be regarded as difficult if I didn’t do what was expected of me as an ageing woman?Yes, I was told by many women: if you step out of line and outside our ageing woman tropes, the swiftness of “difficult” being attached to you and its conjuring of the bad girl trope remained a powerful restraint. Who would want to be considered difficult after so many years playing the game?There had been a stirring in me since my mid-30s to stop placating the people around me, and now that I had hit my 50s, it had begun to feel as though it was shaking me to get out. I wanted to break some metaphorical plates and leave them for someone else to clean up.I spoke to artists and activists in their 70s, 80s and 90s to find out if they were comfortable being thought of as difficult. These were women who were not making it easy for those around them to violate the rights or safety of others. They were speaking up and turning up to the frontline of protests, or they were simply letting their families know that they were no longer going to put up with their shit.Why are we laughing at male ignorance about menstruation? Where are the LOLs? | Rebecca ShawRead moreIn every conversation, there was a glint in their eyes at the suggestion of being “difficult”. “Difficult” had become a rallying cry – a sign that they were on the right track, a sign that they had reconnected with the girl who raged inside them. Many of those women wanted to clarify that being difficult was not done merely for difficulty’s sake. Rather, they were finally following the beat of their heart, unmoved by the social conditioning that had held them captive for so long. “Difficult” didn’t faze them – it emboldened them.This wisdom, along with so much else I received in the writing of the book, has caused me to revisit that good girl and suggest that perhaps we might consider a do-over. Get back some of those years when we kept the peace and smiled nicely. We will invite back the girl who is clear on who she is – before she was told to be something else. The girl who doesn’t please those around her for the sake of pleasing but instead loves wildly and passionately when it feels right to do so. The girl who is in touch with the voice that has been calling her for her whole life. The girl who might, facing the horrors of the life she had been given, pull down her pants and wee on the front lawn.Jacinta Parsons is a radio broadcaster and writer from Melbourne.

Grant had provoked backlash from the Black press for discussing state-funded “voluntary repatriation” (a return of migrant and migrant descendant groups to their country of heritage) at a fringe event at the Labour party conference in 1993. Provided an opportunity by Howe to walk back on these comments, he doubled down, suggesting that Black people had “no future in Europe”.Howe viewed Grant’s position as retrograde, and questioned how a British MP could advocate for a future outside Britain. Grant would complain to Channel 4 about the programme, fearing that it had ruined his political career. But it did not. Despite being abandoned by his Black parliamentary colleagues and only finding mixed support against major rebuke, he remained a respected political figure, andLabourMP, until his death in 2000.The episode is an important reminder of something that used to exist in mainstream British discourse: important Black figures engaging in serious debate on a controversial – even, offensive – subject. Here was a mainstream platform where, gladiator-style, a discussion pertaining to race in Britain could be contested in all its messiness, ferocity and rigour. Where can we find such a space in the mainstream today?Perhaps if we were still committed to engaging in complex discussions of race, racialisation and Blackness today, with a public audience acting as a democratic mechanism of accountability,Diane Abbott’s commentswould have provoked curiosity and real engagement rather than panic and overreaction.The Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, first elected to her seat 38 years ago, was again suspended from the party on Thursday for comments in aBBC Radio 4 interviewdefending her previously revoked statements around the different experiences of racialisation between certain demographic groups. Where Abbott’s wording in her original letter to the Observer had been clumsy, this time she took the opportunity to clarify what she meant, saying: “Clearly, there must be a difference between racism which is about colour and other types of racism, because you can see a Traveller or a Jewish person walking down the street, you don’t know … but if you see a Black person walking down the street, you see straight away that they’re Black.”These comments strike me as true. In the same way that while my Blackness is immediately and unambiguously read, my sexuality (I am a gay man) could only be inferred by context, stereotypes or by my own confirmation. Similarly, you may not know that a white person is Irish until you infer it from their name, accent or simply ask them. That does not undermine the reality of anti-Irish (or antisemitic or anti-Traveller) discrimination, and yet it is plainly not the same as what can be visibly deduced before any kind of identifying context is introduced. But even if you disagree with these comments, as you may, why are they so unsayable to the point that Abbott has had the whip suspended? Why, instead, can there not be public discussion on the differing experiences of racialisation, even if they are provocative?In part, this is down to the decline of serious engagement with Black intellectual thought. Howe’s programme had its cheap moments. And yet in the mid-1990s you could turn on your television and witness thought-provoking debates around race without participants expecting to be served their P45. Equally, you might have been more used to the presence of Black intellectuals on television and radio – the likes of Stuart Hall and CLR James, who had their owninterview broadcaston Channel 4 in the 1980s where they discussed, among other things, the Gold Coast revolution and James’s Trotskyism. It is not that such intellectuals or their works no longer exist, but that they are undervalued or treated more tokenistically.Now, where Black academics and thinkers are called to discuss matters of race, they are largely reduced toshouting matcheswith the likes of Piers Morgan, with the preferred topics being culture-war fodder around the permissibility of praising Winston Churchill, or the latest development onMeghan Markle. No wonder when faced with a real, considered and provocative attempt to parse race and racialisation, the channels simply shut down. The warning signs for this decline were there: when Howe was interviewed by the BBC to discuss the 2011 riots, the anchor erroneouslysuggested that he had a history of rioting, to which he responded “Have some respect for an old West Indian Negro.”The last humanist: how Paul Gilroy became the most vital guide to our age of crisisRead moreThe clearest problem, to me, is that there is a lack of interest in the diversity of what Black people think, and how to respond when that may present a challenge. The Labour party has a persistent problem with it – and that includes when the MPRupa Huq describedthe former Conservative chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng as “superficially” Black. Patronising and opportunistic as ever, Keir Starmer, after failed attempts to deselect Abbott,praised her as a “trailblazer”upon becoming mother of the House following her re-election. Yet it is a safe conclusion that he has absolutely no interestin what she thinks or says. The same is true of Baroness Lawrence, whom he was all too happy to wheel out in the interests of campaigning, only to faceaccusations that he was not listening to herwhen she attempted to engage in dialogue about anti-Black racism.Our public discussions on race are utterly impoverished, and this is largely because our haughty institutions have developed a preference to either run scared or dismiss real discourse rather than challenge, engage and understand. If the answer to Britain’s first Black female MP parsing the lived experience of racism is to suspend her and confect another political controversy, then the message is that you may not ever say anything difficult at all.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

With the lifting of the superinjunction, we can all see where that has ledFri 18 Jul 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 07.40 EDTShareWhat odds on a public inquiry into theAfghan superinjunction? Gold-plated, judge-led, three years of fun and games, that is how British politics normally kicks an embarrassment into the long grass. And what odds on who will get off scot free – Tony Blair?The more we pick away at the stages of this fiasco, the more from the start one blunder seemed to follow inevitably from another. There was no reason for theBritish invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. If the US wanted revenge on the Kabul regime for harbouring al-Qaida after 9/11, it could have done what Donald Trump did last month to Iran. A savage retaliatory blow against the country’s rulers would have made the point.The invocationofarticle 5of the Nato treaty to justify an invasion of Afghanistan was ridiculous. America’s security was not remotely threatened by terrorism directed from Kabul, any more than was Britain’s. Other Nato powers, bullied into showing sympathy, limited themselves to minimal non-fighting roles. Once Kabul had been attacked and the Taliban had fled, caution and common sense indicated swift withdrawal. The US military command wanted no invasion.Blair was insistent inpressing Bush for “nation-building”, against considerable US scepticism. He wasdesperate for Britainto punch above its weight. In hisChicago speech in 1999, he had advocated the new Blair “doctrine of international community”,that of altruistic intervention. It was basically a call for more wars. Clinton’s office described Blair’s intervention in Kosovo as the prime minister “sprinkling too much adrenaline on his cornflakes”. When war duly arrived, Blair was insistent that British submarines fire thefirst barrage of missiles on Kabul. He told the 2001 Labour conference: “We will not walk away from Afghanistan, as the outside world has done so many times before … There is only one outcome: our victory not theirs.”Afghans have been betrayed yet again by this shocking UK data leak – and many don’t even know if they’re affected | Diane TaylorRead moreThere followed a full-scale British occupation that culminated, in 2006, in a reckless, failed attemptto suppress the Taliban in Helmand. One result was that for 20 years, a sizeable chunk of Afghanistan’s modest administrative class found themselves employed by western occupying powers, including Britain. As the Taliban filtered back, these people assumed, perhaps foolishly, that the good old British empire would not desert them.When the list of19,000collaborators in the British occupation was leaked, the danger was obvious. The Ministry of Defence was alerted that an anonymous member of a Facebook group had said he had the database and was threatening to post it in full. Not knowing if the list had been shared with the Taliban, the government acted to protect those named.The defence secretary at the time, Ben Wallace, understandably wanted to keep the fact a secret just in case. A judge understandably agreed, for a while. But neither decision would stand the test of time – or the mounting embarrassment. The Treasury cost of honouring the list was not millions but billions.The bulk of the blame must lie with the fact of the invasion and subsequent departure. The effort of the House of Commons this week to make the leak issue partisan was pitiful. Neither the cabinet nor parliament tried to stop Blair’s original occupation. In 2010, afternine years, it still voted overwhelmingly in favour of Britain’s presence continuing. Parliament was equally in favour of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. When in 2021 Boris Johnson finally joined the US in cutting and running, parliament washed its hands of the whole affair.In Afghanistan,457 British soldiers died. The cost of the war to the UK taxpayer was £30bn. Some 200,000 Afghans also died and29,700 were accepted for resettlementbetween 2021 and 2024. These figures are the bill for the outrage over 9/11 and were utterly unnecessary. No other European country joined the US on anything like the same scale as Britain. There has not been a word of inquiry into who should carry any degree of personal responsibility.Britain attempted to withdraw from its empire with dignity over the course of the 20th century. It did not always succeed. Yet, ever since, its rulers have seemed in a state of lingering regret. Like Blair, they have harboured a tarnished yearning for a Britain still playing a role on the world stage, a violent one if need be.Though Britain was never remotely threatened, Blair was almost always at war, in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. David Cameron was bitten with the same bug, intervening in Libya and trying to do so in Syria. He builttwo giant aircraft carriers, one of which Boris Johnson could not resistsending to the South China Sea. Why was never explained.If Trump has any virtue it has been in telling Europe that the old global interventionism is over. The US is fed up with being Europe’s policeman. The continent should be realistic and look after its own business. But even he could not resist the machismo of bombing Iran.The lesson of the leak is not that emails are never safe. That surely is known. The real lesson is that Britain should never have spent a quarter of a century trying to impose its rule onAfghanistanin the first place.

I worked for more than a decade as a lawyer advising high net worth individuals, and many of the people I worked with had assets worth more than £10m. It was commonplace to refer to their luxury apartments – usually in neighbourhoods like Kensington or Chelsea – as “safety deposit boxes in the sky”. My work involved advising them on how to pass on assets such as these pieds-à-terre and country piles in the home counties while minimising their taxes.Many of the super-rich have ties all over the world, decamping to homes in the south of France in the summer, or their Alpine chalets for ski holidays. Some have constructed more contrived connections to places like Singapore or Bermuda to reduce their tax bills. But regardless of their undeniable worldliness, the super-rich love living in the UK.There is a prestige to owning property in the UK. A bolthole in London allows you to visit the Frieze art fair in Regent’s Park or sit on Centre Court at Wimbledon. On the practical side, many are enticed by how easy it is to set up and conduct business in the UK. Of paramount concern to certain ultra-wealthy families is that the UK offers peace of mind in terms of affording them refuge from those who might otherwise see them as a target for kidnapping in other jurisdictions.Last week, the go-to British magazine for millionaires and wealth advisory professionals, Spear’s Magazine, published ajubilant articlecelebrating the influx of wealthy Americans to the UK. As it turns out, the UK is one of the top choices for Hollywood stars and Silicon Valley big shots looking for a comfortable life away from Donald Trump’s chaos.This hasn’t stopped the Times from publishing endless doomsday prophecies of a wealth exodus on an epic scale. The endlessly repeated trope is that the ultra-wealthy will flee at the first signs of higher taxes, taking their tax revenue and business investments with them, and having the overall effect of lowering growth. However,recent researchby Tax Justice Network, with Patriotic Millionaires and Tax Justice UK, discredited previous, similar claims as vastly overexaggerated.What isn’t overexaggerated are concerns of slow growth and declining living standards in the UK. British society is becoming ever more unequal, unfair and frankly unsustainable. If mid-career professionals earning £100k a yearstruggle to buy property in Londonand maintain a standard of life they’re happy with, while contributingmore than 60% of income tax receipts, what does that say of the vast majority of British residents who earn considerably less or are on universal credit?We have an economy in which work doesn’t pay – the income of people who work for a living is taxed at higher rates than that of those who earn money from simply having money. Before becoming a private wealth lawyer, I hadn’t realised that the way the ultra-wealthy earn their income is quite different from the majority of us. While the average person earns money from their daily work, the ultra-wealthy make eye-watering sums simply from owning assets. They generate wealth from investment funds and rent and sales profits from their property empires.Instead of addressing this unfairness, this week Rachel Reeves announced plans tofurther deregulatethe financial sector, giving another benefit to the already wealthy by boosting speculative capital and hoping it trickles down. Instead of taxing wealth or backing public investment, the chancellor’s Mansion House speech doubled down on prioritising the City of London over serious economic renewal in all sectors and areas of the UK. Councils will continue to be unable to meet the needs of their communities. NHS waiting lists will continue to rise. Government will fail to prepare for climate adaptation and mitigation.What is a wealth tax and would it work in the UK?Read moreI now work with people focused on giving away their wealth. It’s common for the ultra-wealthy to believe they deserve all the privilege they have and should “protect” it at all costs. Usually, this means avoiding tax. However, my current clients have broken free from such ideas. They recognise the privileges they have and acknowledge that they have benefited from a tax system that protects their wealth at the expense of ordinary people. Many of them tell me they see their responsibility of paying higher taxes on their wealth as merely practising good citizenship and contributing to the benefits of living in the UK. After all, the beautiful parks their children play in, and the unparalleled museums they enjoy, are funded by public money.The moral and pragmatic case for a wealth tax is clear. Those with the broadest shoulders can and should contribute more. An annual wealth tax of 2% on assets of more than £10m would affect only 20,000 people and would go part of the way to redressing the inequality between wealth and income. The revenue could be invested in local councils, schools, the NHS. And even help promote sustainable, green innovation to shelter us from the effects of the climate crisis. All while hardly making the slightest difference to the ultra-wealthy or their quality of life, as they often tell me.Themajority of the public supportshigher taxes on wealth – including Conservative voters. It’s time for Labour to start making political choices that benefit all those living in the UK.Stephanie Brobbey is founder and chief executive officer of the Good Ancestor MovementExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionThe super-richRachel ReevesLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Shell companies. Unincorporated associations. Anonymous donations routed through digital campaigns between elections. All legal. All ripe for abuse. And now, a new gateway has opened: cryptocurrency.When someone buys a cryptocurrency their identity is anonymous, but the transaction itself is recorded on the blockchain and is publicly visible. So far we knowthat this anonymity has allowed cryptocurrencies to be used to fund everything from sanctions evasion to election interference. Arecent reportfrom theCentre for Information Resiliencerevealed that A7A5, a new “digital rouble”, has already been linked to sanctions evasions by Russians. The report also found that Ilan Shor, a fugitive oligarch who has been accused of being involved with Russian-backed attempts to meddle in Moldovan elections, had allegedly used the currency to funnel at least $39m (£29m) into the bank accounts of thousands of Moldovans in exchange for their votes.In Britain, Reform UK has already declared that it plans toaccept crypto donations.This is the new frontier of campaign financing. Cryptocurrencies give people plenty of ways to hide, obscuring who is funding political parties and what they might want in return.Online “mixers”can blend an individual’s cryptocurrency with others, making it practically impossible to trace the origin of individual coins. People can also donate using multiple crypto wallets with different addresses, splitting large donations into smaller amounts that bypass the reporting thresholds for political donations.This is a system custom-built for hostile actors and is wide open to abuse, especially by those who launder foreign money into the bank accounts of UK citizens before passing it to British political parties. And Russia is ready to move. It has spentabout £230msubverting democracies in at least 24 countries since 2014.This week, ministers willtable a mini white paperthat will prepare the ground for a new elections bill. It contains some good ideas. The government will introduce tougher “know your donor” rules. But it is impossible to really know your donor if they have given money in crypto. The better solution would be banning crypto donations outright (Ireland and Brazil have already done so). The government should also ban unchecked, unverified and unlimited companies or associations – which aren’t required to file accounts – from donating cash. Shadowy groups known as “unincorporated associations” have channelledmore than £60minto British politics in the past two decades, but do not have to file accounts or explain where their money comes from.It is all too easy to earn money abroad and route it into the bank account of a UK citizen, from where it is then forwarded to a political party. This creates huge vulnerabilities. In 2022, theNew York Times reportedconcerns that money transferred from a Russian bank account into the bank account of a UK citizen might have made its way onward into the coffers of the Conservative party. Ehud Sheleg, the UK citizen, said that his donation to the party was unconnected to a gift from his Russian father-in-law, and the Electoral Commission later said they had found no grounds to investigate the donation.When I reported it to the National Crime Agency, it told me there was no offence because ultimately a UK citizen wrote the cheque to the Tories. There is no evidence that Sheleg was doing anything wrong. But this mechanism could be exploited by bad actors. For that reason, only profits or income earned in the UK should be allowed to fund political parties.The National Crime Agency and Electoral Commission need more resourcesif they are to investigate these problems effectively. And they need to be able to impose much larger fines. Labour pledged in its manifesto to strengthen the rules on political donations. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, has worked with clarity to tackle the dirty money that infects global politics – and to shut down London’s role as the world’s favourite laundromat. Ministers are waking up to the threat of dark money, and a new elections bill is good news for those who want to clean up politics. But only if we close the loopholes.

It’s a rightwing agitator’s dream. “The real disinformation,”wrote Dominic Cummingson X, a platform notably awash with real disinformation, “is the regime media.” Yes, that Dominic Cummings.It was hard enough already to counter paranoia about allegedgrooming gangcover-ups,policing of immigrant communitiesor imaginary supposed plots to flood the country with refugees just so they can vote Labour. Now, like stopped clocks fleetingly getting the time right twice a day, the usual suspects will pounce: see, the deep statedoeslie to you! Meanwhile fantasists of all political stripes and none, whose go-to explanation for why the hated mainstream media mysteriously isn’t covering their pet theory is invariably “there must be a superinjunction”, will have a field day.But you don’t have to wear a tinfoil hat to find this particular cover-up unnerving. In parliament, the Conservative MP Mark Pritchard asked the defence secretary, John Healey, how anyone could be sure there were no other government superinjunctions active. If there were, he added, presumably Healey couldn’t tell him anyway.How does anyone know who to trust, in an era when excess naivety and unwarranted suspicion can both have demonstrably terrible consequences? It’s not just a political question.This week, Constance Marten and Mark Gordonwere convictedof the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn daughter Victoria, who died sleeping in a tent on a freezing January night while her parents were on the run from social workers, their families, and authority in general. The couple, whose first four children were already in care, were probably right to fear her being taken from them. But at least she could have lived, if they’d trusted social services enough to engage.The week before, it emerged that achild had diedin Liverpool of measles, a completely preventable disease of which there have been continuing outbreaks thanks to a complex mix of complex factors, including vaccine scepticism and mistrust of the medical establishment. (Though it’s not known if this poor child was vaccinated – measles can be dangerous for people with compromised immune systems even if they’ve had the jab – the point of keeping vaccine uptake high is to protect the vulnerable, by preventing outbreaks such as the one currently active in the north-west.)In the US, meanwhile, Donald Trump has enraged his own fanbase byinsisting thatonly “stupid people” believe there was a government cover-up over the death of the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein – a cherished Maga belief Trump seemedhappy to stokeback when the idea of a plot to protect some wicked liberal elite suited him. There would be more schadenfreude in seeing the president hoist by his own post-truth petard, if his followers didn’t have a provencapacity for violencewhen angered.What ties these very different stories together is a creeping crisis of faith in institutions from medicine to the law, politics to policing, which has begun to feel actively dangerous. Yet knowing that doesn’t make reversing it any easier.I’ve been thinking about this on and off for months, since joining a thinktank roundtable on restoring public trust that posed some difficult practical questions. My tuppence worth was on rock-bottom levels of trust in the media. But would a return to believing everything you read or hear be healthy? I can’t in all conscience say so: not when there are so many underregulated new platforms I wouldn’t trust to tell the time of day, and AI fakes are getting so sophisticated. Trusting the media less islogical,maybe even necessary,in the circumstances. Yet rational scepticism can all too quickly spiral into blanket suspicion of everything and everyone, justified or not. No society can function like that.One answer is that where trust is no longer automatic, powerful institutions can earn it back by submitting to clear checks and balances. And that’s exactly what didn’t happen with the Ministry of Defence superinjunction.Faced with a catastrophic leak – a soldier emailing a spreadsheet of names that put up to 100,000 Afghans potentially at risk – the then Conservative government had a moral duty to protect those endangered. Though it’s likely many were already identifiable as Taliban targets via other means, it wasn’t unreasonable to seek a brief temporary news blackout while organising an evacuation, followed by full public disclosure at the earliest safe opportunity.But it should have been brief – nothing like a 600-day injunction – and crucially parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC)should have been broughtinto the loop to ensure it was. Invented to provide democratic oversight in sensitive situations when briefing every last gossipy backbencher is impractical, the ISC could have acted as guarantors of the public’s right to know. Instead, it was left to an incoming Labour defence secretary to question whether spending billions on secretively righting past wrongs was the best use of public money, prompting a review that collapsed the whole house of cards.Trust in the British state, at home and abroad, will inevitably be the casualty. While about 24,000 of those named in the leak are already in Britain or on the way, the rest are being expected simply to accept the revised view that they’re safe where they are. Amid the chaos, as the former veterans ministerJohnny Mercer points out, it’s likely some with frankly tenuous connections to the UK gained sanctuary essentially for being victims of British ineptitude, while some Afghan special forces soldiers who bravely fought the Taliban alongside the British (and were promised they’d be looked after as a result) have been puzzlingly left behind. That is the kind of injustice that echoes down generations.Back home, meanwhile, ministers must now brace for far-right attempts to exploit this scandal, and for some uncomfortable questions.Was the superinjunction really about saving lives, sparing political blushes, avoiding inflaming already high tensions over immigration or all of the above? And when exactly would the MoD have voluntarily confessed, if a handful of journalists – the same old legacy media that apparently nobody trusts – hadn’t got wind of what happened?For that’s the paradox, right there: sometimes the alternatives to putting your faith in an institution which has previously failed you – be it social services, doctors, journalists or conventional politics – are even worse. Trust everybody, and you might get taken for a fool. Trust nobody, and youbecomethe fool. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way round that.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More than a decade on, the show is back – and I’ve learned my own lessonsFri 18 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 11.47 EDTShareWhen I was little I imagined, as most children probably do, that the grownups had things all worked out and someday I would find myself on the other side of a clear boundary. Adolescence on one side; maturity, responsibility, self-assuredness, composition on the other.A few weeks ago I turned 35. As the day ticked closer, I found that old childhood suspicion creeping in again; if any birthday should serve as a demarcator of that boundary, it should be this one, shouldn’t it? And now, as the days tick further from that imagined inflection point, it has become a reinforcement of probably the single biggest lesson I have taken away from “adulthood”: that most of us are simply winging it most of the time, through a process of becoming that never quite reachesbecome.There is an odd sort of book-end, however, to my adulthood so far: a French comedy show called Bref, its two seasons spaced more than a decade apart. When I was 22 I left my country, the US, and let a new one,France, become a part of me. Bref had come out in 2011, the year before I showed up in Strasbourg.At the time, the series was notable for the way it was structured: 82 episodes, each between one and two minutes in length, featuring an ultra-fast voiceover (like the part in drug adverts on US television where they zoom through all the possible side effects). I used Bref as a supplement to my French classes – as each short episode could be watched again and again until I had learned to pick out the individual words, until they no longer flowed together in one expressive mass.Throughout those 82 episodes, the rapid-fire narrator, “Je”(written and played by Kyan Khojandi), was the archetype of a 30-year-old “kind of loser” living in Paris. The show moved so quickly in part because his life did; from party to party, bad joke to bad joke, obsession to obsession, relationship to relationship. Until, of course, it all blows up on him.Fourteen years later, in 2025, Bref 2 opens with Je now in his early 40s, in the immediate aftermath of the wreckage of yet another short-lived but intense relationship that accelerated too fast and crashed. He has been living the same cycle, over and over, while everyone else has evolved in some way – especially his exes. The narration is slower this time, with six normal-length episodes rather than 82 hyperspeed ones, perhaps because the themes are deeper, life is thicker, and we can’t move through it so fast any more, in a way that my fellow millennials can probably relate to. Bouncing from party to party isn’t as appealing; sometimes, you just want to stare at the tree right there outside the window, wondering to the people there with you what that tree must think about us after everything it has observed in return.Bref 2 is funny and moving, and a nostalgia trip for the French millennial audience for whom it became a cultural point of reference. Among the deeper themes that have emerged for Je in the past 14 years are the things that hold us back, or ways we hold ourselves back. The ennui that comes with too many first dates and nothing really materialising. The ways we put on masks to please others and how that just fails us in the end. The chances we take – or don’t. The times we go right up to the line, then drop the ball, the failure haunting us.What Khojandi doesn’t touch on much is regret. I used to fixate on my regrets, constantly second-guessing myself, spinning out alternative universes, wondering if any of them were potentially better. If I might be happier in them.When you become an immigrant, when you leave the place you are from for good, there is a rending that occurs – within you, and of you and the people who have not departed with you. It is linguistic, it is geographic. It exists in time and in cultural references. In what we laugh at, in what tugs at our emotions. But will I ever feel fully French, I still find myself wondering sometimes, even as I know without question that I no longer feel fully American. When I sing along toFrance Gallat 1am, is my acquired reference just as legitimate as a memory of being in my parents’ car, listening to it while driving to a summer holiday?There is loss here, yes, but also more than that: it is a big bang, a birth of a new universe. And along with it, a realisation that some of the things I once regretted were indispensable in putting me exactly where I am right now: with a place that has become a part of me as much as I have become a part of it.What do I want at 35? To put energy back into relationships with the people I call family – both inherited and chosen. To be more at ease with owning the times and instances when I have been wrong or have failed, rather than lingering in mental loops. To still be open to the universe throwing me into the unexpected, like a surprisingly deep conversation with a stranger on a train. To surround myself with friends who want to ask big, difficult questions and who are OK to sit with the discomfort of there often not being a satisfying answer.One of those uncomfortable things with no real answer is that I didn’t turn 35 in a vacuum. Years ago, after I stood as atémoin, or witness, at my friend Guillaume’s wedding, he sent me a note written on the back of a print. “I hope that this is just the beginning of a lifelong conversation about all the beautiful and horrible things we learn and witness along the way,” he wrote.I’m living a life that is far more incredible than I would have imagined when I was 22, while watching a world that is so much worse:where one old man oversees a genocide in Gaza; a second old man launches, day after day, missiles, drones and bombs at civilians in Ukraine; a third old man threatens to do the same to Taiwan; a fourth old man ramps up the logging and the drilling and the pollution, and salivates at the idea of modern-dayconcentration camps.Khojandi’s character Je, seems to have been into video games as a kid: at the end of Bref 2, he remarks that he had always thought of life as being like a video game, if he did things right he would level up and get to where he needed to go. As a kid, I was into books and Lego. I think the analogy they provide is a better one. The Lego came with a plan but, once you built what you were supposed to, starting over and letting your imagination run wild was far more fun. As for books, the best stories are often threaded with moments that suddenly make the preceding pages make sense in a different way than the reader first understood.At 35 I don’t have answers. I’m both a reader and an author when it comes to my life. But I do have bricks and pages. And 35 years from now, I hope the way I’ve stacked the bricks, and what I’ve written on the pages, will make sense in a way I can’t yet see.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionTelevisionEuropeChildrenMigrationYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

It has also left some in the TV world wondering if the show requires a wider refresh.Before a long-waited report on the allegations over his behaviour, Wallace’s five-page post included an admission he had used inappropriate language, but he claimed to have been “cleared of the most serious and sensational accusations”. He also revealed a recent autism diagnosis and complained offacing an “incredible injustice”.Report on Gregg Wallace’s behaviour upholds 45 claims against ex-BBC presenterRead moreAt Banijay’s dinner, its boss, Patrick Holland, made no attempt to dodge Wallace’s outburst, instead emphasising the amount of work that had gone into the lawyer-led report. As they made small talk over the crab salad, his executives already knew the show was about to be plunged into deeper peril.Wallace’s fellow presenter, John Torode, was also the subject of a substantiated complaint in the report. He wasn’t named, but given the furore it seemed unlikely his identity would be kept under wraps for long.When the report finally arrived on Monday,it substantiated 45 allegations against Wallace. Meanwhile, Torode opted to reveal he was the subject of a substantiated complaint overthe use of racist language, which he believes never happened.Richard Osman, whose House of Games show is part of the Banijay stable, said on his The Rest Is Entertainment podcast this week that Torode had been accused of using “the worst racial slur there is”. The Sun reported Torode used the word when he repeated lyrics from Kanye West’s track Gold Digger at an after-work gathering six or seven years ago. He denies the incident took place.BBC bosses concluded Wallace could not change his behaviour and wrote to him telling him so. Banijay and theBBCopted not to renew Torode’s contract. However, Torode will continue to be something of a spectre at the feast for the rest of the year, having already filmed Christmas specials.“It’s been a complete mess,” said the TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan. “This is a show which features judges reviewing food. How could it result in the loss of two presenters from a really big, well-known programme so quickly? To lose one presenter is bad enough. To lose two this quickly feels shocking and surprising.“Particularly in light of everything that’s happened, this is an opportunity for both the BBC and Banijay to wipe the slate clean. When a show starts with a new lineup of presenters, it does attract new audiences who would want the show to feel fresh.”A mess it may be, but the overwhelming feeling in the television world is that even such a high-profile crisis will not dislodge the show’s status as a broadcasting behemoth.View image in fullscreenGrace Dent, who became a judge on Celebrity MasterChef alongside John Torode, is one of a pool of potential presenters who could replace him on the main show.Photograph: BBC/PAThe safety of its long-term status is down to its undimmed appeal, producing multiple new adaptations every year even after three decades. Four new versions were launched globally in 2024, according to analysis by K7 Media, with 25 existing versions returning to screens last year. There have so far been more than 60 versions of the show launched globally. It is a major money-spinner, even spawning its own line of kitchenware.For the BBC, meanwhile, it is a cornerstone of traditional schedules. In any given week, it is more likely than not that some version of the show is on the airwaves. As a result, the appetite for doing something radical – either a break or an overhaul – is low.Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, has already thrown his weight behind the show – the corporation is tied to production until 2028. It has also invested in moving production to Birmingham, where it is now filmed in the old Banana Warehouse building in Digbeth. The move has helped its claims to be driving jobs out of London, something the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, is watching closely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saturday Kitchen Live’s Matt Tebbutt is regarded as a frontrunner for one of the roles.View image in fullscreenThe BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, is backing the show, which will stay in production until 2028.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersIf the long-term future of the show looks safe enough, the BBC is still left with a knotty short-term problem. The latest series of MasterChefhas been delivered, but not shown. Wallace appears in all of it apart from the final – Torode appears throughout.The BBC has already been speaking to contestants about what to do with the series. Davie is very keen to press ahead, given the effort they have put in. Figures close to the show are also pushing for it to be shown, arguing the presenters have never been the core of the title.“The programme is filled with warmth, support and leaves a legacy of life-changing proportions for the contestants,” said one. “The headlines really don’t share the love that there is across the incredible team and family of winners and finalists who adore and care passionately about what they do.”There could be one last unwelcome flurry before things improve for MasterChef’s makers. Comments from Wallace’s social media missive that began the barrage of bad news still hang over them. He made it clear he “will not go quietly”.While an updated post from Wallace no longer includes those remarks, both Banijay and the BBC are braced for a further media outing from one or both of their former presenters.Perhaps at that point they can once again focus on the programme’s strengths. As one despairing and perplexed MasterChef insider observed at the end of a bruising fortnight: “The star of the show was always the food.”Explore more on these topicsMasterChefGregg WallaceBBCTelevisionFood TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The multiverse is collapsing, timelines are unravelling, box office numbers are wobbling, theKang planis in tatters and Blade is on its ninth script. So, naturally, Marvel’s answer is to hand the reins to a stretchy man in sensible shoes who once broke the entire multiverse.Yes, according toThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsdirector Matt Shakman, the awesome foursome’s Reed Richards is being lined up as the new leader of Earth’s mightiest heroes. Or at least, he is (at times) in the comics, and it looks increasingly like he might be the only reality-straddling, buttoned up polymathable to take on this job on the big screen.“He goes from being the nerdy scientist who’s locked away in the lab, to the husband and the father who’d do anything to protect his family, to the guy who’s leading the Avengers,” Shakman told Variety,in a new interview ahead of the release of First Steps. “I realised that the version we were building had to have all of those elements.”With the Fantastic Four’s debut in theMarvelCinematic Universe now only a week away, it’s perhaps the right time to take a look at exactly what kind of man Marvel might be nudging into the empty chair. Let’s not forget that this is a mantle once sort of jointly held by Iron Man and Captain America.View image in fullscreenFrom nerdy scientist to man in charge … Pascal in Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Jay Maidment/20th Century Studios/Marvel StudiosReed Richards, by contrast, is less a natural leader than he is the kind of man who accidentally invents godhood before breakfast. In the comics, he’s a genius, a father, a sometimes war criminal, and very occasionally the most powerful being in existence. If Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark was all ego, charisma and self-loathing in a can, and Chris Evans’s Steve Rogers was apple pie and emotional repression with the ability to bench-press liberty, then Reed is the guy who treats collapsing timelines like a crossword puzzle and has, on more than one occasion in the comics, tried to solve galactic crises using charts.Perhaps the difference this time around (after two attempts to bring the Fantastic Four to the big screen during the 20th Century Fox era) is that Richards is now being played by Pedro Pascal, an actor who has already proven inThe Mandalorianthat he can project warmth, gravitas and reluctant-dad energy despite wearing a bucket on his head. If anyone can revive Marvel, it’s the guy who transformed what should have been another run-of-the-mill zombie video game adaptation (The Last of Us) into high-end post-apocalyptic art-house TV.Giving Reed Richards the top job also speaks volumes about where the MCU is right now. Gone are the days of heroes with moral codes, defined character arcs, and just one version of themselves per universe. We’re deep into the age of collapse and crossover, where no one knows who’s running what, where half the audience are Googling “Wait, who is that?” during every post-credits scene, and the only thing holding the multiverse together is the vague promise thatDowney’s Doctor Doomwill eventually reboot the franchise with the sheer force of his contempt.View image in fullscreenDad energy … Pascal with Bella Ramsey in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBO/APAll of which brings us tohints this week(denied by Shakman) that the metal-plated menace might make his first appearance in First Steps, before presumably following Marvel’s first family into the main MCU in next year’sAvengers: Doomsday. If Reed is Marvel’s reset button, Doom is its nuclear option — the character you deploy when you’ve run out of timelines, villains, and narrative excuses.The idea of Reed going up against a twisted variant of the previous Avengers figurehead – if this new Doom really is some kind of alternate-universe Tony Stark with a god complex and a cloak budget – has a certain multiverse-bending symmetry to it. So why not have Reed face him down as a new type of Avengers leader? They might just be from the same universe, and this is a battle that has been carried out countless times in print. Mister Fantastic is brilliant. He’s brave. And he’s got a pretty impressive track record of saving all of existence – which could come in useful when you’re facing the sort of supervillain who treats the fabric of existence like a mood board for his ego.Unlike Stark or Rogers, Reed doesn’t need a cool catchphrase, or a billion-dollar suit with built-in sarcasm. He just needs a quiet room, a few hundred monitors, and the freedom to quietly map the collapse of the multiverse.Explore more on these topicsMarvelWeek in geekPedro PascalSuperhero moviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has an Arm. That’s what the harbour’s long walkway into the Channel is called. It is a suitably surreal, even grotesque setting for theFolkestone Triennialartworks that infest its salty nooks and crannies – or armpits and elbow crooks. Laure Prouvost has placed a mutant seabird, with three heads and an electric plug on its tail, on the adjacent concrete stump of the defunct ferry terminal. Surprising? Not really if you have just visited The Ministry of Sewers, an installation by Cooking Sections that documents and protests the poisoning of our rivers and seas.View image in fullscreenPoison pen-pushers … The Ministry of Sewers by Cooking Sections at Folkestone Triennial.Photograph: Thierry BalThere’s nothing like an exhibit on the scale of Britain’s water pollution to kick off a day at the seaside. It’s cloudy when I visit, the cliffs and sea swathed in white mist and the water under the Arm looking like a detergent soup. It all adds to the uncanny mood. And art doesn’t come much more uncanny than the sculpture by Dorothy Cross near the far end of the Arm. You have to go down soaking wet, concrete steps to a recess with a precipitous opening to the evil-looking sea. “Try not to fall in,” says the attendant, who stays up above. Here you find a massive block of blood-coloured marble, as if a giant tuna steak had been stashed here by fish smugglers. The sides are smooth, the top uneven and rough. Out of this earthy hulk Cross has carved several pairs of feet in hyperrealistic detail, nervously walking its beach-like surface. They face out to sea, as if about to make a bold leap into the blue-green water, to find a better life.Cross has made a monument to migrants. The marble she has used is from Syria, the feet pattering over it full of fear and hope. These lifelike appendages and the surface on which they stand echo Magritte’s surrealist 1934 painting The Red Model, of disembodied feet on red ground, while her use of massive, raw stone to suggest infinite sorrow - the weight of the world - shows she understands Michelangelo. This is a superb sculpture, brilliantly sited. It would be worth visiting Folkestone just to see it.But there’s more – if you fancy a walk. Up above the cliffs, on steep green downs guarded by Martello towers built to fend off invasion during the Napoleonic wars, are a string of thoughtful, often witty artworks. A monolith that looks as if it were made from glue and plastic stands alone on a mowed hill, facing the sea. Approaching, you read the words “Curse dissolved”. That’s heartening. The brochure describes this piece by South African artist Dineo Seshee Raisibe Bopape as “meditative” but it made me laugh. What is the curse? Who lifted it?View image in fullscreenInfinite sorrow … Red Erratic by Dorothy Cross at Folkestone Triennial.Photograph: Thierry BalI chew on this as I climb to a white circular tower inside which Katie Paterson also plays with magic. Paterson shows, on curving display tables inside the round room where red-coated soldiers once lived, a collection of mystic charms from different times and places. There are images of ancient Egyptian gods, Buddhist amulets and a tiny figure of the Mesopotamian demon Pazuzu who features in The Exorcist.Each replica is cast in materials that bear witness to planetary crisis, including space debris from satellites and plastic from the Mariana trench. Paterson has a track record of working with scientists to get her hands on such exotic materials. Her installation is a more refined version of the Ministry of Sewers, a sly way to show us that we are turning everything to crap. These amulets are bluntly satirical. They seem to mock the magical thinking of those who would wish away the Earth’s crisis.View image in fullscreenSweetening the picture …Four-year-old Bram Kimm eats an art ice-cream by Emeka Ogboh at Folkestone Triennial.Photograph: Lia Toby/PAIf you head on to the next Martello tower you might be momentarily cheered up by Jennifer Tee’s wavy picture of a giant kelp, mapped in the grass in brown bricks which also have sea kelp and other life forms imprinted on their surfaces. It makes you look out to the sea below and imagine the threatened life it holds.There are jollities to be found in this seaside art trail – for the kids, Monster Chetwynd has started building an adventure playground, and down in the harbour you can get Emeka Ogboh’s “artist designed ice-cream”. But then I find huge burial urns littered in the high moorland overlooking the misty Channel. Sara Trillo has modelled these deathly objects on bronze age grave goods. They return you to melancholy: the view from here is as bleak as it is beautiful.Folkestone Triennial opens on 19 JulyExplore more on these topicsFolkestone TriennialArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

The latest and possibly last such nail is the cancellation of The Late Show, theCBSlate-night talkshow hosted byStephen Colbertsince the fall of 2015, and originated by David Letterman when the network poached him from NBC in 1993. At this point, Trump hasn’t just made topical late-night comedy look outdated, hackneyed and an insufficient response to his reign of terror; he’s also made a chunk of it flat-out go away.There will be time to eulogize Colbert’s particular talkshow style later; the Late Show isn’t leaving the air for another 10 months, when his contract is up. Surely that leaves plenty more time to savage the president – and Colbert has been in this slot since right around the time Trump became a real contender in the presidential race, so why has this only now come to a head? Seemingly because the axing of the Late Show franchise follows the$16m settlementof afrivolous Trump lawsuitagainst CBS and their newsmagazine show 60 Minutes over the show’s editing of a 2024 interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Colbert madegreat funof his bosses’ payout as a cowardly “bribe” designed to appease the Trump administration, who are in the position to approve or deny the sale of Paramount, the corporate owners of CBS, to the company Skydance. In other words, the pre-merger nixing a comedian who regularly goofs on Trump on network TV seems like a convenient bit of timing – maybe even an unspoken bonus to go along with those millions of dollars.The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to end in 2026 as CBS cancels showRead moreThe network, of course, has characterized the decision as “purely financial” amid a period when most traditional late-night shows have struggled. As excuses go, it’s not entirely unconvincing. After all, Colbert isn’t being replaced with another host; The Late Show is simply going the same route as its short-lived companion series After Midnight (and The Late Late Show before it).CBSis surrendering the late-night block entirely. This represents a major retreat after the Letterman deal made the network a genuine player for the first time in ages. Presumably it’s back to reruns and old movies going forward.In that sense, this decision does transcend politics. CBS has ripped off a bandage that the big three networks have been applying to similar wounds for years. Late-night programming simply doesn’t mean as much as it used to, with smaller network lead-ins from primetime lineups and more audience choices for comedy, talk, music or even the dopey celeb games thatJimmy Fallonthrows together.Saturday Night Livehas retained some cultural cachet, thanks to a combination of lower commitment (20 episodes a year, on a night where many people don’t have work the next day, versus eight times as many, all airing on weeknights), legacy branding (it’s still known as a star showcase and political comedy go-to, no matter how wan those cold-open sketches get), and sketch comedy that travels well online. These days, it’s routinely one of the highest-rated network shows of the week when it airs a new episode, offering an encouraging sign that old time-slot rules about viewership no longer apply. It’s also extremely expensive to produce and difficult to replicate, which nonetheless looks more viable than the tired talkshow format.View image in fullscreenKamala Harris and Stephen Colbert.Photograph: Scott Kowalchyk/©2024 CBS Broadcasting Inc.Broadly, this could be a good thing for comic minds including Colbert or Conan O’Brien. Some comedians seem unable to resist the siren call of late-night talkshows, chasing the Tonight Show dream even when that actual job remained out of reach. O’Brien is a singularly brilliant comedy writer and performer; as great as his late-night shows could be, in retrospect should he have spent three decades primarily in that waning medium? Colbert, meanwhile, did his strongest political satire playing a parody of a conservative commentator on The Daily Show and its later spinoff The Colbert Report. His warmth and sometimes-sharp humor made him a good “real” talkshow host – and by most standards, a successful one. In recent matchups, his Late Show has been themost-watchedsuch program across the major networks. That he can face cancellation anyway should (alongside O’Brien losing his Tonight Show gig years ago) signal to newcomers that the rarified air of the national late-night talkshow host is also getting pretty thin, maybe unbreathable.Stephen Colbert on Paramount’s $16m settlement with Trump: ‘Big fat bribe’Read moreYet Trump has sucked up some of that oxygen, too. Even with the “challenges” cited by CBS, it’s difficult to believe that vanquishing a longtime issuer of Trump mockery wasn’t at least considered a side benefit of canceling The Late Show. Even if the decision was, as claimed, a financial one, it accompanies another financial decision: that Paramount could afford to pay Trump $16m rather than proceed with litigation that many seemed to think they could win. That’s precisely the kind of expense that could diminish how, say, your late-night talkshow attracts more eyeballs than The Tonight Show.Beyond Trump personally smudging up the balance sheets, he’s helped to hasten the demise of late-night comedy simply by being himself, seeming to provide the perfect target: a venal, dimwitted perma-celebrity with an army of devoted sycophants. But after two non-consecutive administrations have flooded the zone with grotesqueries, performing a lightly zinging monologue or sketches as a warmup act for good-natured interviews seems unlikely to entice either those craving anti-Trump catharsis, or those desperate to believe in his strongman powers.That Colbert took a somewhat less cutesy approach than his competitor Fallon seemed to be all that was necessary to mark him as a troublemaker. The thing is, Trump might have ultimately consumed him either way. By providing a ready-made caricature of himself, intentionally or not, the president has beaten the system again. It may not be worth mourning the hacky, presidential-themed jokes we might miss in a future with fewer talkshows than ever. But it does feel like the enforcement of one of Trump’s more minor cruelties: the ability to see himself as the only real star in the world.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertCBSUS televisionDonald TrumpTV comedyComedyTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

David was carrying an enormous block of pitch.The cottage and its boundless garden sits on the shingle at Dungeness, a place of immeasurable strangeness and beauty on the Kentish coast. “After swimming,” Jarman wrote, “we built a brick hearth, lit a bonfire, and melted the pitch in an old tin can.” The two men then rushed back and forth between the studio and the pot, fetching brushes, gloves, pillows, barbed wire, crucifixes, prayer books, bullets, a model fighter plane and a telephone and set about tarring and feathering objects and affixing them on to canvases. “The hot tar splashed everywhere and set like shining jet,” he observed, with a childlike enthusiasm.The artworks in question are part of a series known as the Black Paintings, now the subject of a two-part chronological survey at Amanda Wilkinson Gallery in London. Jarman started working on these precious miniatures – most are only a forearm in width – in 1984. He used oils and found objects, building up from scarlet and gold underlayers. The red and sparkle seep through the impastoed black that encrusts and overwhelms everything on the surface. Broken glass, plastic figurines, a crushed Coca-Cola can, a model boat. When he was nominated for the Turner prize in 1986, Jarman exhibited about a dozen of the Black Paintings. The prize went to Gilbert and George, but Jarman remained focused, filming The Last of England in 1987 and The Garden in 1990, and gradually swapping oils for tar in his paintings.‘Sometimes he cast spells over them’: the raging beauty of Derek Jarman’s black paintingsRead moreJarman’s journals open with his exhilaration at the boundless possibility Dungeness clearly proffered (“there is more sunlight here than anywhere in Britain”) and the panic he experienced at the onset of the Great Storm of October 1987 (a neighbouring fisher’s hut disintegrated, “80 years of tar and paint parting like a rifle shot”). He had been diagnosed with HIV just months earlier. The works in the show, like the entries in the book, duly trace his alchemical art-making and the pain and outrage of his reckoning with that generational cataclysm. Motifs including Christ’s crown of thorns and blood surface in the works’ iconography.“He didn’t think of himself as a film-maker or a gardener or a painter or a political activist,” Wilkinson says. “He wasn’t a queer artist. He was an artist. All of that was his art.” Fabled punk chronicler Jon Savage, who was close to Jarman, recently emphasised to the gallerist how crucial this point is. “You mustn’t pin Derek down,” he said. “You can’t pin Derek down. You can’t put him in any box. He would always resist it.”Former lovers and friends often refer to Jarman’s agitated energy, his enthusiasm. He was the most colourful man they had ever met, someone who had crazy ideas every day, an interlocutor with whom conversation remains, in death, just as strong and empowering as it was when he was alive. And anyone who has one of these Black Paintings (there is no official tally; unknowns keep emerging) knows to treasure it deeply. “He just made everybody feel good,” Wilkinson says. “He was so charming and funny and charismatic. Everybody loved Derek Jarman.”The Black Paintings: A Chronology Part 2isat the Amanda Wilkinson Gallery, London, to13 SeptemberHis dark materials: five works from the exhibitionExit 1988 (main image)Jarman wasn’t afraid to be complex, Wilkinson says. And he remained resolute and bright-eyed at the end of his life. “I do not wish to die … yet,” he wrote in the summer of 1990, overwhelmed by the number of pills he has to take, his strength ebbing and flowing like the tide on the shingle outside. “I would love to see my garden through several summers.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Keith Collins Will Trust and Amanda WilkinsonDeath Is All Things We See Awake 1991Jarman’s films, writing and paintings are steeped in his reading. Here, he was inspired by a quote from the philosopher Heraclitus. “Jarman was fun, but he was a serious person,” Wilkinson says, “cultured, not in a snobby way but in a deep-thinking way.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Certainly his creepingly explosive turn in Shaan Sahota’s debut drama is unmissable. It carries this first play, almost eclipsing its imperfections.Better known for his screen work, he shone darkly inBenedict Andrews’ The Cherry Orchard last year as Chekhov’s peasant-stock merchant with a chip on his shoulder, Lopakhin. Angad, a British-Sikh politician hungry for the top job, is a self-made man too, or so he insists, even if he went to Harrow and Oxford: he calls himself the son of an immigrant baggage handler although his father went on to become a property magnate (and slum landlord, it is suggested) before his unexpected death.That death hails in the explosions of this drama. Angad has also inherited all his father’s wealth in a will that leaves nothing to his two sisters, Malicka (Shelley Conn) and Gyan (Thusitha Jayasundera), the latter having been the most dutiful of the siblings.Akhtar rises into his part, first unassuming and then viper-like, to loom over this family drama cum political play. The action first swivels between the two, with Chloe Lamford’s set rearranging itself from the casual opulence of Angad’s home to the white-collar functionalism of his office.It is exciting writing, fast and funny in its political satire, if clunky in plotting, with interludes of drum‘n’bass (music composed by Asaf Zohar) that captures the throb and power-hunger of Angad’s ambition. Snappily directed by Daniel Raggett, there are brilliant performances across the board.But there is too much stuffed in, jostling for air. Angad’s sisters dispute their father’s will, urging their brother to split the inheritance equally as he once promised. Angad resists, engaging in his own political battles. Slowly, their father’s toxic legacy is exposed and the wrangle over his will comes to signify misogyny, control, betrayal.Political satire in the Commons captures the cut and thrust of political scheming but in approximate, over-familiar ways. Parliamentarians are referred to by the name of their Oxford college, Angad’s communication’s adviser (Helena Wilson) is amusing but derivative, while the bullying whip, Ralph (Humphrey Ker), seems to be doing an impression of Peter Capaldi in The Thick of It. It is funnier in the gurdwara where a funeral becomes a political opportunity.View image in fullscreenAdeel Akhtar (Angad), Thusitha Jayasundera (Gyan) and Shelley Conn (Malicka) in The Estate at the National Theatre.Photograph: Helen MurrayBut the biggest hole is that none of it resembles the politics of today. Angad’s race is vaguely referenced but there is no mention of the big issues of our day, including immigration and the connection between race and Britishness, with all the undertones that brings. So it becomes hard to suspend disbelief as Angad rises and rises to power.His final speech is rousing and magnificently delivered. It interrogates whether we hold the self-serving politician of colour to different,better, values. Do we need Angad to hide his ambition in order to be acceptable? This question is lost in the tangle of other themes while some characters seem under-conceived, especially Angad’s wife (Dinita Gohil) – the play ducks out from showing us what makes her tick.The scandal on which the political plotline pivots is naive too. There is an equivalence set up between the rule of primogeniture in hereditary peerages and biases against women in Punjabi culture in order to show the double-standards employed against Angad. But the fact that the party gets in a spin over his refusal to overturn his father’s will rings a false note.Still, it is a sensational debut, and if the best kind of failure is one that bears too much ambition, there is an admirable kind of over-reaching here, and a great playwright in the making.At the Dorfman theatre, London, until 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreNational TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

As her raucous comedy Mandy returns, she talks about why she almost asked the BBC to pull it – and why she pretends to be a robot for an hour a dayFri 18 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareDiane Morgan went vegan a few months ago, so naturally, we meet for lunch at a restaurant in central London that almost entirely serves cheese. It is a humid, muggy day. “You don’t often hear people use the word ‘muggy’ now,” Morgan says, when I mention it. “How many people do you hear saying that, on a daily basis?” A pause. “Under the age of 85, I mean.”Morgan is famous for her deadpan style, which she has honed to perfection as the mockumentary hostPhilomena Cunk, and has put to use all over British TV, from the dour Liz inMotherlandto Kath in Ricky Gervais’s sitcomAfter Life, with a recent stint as the reporter Onya Doorstep inWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Over a lovely looking cheese-free salad, she admits that she is becoming more of a hippy as she gets older. “As I’m cascading towards the grave,” she laughs.View image in fullscreenComing up roses … Diane Morgan.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianMorgan is here to talk about the surreal, anarchicMandy, which she created, writes and stars in. It is “pure stupidity”, she says, gleefully, ahead of its fourth series. “There’s no meaning. You’re not going to learn anything. I don’t want tolearnanything.” The episodes are barely 15 minutes long, and see Mandy try out various jobs and get-rich-quick schemes, as she is forced to navigate fatbergs, psychics, illicit medical procedures, Russian gangsters and plane hijackings.Back in the day, Morgan and her friendMichael Spicer(“aYouTubesensation now”) would meet up at a pub – upstairs, in an empty room, not at the bar, she clarifies – with a bag of wigs, to play around with characters. One of them became Mandy. Mandy first made an appearance on Craig Cash’s short-lived 2016 sitcomRovers. When the BBC asked Morgan if she had any ideas for a new comedy, Mandy staged a comeback. They filmed a 15-minute pilot, in which Mandy covets a white leather sofa, leading to a Princess Di makeover that clashes with an experimental medical trial. “I never thought they’d pick it up, and I think that’s why it was so mad,” she says. “I had the freedom to do whatever I wanted.”It went out in 2019, and was soon picked up for a full series. “I thought, fantastic, made it, and then thought, oh shit.” She was so nervous about it airing that she almost phoned the BBC and asked them to pull it. “It felt really personal, in some ways,” she explains. In the new series, Mandy vomits ice-cream on to a small child’s head and gets “rancid lamb fat” injected into her backside. How personal are we talking? “I felt like people were going to go, what the hell is that? And I’m sure a lot of people did. It’s just what I felt like doing at the time, as a reaction to all those Fleabaggy dramas.Fleabag’s brilliant, but because it was so successful, there were loads of other shows that were a bit like that.”View image in fullscreenSweet treat … Morgan as Mandy, who has tried countless different jobs – and failed at all of them.Photograph: Richard Harrison/BBCMandy is not like that. Instead, it was inspired by more grotesque physical comedies such as Bottom. “Where they’re just beating each other up repeatedly. I couldn’t think of a woman that had done that.” She wonders whether women don’t want to make themselves look disgusting. “I’ve not got a problem with that,” she laughs. “Because that’s what I want to see.”In the first proper episode, Mandy gets a job in a banana factory, squashing spiders. I think about it every time I pick up a bunch at the supermarket. “I was told that was an actual job in Bolton,” she insists. “They would hand you a mallet and if the spider ran out, you’d just clobber it. That was a job! Otherwise, what do you do? Just let them run free?”Morgan has done quite a few of the jobs that Mandy tries, it turns out. “Chip shop, telesales, Avon lady, dental nurse, packing worming tablets. All kinds of stuff. I’ve been pretty terrible at all of them.” She grew up near Bolton, and had always wanted to act, but for a while, struggled to get into drama school. At one point, she and her friend Maxine Peake decided to have elocution lessons. “We thought the reason we weren’t getting into drama school was because we were so broad,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I started doing standup, and then I started getting acting parts, and they were always miserable northerners.” It finally occurred to her that what she had been trying to suppress was exactly what people found funny. “The flat, miserable noise of my voice.”Morganhas playedPhilomena Cunk for over a decade, and in the past, she has said that the two are very similar. “Basically the same,” she nods, today. But it sounds like there’s more crossover with Mandy than you’d think. “There’s a lot of overlap there. I’m probably more like Cunk, because Mandy’s quite brazen. I haven’t got [Cunk’s] social skills, because I didn’t go to public school. She doesn’t care, whereas I do care. That’s the big difference.”She will freely admit, though, that she loves an awkward moment. “I’m completely happy in silences, as you can probably tell from Cunk. I revel in them, almost.” When she interviews experts for what looks like minutes on screen, she might have been talking to them for hours, waiting for the perfect response to the often mindless questions. “Basically, it’s an improvised conversation, because you never know when they might go, ‘what do you think?’” She has to second guess what they might say, and work out where she might take it from there. “If they completely fall into the trap I’ve set, it’s like feeding strawberries to a donkey. It’sgreat.”Philomena Cunk is unexpectedly massive in the US. “Oh my god, yeah, they love it.” Morgan has done the rounds on the late night talk shows; she got a standing ovation when she walked out on to the Stephen Colbert stage. “It sounds ridiculous, saying it,” she laughs. “I felt like one of the Beatles.” Cunk is so big on social media that people don’t always realise she’s a character from a TV show. Sometimes, when they meet Morgan, they call her “the TikTok lady”From 2016 to 2022, Morgan played Liz in the hectic parenting comedy Motherland. Have they asked her to be in its spinoff,Amandaland? “No.” She leaves one of those perfect silences. “Bit awkward,” she jokes. “No, I think it would be weird if we’d all gone back into it, and called it Amandaland. It’s a different show.” She hasn’t seen it, solely for the reason that she doesn’t watch much comedy. “It feels too close to home. I can’t switch my brain off from going, oh, I see what you did there. I just ruin it, because I can’t enjoy things.” She prefers documentaries. “I find documentaries really funny, especially ones from the 70s. There’s one that’s purely about people who have got struck by lightning. It’s just superb.”View image in fullscreenMorgan with Paul Ready, Anna Maxwell Martin, Philippa Dunne, Lucy Punch and Tanya Moodie in Motherland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/MermanSurely Philomena Cunk has ruined documentaries for everyone? “But they’re still making them, exactly the same,” she says. “They make shows and you think, this is exactly like Cunk! How can you do this?” Morgan recently appeared on the celebrity genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, which was surreal for a number of reasons. First, because Mandy had already done a spoof of it called Who Are You, Do You Think, and second, because it is full of Cunk-like documentary tropes. Morgan leans into the daftness of it, doing those long, distant walking shots, and pleading not to have to look over her shoulder for the opening credits. “My mum said to my auntie, ‘Diane’s done Who Do You Think You Are, are you going to watch it?’ And my auntie said, ‘Depends what else is on’. Swear to God.Depends what else is on. None of them give a shit. Keeps me very grounded.”Morgan loves Mandy’s 15-minute episodes. “You’re in, you’re out, you’ve got your life back. I don’t want anything that’s like, oh, this is 47 seasons and it doesn’t get going until episode 16.” But she will soon be returning to half-an-hour with Ann Droid, the new comedy she has written withSarah Kendall. A year ago, Morgan read an article about the possibility of robot carers for child-free older people in Japan. “I thought, I don’t have any kids. Shit, that’ll be me, ending up with a robot.” It made her laugh so much that they sent the idea to the BBC, who said yes. “Then we had to write it.” Worse, she has cast herself as the robot. “It didn’t occur to me that it would be difficult, over six weeks, to move like this,” she says, lifting her arms stiffly. She is currently in training with a movement coach. “I spend an hour a day, walking around the house like a robot.” I can’t believe your family don’t care about what you do, I say. “I know! They don’t ask,” she shrugs. “Not bothered.”Mandy returnson Monday21 Julyat 10pm on BBC Two.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDiane MorganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it’s drag queen Felicia Jollygoodfellow in his 1994 breakout Australian movieThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, or Detective Exley in 1997’s LA Confidential.Maybe you prefer your Pearce going backwards in Christopher Nolan’sMemento; time-travelling back to 1899 in an adaptation of HG Wells’s The Time Machine; at sea in The Count of Monte Cristo; or all-too-briefly at war in The Hurt Locker. He’s also done royal drama (The King’s Speech, Mary Queen of Scots) and he’s done biopics (Andy Warhol in Factory Girl and Harry Houdini in Death Defying Acts). He’s been into space (Prometheus and Alien: Covenant) and he’s breathed fire (Iron Man 3).View image in fullscreenGuy Pearce, centre, with Russell Crowe in 1997’s LA Confidential.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Warner Bros/AllstarHe’s made two Aussie westerns with John Hillcoat (Lawless, The Proposition) and two yet gnarlier contemporary tales set in his homeland (Animal Kingdom, The Rover). And earlier this year he was Oscar-nominated for his role as a wealthy industrialist inThe Brutalist. He didn’t win the Academy Award, but he made a lot of new fans with his candour about marriage, Palestine, and his feelings about LA Confidential co-star Kevin Spacey.Pearce also won an Emmy for his role in the Todd Haynes miniseries Mildred Pierce, and was excellent in Mare of Easttown – both opposite Kate Winslet. He released two solo albums in the 2010s, and dresses up as a dishevelled superhero in the video toRazorlight’s Before I Fall to Pieces.

The 27-year-old denies the charge and is to appear in court in August.Kneecap said on Friday they had received a “private email” to say no further action would be taken over last month’s performance. “We played a historic set at Glastonbury. Whole area closed an hour before due to crowds,” the group said on X. “A celebration of love and solidarity. A sea of good people at the world’s most famous festival.”They added: “Every single person who saw our set knew no law was broken, not even close … yet the police saw fit to publicly announce they were opening an investigation. This is political. This is targetted. This is state intimidation”Avon and Somerset police said: “An investigation has been carried out into comments about a forthcoming court case made during Kneecap’s performance at Glastonbury festival on Saturday 28 June.“Detectives sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service during their inquiries and after that advice, we have made the decision to take no further action on the grounds there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence.”The force added: “Inquiries continue to be carried out in relation to separate comments made on stage during Bob Vylan’s performance.”During the Bob Vylan performance, one half of the duo, Pascal Robinson-Foster, who performs under the name Bobby Vylan, led chants of “Death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, and spoke of working for a “fucking Zionist”.In a statement published on Instagram on 1 July, Bob Vylan said: “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine. A machine whose own soldiers were told to use unnecessary lethal force against innocent civilians waiting for aid. A machine that has destroyed much of Gaza.“We, like those in the spotlight before us, are not the story. We are a distraction from the story and whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Stone later said revealing shots were captured without her consent.View image in fullscreenTwisted … Joe Eszterhas in 2003.Photograph: Chris Stephens/AP“To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: the rumours of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist,” Esztherhas said in a statement to the Wrap.“I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN and he lives somewhere deep inside me. He was born 29 and he will die 29 and he tells me he is ‘sky high up’ to write this piece and provide viewers with a wild and orgasmic ride. That makes me very happy.”It remains unclear whether Stone’s character, Catherine Tramell, will return for the film, as she did for the 2006 belated sequel directed by Michael Caton-Jones without involvement from Eszterhas.That film was both a critical and commercial failure, making back just half its budget, while the original made some $352m (more than $800m adjusted for inflation).In 2018, Eszterhas told the Hollywood Reporter that the most problematic aspect of the first film was a sex scene between Douglas and his character’s psychiatrist, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, who said in 1993 that director Paul Verhoeven had described a “lighter” encounter to her before filming.Some “serious #MeToo protesters” would take issue with the sequence, he said. “It was rough sex,” he added, “but today’s yardstick is different.”According to an individual with knowledge of the deal who spoke to the Wrap, the reboot is expected to be “anti-woke”. The first film attracted criticism from gay and lesbian activists for its portrayal of homosexual relationships and its depiction of the central murderous bisexual psychopath. TheNational Organisation for Womenwas among those who also took issue with its treatment of women, calling it “the most blatantly misogynistic film in recent memory”. One French mayor banned the film from showing in his municipality, calling it an apology for rape.Sharon Stone says US is in state of ‘ignorant, arrogant adolescence’Read moreAfter being diagnosed with throat cancer, Eszterhas apologised for the film’s glamorisation of smoking. After the success of the film, he wrote scripts for films including Sliver, Showgirlsand Jade before moving back to Ohio and returning to his Catholic faith.A planned collaboration with Mel Gibson in 2012 on a biblical film fell apart after Eszterhas accused Gibson of being unhinged and encouraging antisemitic supporters to attack him.The Basic Instinct reboot is the latest in a number of pricey blockbuster projects from Amazon MGM Studios, including the Ryan Gosling sci-fi Project Hail Mary and the first in the studio’s series of James Bond films, to be directed by Denis Villeneuve.Explore more on these topicsFilmJoe EszterhasSharon StonenewsShareReuse this content"

But super fans – and scalpers – already have seatsSian CainFri 18 Jul 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 18 Jul 2025 03.06 EDTShareThe first tickets to Christopher Nolan’s take on Homer’s Odyssey have gone on sale – before he’s even finished filming it and a year before the film is even out, in what is likely the longest pre-sale in cinematic history.The Odyssey, which stars Matt Damon as the cunning Odysseus as he fights his way home after the end of the Trojan war, will be released on 17 July 2026. But on Thursday, Imax released tickets to the first screenings at the 26 Imax cinemas around the world that have the staff and equipment required to project in 1570 format.1570 is the largest and highest resolution film format in existence and Nolan’s preferred format. It refers to the dimensions of the film: the 15 perforations along the edge of each frame, which allow the film to be pulled through the projector, and 70mm in height.The first Imax tickets are just for 1570 format screenings on the opening weekend, from 16 to 19 July 2026 – but only one screening per cinema per day is possible as the film’s length is unknown.Overnight, ImaxMelbournesold about 1,800 tickets across four screenings.“Just one year in advance – it’s nice and normal to have a pre-sale like that,” Jeremy Fee, general manager of Imax Melbourne, joked to Guardian Australia on Friday. “I couldn’t be more excited. We worship Nolan here. It’s a bit pathetic. But we love him so much.”In the US, almost all tickets sold out within an hour ; soon there were reports of tickets being resold online by scalpers for between US$300-$400. In the UK, London’s famous BFI Imax has sold out, as has the Science Museum Imax.Nolan began using Imax cameras for 2008’s The Dark Knight and has championed the format ever since. His 2023 Oscar winner Oppenheimer was the first movie shot entirely with Imax 65mm film, but The Odyssey will bethe first commercial feature shot entirely on Imax film cameras, after Nolan convinced Imax to create new cameras that were quiet enough for him to record dialogue.Imax screenings accounted for US$190m – or about 20% – of Oppenheimer’s US$975.8m global box office. The Oppenheimer 1570 reelwas more than 18km long, weighed 260kg and was the most expensive film reel ever made. The platters that hold and feed the large-format film reels through the Imax projectors had to be widened to 1.85 metres to accommodate the sheer heft of Oppenheimer – but Fee predicted the Odyssey reel could be even bigger.The longest pre-sale Imax Melbourne has ever run was about three months, Fee said.“Nolan is the biggest deal for us, obviously,” he says. “But we’ve not been through something like this before. We had to change the back-end of our ticketing systems to ensure we could actually put tickets on sale this far out. It is definitely an anomaly for us, and something we were pretty excited to do.”The decision to sell a relatively small number of tickets so far in advance when Nolan’s film will inevitably dominate screens in most cinemas upon release, Fee said, is simply to build anticipation.“We’re anticipating it will be even more successful for us than Oppenheimer was – and Oppenheimer is our most successful feature length of all time,” he added. “It is an opportunity to see the film in the way that Nolan wants it to be seen. The superfans for Nolan – and there’s many of them – are just getting excited about being able to access [The Odyssey] earlier than anyone else.”Imax Melbourne regularly sees “cinema tourists”, he said: people who book holidays around screenings.“We’ve already got people who bought their Odyssey tickets and are now trying to find flights from Sydney and New Zealand and so on, just to come down here,” he said.According to Fee, Imax Melbourne had not yet seen any evidence of scalpers selling tickets from their first four screenings. But the pre-sale is “just a drop in the ocean, really, of how many sessions and tickets will eventually be put on sale,” he said. “The idea of buying a tout ticket now would be a very foolish one.”Explore more on these topicsChristopher NolanHomerMelbournenewsShareReuse this content"

He plays a mild-mannered CIA cryptographer sent on a bloodthirsty revenge quest after his wife is killed in a terrorist attack. What’s fascinating about this film is that, had the lead been any other actor, it would have devolved into generic pulp. But Malek, in the hands of director James Hawes, really leans into the character’s psychopathy. He has a dead-eyed stare throughout, the sort you’d usually expect to find on a film’s antagonist. Sure, this is a globe-trotting Bourne-style romp, but you’re never allowed to forget the ethical iffiness of, say, blowing someone up inside a swimming pool.Out now, Disney+Women TalkingView image in fullscreenLingers long after the credits roll … Ben Whishaw as August, Rooney Mara as Ona and Claire Foy as Salome in Women Talking.Photograph: Michael GibsonBased on the 2018 novel by Miriam Toews, which was in turnbased on true events, Sarah Polley’sWomen Talkingis startlingly unconventional. The story of a Mennonite community in remote Bolivia, whose women discover that they are being drugged and raped, Women Talking centres around the discussion of how they should react. Do they leave, do they fight back, or do they do nothing? With a world-beating cast (Rooney Mara, Jesse Buckley, Claire Foy and Frances McDormand), the film is light on action but will linger long after the credits roll.Tuesday 22 July, 11pm, BBC TwoEmmaView image in fullscreenLively … Mia Goth and Anya Taylor-Joy in Emma.Photograph: Focus Features/Moviestore Collection/AlamyThis2020 Jane Austen adaptationwas the directorial debut of photographer Autumn de Wilde, who brought all the experience of her old career to the table.

What sets this version apart are the lively performances – from Anya Taylor-Joy, Josh O’Connor and Bill Nighy – and visuals that are modern enough to cut through all the period stuffiness.Wednesday 23 July, 11pm, BBC TwoTin SoldierView image in fullscreenIncredible … Jamie Foxx as The Bokushi in Tin Soldier.Photograph: Unified Pictures/AlamyWell, this is a weird one.Tin Soldieris a film where Scott Eastwood attempts to infiltrate a cult and overthrow its leader. What makes it weird, however, is how heavily this is overshadowed by its supporting cast. Robert De Niro features in a typically underpowered late-stage role as a kind of military advisor. But even he recedes into the shadows next to Jamie Foxx, playing the aforementioned cult leader. He has huge hair. He has silly glasses. He has questionable facial hair. His name is The Bokushi. None of it makes any sense. It’s sort of incredible.Wednesday 23 July, Prime Videoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Knocked by Sony’s repeated duff attempts to create a universe of Spider-Man baddies, none of which actually featured Spider-Man, the film was so poorly anticipated that the director was reduced to begging people to give it a chance. The good news is that Kraven the Hunter is actually a good film. It’s less silly thanMadame Weband less wild thanMorbius.

A 1996 sports comedy about a short-tempered ice hockey fanatic who finds a surprising affinity for golf, this is arguably the archetypal Adam Sandler performance; loud, profane, occasionally syrupy. Now, almost 30 years later, it’s time for the sequel. Here, Gilmore is forced out of retirement to pay for his daughter’s ballet school. Expect lots of shouting, a billion cameos and – most intriguing of all – a turn by Sandler’s Uncut Gems director Benny Safdie.Friday 25 July, NetflixBlade Runner 2049View image in fullscreenA maximalist spectacle … Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarIf you need to get acquainted with the man who’ll lead James Bond into the future, this is a decent place to start.

She’s also the absolute antithesis of maternal so she hasn’t been looking forward to the arrival of her adult son Edward (Freddie Highmore), who is visiting her on the Greek island she calls home. Not that Edward is relaxed about it either – he wants information about his elusive family background. Julie is also a former assassin. Flashbacks suggest she was a ferociously efficient one too. But how retired is she really? When her past catches up with her and the pair’s prickly but sunny sojourn is interrupted by bloody chaos, they’re forced to go on the run.

It follows Washington as a child (Eddie Karanja), enslaved but under the wing of white saviour Titch (Tom Ellis), and the older Washington (Ernest Kingsley Jr) as a free man, obsessed with building a flying machine and in cahoots with Sterling K Brown’s Medwin Harris. The performances are engaging and it asks serious questions about freedom in a world where Black people are constrained by their history.Disney+, from Wednesday 23 JulyAcapulcoView image in fullscreenDelightful retro stylings … From left: Rafael Cebrián, Jessica Collins and Chord Overstreet in Acapulco.Photograph: Cate Cameron/AppleIt’s the fourth and final season of this bright and breezy flashbackcomedy dramawhich delights in its sunny setting and retro stylings.

Criminally overlooked by its own studio, which attempted to dump it on to streaming without a theatrical release, this is arguably his best film for 20 years. It’s a tight legal thriller about a journalist (played by Nicholas Hoult) who is called up for jury duty only to realise he may be responsible for the victim’s death. The film quickly becomes a knotty morality play designed to keep you torn until the very end. If this is Eastwood’s last work, he’s going out on a high.Stuart HeritageExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jet, who comes across as rather younger than her 27 years, has retreated back to the dysfunctional bosom of her wealthy Vermont family after dropping out of law school; she disagrees with the police department’s choice of culprit and conducts her own investigation with the aid of childhood friend Billy. As Jet’s neighbours, family and the construction business from which the Masons derive their money come under the microscope, secrets and cover-ups are revealed, and it starts to look as if the killer may be very close to home … A propulsive plot, where the pathos is fuel for real suspense, makes this perfect holiday fare – a genuine page-turner for YA and adult readers alike.View image in fullscreenKill Your DarlingsbyPeter Swanson(Faber, £18.99)Set in Massachusetts, this is a mystery told in reverse order. We know from the first sentence that Wendy is planning to kill her husband Thom, after discovering that he is writing a novel that threatens to expose their darkest secret. It’s the last straw: Thom, who is not only sexually incontinent but increasingly prone to getting blackout drunk, has become not only a disappointment but a liability. The narrative, which forms a kind of moral balance sheet, switches between his point of view and Wendy’s as it takes us back through almost three decades of marriage, and finally to 1982, when they first met as teenagers on a school trip to Washington DC. It’s cleverly done, with seemingly insignificant details emerging in a consequential light once we have knowledge of what happened earlier in the chronology of the pair’s lives. Swanson fills in all the puzzle parts meticulously, for a complete picture.View image in fullscreenThe Good LiarbyDenise Mina(Harvill Secker, £16.99)Professor Claudia Atkins O’Sheil, MBE, creator of the revolutionary Blood Spatter Probability Scale, is preparing to give a speech at the Royal College of Forensic Scientists, in the full knowledge that she is about to trash her reputation and that of her boss, Sir Philip Ardmore. We then wind back a year to a similar gathering, when the pair are called away to a crime scene: Ardmore’s old friend, aristocrat Jonty Stewart, and his fiancee have been found murdered in their smart Regent’s Park home. Jonty’s ne’er-do-well son is arrested, but Claudia isn’t sure that he’s guilty, and, as the action moves forward, she begins to have serious doubts about several other things, including the veracity of her creation. Her social trajectory having been as spectacular as her professional one, Claudia is both drawn to and resentful of the privileged world in which she moves, and her attempts to decode its mores as she wrestles with her conscience make this compelling and suspenseful study of complicity and culpability a stand-out read.View image in fullscreenThe HolebyHye-Young Pyun,translated bySora Kim-Russell(Doubleday, £14.99)The Shirley Jackson award winner’s novel centres on Korean cartography professor Oghi, who wakes up in hospital after the car accident that killed his wife, unable to move or speak. Released into the care of his mother-in-law, he returns to his marital home, where, confined in bed, he desperately tries to communicate by blinking. The details of the crash are initially unspecified, but as clues emerge as to the state of Oghi’s marriage and his conduct at work, it gradually becomes clear that he is not an entirely reliable narrator of his own life, and that his mother-in-law, who may have begun reading her daughter’s diaries, is deliberately tormenting him. As well as the literal and sinister hole that Oghi’s mother-in-law is busy digging in the garden, metaphorical holes abound in this superbly insidious and atmospheric chiller about caring and cruelty: grief, isolation, helplessness and existential fear.View image in fullscreenGunnerby Alan Parks(Baskerville, £16.99)Alan Parks’s latest novel, the first in a projected series, opens in March 1941, during the Clydebank Blitz. German bombs are also raining down on neighbouring Glasgow when former police officer Joseph Gunner returns after being wounded in action in France. His initial concerns – a bed for the night and how to eke out his precious supply of morphine – are multiplied when the body of a German, mutilated to disguise his identity, turns up in the rubble and Gunner’s erstwhile boss asks him for help. When he reluctantly agrees, he soon finds himself embroiled in a high-level conspiracy. There’s also the matter of a turf war between rival gangsters and the fact that his brother, a conscientious objector, has absconded from a work camp… The similarities with Parks’s 1970s-set Harry McCoy series will certainly please existing fans, but this well-researched historical thriller, which perfectly captures the chaos, danger and moral mess of a world turned upside down by conflict, is sure to attract new ones too.Explore more on these topicsBooksCrime and thrillers roundupCrime fictionThrillersFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nothing unusual there, you might think. But not only did Phillips not invite her husband or children, she didn’t consult them, instead simply informing them that she was leaving the following week. It was an impulsive decision that she hoped would lift her out of a depressive episode that was manifesting in brain fog and anxiety. But for her husband, TV editor Martin Frizell, it was another instance of Phillips behaving oddly, a sign that things “were not all they should be”.Remember When chronicles, with illuminating candour, the changes that culminated in Phillips’sdiagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’sin 2022, at the age of 61. Billed as a memoir by Phillips herself, owing to her decline during the three-year writing process, it’s really a co-production between her, her ghostwriter Alison Phillips (no relation) and Frizell, who provides fitful interjections. As such, it offers a rare account of the impact of Alzheimer’s not just from the person who has it, but from their primary carer too.Neither of them managed to join the dots of her symptoms until comparatively lateFrizell initially attributed his wife’s symptoms to the menopause, which can also present as low mood and memory loss. Both wondered if she had long Covid, having been infected with the virus during the first lockdown. It’s a reflection of the insidiousness of Alzheimer’s that neither of them managed to join the dots until comparatively late, even though Phillips’s mother and father had developed the disease in their 50s and 60s respectively. She had even made documentaries about her parents’ decline, and was an ambassador for Alzheimer’s charities.Yet, as this book makes clear, the memory loss that is intrinsic to Alzheimer’s makes it unfathomable to the sufferer. How can you pinpoint what is going wrong with your brain when the main symptom is confusion? Among the early signs, Phillips reflects, was a feeling of flatness. She recalls going for a walk on Clapham Common in early summer 2018 and looking at other Londoners enjoying the weather. “It was like looking through a double-glazed window on to another world of which I had no part. It was a strange sense of disconnection. Of seeing others laughing, enjoying the moment, while increasingly I felt, well, nothing. Just flat.”At this point in the book, Phillips presses pause on the story of her illness to trace her early years growing up in Canterbury and, later, Southampton. Along with her childhood, we get a whistle-stop tour of her career in journalism: after starting out in local radio, she began working for Sky News and later got a job reporting for GMTV from Los Angeles. On her return to the UK in 1997, she succeeded Anthea Turner as co-host alongside Eamonn Holmes, interviewing prime ministers and Hollywood stars.The intention of this determinedly breezy segment is clear: to let us know the fearless and successful person Phillips had been before Alzheimer’s did its worst. Yet it is also revealing about the impossible juggle of fronting Britain’s leading TV breakfast show and raising a young family, while caring for her parents through their own diagnoses. Her devastation at watching them disappear before her eyes is mirrored in Frizell as he observes his wife’s incremental withdrawal from the world.This sadness erupts into anger when he states: “I wish Fiona had contracted cancer … It’s a shocking thing to say, but at least then she might have had a chance at a cure, and certainly would have had a treatment pathway, and an array of support and care packages.” As it is, following diagnosis, the Alzheimer’s sufferer and their family are largely “left to their own devices. There is nothing more that can be done and you are left to cope alone.”By the end of Remember When, Frizell’s is the dominant voice, since Phillips no longer has the capacity to articulate her experience. Early in the book she says she doesn’t want to become an object of pity, or for her story to be viewed as a tragedy. But there can be no happy ending here, no endnote of hope. Capturing the loneliness and sense of loss that occurs when a loved one is alive but no longer fully present, Frizell simply says: “I miss her. I miss my wife.”Remember When by Fiona Phillips is published by Macmillan (£22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Surrounded by rocks, he arranges himself in a sun chair on a small, raft-like deck. Breathing through a long curved tube, an oxygen tank tucked beneath his white shirt, he seems utterly self-sufficient, like a shipwreck survivor, lost in his thoughts.It is a startling opening to a 45-minute piece that would be called performance art in a gallery. On a bank of seats facing the three-metre-high glass tank, the small audience surveys the specimen in front of them. A dizzyingly inventive physical performer and director,Murfi often collaborateswith other theatre, dance and opera artists. Here his director is Kellie Hughes, with designers Sabine Dargent (set) and Sinéad Wallace (lighting). While it seems to flow dreamily, this arresting new work they have created with Loco & Reckless Productions and Galway international arts festival relies on pinpoint precision and skill.It is only when Murfi’s Robinson Crusoe-like character completes his fastidious weightlifting routine that he pays attention to the teeming life around him, as swarms of fish approach him – bream, wreckfish and starry smooth-hound sharks, according to the programme. To a soundtrack of honking traffic, he playfully conducts the fishes’ darting movement. Later he plays piano in the water, the accompanying music evoking memories that seem linked to a past loss. Face down, rolling and gliding like an astronaut, he is riding waves of grief.Declan Gibbon’s string and percussion score surges, as an agitated Murfi shines a torch through the glass at us, searchingly. As the tempest subsides, he undulates and floats, now with an affecting sense of surrender or acceptance. With the fish encircling him as he swims, he has undergone “a sea change, into something rich and strange”.At Galway international arts festival until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

For the rest of us though, she’s a revelation. Taking inspiration from all aspects of her heritage, you’ll find traces of Buddhism, the Mongolian countryside, Chet Baker and David Byrne woven through her songs in a sound that’s classic, old as the hills and refreshingly new all at once.Her standout track to date is Chintamani, the B-side toher 2025 single Selenge. Over three minutes and 32 seconds of bliss, Dessberg mixes theyatga(a traditional Mongolian zither-harp hybrid) with old-Hollywood vocal backing and a waltz rhythm that puts it somewhere between a chaste slow-dance at prom in the 50s and the feeling of stepping into a cool, clear lake in the blazing midday sun. In Dessberg’s hands, theyatgais playful, angelic and makes you want to use words like “frolicking”. Her voice is rich and often deep, but on Chintamani it has a childlike quality too: a wide-eyed awe at the beauty of her homeland.Last year’s EP Hödööis mostly in French and it feels much more nostalgic – close your eyes and you’ll see black-and-white Nouvelle Vaguewaifs swaying in your mind. But on both releases, the warmth of Dessberg’s voice is irresistible. Even if the last vestiges of GCSE French (or Mongolian) fail you, this is music that gets you right in the heartstrings.Kate SolomonThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenSudan Archives.Photograph: Yanran XiongSudan Archives – My TypeFar from her breakout stately cello-based music, here Brittney Parks is starry-eyed as she admires a carefree high-flyer, her romantic rapped verses giving way to a rapturous chorus swirl.Water From Your Eyes – Playing ClassicsDeadpan NYC club classicism and tight-jawed hi-NRG get dragged towards a ditch of distortion in a strangely addictive confection that couldn’t be by anyone but the Chicago duo.Olof Dreijer – IrisThe former Knife member’s solo material has grown increasingly mischievous and alive over several great EPs.

Starting with thin, wobbly Moldy Peaches-style anti-folk in his teenage years, the Pennsylvania native added lusher, twangier elements – Americana with a slacker twist – before introducing glitched beats, pitched-up vocals and copious vocoder. By 2022’s God Save the Animals he had a zealous cult following and was pushing at the limits of what indie singer-songwriter fare could be, melding acoustic strumming and sweet melody with distortion that ranged from unsettlingly inhuman to downright demonic.View image in fullscreenAlex G: HeadlightsOn Headlights, his 10th album, Giannascoli, 32, reins in the warp and abrasion: the sonic invention remains, but it is deployed with increased subtlety. Exceptional opener June Guitar has chipmunk backing vocals and a surging organ riff that strongly recalls Centerfold by the J Geils Band; Beam Me Up is haunted by a mid-century sci-fi sound effect and Louisiana begins with a revving engine – yet all serve the timeless, melancholic soft-rock rather than overpowering it.It means the best bits of Headlights are not the (still highly enjoyable) off-kilter details, but the incidental shots of melody – the languid “yeah, yeah, yeah” on Beam Me Up – and the crooked love song lyrics: on the shoegazey hyperpop-punk of Bounce Boy his heart is “in braces”; on June Guitar he insists “love ain’t for the young”. The album peaks with the seemingly totally analogue Real Thing: a simply and addictively beautiful tune built around a pan flute and a witty riff on the titular romantic cliche. Giannascoli may have found a middle ground, but he’s nowhere near the middle of the road.Explore more on these topicsMusicIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

Adieu Lovely Erin starts by evoking Broadcast swirling around a maypole; then it’s as if Cocteau Twins had been transported to a traditional music session. Its sweet, high female vocals also evoke the improvisations of sean-nós singing, while simmering, krautrock-like drums build drama.View image in fullscreenPoor Creature: All Smiles TonightPoor Creature comprises three musicians expert in heightening and managing atmosphere:Landless’s Ruth Clinton, Lankum’s Cormac MacDiarmada plus live Lankum drummer John Dermody. Their debut album steeps cowboy songs, Irish ballads, bluegrass and other traditional songs in a misty, playful lightness that somehow also carries an eerie power. Bury Me Not is a 19th-century American song about a dying sailor desperate not to be buried at sea, and Clinton delivers its lamenting lyrics with a bright, shining innocence. MacDiarmada leads Lorene, a rolling, country ballad by Alabama duo the Louvin Brothers, with a similarly soft, brooding magic. Singing as a boy desperate for a letter from his beloved, despite clearly knowing he’s being ghosted, the song’s melancholy slowly rises as voice and guitar mesh together.Preprogrammed beats from a Hohner Organetta (a mid-century table-top organ), the wails of an Otamatone (a 21st-century Japanese synthesiser, shaped like a musical quaver) and a theremin add childlike, hauntological flavours to much of this music. Meat and muscle are also built into Hicks’ Farewell, a Doc Watson song fed through a sturdy wall of shoegaze, and propulsive highlight, The Whole Town Knows. Within Clinton and MacDiarmada’s dense harmonies, Dermody’s drums and the track’s cacophonous final minutes, you sense folk rocketing somewhere poppy, wild and new.Also out this monthA folk duo who also work in cabaret, performance, and installation art,Lunatraktorscollect together six years of collaborative work on their new compilation,Quilting Points: Invitations and Open Calls 2019-2025 (self-released). A loud mix of salvaged songs, archival fragments, chaos and energetic ideas, its most intriguing tracks are the Korg-propelled ’Oss Girls, inspired by the Padstow May Day song, and The Truth of Eanswythe’s Bones, a twisted choral epic inspired by the discovery of a skeleton of a 7th-century saint. Clàrsach (Celtic harp) playerGrace Stewart-Skinner’sAuchies Spikkin’ Auchie (self-released)is a moving, textured exploration of the stories and dialect of her north-east Highlands harbour village, Avoch, mixing her playing with field-recorded conversations, fiddle, double bass and drums.Toby Hay’s gorgeousNew Music for the 6 String Guitar (The State51 Conspiracy)also further confirms him as a warm, 21st-century heir to the string-bending genius of John Fahey.Explore more on these topicsMusicFolk album of the monthFolk musicLankumreviewsShareReuse this content"

Of course, they don’t strip off and swim – the figures in the water are fishing folk. Sea bathing wouldn’t become fashionable until about a century later, and the hedonism of modern beach life would gradually appear in art, from impressionist Normandy to Picasso and Matisse on the Riviera. All of that lies in the future here – and to be honest those looming clouds don’t augur well for a day at the seaside.

This is the most beautiful place on Earth (when it isn’t raining). The numerous beaches are full of soft white sands. Our children have grown up playing free in the fields on their yearly holiday – no computers, just outdoor fun.EmHiking a Highlands mountainView image in fullscreenThe view near the summit of Lochnagar, a Munro in Aberdeenshire.Photograph: Scott Sim/AlamyFor a true taste of the Scottish Highlands, head to Ballater and hike the 1,155-metre (3,789 ft) peak of Lochnagar in the Grampians. The trail winds through pine forests and open moorland, the air crisp and alive. Be ready for the weather to change like pages in a book: sunshine, sudden rain, a flurry of snow on the summit, then blue skies again. On the way down, slip into the river, its water sharp as ice. Pack layers, bring snacks and take your time. It’s a walk that stays with you long after you leave the mountain behind.EvaWalking the Cotswold Way – inspired by Laurie LeeView image in fullscreenA view from the Cotswold Way at Crickley Hill country park, Gloucestershire.Photograph: Cotswolds Photo Library/AlamyAfter a family reading of Laurie Lee’sAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, my husband and I decided our two teens were ready to try a walking holiday in the Cotswolds. We set out with backpacks and a tent on theCotswold Way, starting just outside lively Chipping Campden and ending in Bath. Mobiles were limited to an hour a day in the evening and we did 10 miles a day – covering the walk in 10 days. We felt we were a part of a community of walkers as fellow hikers greeted us in passing, sharing drinks and tips with us along the way. We also learned about the Japanese idea ofshinrin-yoku– feeling free in nature under the canopy of trees, sky and stars – from a family from Tokyo. We returned fitter, more together and happier than when we set out.AnnProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

In fact I only needed some minor encouragement from the vampire; the area itself was my ally. The forests, flanked by brooding mountains, were exciting to hike through anyway (with the help of a local guide), with the presence of brown bears, wolves and lynx adding to the thrills as we marched along. We came across medieval towns and villages that are rich in traditional folklore. One highlight was sampling local cheese and singing songs with villagers in the Bârza valley. The boys were rewarded with a ride on a horse-drawn cart to the next village, near Dracula’s alleged abode – Bran Castle. Don’t miss the stiff climb up to Postăvarul peak (1,799 metres) for great views over the area.JoeWhere Austria’s hills are aliveView image in fullscreenBathers enjoy the jetty at Wolfgangsee, Salzburg.Photograph: Volkerpreusser/AlamySalzkammergut is the Austrian lake district. Lush meadows, forests and blue-green lakes make for endless days of swimming, biking and lying in the sun. No wonder that The Sound of Music was filmed here. Wolfgangsee has well-marked bike trails and opportunities to swim, alongside cafes serving deliciouskaiserschmarrn(fluffy pancakes) and schnitzel. The nearby Fuschlsee has an incredible water park right by the lake: swimming pools, slides and plenty of quiet water in which to swim. It’s excellent entertainment for the entire family. We stayed in the newly renovated Feichtingerbauer, which offers complimentary access to theFuschlseebad.NehaPaddleboarding in County DerryView image in fullscreenThe River Roe near Swanns Bridge, Northern Ireland.Photograph: Robert Morris/AlamyBy the end of the summer in 2021 we were at the end of our tether due to lockdowns and the lack of socialising opportunities. The kids had never been so quiet. My good friend Bob insisted we join his family at Swanns Bridge in County Derry for a paddleboard trip. Swanns Bridge is only a few minutes’ drive from the Atlantic beaches of Benone, but it makes use of the River Roe, rather than the ocean. After 20 minutes of trying to stay upright, something happened. For the first time in over a year we were distracted by something positive and by the beauty of the Roe. The only sound was water (mostly me falling in) and laughter. We’ve gone back since to be distracted for different reasons. It still works.Kieranskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Be it a weekend in the Peak District or Monday to Friday in the Lake District, it doesn’t have to cost a lot. You can pitch a tent in a campsite or get cheap accommodation in a youth hostel. My kids love scrambling up the hills, paddling in the streams that flow down them, spotting the ground-nesting birds, and tucking into the snacks that come with hiking. It teaches them so much about nature and personal safety, as well as about how quickly the weather can change in such places.RebeccaSearching for buried treasure on Ynys Môn (Anglesey)View image in fullscreenThe dunes at Newborough beach, North Wales, are the perfect location for a treasure hunt.Photograph: Shoults/AlamyOur best back-to-nature day out? A spontaneous treasure hunt through the dunes of Newborough beach on Ynys Môn (Anglesey). There’s no admission fee needed – just a hand-drawn pirate map, a flask of lemonade and plenty of imagination. The kids darted between marram grass and shoreline, hunting for shells and “buried treasure” (a biscuit tin full of sweets we’d hidden earlier). With views of Llanddwyn Island and a picnic under the pines, it was low-stress, big-memory magic. Just bring snacks, suncream and a good sense of adventure!Robert SerebriakoffCar-free and carefree on the Isle of ArranView image in fullscreenArran is an easy ferry ride away from mainland Scotland.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyWe had a lovely summer holiday staying on a farm on the Isle of Arran. It’s the perfect car-free holiday for families, with a very easy train ride from Glasgow to the harbour [at the mainland ferry port of Ardrossan]. We stayed on the organic farm, picking our own fruit and veg then cooking it on our camping stove on the beach. The accommodation is right on the beach and on our first morning we stepped out and saw an enormous pod of dolphins. Our days were spent walking up and down the beach playing in rock pools. Absolute heaven! The owner of the farm, who used to work in a Michelin-starred restaurant, cooks fresh lobster and seafood most nights. You can watch him and his daughter going out on their kayak to make their daily catch.GemmaRockpooling in East SussexView image in fullscreenThe Seven Sisters make a beautiful backdrop to walking, biking and crab-hunting.Photograph: Liliya Sayfeeva/AlamyOne of our favourite trips out in nature is to the beach at Seven Sisters, East Sussex. The walk to get there is lovely – it’s flat and a good size for our boys to ride their bikes along. It’s beautiful, with the cliffs and rivers winding along, and there’s even a little empty building to look inside, which is very exciting for small children. When at the beach, there is so much to do, including wading across the part where the river joins the sea with a pretty decent current; rock pooling in crystal-clear waters; and, on a good day, there’s the sludgy sand to get filthy in! Bonus fun is had by watching walkers wade across the river to get to the cliffs, teetering on the painful rocks, as they don’t want to get their walking shoes wet; or by finding crabs in the rock pools; and seeing little islands made as the tide goes in and out. It’s extra fun if you win the competition to find the most interesting stone or find some treasured sea glass. Chalk is fun too, but common enough not to count as an entry into the competition.LaurenView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsFamily holidaysReaders' travel tipsUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysBeach holidaysCamping holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Put the vodka and oil in a blender, blitz to combine, then pour into a wide plastic container (a clean empty ice-cream tub would be ideal), seal and freeze overnight. The oil will separate, rise to the top and freeze, so simply lift it off, leaving only the vodka behind (thaw the oil, save a little for the garnish and use the rest in cooking). Leave the vodka to come up to room temperature, then pass through coffee filter paper into a bottle or jar. Seal and store in the fridge for up to three months, though it’s best used within a month.To build the drink, measure all the liquids into a shaker and fill with ice. Seal and shake hard until the shaker is very cold and coated in a light frosting of ice, then fine-strain into a chilled martini glass (if you like, first dip the rim or half-rim in lemon juice and then in flaky sea salt).Put three or five droplets of olive oil on the surface of the cocktail, and serve at once.Matt Maranzano, bar manager,Templar, London E20Explore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerSpiritsFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

Ta-da!Helen GohFri 18 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareThere’s a touch of theatre to a bombe Alaska: the soft swoops of toasted meringue, the hidden layers revealed at the slice, the contrast of cold and flame … This one takes its cue from lemon meringue pie, reimagined as an icy dessert with a gently tangy heart. The lemon ice-cream is no-churn, which makes it blissfully easy, and it softens into a mousse-like texture, rather than melting, so this is great for entertaining, when timing isn’t always precise. Underneath is a tender pistachio sponge for a little texture and subtle nuttiness, and it’s all wrapped in a satiny meringue, torched to golden. It’s a dessert that feels doable but celebratory, a little retro and entirely joyful.Lemon meringue bombe alaska with pistachio cakePrep10 minFreeze8 hr+Cook1 hr 30 minServes8-10For the pistachio cake40g shelled pistachionuts60g plain flour½ tsp baking powder⅛ tsp fine sea salt60g room-temperature unsalted butter60g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 lemon1 large egg, at room temperature½ tsp vanilla extract40ml milkFor the lemon ice-cream330g lemon curd(shop-bought or homemade)100g condensed milk100g plain, unsweetened yoghurt1tbsp lemon juice300ml double creamFor the meringue3 large egg whites(about 90g)150g caster sugar⅛ tsp cream of tartar1 tsp lemon juice1 tsp vanilla extractLine the base and sides of a 20cm round cake tin with baking paper. Put the pistachios in a food processor and process until finely ground. Add the flour, baking powder and salt, and pulse to combine; transfer to a small bowl.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Put the butter, sugar and lemon zest in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high for about two minutes, until lightened. Beat in the egg and vanilla, then, on low speed, mix in the pistachio flour in three stages, alternating with the milk. Once just combined, scrape the batter into the lined tin and spread out evenly (it’s a very shallow cake). Bake for 15-17 minutes, until light golden brown and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Transfer the tin to a rack for a few minutes, then unmould and leave to cool completely.Line a one- to one and a half-litre pudding bowl with a few layers of clingfilm, making sure there is a generous overhang all around. Whisk the lemon curd, condensed milk, yoghurt and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Beat the cream to soft peaks, then fold into the lemon curd mix; be gentle but thorough – there shouldn’t be any white streaks. Scrape into the lined pudding bowl, then place the cake on top. Fold over the overhanging clingfilm to cover, then freeze for eight to 12 hours, until firm.Once the ice-cream has frozen, make the meringue. Find a saucepan on which your electric mixer bowl will sit stably. Fill the saucepan a quarter of the way up with water and bring to a simmer. Put the egg whites and sugar in the bowl and set it over the pan, making sure the base isn’t touching the water. Whisk until the sugar dissolves and the mix is warm; rub a bit between your fingers: it’s ready when it feels smooth and not gritty. Transfer the bowl to the mixer, and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high for a minute. Add the remaining ingredients and beat for five minutes, until thick and glossy.To serve, invert the ice-cream bombe on to a serving plate. Gently tug at the clingfilm to release the ice-cream, then lift off the bowl and remove and discard the clingfilm. Spoon the meringue generously over the bombe to cover it entirely, using a small spatula to create swoops and peaks (at this stage, it can go in the freezer until ready to serve). Just before serving, use a blowtorch to caramelise the meringue until golden brown, then slice into wedges with a hot knife (dip it in a jug of hot water first, and wipe dry).Explore more on these topicsIce-cream and sorbetThe sweet spotDessertFoodBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"
