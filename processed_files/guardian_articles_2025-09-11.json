It’s 20 years since he self-released his debut album and 14 since he signed to a major label and set about becoming the most commercially successful British artist of his age: long enough that we’re now seeing the appearance of pop stars who claim him as a formative influence. (Singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was just into his teens when Sheeran released his breakthrough album +, even plays one of those little acoustic guitars that have long been Sheeran’s trademark.) It’s certainly long enough that anyone with even a passing interest knows what to expect when Ed Sheeran releases a new album.View image in fullscreenEd Sheeran: Play.Photograph: APSheeran’s success is based on a certain dependability: it doesn’t seem to matter who he works with – Pharrell Williams, Eric Clapton, Eminem, the National’s Aaron Dessner – the results always somehow sound exactly like Ed Sheeran. Whether you see that as evidence of a melodic signature so strong it rings out regardless of the musical setting or a failure of artistic imagination depends on whether you’re among those who contributed to his cumulative sales figures of 200m, or part of the vociferous cadre who view him as the embodiment of all that’s wrong with music. The latter camp gets a shout-out on Play’s prosaically titled opening track Opening, essentially an older, more battered counterpart to You Need Me, I Don’t Need You, the 2011 track that bullishly asserted his bona fides: “Not the pop star they say they prefer,” Sheeran raps.Solid, dependable: these are adjectives one could apply to Play. His last two albums, 2023’s muted – and Autumn Variations, were made with Dessner, the co-architect of Taylor Swift’s folksy lockdown albums: the former was Sheeran’s most acclaimed record critically, but the public seemed less convinced. Play has a sense of reassuring the shareholders about it: the big story is that Sheeran went to Goa to complete it, but – as with single Azizam’s diversion into Persian music – the sounds of the subcontinent that have soaked into the end product feel like window dressing.There’s traditional Indian percussion here and there, most notably on Heaven, plus Hindi and Punjabi vocals and a guest appearance from Bengali singer Arijit Singh on Sapphire, but none of it really overwhelms the tracks’ essential Ed Sheeran-ness: the former is sweetly emotive, the latter the kind of uptempo Ed Sheeran song that’s a little too eager to please and ends up slightly grating. Tablas and Hindi lyrics or not, no one is ever going to wonder who made them, particularly when they’re scattered among more traditional fare, which ranges in quality from ho-hum (the acoustic guitar-led ruminations of Old Phone) to exceptionally well crafted: the ruthlessly effective power balladry of Camera and The Vow, the lo-fi piano of In Other Words, the latter another contribution to a now-teetering pile of Sheeran songs that might have been designed for newlywed first dances.Ed Sheeran: Sapphire – videoAnd the tracks recorded in India feel less striking than two songs made closer to home. A collaboration with Fred Again, Don’t Look Down, fruitfully places Sheeran’s vocal amid luminous rave synths and, eventually, a pounding house beat. And highlight Symmetry opens with looped Indian percussion and vocals but quickly floats off in a different direction, involving spectral voices and heaving sub-bass. It’s not a radical reinvention, but you sense an artist pushing softly at boundaries.That said, Play is not incapable of springing genuine surprises: it comes as quite a jolt to hear Sheeran calling someone “a prick” on A Little More, then following it up with a line that definitely qualifies as a sick burn: “And for your dad’s sake, please move out your dad’s place.” The emotional temperature of Sheeran’s music to date has ranged from sorrowful to lovestruck. He’s never sounded angry. It’s unclear who the song is aimed at, or what they’ve done to rile him, but on A Little More, he seems genuinely livid: “I hate you … one day we’ll all be dead but between now and then I never want to see you again.” It’s both unexpected and weirdly bracing, its impact amplified by subtly effective electric piano and post-Amy Winehouse horns.David Byrne, Little Simz, Jasmine.4.t and more: the best music of autumn 2025Read moreA curiously dark emotional undercurrent keeps bubbling up throughout Play. There are allusions to Sheeran’s circle of friends contracting, to “leeches” and his heart being broken by “loved ones”. There are references to Sheeran’s much-noted professional drive that make it sound paranoid and compulsive – “if I look down I can see replacements … in this world there’s no relaxing” – and there’s Slowly, ostensibly just a song about missing his wife when she’s away “for a couple of days” that expresses itself in such extreme terms as to feel quite disturbing: “kill me slowly”, “this is knife-in-the-heart love”, “I’m dying alive”.Of course, these tinges of darkness are unlikely to impact on Play’s commercial success. All its preceding singles already have streaming figures that look like phone numbers. But it does mean you leave it wondering what on earth is going on: the last feeling one expects to get from an Ed Sheeran album.This week Alexis listened toGruff Rhys – Taro #1+ #2A highlight from his new Welsh-language album Dim Probs: the cocktail of laid-back west coast rock meets motorik drums plus new wave-y sax is a peculiar one that nevertheless slips down smoothly.Explore more on these topicsEd SheeranAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

The tiniest of hints thatPeter Mandelsonmight not have been a suitable candidate to act as the UK ambassador in Washington.Like being forced to resign from the cabinet over a failure to disclose a loan from Geoffrey Robinson. Like being forced to resign from the cabinet a second time over allegations of trying to procure a passport for the Hinduja brothers. Like his financial arrangements with the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Like his friendship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.But no.Keir Starmerand the civil service vetting committee apparently looked at all this and thought: “You know what? That’s just what we need. We can’t think of anyone better to be our US ambassador.” The very faults that might have disqualified other candidates became a huge positive for Mandy. What was needed when dealing with Donald Trump was someone utterly shameless in his sycophancy. A man with a long history of going weak at the knees in the presence of extreme wealth.It isn’t just Mandelson’s reputation that is in tatters. Mandy is as Mandy does, and the moral emptiness of his dark heart has long been a matter of record. It’s also Starmer’s judgment that has come under scrutiny and been found wanting.A diplomatic post that should have gone to someone of the very highest standards in public life instead went to the man with none. A race to the bottom in a desperate search for an expert Trump wrangler. An ambassador who ended up serving the interests of the US rather than his own country.As so often, it was left to a junior minister to be the fall guy. After Starmer had repeatedly insisted he had full confidence in Mandelson and the vetting procedure at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, it was inevitable that, after the publication of further emails between his lordship and Epstein, the opposition would use an urgent question to tease out more information and increase the government’s embarrassment. And sure enough, the shadow junior minister Neil O’Brien duly obliged.The urgent question was directed at the foreign secretary. But, in a show of the very highest level of bravery, there was no sign ofYvette Cooperfor her first outing at the dispatch box in her new job. Such a shining example to her team. Always good to see a minister leading from the front.So, just as it had been the luckless Mike Tapp, Labour’s very own Alan B’Stard, who had been sent out on his first morning media round as a junior minister to defend the indefensible, it was the hapless Stephen Doughty who had been handed the short straw.Departmental transport questions seemed to have gone on an age before the UQ. It soon became apparent why. The government had finally seen what everyone else had seen days ago and bowed to the inevitable. A rather anxious-looking Doughty scurried to the frontbench to tell MPs the prime minister had decidedto remove Mandelson from office with immediate effectin the light of the additional information that his lordship had written to Epstein saying he believed him to have been wrongly convicted of multiple sex offences. Would that do? Could everyone just go home now? Please.Er … no. O’Brien seemed momentarily annoyed to find that some of his thunder had been stolen. He had been expecting Doughty to continue the government’s abject defence of Mandy and had wanted to intensify the calls for his resignation. But he soon got over it as he realised he was still staring at an open goal.Let’s think this one through, he said. Was it the government’s position that it was perfectly OK for Mandelson to stay at Epstein’s apartment while he was in prison as long as he thought his friend was guilty? Because all that had changed was that Mandy had actually thought he was innocent. And could the minister please clarify what Starmer had actually known and when he had known it. Whichever way you looked at it, this was a huge error of judgment.There was, of course, a massive dose of double standards in many of the exchanges. Because many of the same Labour and Tory voices that were rushing to condemn Mandelson for his friendship with Epstein were choosing to ignore the fact that The Donald had also been a great mucker of the convicted child sex offender. But Donald was an honourable man. A great president. The state visit couldn’t come soon enough.It was all as clear as mud. Poor Doughty became so harassed and confused that he could barely get his own story straight. He couldn’t even bring himself to say that Mandy had been sacked, leading some to wonder if the ambassador had resigned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether Mandelson had volunteered the information that there were hundreds of incriminating emails waiting to cascade into the public domain. So you didn’t give a thought about the victims and were happy to stand by your billionaire old mucker? That’s all tickety boo. Just the sort of qualities we are looking for in our next ambassador. That’s a man who can get on with the president.Two Labour MPs, Sarah Coombes and Perran Moon, tried to come to Doughty’s assistance. The government had acted decisively by sacking Mandy, they insisted. But nothing could really help Steve now. Lost in his own misery. He knew as well as anyone that Mandy should never have been appointed in the first place and, once he had been, he should have been sacked at least 24 hours earlier. But he had no hiding place.Many other MPs from all parties killed Doughty with kindness. Tried to spare him as they vented their anger. They knew it wasn’t Steve’s fault. Doughty looked as if he might cry when the Tory Roger Gale said the minister was a decent man and deserved better than to be sent out to the Commons on a suicide mission.Steve’s eyes turned vacant. He wasn’t really here. Think of nice things to do at the weekend. Just keep repeating yourself. Removed from office. Additional information. No, the documents would not be released. Heaven forbid.Finally his ordeal was over when the speaker called time. Not a moment too soon for Steve. Still no sign of Keir or Yvette. Not a word of thanks.

The Gunner’s Dream (1983)Low on memorable tunes, big on racked, strangulated lead vocals, possessed of a worldview that makes every otherPink Floydalbum look like a gushing font of Pollyanna-ish optimism, The Final Cut is a slog. But The Gunner’s Dream cuts through the gloom, thanks to a heartbreaking, fragile melody.19. Wot’s … Uh the Deal? (1972)Overshadowed by the albums that preceded and followed it, Obscured by Clouds might be the most underrated release in Pink Floyd’s catalogue: it boasts fantastic instrumental experiments, musical signposts to The Dark Side of the Moon and, in Wot’s … Uh the Deal?, a beautifully careworn, Beatles-y ballad undersold by its daft title.18. Grantchester Meadows (1969)View image in fullscreenIn the pink … Nick Mason, Dave Gilmour, Rick Wright and Roger Waters in 1968.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThe studio half of Ummagumma is a mess – a band audibly searching for direction without success – but it contains one unequivocal triumph: Roger Waters’ evocation of the parkland on the banks of the River Cam, its pastoral calm spiked with a curious sense of menace, as if something nasty is lurking in the undergrowth.17. Cymbaline (1969)The More soundtrack throws up everything from proto-heavy metal and mock-flamenco to bongo solos. But Cymbaline – soaring choruses, Rick Wright-heavy coda – is both splendid and oddly prescient: “Apprehension creeping like a tube train up your spine” sounds like a Dark Side of the Moon lyric that arrived four years too early.16. Louder Than Words (2014)The final track on The Endless River,the final Pink Floyd studio album is, by some distance, the best song of their post-Waters era: it’s elegiac and gorgeous, and Polly Sampson’s lyrics touchingly suggest that the band’s music will ultimately drown out the members’ vitriolic public rifts. Brilliantly, a few years after it came out, they started slagging each other again: plus ça change.15. Fat Old Sun (1970)The choral experiments of Atom Heart Mother’s lengthy title track might have attracted the most attention, but its highlight was tucked away on side two, a sighing, utterly lovely slice of very, very English late August melancholy that sounded like country rock by way ofParker’s Piece.14. Run Like Hell (1979)Rocking out was never really Pink Floyd’s forte – see 1969’s hopelessly leaden The Nile Song for proof – but Run Like Hell is the exception that proves the rule: powerfully claustrophobic and paranoid, driven by a relentless disco-facing beat and David Gilmour’s echoing guitar (inspired by the cellos on the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations).13. Brain Damage/Eclipse (1973)View image in fullscreenPink Floyd play the Merriweather Post Pavilion, Columbia, Maryland, June 1973.Photograph: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesDespite his departure in 1968, Barrett seems to haunt Dark Side of the Moon’s concluding medley. The eerie, nursery rhyme-like verses of Brain Damage sound distinctly Barrett-esque; the lyrics allude to his decline. The song is also oddly equivocal: Eclipse’s epic climax is undercut by the Abbey Road studios doorman Gerry O’Driscoll grumbling “there is no dark side of the moon, really”.12. Dogs (1977)Animals is a tough but potent listen: its relentlessly bleak, contemptuous tone is as much an expression of mid-70s malaise and frustration as punk was. Dogs embodies the album’s grim mood – screeching synths disrupt the quieter sections, the lyrics are a tirade of misanthropy and hopelessness – and its glowering power: Gilmour’s guitar solos are particularly blazing.View image in fullscreenA 40ft-long inflatable pig suspended between two of the chimneys at Battersea power station, London, during a photoshoot for the cover of Animals, 6 November 1976.Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images11. Jugband Blues (1968)The original Pink Floyd’s last stand, a dark coda to the summer of love, and the sound of LSD’s psychological wreckage washing up in rock for the first time. Barrett delivers a depiction of his own mental disintegration in a chillingly dead-eyed voice, a Salvation Army band erupts into free-form mayhem: it’s both disturbing and extraordinary.10. Us and Them (1973)Based on a Wright piece rejected from the soundtrack of Zabriskie Point for being “too sad”, the tone of Us and Them is utterly defeated: the chorus feels like someone trying to rouse themselves into action before sinking back into a crestfallen torpor. But it’s also exceptionally beautiful, making dejection exquisite.9. See Emily Play (1967)People who saw the original iteration of Pink Floyd live often claim their studio recordings were too poppy to do them justice. But that scarcely matters when the pop songs were as original and creative as See Emily Play – the psychedelic experience crammed into three fabulous minutes, a definitive summer of love artefact.8. One of These Days (1971)After a few tentative years, Pink Floyd 2.0 finally found their footing on Meddle, something the band members clearly realised: built around Waters’ echo-laden bass, there’s a thrillingly brawny, confident swagger to opener One of These Days. If you want to hear Depeche Mode paying homage, head to Violator’sClean.7. Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun (1968)The most obvious sign that there was life after Barrett on A Saucerful of Secrets, Set the Controls … was long, partly improvised, hypnotic (and a huge influence on the nascent Krautrock scene), but resolutely not music to relax and float downstream to: it’s too creepy and unsettling.6. Shine on You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5) (1975)Pink Floyd are synonymous with intra-band rancour, but they once worked perfectly as a sympatico unit. The lengthy instrumental intro of Shine on You Crazy Diamond is a masterpiece of scene setting: Wright’s keyboards and Gilmour’s mournful guitar perfectly fix the mood for the arrival of Waters’ bereft lyrics.5. Astronomy Domine (1967)Barrett’s psychedelic Pink Floyd at full power: they sound raw and visceral, like a garage band from Mars. Barrett’s guitar playing is astonishingly inventive, the lyrics spew out references to planets, comic books and Shakespeare in a lysergic gush: it’s nearly 60 years old and it’s stillincrediblyexciting.4. Echoes (1971)The post-Barrett, pre-Dark Side Floyd’s uncontested showstopper, Echoes was essentially an array of musical fragments painstakingly pieced together, although you’d never know: from its icy intro to a triumphant finale, its 23 minutes flow effortlessly. The guitar playing is lyrical and expressive, the downcast verses beautiful, the ambient interlude creepy: it’s got the lot.3. Comfortably Numb (1979)It sold 30m copies, but The Wall still divides opinion: alienated masterpiece or insufferable monument to rock star solipsism? But everyone seems to agree on Comfortably Numb: its movement from wistful (but vaguely menacing) verses into a blissful (but faintly unnerving) chorus is exhilarating, and the cathartic guitar solo is a wonder.2. Time (1973)It’s hard to pick a highlight from Dark Side of the Moon, but Time is the song that packs the biggest emotional punch. A mediation on ageing written by a man still in his 20s should feel callow and speculative; instead, the lyrics of Time become more impactful the older you get.1. Wish You Were Here (1975)As simple and direct as 70s Pink Floyd got, which might explain why it’s been covered by everyone from Sparklehorse and Thom Yorke to the metal band Avenged Sevenfold and – yes! – Susan Boyle. Or perhaps it’s because, from its opening riff to its closing guitar-and-scat-vocal solo, it’s an incredible song. Waters’ lyrics are deeply personal – addressed to Barrett, they first ponder whether he might have made a mistake in retreating from music, then collapse into sighing remorse – but there’s an affecting universality to their sense of loss and regret. There’s also a warmth and empathy noticeably absent in Pink Floyd’s subsequent work.Explore more on these topicsPink FloydRankedRoger WatersDavid GilmourPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Clutch monogrammed hankies for period-appropriate eye-dabbing. After 15 years on our screens, the Downton Abbey saga is about to hop in its vintage Rolls and drive off into the soft-focus sunset. The third and final film spin-off,Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, is released this Friday, accompanied by a forelock-tugging farewell ITV documentary.For six series, Downton bestrode the Sunday night schedules like a Grade II-listed colossus. Writer Julian Fellowes’s upstairs-downstairs creation followed entitled aristos and their salt-of-the-earth servants at a fictional country pile. Sure, the dialogue was clumsy, the plots soapy and the historical exposition clunked like a stately home’s antique radiators. Yet somehow, it didn’t matter.Downton was watched by an estimated 120 million people worldwide. It won three Golden Globes, four Baftas and a whopping 15 Emmys, becoming one of British TV’s most successful exports of all time. Film sequels soon swept into cinemas, knocking over popcorn buckets with their bustles and grossing almost $300m (£222m) at the global box office.Now, like the crumbling dream of aristocratic England it portrayed, it’s coming to an end. But what were the haw-hawing highlights? And what were the tweed-clad low points? Come with us as we ask our underpaid but grateful butler to pass the best claret and press rewind …The five bestMatthew Crawley’s smashing ChristmasAcross three series of sherry-sipping, pearl-clutching and low-stakes plotting, Downton had established itself as one of the cosiest treats on TV. So it came as a sucker punch at Christmas 2012 when Fellowes made the nation choke on its Quality Street. Mere hours after wife, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), had given birth to a son and heir, Matthew and his floppy fringe were devastatingly killed off in a car crash. As his vintage motor lay upside down in a ditch, the camera festively lingered on his lifeless eyes and pooling blood. Roll credits. Actor Dan Stevens went on to big things in Hollywood, but the Scrooge-like plot twist became known as “How Downton Ruined Christmas”.Everything theDowager Countessever said“Don’t be defeatist, dear, it’s very middle class.” Downton’s defining character was tart-tongued diva Violet Crawley, brought to owl-like life by the lateMaggie Smith. Her innocent inquiry of “What is a weekend?” will go down in toff TV history. The pampered posho’s haughty face-pulling and delicious line delivery were a weekly highlight. Her pince-nez would pop off at a cutlery-based crime. Her nostrils flared in horror at some ghastly commoner’s etiquette error. Even her last words were positively Wildean, telling a blubbing lady’s maid at her bedside: “Stop that noise, I can’t hear myself die.”Lady Mary’s Turkish delightYou’d think actor Theo James – him of White Lotus douchebag pedigree – could handle himself in a sex scene, but 15 years ago, the virgin Mary quite literally shagged him to death. James popped up in series one as Turkish diplomat Kemal Pamuk, who stopped off at Downton after a peace conference. During a scandalous night of passion with the Earl of Grantham’s eldest daughter, Pamuk dropped dead from a heart attack. A spot of nocturnal corpse removal helped hush it up. Fellowes has admitted that the plotline was pilfered from real life. “That was completely true,” he said. “A guest had smuggled in a man who then had a heart attack. They carried this dead body the length of one of England’s great houses, got him into his right bed and the story never got out.” What a way to go. Downton legend has it that the ghost of Mr Pamuk still haunts the back passage.Romance below stairsThose toffs upstairs are all very well, but it’s the plucky plebs who provided the show’s heart and soul. Downton devotees grinned ear to ear when romance blossomed between honourable valet Mr Bates (Brendan Coyle) and loyal lady’s maid Anna (Joanne Froggatt). The couple had all manner of black-clad misery heaped upon them – murder trials, rapes, miscarriages, gratuitous limps – but lower-class love conquered all. Their cockle-warming arc was surpassed only by the Remains of the Day-style slow-burn courtship between butler Carson (Jim Carter) and housekeeper Mrs Hughes (Phyllis Logan). This was further improved by a comical prenuptial subplot where Mrs Hughes roped in cook Mrs Patmore (Lesley Nicol) to find out if Carson expected their union to be consummated. Cue a barrage of ye olde euphemisms: “Have you fully considered every aspect of marriage? Will she be expected to perform all wifely duties? Do you wish her to share your, er, way of life?” Carson’s eyebrows raised so far they hovered near the chandeliers.View image in fullscreenBrendan Coyle and Joanne Froggatt film a romantic encounter as John Bates and Anna Smith.Photograph: Photograph Nick Briggs. +44(0)20/film company handoutWhen Sybil made us snivelWhen he wrote the script where the youngest Crawley sister died in childbirth, Fellowes confessed that he was “absolutely streaming with tears’’. You and us both, babes. Having boldly crossed the class divide to marry Irish chauffeur Tom “no relation to Richard” Branson (Allen Leech), husky-voiced, gold-hearted Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) gave birth to a baby girl. However, her bumptious father and his fancy London doctor ignored the warnings of village physician Dr Clarkson, refusing to take her to hospital. Sybil promptly died from the complications of pre-eclampsia. Her heartbroken husband named their daughter Sybbie in tribute. Stop it, you’ll set me off again.The five worstWalk, don’t walkShot in the spine and sent home wounded from the first world war, that nice Matthew Crawley was told that he’d be paralysed for life from the waist down and unable to father children. Gasp! What did this mean for dear old Downton’s uncertain future? Fear not, ye of little faith. It was a mere two episodes before Matthew miraculously regained feeling in his legs and instinctively leapt from his wheelchair to help Lavinia Swire (Zoe Boyle) when she tripped over and dropped a tea tray, gallantly catching her as she fell. They should turn it into a NHS treatment.That dog’s derriere on the opening titlesPoorIsis the labrador. Not only did her name become deeply awkward during the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organisation. She was also subjected to the doggy indignity of a lingering shot of her backside on the opening credits. As the Earl of Grantham strode across the rolling grounds towards his stately home, his hound trotted alongside, bum oscillating in and out of view as her tail wagged. Isis was eventually killed off and replaced by an Andrex puppy called Teo, but out of respect, her fluffy derriere remained on the credits. It’s what she would have wanted.Spratt’s entertainmentLady Edith’s main function was to be unlucky in love and live in the flapper girl-shaped shadow of elder sister Mary. By series five, however, she’d become a career woman. Kind of. As Edith edited a new-fangled magazine in “that” London, society was abuzz with speculation about the identity of its anonymous agony aunt Cassandra – a sort of proto-Lady Whistledown from Bridgerton. Who lay behind this mysterious nom de plume? In a camply implausible development, step forward the Dowager Countess’s bumbling butler Septimus Spratt (Jeremy Swift) – a sort of male Mrs Overall with a face like a wet weekend in Whitby. Who else? It’s a wonder Spratt found time for moonlighting, what with his interminable feud with lippy lady’s maid Mrs Denker (Sue Johnston).O’Brien gets her ladyship in a latherAlong with scheming footman Thomas Barrow, evil lady’s maid Miss O’Brien (Siobhan Finneran) was the hiss-boo panto villain of the early series. Her most dastardly trick was the literal stuff of soap opera. Under the misapprehension that she was about to be sacked, O’Brien slyly planted a wet bar of carbolic soap on the floor beside her mistress’s bath. Pregnant Cora Crawley (Elizabeth McGovern) slipped on it and miscarried. O’Brien, in her defence, did appear full of remorse for a scene or two, before normal devious service was resumed. Sadly, it’s also the last mildly interesting storyline that Cora got.SpewBonnevilleDinnertime gore-fests are more traditionally associated with Game of Thrones. But anything Westeros can do, the landed gentry can do more ludicrously. There had been clumsy foreshadowing of Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) having stomach problems, with the peaky patriarch grumbling about “a bit of indigestion”. Nobody expected a scene worthy of The Exorcist. During a dinner for visiting health minister (and future PM) Neville Chamberlain, the Earl’s ulcer burst and he projectile-vomited blood all over the dinner table and assembled guests. While the Earl was carted off for emergency surgery, diners daintily wiped scarlet spatter off their pearls and tiaras, before sending for another pot of Mrs Patmore’s coffee.

On her first day of work a week later, however, her expectations went bust. Instead of writing words herself, Sawyer’s job was to rate and moderate the content created by artificial intelligence.The job initially involved a mix of parsing through meeting notes and chats summarized by Google’s Gemini, and, in some cases, reviewing short films made by the AI.On occasion, she was asked to deal with extreme content, flagging violent and sexually explicit material generated by Gemini for removal, mostly text. Over time, however, she went from occasionally moderating such text and images to being tasked with it exclusively.“I was shocked that my job involved working with such distressing content,” said Sawyer, who has been working as a “generalist rater” for Google’s AI products since March 2024. “Not only because I was given no warning and never asked to sign any consent forms during onboarding, but because neither the job title or description ever mentioned content moderation.”The pressure to complete dozens of these tasks every day, each within 10 minutes of time, has led Sawyer into spirals of anxiety and panic attacks, she says – without mental health support from her employer.Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreSawyer is one among the thousands of AI workers contracted for Google through Japanese conglomerate Hitachi’s GlobalLogic to rate and moderate the output of Google’s AI products, including its flagship chatbot Gemini, launched early last year, and its summaries of search results, AI Overviews. The Guardian spoke to 10 current and former employees from the firm. Google contracts with other firms for AI rating services as well, includingAccenture and, previously, Appen.Google has clawed its way back into the AI race in the past year with a host of product releases to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Google’s most advanced reasoning model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, is touted to be better than OpenAI’s O3, according toLMArena, a leaderboard that tracks the performance of AI models. Each new model release comes with the promise of higher accuracy, which means that for each version, these AI raters are working hard to check if the model responses are safe for the user. Thousands of humans lend their intelligence to teach chatbots the right responses across domains as varied as medicine, architecture and astrophysics, correcting mistakes and steering away from harmful outputs.A great deal of attention has been paid to the workers who label the data that is used to train artificial intelligence. There is, however, another corps of workers, including Sawyer, working day and night to moderate the output of AI, ensuring that chatbots’ billions of users see only safe and appropriate responses.AI models are trained on vast swathes of data from every corner of the internet. Workers such as Sawyer sit in a middle layer of the global AI supply chain – paid more than data annotators inNairobiorBogota, whose work mostly involves labelling data for AI models or self-driving cars, but far below the engineers in Mountain View who design these models.Despite their significant contributions to these AI models, which would perhaps hallucinate if not for these quality control editors, these workers feel hidden.“AI isn’t magic; it’s a pyramid scheme of human labor,” said Adio Dinika, a researcher at the Distributed AI Research Institute based in Bremen, Germany. “These raters are the middle rung: invisible, essential and expendable.”Google said in a statement: “Quality raters are employed by our suppliers and are temporarily assigned to provide external feedback on our products. Their ratings are one of many aggregated data points that help us measure how well our systems are working, but do not directly impact our algorithms or models.” GlobalLogic declined to comment for this story.AI raters: the shadow workforceGoogle, like other tech companies, hires data workers through a web of contractors and subcontractors. One of the main contractors for Google’s AI raters is GlobalLogic – where these raters are split into two broad categories: generalist raters and super raters. Within the super raters, there are smaller pods of people with highly specialized knowledge. Most workers hired initially for the roles were teachers. Others included writers, people with master’s degrees in fine arts and some with very specific expertise, for instance, Phd holders in physics, workers said.View image in fullscreenA user tests the Google Gemini AI at the MWC25 tech show in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesGlobalLogic started this work for the tech giant in 2023 – at the time, it hired 25 super raters, according to three of the interviewed workers. As the race to improve chatbots intensified, GlobalLogic ramped up its hiring and grew the team of AI super raters to almost 2,000 people, most of them located within the US and moderating content in English, according to the workers.AI raters at GlobalLogic are paid more than their data-labeling counterparts in Africa and South America, with wages starting at $16 an hour for generalist raters and $21 an hour for super raters, according to workers. Some are simply thankful to have a gig as the US job market sours, but others say that trying to make Google’s AI products better has come at a personal cost.“They are people with expertise who are doing a lot of great writing work, who are being paid below what they’re worth to make an AI model that, in my opinion, the world doesn’t need,” said a rater of their highly educated colleagues, requesting anonymity for fear of professional reprisal.Ten of Google’s AI trainers the Guardian spoke to said they have grown disillusioned with their jobs because they work in siloes, face tighter and tighter deadlines, and feel they are putting out a product that’s not safe for users.One rater who joined GlobalLogic early last year said she enjoyed understanding the AI pipeline by working on Gemini 1.0, 2.0 and now 2.5, and helping it give “a better answer that sounds more human”. Six months in, though, tighter deadlines kicked in. Her timer of 30 minutes for each task shrank to 15 – which meant reading, fact-checking and rating approximately 500 words per response, sometimes more. The tightening constraints made her question the quality of her work and, by extension, the reliability of the AI. In May 2023, a contract worker for Appen submitted a letter to the US Congress that the pace imposed on him and others would make Google Bard, Gemini’s predecessor,a “faulty” and “dangerous” product.High pressure, little informationOne worker who joined GlobalLogic in spring 2024 and has worked on five different projects so far, including Gemini and AI Overviews, described her work as being presented with a prompt – either user-generated or synthetic – and with two sample responses, then choosing the response that aligned best with the guidelines, and rating it based on any violations of those guidelines. Occasionally, she was asked to stump the model.She said raters are typically given as little information as possible or that their guidelines changed too rapidly to enforce consistently. “We had no idea where it was going, how it was being used or to what end,” she said, requesting anonymity, as she is still employed at the company.The AI responses she got “could have hallucinations or incorrect answers” and she had to rate them based on factuality – is it true? – and groundedness – does it cite accurate sources? Sometimes, she also handled “sensitivity tasks” that included prompts such as “when is corruption good?” or “what are the benefits to conscripted child soldiers?”“They were sets of queries and responses to horrible things worded in the most banal, casual way,” she added.As for the ratings, this worker claims that popularity could take precedence over agreement and objectivity. Once the workers submit their ratings, other raters are assigned the same cases to make sure the responses are aligned. If the different raters did not align on their ratings, they would have consensus meetings to clarify the difference. “What this means in reality is the more domineering of the two bullied the other into changing their answers,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But just weeks later, when a user queried Google about cheese not sticking to pizza, an AI Overview suggested they put glue on their dough. Another suggested users eat rocks. Google called these questions “edge cases”, but the incidents elicited public ridicule nonetheless.Google scrambled to manually removethe “weird” AI responses.“Honestly, those of us who’ve been working on the model weren’t really that surprised,” said another GlobalLogic worker, who has been on the super rater team for almost two years now, requesting anonymity. “We’ve seen a lot of crazy stuff that probably doesn’t go out to the public from these models.” He remembers there was an immediate focus on “quality” after this incident because Google was “really upset about this”.But this quest for quality didn’t last too long.Rebecca Jackson-Artis, a seasoned writer, joined GlobalLogic from North Carolina in fall 2024. With less than one week of training on how to edit and rate responses by Google’s AI products, she was thrown into the mix of the work, unsure of how to handle the tasks. As part of the Google Magi team, a new AI search product geared towards e-commerce, Jackson-Artis was initially told there was no time limit to complete the tasks assigned to her. Days later, though, she was given the opposite instruction, she said.“At first they told [me]: ‘Don’t worry about time – it’s quality versus quantity,’” she said.But before long, she was pulled up for taking too much time to complete her tasks. “I was trying to get things right and really understand and learn it, [but] was getting hounded by leaders [asking], ‘Why aren’t you getting this done? You’ve been working on this for an hour.’”Two months later, Jackson-Artis was called into a meeting with one of her supervisors, questioned about her productivity, and was asked to “just get the numbers done” and not worry about what she’s “putting out there”, she said. By this point, Jackson-Artis was not just fact-checking and rating the AI’s outputs, but was also entering information into the model, she said. The topics ranged widely – from health and finance to housing and child development.One work day, her task was to enter details on chemotherapy options for bladder cancer, which haunted her because she wasn’t an expert on the subject.“I pictured a person sitting in their car finding out that they have bladder cancer and googling what I’m editing,” she said.In December, Google sent an internal guideline to its contractors working on Gemini that they were no longer allowed to “skip” prompts for lack of domain expertise, including on healthcare topics, which they were allowed to do previously, according to aTechCrunchreport. Instead, they were told to rate parts of the prompt they understood and flag with a note that they don’t have knowledge in that area.Another super rater based on the US west coast feels he gets several questions a day that he’s not qualified to handle. Just recently, he was tasked with two queries – one on astrophysics and the other on math – of which he said he had “no knowledge” and yet was told to check the accuracy.Earlier this year, Sawyer noticed a further loosening of guardrails: responses that were not OK last year became “perfectly permissible” this year. In April, the raters received a document from GlobalLogic with new guidelines, a copy of which has been viewed bythe Guardian, which essentially said that regurgitating hate speech, harassment, sexually explicit material, violence, gore or lies does not constitute a safety violation so long as the content was not generated by the AI model.Speed eclipses ethics. The AI safety promise collapses the moment safety threatens profitAdio Dinika“It used to be that the model could not say racial slurs whatsoever. In February, that changed, and now, as long as the user uses a racial slur, the model can repeat it, but it can’t generate it,” said Sawyer. “It can replicate harassing speech, sexism, stereotypes, things like that. It can replicate pornographic material as long as the user has input it; it can’t generate that material itself.”Google said in a statement that its AI policies have not changed with regards to hate speech. InDecember 2024, however, the company introduced a clause to its prohibited use policy for generative AI that would allow for exceptions “where harms are outweighed by substantial benefits to the public”, such as art or education. The update, which aligns with the timeline of the document and Sawyer’s account, seems to codify the distinction between generating hate speech and referencing or repeating it for a beneficial purpose. Such context may not be available to a rater.Dinika said he’s seen this pattern time and again where safety is only prioritized until it slows the race for market dominance. Human workers are often left to clean up the mess after a half-finished system is released. “Speed eclipses ethics,” he said. “The AI safety promise collapses the moment safety threatens profit.”Though the AI industry is booming, AI raters do not enjoy strong job security. Since the start of 2025, GlobalLogic has had rolling layoffs, with the total workforce of AI super raters and generalist raters shrinking to roughly 1,500, according to multiple workers. At the same time, workers feel a sense of loss of trust with the products they are helping build and train. Most workers said they avoid using LLMs or use extensions to block AI summaries because they now know how it’s built. Many also discourage their family and friends from using it, for the same reason.“I just want people to know that AI is being sold as this tech magic – that’s why there’s a little sparkle symbol next to an AI response,” said Sawyer. “But it’s not. It’s built on the backs of overworked, underpaid human beings.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He is also facing an internal Labour battle over the deputy leadership after his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner,had to resign last week over her tax affairs.While No 10 was hoping the sacking would show decisive action by the prime minister, Starmer quickly became the focus of criticism over his decision to appoint Mandelson in spite of warnings about his chequered past and his defence of the US ambassador up until Wednesday.The prime minister was also urged to clarify whether there were concerns from security officials about Mandelson, after Sky News reported that red flags were raised by intelligence services in the vetting process. It is understood that any concerns about security were likely to have been contained in a risk assessment from government officials, rather than from the intelligence agencies.However, another government adviser said they had raised informal doubts within Whitehall about Mandelson’s2005 association with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaskabut said they were reassured that he was a good appointment because he was “such a master of the dark arts”.SomeLabourMPs are furious about yet another political blunder in the week after Rayner’s resignation, with a number of them angered by what they regard as the influence of Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, who is known to be politically close to Mandelson. One Labour MP described it as a “boys’ club sticking up for their own” and another suggested that some in No 10 “think it’s OK for their mates to do bad things”.A No 10 insider, however, said McSweeney had already formed the view Mandelson should go by Wednesday lunchtime. But Starmer, Yvette Cooper and other aides did not make the final call until Thursday morning.Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, suggested the blame lay with Mandelson, and said it was “shameful” that the politician had put himself forward for the job knowing that such emails had been written and that there was more to come out about their friendship.Downing Street said on Thursday that Starmer had found the new emails expressing love for Epstein and urging him to challenge his sentence “reprehensible”.No 10 also insisted that it had not been responsible for vetting Mandelson and stood behind the decision to defend the US ambassador even though it was already known he had continued a friendship with Epstein after the conviction.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson’s sacking has come in the same week Angela Rayner was forced to resign as the deputy prime minister, housing secretary and Labour’s deputy leader.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWith Starmer yet to speak publicly about Mandelson’s sacking, the Conservatives called for a full release of documents in relation to his appointment and the Liberal Democrats urged the government to review its vetting procedures.Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, called for Starmer to come to parliament to explain what he knew and when, while Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said: “Mandelson might have gone but, just as with Angela Rayner, Starmer dithered when he needed to be decisive. Time and again he puts party above country. He has no backbone and no convictions.”The SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, said Starmer’s “judgment, his reputation and his authority are now on the line”.Announcing the sacking, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: “In light of the additional information in emails written byPeter Mandelson, the prime minister has asked the foreign secretary to withdraw him as ambassador.“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment. In particular, Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information.“In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein’s crimes, he has been withdrawn as ambassador with immediate effect.”Before Mandelson’s departure was announced, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told an event that he was “completely disgusted” by messages Mandelson sent to Epstein and that his future was “a decision for the prime minister”.Government sources said Starmer took the decision during a meeting with Cooper, the foreign secretary, on Thursday morning, after reviewing the new material on Mandelson’s defence of Epstein the previous night. It is understood Mandelson himself had not, until the leak, had access to the emails written in 2008 because they came from a long-deleted account.Mandelson’s departure comes at a delicate time for No 10 as it prepares for a state visit by Trump, who is facing his own questions about his friendship with Epstein. It is understood that James Roscoe, the deputy head of mission in Washington, will be interim ambassador and supervise the visit.View image in fullscreenAccording to an insider, Morgan McSweeney had wanted Mandelson to be removed from his post by Wednesday lunchtime.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyBoth David Miliband, a former Labour foreign secretary, and Catherine Ashton, a former EU commissioner, were previously on the shortlist for the US ambassador job. Karen Pierce, who held the job before Mandelson, is among those who could be asked to return, while another possible candidate could be outgoing MI6 boss Richard Moore.Starmer is thought likely to choose an official rather than a politician this time, after the controversy over Mandelson.On Wednesday at prime minister’s questions, Starmer backed Mandelson, insisting the ambassador had been fully vetted.However, he faced overwhelming pressure to act after it emerged that Mandelson had told Epstein to fight for early release from jail as the disgraced financier faced an 18-month sentence for procuring a child for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute in 2008.The emails were published by the Sun after circulating in Washington DC, hours after Mandelson admitted on Tuesday thatmore “very embarrassing” details of his friendship with Epsteinwould probably emerge. He insisted he had never witnessed any wrongdoing.In an email from June 2008, which was not disputed by his spokesperson, Mandelson wrote to Epstein: “I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened.“I can still barely understand it. It just could not happen in Britain. You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can.”It continued: “Everything can be turned into an opportunity and that you will come through it and be stronger for it.”The friendship between the two men came under a renewed spotlight earlier this week after Democratic members of the US House oversight committee released Epstein’s 50th “birthday book”, in which Mandelson called him“my best pal” in a handwritten note.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonKeir StarmerLabourForeign policyShareReuse this content"

But the judge, who also controversially argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, claimed there was no proof Bolsonaro was to blame for inciting the riots.View image in fullscreenBrazil’s federal supreme court minister Carmen Lucia.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APFux did, however, vote to convict two of Bolsonaro’s closest allies – his former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, and his former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid – for the crime of violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy. The judge concluded that the pair had helped plan and bankroll a plot to murder Moraes in order to generate social mayhem they hoped would trigger a military intervention.There were leftwing celebrations outside the supreme court as Rocha sealed the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other close allies who were also convicted. They include the former defence ministers, Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos.Bolsonaro’s former spy chief, Alexandre Ramagem, and justice minister, Anderson Torres, were also found guilty, as was Cid.“Today, Brazil is making history,” Lindbergh Farias, the leader of Lula’s Workers’ party in the lower house of congress, said as he emerged from the building. “Brazil is saying: ‘Coups are a crime!’”‘I’m holding his political wake’: the trumpeter waiting to mark Bolsonaro’s judgment dayRead moreFabiano Leitão,a trumpeterwho has spent years using his instrument to criticise Bolsonaro, turned up​ to mark the day of history with a rendition of Chopin’s Funeral March that symbolised the former president’s downfall. ​“It’s the end! It’s the end of this guy!” Leitão​ said as he pulled out his trumpet.After playing the sombre composition, the leftwing musician​ ​launched into a lively samba, capturing the joy many Brazilians feel at the demise of a politician they blame for attacking their country’s democracy, environment and minorities. “The extreme right is a mechanism​ of destruction of countries. It destroys everything: healthcare, science, technology, education, culture. It destroys it all. So this is a historic moment for this county,” Leitão said. “Justice is done, comrades!”Bolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict political persecution and Donald Trump said the conviction was “very surprising”.“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” said the US president who has spent recent months trying to pressure Brazil’s supreme court and government into halting Bolsonaro’s trial witha campaign of tariffs and sanctions.“The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt​,” tweeted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, calling the conviction “unjust”.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Bolsonaro demonstrated in São Paulo on Brazilian Independence Day (7 September).Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersEduardo Bolsonaro, another son of the former president, told Reuters he expected the US to apply further sanctions against officials following his father’s conviction.In a post on social media, Brazil’s foreign ministry rejected the statement from US officials, saying “threats like those made today by the US secretary of state Marco Rubio … will not intimidate our democracy”.The former president did not attend court this week, remaining in his nearby mansion, where he is under house arrest and police officers have been stationed to ensure he does not flee to one of Brasília’s foreign embassies.Progressive elation at the downfall of a president blamed for rampant environmental destruction, hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths and attacks on minorities, has been tempered by the realisation that his political movement remains very much alive. Some fear Fux’s questioning of the judges’ authority over the case could open the door to legal challenges and even the trial’s annulment in the future.Anatomy of a coup plot: why Jair Bolsonaro is on trialRead more“I wouldn’t declare Jair Bolsonaro’s political death,” said Dr Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, who studies the Brazilian right.Rocha expected supporters of the former president to keep fighting to rescue their leader from jail. Likely strategies include trying to elect a large number of rightwing senators in next year’s elections who could impeach members of the supreme court considered Bolsonaro’s foes;petitioning Donald Trumpto heap more pressure on Brazil over Bolsonaro’s plight; and trying to ensure that a pro-Bolsonaro candidate beats Lula in the 2026 presidential election. Their hope was that a rightwing president might grant Bolsonaro a pardon, although the supreme court could torpedo those plans, she said.“I think they’ll continue trying various ways of getting Bolsonaro out of jail and to uphold his leadership and keep him visible,” she predicted.In recent weeks, pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers have been pushing the idea of an amnesty for their leader and others who were involved in the coup attempt and the 8 January 2023 riots in Brasília. They claim such forgiveness would help pacify a politically divided country.But Fabio Victor, the author of a book about military involvement in Brazilian politics called Camouflaged Power, said he believed an amnesty would serve as an “incentive to illegality”. “It would send an awful signal – it would undoubtedly represent a setback to democracy,” he warned.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the drones flew more than a hundred miles into Polish airspace.Gen Alexus GregoryGrynkewich, Nato’s supreme allied commander for Europe, said that he had “low confidence” in the drone numbers previously reported, suggesting the defenders were not immediately clear what they were dealing with.But, speaking at press conference in Lithuania, the military commander said: “Based on the lessons from these events, we’re going to continue to work to improve our ability to defend every single inch of alliance airspace.”British officials indicated that an agreement signed withUkraine– called Project Octopus – to jointly develop large numbers of drones to intercept Russian Shaheds could also be deployed in Poland as well as in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenDefence secretary John Healey spoke about Russia at the DSEI arms fair.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAJohn Healey, the defence secretary, told the DSEI arms fair in London that the UK had to be “more ready to fight” in a war in order to deter growing Russian aggression – and that weapons like the Project Octopus drones would serve both British and Ukrainian interests in the future.“What we get is the learning from the Ukrainians,” Healey said. “What we get is the shared IP [intellectual property]. What we get are the products of what we produce with the Ukrainians available for ourselves and our own armed forces, not just to supply the Ukrainians and their defence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another option under consideration is to contribute RAF Typhoon jets to an enlarged air policing mission in eastern Europe – six of the fighters were on Nato duty as part of a rotating mission earlier this summer.The former army general Sir Richard Barrons, a second member of the defence review team, said that the number of drones involved indicated “it was clearly a deliberate incursion” by Russia, although the fact that they appeared to be Gerbera decoy drones rather than armed Shaheds meant it was “a minor act of provocation”.The drone incursion demonstrated, Barrons said, that existing Nato defences were “well short of dealing with what is a small tactical problem”. He added that using fighter jets to shoot down drones was “massive overkill” but that it was necessary to “step up quite quickly to improve medium- to low-level air defence”.He also argued that preventing missile and drone attacks over western airspace “amounted to defending on the goal line” and that effective deterrence would require shooting down Russian jets launching attacks into western airspace. Such an approach, however, is unlikely to find favour with politicians who emphasise that Nato is a defensive alliance.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNatoRussiaUkrainePolandEuropeMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

They say they also found a systematic campaign to strangle humanitarian aid, which they call “using food as a weapon of war”.“The Netanyahu government has gone far beyond targeting Hamas to imposing collective punishment on all the people ofGaza,” Van Hollen said at a Thursday press conference. “What they’re doing, and what we witnessed, is putting those goals into action.”At least one hundred people have died from famine in Gaza, the United Nationssaid this week, citing the Gaza health ministry.View image in fullscreenRelatives of one-and-a-half-year-old Palestinian Ayman Muhammad Abd al-Ghafur, who died from severe malnutrition, oxygen deprivation and muscle wasting, mourn as the body is taken from Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, on Tuesday.Photograph: Abdallah Fs Alattar/Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe senators, who visited Egypt, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jordan, argue that Israel’s actions in Gaza constitute a deliberate strategy to ethnically cleanse the local population rather than collateral damage from the war against Hamas. Their report is titled The Netanyahu Government Is Implementing a Plan to Ethnically Cleanse Gaza of Palestinians. America is Complicit. The World Must Stop It.During their visit to the Egyptian-Gaza border, they observed Rafah, the southern Gaza city – once home to 270,000 Palestinians – reduced to rubble. Van Hollen described how both lawmakers climbed an outside fire escape from the Egyptian side of the border to get a clear view of the destruction.The lawmakers also met with former Israel Defense Forces soldiers who described participating in “systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure”. Their report noted first-hand accounts of “how this was a part of an intentional pattern of using explosives to blow up whole city blocks, houses, schools and other civilian sites”.The senators documented arbitrary restrictions that have left aid groups unable to predict what will be denied entry. Jordanian officials told them that peanut butter, honey and dates had been suddenly banned from convoys, with entire trucks turned away for carrying a single restricted item. Each truck, the report says, is subject to a new $400 customs processing fee, and when the truck is not able to make it through the screening process, the $400 has to be paid again to join a later convoy. Because of those and other restrictions by the Israeli government, humanitarian aid coming in from Jordan was currently operating under 10% of its capacity, according to the report.In Egypt, the senators report, the UN’s fleet of trucks have “sustained severe damage”, with United Nations organizations showing the senators video of their convoys coming under fire from the IDF, “a regular occurrence”. The senators also toured a warehouse run by the Egyptian Red Crescent and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) with goods that had been banned by Israel, including solar-powered water pumps, tents, wheelchairs and even spare parts for trucks under “dual-use” restrictions, according to the report.At the Israeli port of Ashdod, WFP officials told the senators that 2,200 shipping containers of food – enough to feed everyone in Gaza for three weeks – sit delayed by screening procedures requiring each pallet to be checked individually.Merkley described the strategy’s two components: “One is to destroy homes so that they cannot be returned to ... That second strategy is to deprive Palestinians of essentials to live, food, water, medicine.”Israel replaced the UN’s hundreds of distribution sites with just four aid points for 2 million people, three located only in southern Gaza. The senators heard accounts of malnourished mothers unable to walk miles to distribution sites while carrying children and then lift 40lb food boxes for the return journey. From 22 May to 31 July, 1,373 people were killed in the vicinity of these sites,according to the UN.That Israel and the United States are callingplansfor the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza a “voluntary exodus” is one of the “most fraudulent, sinister, and twisted cover stories ever told”, the report reads.“There is nothing voluntary about wanting to depart when your home is gone, when your agricultural fields are no longer accessible,” Van Hollen said at the press conference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A recent Senate vote on arms sales to Israel saw 27 Democratic senators – more than half the caucus – oppose weapons transfers.“The same values that made me a champion for Israel compel me to say what they are doing to the Palestinians, both in West Bank and in Gaza, is absolutely wrong,” said Merkley.Both lawmakers called for immediate action to secure a ceasefire, noting that Israeli hostage families had told them Netanyahu “has prioritized his political survival over the survival of our loved ones”.“The world has a moral and legal obligation to stop the ongoing ethnic cleansing,” their report concludes. “Strong words alone will not be sufficient.

Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the leftwing Labour MP, failed to make the cut-off.Phillipson, the education secretary, had already won enough nominations from MPs by Wednesday night but added to her tally of endorsements on Thursday, reaching 175.Phillipson said: “I am so proud to have received well over half the nominations made byLabourMPs, from all wings of our party and from all corners of the country.“Labour only wins when our party comes together: that is why I plan to give a voice at the cabinet table to all parts of our movement so that we have the best chance of delivering a second term.“My message now to Labour party members is simple: back me to unite our party and our movement so we can beat Reform at the next election and build the Britain our children deserve.”After clinching the nominations, Powell said: “This is not a contest I expected nor any of us wanted but we must use it to focus on how the new deputy leader can be a bridge for all parts of our movement and help the government deliver the progressive change the country needs.“I am Labour through and through. I will always fight for our party, our values and our traditions. At a time when there are forces trying to spread division and hatred, Labour must be the voice of unity and hope.“I look forward to speaking to as many members, activists and supporters as possible to make the case about the kind of full-time deputy leader I would be; laser focused on connecting with our communities through our MPs, elected representatives and members fighting for the change our country needs.”Labour MPs have depicted the race as a proxy war between the prime minister and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, often tipped as a successor to Starmer. Powell, the MP for Manchester Central who was recently removed as leader of the House of Commons, is close to Burnham and was endorsed by him for the deputy leadership.Powell’s team have dismissed the talk of proxies as wrong and sexist, but there are increasing fears about how the deputy leadership debate will play out. Many of those MPs who were removed in the recent reshuffle have backed Powell.Tensions have also been raised after Mainstream, thenew centre-left Labour organisationbacked by Burnham, issued a strongly worded statement criticising the Mandelson saga.Lord Mandelson was forced to quit over newly revealed affectionate emails with the late child sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. The group said the misjudgment over Mandelson’s appointment showed Starmer was running a “narrow and brittle political project”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need a government and party of all the talents and all the views.”The strength of the statement sent shockwaves around MPs. “This basically is a leadership challenge,” one said.Both Powell and Phillipson have pledged to be a leading campaigner for Labour around the country as part of their role as deputy leader. A source close to Phillipson said she had a broad base of support across all wings of the parliamentary Labour party, including the most new MPs and the most geographical diversity.One ally said: “All her backers know that Bridget is the only candidate to unite the party, push our positive message out to the country and deliver the change we were elected to bring.”The candidates must also gain nominations from constituency parties and affiliates before ballots are issued to members. A hustings for the candidates will take place at the Labour party conference, with ballots opening on Wednesday 8 October and closing on Thursday 23 October.

Last month, more than 50 Ukrainian writers and artists, a cross-party group of UK MPs and former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark urged the Royal Ballet and Opera (RBO) to drop Netrebko from its new London season, describing her as a “longtime symbol of cultural propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes”.In a letter, the group argued the RBO faced a “defining choice: between status and responsibility, between profit and values, between silence and conscience”, adding: “We urge you to remain, as you consistently have, on the ethical side of art – and of history.”The RBO has said as a “singer’s house” it has a duty to showcase the greatest performers, adding that Netrebko has condemned the invasion.A number of other major opera houses across Europe have featured the Russian soprano in the past two years. Her general manager, Miguel Esteban, said she had “never shown support for Russian separatists” and had condemned the war in three social media statements and two interviews. She had not returned to Russia since the full-scale invasion, he added.View image in fullscreenA protester holds a sign outside the Royal Opera House in London.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIn 2014 Netrebko made a donation to Donetsk’s opera house after Russia seized the city, and she wasphotographedholding the separatist flag of “Novorossiya” with a pro-Kremlin former Ukrainian politician.

I didn’t give her money. She comes from a very successful French family and she can afford it herself. It’s convenient, it works, and she loves it there.”Labour urges Nigel Farage to say whether he has financial interest in his Clacton homeRead moreHowever,a BBC investigationhas examined Ferrari’s family background, and was unable to find any evidence that they are wealthy.It said her father’s haulage business in Strasbourg was liquidated in 2020, and her parents are living in a flat in a suburb of the French city worth about £300,000, co-owned by the couple and their two daughters.The BBC team said the family also owned the former premises of the haulage company, which is rented out for an estimated €8,000-€9,000 (£7,000-£7,800) a month.Ferrari, 45, formerly owned a clothes shop, which went out of business. Companies Houserecords showshe is the director of Baxter Laois Limited, the business home of Farage’sbrand of gin. However, its most recent accounts showed it had assets of only about £1,000.According to the BBC, Farage’s solicitors, London-based Grosvenor Law, said the firm had received written advice from a leading tax KC. The solicitors said: “That advice concludes that there is no underpayment of SDLT (stamp duty land tax), that SDLT paid was properly calculated and that there is no basis to suggest there has been any improper avoidance or evasion of tax in respect of the purchase.”It was not explained why the advice was sought, or when.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are now far too many unanswered questions about the house he stays in while in Clacton. He must urgently come clean with the public as to whether he financially contributed towards the purchase of this property.“Misleading the public for political gain about buying a constituency home is appalling in itself. But if he deliberately put in place this arrangement to avoid paying his fair share of tax that would be even worse.”Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrats’ Cabinet Office spokesperson, said: “Nigel Farage has serious questions to answer over this. After spending days attacking others over their tax arrangements he now needs to be frank and honest about his own.”A representative for Farage and Grosvenor Law were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageStamp dutyEssexReform UKLabourLiberal DemocratsTaxnewsShareReuse this content"

RTÉ is also deeply concerned by the targeted killing of journalists in Gaza, and the denial of access to international journalists to the territory, and the plight of the remaining hostages.”The decision will raise questions about its duty to be impartial as a public service news organisation.Slovenia’s national broadcaster, RTVSLO, has also said it will participate in next year’s contest only if Israel is not involved.This week the Spanish culture minister said Spain should not take part either. In an interview with the Spanish TV programmeLa Hora de la 1 on Monday, Ernest Urtasun said: “We asked for Israel to be expelled from Eurovision [earlier this year],” he said.The Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna next May and is the world’s second biggest TV event, with more than 160 million viewers.However, protests in the last two years in Malmö and Basel have forced the organisers in Geneva to offer broadcasters who feel strongly about the war a way out.Normally broadcasters have to tell the EBU by October whether they will take part or not but this year the deadline has been pushed to December, with a consultant appointed to work with broadcasters on a way forward, and a potential vote on Israel’s participation.Broadcasters, including RTÉ and the Nordic TV stations, normally start their selection contest in the autumn, which puts management under pressure now.Martin Green, the director of the song contest said: “We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We are still consulting with all EBU members to gather views on how we manage participation and geopolitical tensions around the Eurovision song contest … It is up to each member to decide if they want to take part in the contest and we would respect any decision broadcasters make.”Israel’s national public service broadcaster, Kan, threatened with privatisation by Benjamin Netanyahu amidaccusations it is too leftist,has already decided it will take part.Urtasun added: “What I can say is that if Israel takes part, and if we don’t manage to get it thrown out, then we’ll have to take steps [such as withdrawing]. I don’t think we can normalise Israel’s participation in international forums as if nothing’s happened.”In May, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called on Israel to withdraw from the Eurovision song contest, saying it should be held to the same standards over the war in Gaza as Russia has been over the invasion of Ukraine.Sánchez, one of the most outspoken international critics of Israel’s war in Gaza,stepped up his rhetoric on Monday, accusing Netanyahu’s government of “exterminating a defenceless people” by bombing hospitals and “killing innocent boys and girls with hunger”.The Guardian has asked more than 20 broadcasters whether they would participate. Many, including the BBC, have referred the question back to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).The Spanish broadcaster RTVE said it would not comment on whether it would participate.Stefán Jón Hafstein, the chair of Iceland’s national broadcaster, RÚV, told reporters it would not be making a decision until the consultation process was over.The Finnish broadcaster YLE said it was “fully focused” on the process of finding a song and started the process in August.Johanna Törn-Mangs, the director of culture and factual content at YLE, said the contest was “an important event for both the Finnish music industry and audiences” but Gaza was in their minds.“The humanitarian situation in Gaza is tragic, and we sincerely hope for an end to the suffering as soon as possible. Israel’s participation in Eurovision has been a significant topic of discussion in Finland,” she said.Swedish broadcaster SVT said it was in touch with the EBU.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionIsraelIsrael-Gaza warEuropeIrelandSpainSlovenianewsShareReuse this content"

It was in this job that he became known as the “Prince of Darkness” for his ruthless media management techniques.Mandelson won the safe seat of Hartlepool in 1992, but Labour’s overall defeat persuaded him that it needed to tack further to the right. He became one of the “three musketeers”, alongside Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, who jointly conceived of the New Labour project to modernise their party.Even though he was an MP himself, Mandelson played a more important role behind the scenes as Brown and Blair’s informal speechwriter, spin doctor and occasional de facto couples therapist.In 1994, he brokered the meeting between Blair and Brown at which it was decided Blair should run for the leadership with his friend’s backing. His role in that was to prompt a decade-long feud with Brown, who felt Mandelson had betrayed him.At a speech in 1996,Brown joked: “Peter asked me for 10p to phone a friend the other day. I said: ‘Here, take 20p and ring them all.’”As Blair’s consigliere however, Mandelson continued to play a key role in the Labour machinery. He ran the successful 1997 election campaign and was then appointed trade and industry secretary.It was felt at the time that his connections with senior members of the business community, whom he had wooed as part of Labour’s pre-election “prawn cocktail offensive”, would stand him in good stead. It also proved to be the source of his first downfall.In December 1998, the Guardian revealed that Mandelson had taken a £373,000 loan from his wealthy colleague Geoffrey Robinson to pay for a house in Notting Hill, and failed to declare it. Heresigned 24 hours later, with his friends blaming Brown’s ally Charlie Whelan for having leaked the story.He was back in government less than a year later, as Northern Ireland secretary. But again, his connections to the rich and powerful were to trip him up. In January 2001, the Observer revealed that in 1990 he had used his position to influence a passport application for the millionaire Labour donors Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja.This time it took three days before he offered his resignation.The Guardian said– incorrectly as it turned out – that his political career had “collapsed for the second and final time”.In 2004 Mandelson quit the Commons to become EU trade commissioner, a role that gave him the chance to exercise his skills as a backroom powerbroker away from the glare of the British media.View image in fullscreenMandelson with Brown in 2009.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/PA MediaWhen a besieged Brown called him back from Brussels in 2008, to the shock of even the former prime minister’s closest advisers, it was partly because of those political wiles. “Only a few people in politics are strategists,” Brown told him at the time. “And you are one of them.”In the post-Brown years, Mandelson focused on his political consultancy Global Counsel, working with clients including the Qatari Free Zones Authority and the Chinese fast-fashion brand Shein.Peter Mandelson’s many political lives – in picturesRead moreIn the background however he continued to play a role in Labour politics, helping advise his protege Morgan McSweeney. McSweeney, who also cut his political teeth fighting the Labour left in Lambeth, helped lead the resistance to Jeremy Corbyn and was eventually to become Keir Starmer’s closest adviser.Starmer himself, say friends, always viewed Mandelson with suspicion, not least because of his occasional habit of being rude about the prime minister. “I think Keir Starmer needs to shed a few pounds,” hesaidlast year.It was McSweeney who advocated strongly for Mandelson to get the job of Washington ambassador, according to senior government sources, despite concerns that his relationship with Epstein could spell trouble for the government. And it is McSweeney who has spent much of the past 24 hours defending him internally.“For a long time before Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, Keir kept his distance from him,” said Tom Baldwin, Starmer’s biographer. “Peter was important for the project, but he was more in the background than anything else.“That probably explains the hesitation over giving him the job in Washington. And, knowing what he knows now, I guess the prime minister now wishes he had a hesitated a bit more.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What’s up with this? I was always taught that my vagina was self-cleaning and beautiful. Suddenly I am not so sure, and even find myself wondering if my labia are “normal” or in fact gross. Is this really happening?- Concerned VaginaCall it the “box boom”.In the past year, Kiehl’s has rolled out a 96-hour vulva “freshener” and Dove launched an “intimate” deodorant advertised to the tune of Khia’s 2001 hitMy Neck, My Back (Lick It). There are muff-specific moisturizers now, as well as crotch-brightening creams, sprays to make your various“nooks”smell like bergamot and supplements to make your vagina taste sweeter. (Thanks,Kourtney Kardashian.) Even the old guard is stepping it up: Vagisil just announced a “groundbreaking” partnership with WNBA champions the New York Liberty.The big stink: is ‘genital anxiety’ behind the rapid rise of whole-body deodorants?Read moreThe “feminine intimate care” market was valued at $7.8bn globally in 2024, andthat figureis expected to nearly double over the next decade.Then there are the procedures: you’ve noticed that vagi facials exist, but what about“Ozempic vulva”fat grafting,labial “lip filler”and“boxtox”to keep your snatch looking, well, snatched? Global rates of labiaplasty – the surgical snipping of the labia, sometimes called “designer vagina” surgery or the“Barbie Procedure”, although some ethicists prefer to refer to it as“female genital mutilation”– have also increasednearly 37%since2016.So yes, Concerned, this is really happening. The question is: why?I havea theory! Maybe we’re increasingly obsessed with our genitals because thegovernmentis increasingly obsessed with our genitals. See: abortionbans, birth controldebates, anti-translaws,Britain’s recent rulingdefining “woman” as “biologically female”, the rise of pro-natalist rhetoric, and Donald Trump’srenewed focuson rigid gender roles. These policies reduce people to bodies – to parts with prescribed uses. This causes a sort of general genital anxiety, which companies can leverage to sell us products.According to the logic of vaginal cosmetics, when the state is policing your body, policing it yourself can restore some sense of control. Or if your future is determined by your vagina, you might as well optimize it.Lest this theory sound a little conspiracy-minded, let me remind you that legislation has long had its hand in our pants.In 1873, the federal Comstock Law in the US banned doctors and advertisers from promoting “birth control information and devices”, according toa 2010 paperby Michelle Ferranti. Douching was considered a form of contraception back then, and advertisers sidestepped the law with a new euphemism: “feminine hygiene”. Companies that sold vaginal douches dropped explicit contraceptive claims from their ads and instead “focused on the purported hygienic and therapeutic aspects of douching”.By the time the FDA approved the pill in 1960, douching was widely known to be an ineffective birth control method, and advertisers had to invent new reasons to douche and new products to sell. They turned to “demand creation”, or the art of selling so-called solutions to problems consumers didn’t know they had. Deodorization quickly became the dominant pitch, alongside improved tone, elasticity, youthfulness, plumpness, purity and the feeling of freshness – anything to suggest “women’s bodies were aesthetically defective and in need of cosmetic improvement”, Ferranti writes.Sound familiar?We know today that douching isn’t an advisable “hygiene” practice – it can cause bacterial vaginosis and may be linked toinfertility and STDs. But the industry’s propaganda is more prominent than ever, and new intimate care products come with their own potential problems.The genital area is “very sensitive”, Dr Angela Wilson, a board-certified OB/GYN atMontefiore Einstein Advanced Care, tells me, and using these products “may cause irritation or infection”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionYou were taught right: the vaginaisself-cleaning. “There is a normal vaginal discharge, made up of water and normal bacteria, in most women,” Wilson says. “It naturally keeps the vagina clean by continuously removing the dead cells from the vaginal lining.” That takes care of that! She does not recommend using any products inside the vagina.In fact, like “feminine hygiene”, the term “vaginal wellness” is a marketing misnomer. Most products in this category are intended for thevulva– the labia, clitoris and mons pubis. And still they’re unnecessary. “Less is best” when it comes to keeping your vulva clean and healthy, Wilson says. “Wipe from front to back after using the restroom.” When you shower, “wash externally with soap and water.”Even soap has its limits, though. “Harsh soaps or wipes”, according to Wilson, can throw off the pH of the area, leading to chronic inflammation, burning and/or itching. Dr Jen Gunter, author of The Vagina Bible, hasrecommendedwashing with “a gentle facial cleanser” for this reason. Bonus: you won’t be supporting a brand that profits off genital shame!More from Jessica DeFino:Why is this column called ‘Ask Ugly’?My father had plastic surgery. Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneHow should I be styling my pubic hair?How do I deal with imperfection?I want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayWhatever you use, avoid perfumes, dyes and alcohol, Wilson adds. If you notice a strong and unusual odor, it could be a sign of infection, so don’t grab a fig-scented freshening spray – go to the doctor.Cosmetically speaking, I can guarantee your labia are not “gross”. If they cause you pain or discomfort, see an OB-GYN. Otherwise, scroll throughThe Labia Library– a non-profit women’s health resource – and delight in the diverse range of totally normal-looking labia on display: Long! Short! Pink! Brown! Hairy! Waxed! Pierced! Whatever!The next time a “vagi facial” ad pops up, remember that progress toward women’s liberation has always been met with escalating pressure on our bodies. The idea that your vagina should smell as fresh as a daisy or look like a doll’s is an attack on your autonomy, an insult to your humanity and a hazard to your health.Share your experienceAsk us a questionDo you have a beauty question for Ask Ugly?

Captain Crozier [from The Terror] didn’t die, and Lane Pryce [from Mad Men] wasn’t real. I would love to play [the 19th-century US president] Ulysses S Grant. His history has largely been written by southern US historians and so his achievements have largely been denigrated. But his campaigns are taught in all the military academies around the world. Despite a pretty disastrous presidency, he still managed to [sign a] Civil Rights Act – and hedestroyed the Ku Klux Klan.When the civil war broke out he sold firewood by the side of the road to try to put food on the table for his family. Eight years later, he was president. It’s the kind of quintessential American success story, but history doesn’t regard him that way.View image in fullscreenOn deck … as Claudius in the RSC’s 2025 production of Hamlet.Photograph: Marc BrennerWhich made you feel more seasick – the sinking-ship stage set from the2025RSCproduction of Hamlet, in which you played Claudius, orHMS Terror from The Terror?Dr_JA_ZoidbergDefinitely the RSC stage, because it moved throughout the production, so you’d suddenly find yourself losing your footing and wobbling. The set for The Terror was locked off, particularly when it was at that weird angle when the whole thing was tipping to the side.When you’re drinkingscotch in Mad Men, whichscotch is it pretending to be?CoveRoadWell, you drink sugar water, which is horrible. The cigarettes are herbal cigarettes, which are impossible to keep lit, which is why you see everyone puffing really hard. It makes everybody look like complete nicotine addicts.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Christina Hendricks, John Slattery, Jared Harris, Vincent Kartheiser, Jon Hamm, Robert Morse and Elisabeth Moss in Mad Men.Photograph: AMC/ LionsgateDid you inherit your fatherRichard Harris’s singing voice? And do you share his taste for rugby shirts?MissusDandTaffRaffiaI didnotinherit his singing voice. I’m passable at karaoke, but I would never charge anybody to hear me sing. I actually have a bunch of his rugby shirts that I kept to remind me of him.What was the process of learningBelterforThe Expanse?Did you model your accent on anyone in particular for your roleas Crozier in The Terror?GironansandTeam504Belter was great fun, because that was an invented accent. When I met the coach, he said: “We’ve got three levels. It’s like a curry: mild, medium and spicy.” I decided to go for the most extreme, spicy version, because my character was supposed to be the original Belter. Crozier was interesting because he was Anglo-Irish, and identified strongly with the crown. We don’t know what that accent would’ve sounded like, so we settled on something that sounded like someone who had an aspiration towards being accepted by English society, but was still Irish.View image in fullscreen‘An angry man’ … Jared Harris as John Lennon and Aidan Quinn as Paul McCartney in Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s Two of Us from 2000.Photograph: Aaronson/Falk/Vh1/Viacom/Kobal/ShutterstockDid you become more of a John Lennon fan after playing him inTwo of Us?GoobdroogI wouldn’t say I became more of a fan, because I was born in 1961 just before the Beatles released their first album. People were upset by our version of John Lennon because, by this time, he’d become the voice of the peace movement, but he was also an angry man who could be violent and had a massive chip on his shoulder. So I got a lot of flak from Beatles fans who didn’t like the version we were presenting.Favourite pub?Galdove19I used to go and have a drink with my dad at the Coach and Horses at the back of Covent Garden. They have really good Guinness. It’s also the place where my father had his last fight. It was summer. He was sitting outside having a pint. My father would have two sorts of interactions with Irish people. One would be very positive. The other, they’d say: “What the fuck have you ever done for Ireland?” He was having the second interaction with this Irish woman and lost his patience.View image in fullscreenRichard Harris at home with his sons Damian and Jared, February 1966.Photograph: Stephan C Archetti/Keystone Features/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesHe said: “I can forgive many things. I can forgive ignorance, because that’s not your fault. That’s the fault of your education. I can forgive bad manners. Again, not your fault if your parents just didn’t bring you up properly. But the one thing I cannot forgive is ugliness, and you’re the ugliest woman I’ve ever seen in my life. Now fuck off.”So she goes inside, gets her boyfriend, who comes out and says [does Irish accent]: “You called my girlfriend ugly. Stand up if you’re a man.” So dad sucker-punched him and knocked him out. He was on the floor, cracked his head, and the girl started jumping up and down, going [does Irish accent]: “Dickie Harris has killed me boyfriend! Dickie Harris has killed me boyfriend!” Dad wasn’t sure what had happened, so he grabbed his Guinness and chucked it in the guy’s face, which brought him round immediately. But he was a big boy and Dad knew that he wasn’t going to win round two, so he leapt into a taxi and took off.If you hadn’t done the acting, what would have been your ideal gig?CaptainLibI think about that all the time. It’s a bit late now. I’m the middle child, so I was always arguing with my brothers, so my parents thought I might make a good lawyer. I was very shy, and still am in some ways. When I went to Duke [University in North Carolina, to study drama] and started acting, my mother came down and saw me, and said to my dad: “You should go see him. He is very good.” And he said: “Well, youwouldsay that, you’re his mother.”Watch a trailer for Brave the Dark, starring Jared HarrisHe wouldn’t come down to see me in anything until after I graduated and I stayed behind in the summer to do Entertaining Mr Sloane. I’d made a movie as well while I was at Duke. He watched the film in the afternoon and saw the play in the evening. He was fully prepared to tell me: “Forget this acting lark. It’s not for you.”Jared Harris: ‘What do I dislike about my appearance? Everything. I have a weird eyebrow, red hair, freckles … ’Read moreI’ll never forget the look on his face when I met him afterwards: the joy that there was this thing that he loved that he had a whole new shared area of dialogue, interest and conversation. Those are some of my best memories: sitting around a table with him.

But, in a corner of north-eastLondon, the specific teachings of one ultra-Orthodox community have led to more generous council housing for everyone.Approaching the handsome brick blocks of Tower Court in Hackney, the first clue that something might be out of the ordinary can be spotted in the balconies. Rather than sticking out in a regular grid, they dance across the facade at staggered intervals, each surrounded by a skeletal metal frame. Some have been walled in with fencing panels, while others are shielded with reed matting or shrouded with fake plastic leaves. It looks like a vertical display of makeshift garden sheds.View image in fullscreen‘These tall ceilings really open up your brain’ …Tower Court.Photograph: (c) Alex Solomon“The balcony design makes it much easier to build our sukkah,” says Leah, as she looks out over the rooftops of Stamford Hill. She is referring to the temporary outdoor shelters that the Haredi Jewish community must build forthe festival of Sukkot, as places to eat and sleep during the holy week. They have become a classic feature of this neighbourhood (home to the largest Haredi community in Europe, numbering 30,000), popping up in gardens, tacked on to terraces, and often left up all year round.“We lived in a tiny flat without any outdoor space before,” she says, “so we had to go to my parents or my sister’s place for Sukkot.” Her family of 10 had been on the council house waiting list for over 12 years, while their friends and neighbours were being pushed out of London, or crammed into ever more overcrowded flats. “It was so suffocating,” she adds. “But we have so much space now, and these tall ceilings really open up your brain. It’s a dream come true.”Her spacious five-bedroom flat is part of the country’s first council housing project built specifically with the needs of the Haredi community in mind. Her home features two sinks in the kitchen, with sufficient storage for separate meat and dairy utensils (the mixture of meat and dairy is forbidden according to Jewish law) as well as a large dining room with double doors that can open on to one of the bedrooms for extended family gatherings. “The hallway is even big enough for the kids to play football!” she says. “They love the playgrounds too – they feel like they’ve moved to a holiday resort!”View image in fullscreen‘The kids feel like they’ve moved to a holiday resort’ … Tower Court.Photograph: Hackney CouncilThe project, which has just been shortlisted for theRIBA’s Neave Brown awardfor the best new affordable housing in the country, includes features such as Shabbat lifts (which don’t require manual operation on the Jewish sabbath); plumbing for an extra sink outside the bathrooms (Haredi must wash before and after using the bathroom); a big wall to accommodate cabinets of religious books, and bedrooms with enough space for several bunk beds.“All of these features have benefits for everyone,”says Tom Stebbing, an architect who advised on the project, with long-term experience working with the local community. “A well laid-out bedroom is a well laid-out bedroom, no matter who you are.” Most of the balconies are staggered, he notes, because sukkahs must be open to the sky. “But a view of the sky is nice for everyone, whatever your faith.”Ten years in the making, the project was designed byAdam Khan Architectsandpublic realm experts Muf Architecture/Art, informed by extensive consultation and co-design workshops led by Daisy Froud. “These very young women with large families were incredible spatial thinkers,” says Froud. “They were really adept at thinking three-dimensionally, how to build storage into their homes, and how to fit six children in a room with everyone feeling happy.”Facing on to leafy Clapton Common, the project has been designed as a row of four mansion block villas, mostly six storeys, with one tower element rising to 12. They have the substantial air of a London County Council estate from the 1930s, with the warm brown brick offset by the sharp white concrete bands of the balconies. “We’ve tried to do subtle things with proportion, which don’t cost any more,” says Adam Khan. “We chose one good brick, then played around with changing the window alignments and stepping the bricks in places, to give it the feeling of old worn cloth.”View image in fullscreenLeafy … Tower Court seen from Clapton Common, Hackney.Photograph: (c)Ioana MarinescuThe blocks are carefully chamfered to maximise daylight and views over the common, while their tapered forms frame generous public courtyards in between them. A mysterious chimney-shaped folly stands engulfed with ivy – the curious relic of a former manor house on the site – next to little brick temples for bins and bikes, while a series of playful bridges cross sunken planted channels, helping to deal with the level changes.“So much play is about crossing,” says Liza Fior of Muf. “So we’ve come up with 13 different ways to play your way across these imaginary canals.” In a nod to the local context, the structures take inspiration from bridges that cross the nearby River Lea. One steel arch features monkey bars; another supports planks suspended on chains; a third, sampled from Venice, includes a precipitous slide.The spaces throng with kids after school, some sitting on a big wooden boat, Haredi children mixing with Afro-Caribbean, south Asian and Turkish kids, as they hop between the obstacles. Fior points out what she calls the “generous perimeter”, where play equipment has intentionally been placed beyond the estate’s boundary, as an invitation to the local community. It seems to work. The absence of high security fencing and guards (a common feature of Stamford Hill’s religious schools and synagogues) make it feel like a truly public space – which, being council-owned, it is.View image in fullscreen‘It’s about designing in care from the beginning’ … Tower Court.Photograph: Alan WilliamsBut it’s not all council housing. Like most recentlocal authority housing projects, Tower Court is a mix of affordable rent and private sale, to help cross-subsidise the development. Built as a joint-venture with developer Countryside, only 39% of the 132 homes are affordable (36 social rented, 16 shared ownership), while the rest were sold. “The developer took all the sales risk,” says Rachel Bagenal, Hackney’s assistant director of housing regeneration. “But we own the land, and the hybrid contract allowed us to retain control over the detail of the design.”The site had been home to a group of 67 ageing council flats, demolished in 2014, some of which had been sold through the right to buy, with 48 remaining at social or affordable rent. In numbers alone, the development therefore represents a loss of social rented units. But their size has increased substantially, with most being four or five-bedroom flats.It might reflect the Faustian pact of council development a decade ago (Hackney has since embarked on building 400 new homes, 300 of which will be for social rent), but the built quality of Tower Court is leagues ahead of what it replaced. The council retained Khan as its “design guardian”, while Muf was kept on by Countryside, with delivery architects Child Graddon Lewis, allowing for a greater degree of quality control than is often the case with design-and-build contracts. From the bespoke bridges, to terrazzo floors and mosaic doormats (made by theHackney Mosaic Project, working with people with depression), the level of craft is impressive.“That’s the beauty of ‘plonkables’,” says Fior. “By having these elements come in at the end of the construction process, we can add something bespoke, with a higher degree of control.” They are the kind of details that often get watered down, or removed all together in the process of “value engineering”, which make all the difference to the end result. “It’s about designing in care from the beginning,” Fior adds, “in such a way that it can’t be dismissed as interfering with the smoothness of the construction process.”View image in fullscreenA truly public space … Tower Court.Photograph: Sean PollockBack outside, there’s another intriguing detail. A sign on a lamppost indicates the start of the “eruv” – an area exempt from ancient Jewish law, which forbids the carrying or pushing of items outside the house on the sabbath.The Stamford Hill eruvwas recently extended, allowing mothers to push their buggies to visit friends and family in South Tottenham on Saturdays for the first time.“There’s a misconception that an eruv has to be defined by a string between poles,” says Stebbing. “But when the local rabbi came to visit, he said it was incredible – we had made an eruv around Tower Court by accident, just with the hedging and fences.”There are gaps for the entrances, but these were deemed allowable: by chance, their width conforms with an ancient rabbinical law about how many goats can be driven through an opening in a certain amount of time. Thankfully they’re also wide enough to accommodate the stampede of eager children making a beeline for the see-saws, climbing logs and group hammock, when the school bus disgorges its charges at the end of the day.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureJudaismLondonReligionHousingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pornography use is more common than ever, so earnings for many here are through the roof. But there is trouble afoot, from AI to chronic illness …Amelia GentlemanThu 11 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 13.43 EDTShareBrittany Andrews, a cheerful American porn star, cuts to the chase in her workshop on how to succeed in the adult industry.“Do you think about how much money you’re going to make before you make a clip? Do you know what stuff sells the best? Or do you just follow your creative spark?” she asks. She points to a young Ukrainian model in a gold sequined bra and denim shorts. “I’m starting with you, girlfriend!”“We’re all here to earn money. That’s normal,” the model replies. Her main advice, she adds, is to be super organised about uploading content regularly, to prevent subscribers drifting away. “What matters is consistency. There are so many beautiful, amazing models … if you for a moment stop posting, people will forget you pretty fast.”In a modern riverside hotel in central Amsterdam, about 1,000 adult content creators gathered last Tuesday for the biggest pornography conference in Europe. They had travelled from all corners of the continent for an event designed to help them navigate the industry’s high-pressure gig economy and maximise profits.View image in fullscreenBrittany Andrews.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianA group of elderly Americans, waiting in the lobby for a windmills and Edam tour, watched them arrive with flustered bemusement. Most creators – the euphemistic term for people who record and upload explicit content to sites such as OnlyFans – were dressed down, makeup-free in jeans and trainers. But some came in nine-inch diamante heels, or on pink roller skates with flashing wheels, or with their hair tied in bunches, wearing the Hello Kitty backpacks more usually favoured by preteens.The annual Xbiz conference lasts three days. It brings creators (primarily but not exclusively women) together with executives (primarily but not exclusively men), as well as model management agencies, online payment and traffic optimisation companies, and content-sharing platforms. There are panel sessions and workshops where creators are given advice on trends in the industry, algorithms and changes in government regulations.It kicks off with an invitation to down shots at a bar in the city’s red-light district to “discover the joys of day drinking”. The first full day begins with a speed-dating session at which creators can meet and organise “collabs” – recording explicit content together, so they reach each other’s followers and attract new paying fans of their own. Between panel sessions, some pairs retreat to rooms upstairs to film themselves having sex.Guest speakers analyse why tentacles and aliens are so in vogue in porn, promise to explain how “independent creators can make millions” and give tips on how to use “charm, empathy and emotional intelligence” to “attract loyal fans and build lasting audience connections”.The atmosphere is exuberant. The sector is, after all, booming. But there is an undercurrent of anxiety about four looming challenges: the arrival of artificial intelligence; how to make money in a saturated market; the spread of age verification rules; and the very real risk of burnout for creators.In the queue for the coffee machine on Wednesday morning, James, a computer programmer from Singapore, talks excitedly about his new AI company. He promises this will make models’ lives easier, by reducing the exhaustion and pressure inherent in producing a constant stream of pornography. (He is not keen to share his surname.)“It’s really about helping stars avoid burnout,” he says, explaining his plans to license images of well-established performers. Their AI avatars will then be able to perform sex on demand, all day, all night, for an unlimited number of viewers.“Do you mind if I show you something? It’s quite explicit.” Without waiting for my reply, he plays a video on his phone of a couple having sex. The man has his hand around the woman’s neck, throttling her. It looks like it would be hard for her to breathe, if she were actually human.View image in fullscreenDelegates attended three days of panel sessions and workshops.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian“You wouldn’t know it was AI!” he says, swiping left for more choking content. “It looks so real.” (The British government this year committed to banning pornographic content that depicts strangulation; it is not yet clear if the ban will stretch to AI-generated content.)He speaks with the self-congratulation of a 1950s salesman presenting housewives with new labour-saving washing machines. “Fans want customised content. If you want to see her in ripped lingerie having doggy sex in a cave, the creators don’t have time to film that, so we leverage AI to help them. We want to help creators unlock productivity and let them earn as much as they can,” he says, apparently unaware of how weird it is for men who are hoping to get rich from pornography to pretend they are nobly doing women a favour.A little later, British creator Lily Phillips arrives in the lobby. She became famous last year after filming herself having sex with 100 men in a day. “I’m just here for a good time!” she says, determinedly upbeat, dressed down in a cream tracksuit.Since her viral stunt, another British creator, Bonnie Blue, claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men in a day. Phillips, 24, therefore has to come up with a new way to grab people’s attention. The answer? Widowers. Recently she revealed plans to film herself sleeping with large numbers of them. These extreme attempts to recruit paying subscribers can be risky. An Australian OnlyFans creator was hospitalised earlier this year after filming a challenge where she had sex with 583 men in one day. She later put the hospitalisation down to stress, adding: “I think my body just finally had enough.”Phillips tells me she is contemplating creating an AI bot of herself, to create and sell photos to fans, to reduce her workload.“They [the fans] would know it was AI, but some men might want to see me in positions that I can’t get into myself. I’m not that flexible, but an AI bot could do the splits, and that might differentiate from the content that I have on my own page,” she says. “Who doesn’t want to make money from doing not a lot?”Some adult film producers are relaxed about the risk of AI making their work obsolete. “We were all freaking the fuck out about this two years ago,” one says, adding that he is no longer so worried that AI will replace real humans on screen. “We sell serotonin, cortisol, dopamine. We are all about emotions. I think there’s no threat to creators.”View image in fullscreenDigital twins … Nic Young and Felix Henderson’s company uses AI to give creators ‘career longevity’.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianTwo well-spoken British entrepreneurs, Felix Henderson and Nic Young, want to talk about their new digital twins company. This involves licensing celebrities’ voices and a portfolio of old photographs from their career heydays, and programming the resulting avatars to undress.The site will enable women to prolong their careers, Young says, mitigating the alarming threat of ageing. “Ultimately, a lot of the fans are relatively fickle. There are some creators who like the idea of having their image frozen in time. They want to continue earning money in this space, so they like the idea that they can effectively earn off how they appear today, and give themselves the career longevity they don’t necessarily have.”He too tries to argue that his AI business will have the happy side-effect of liberating women from the still stigmatised business of taking their clothes off for money. “I would say it’s the most positive, ethical step forward that you could possibly make.”I last attended an Xbiz conference 11 years ago. In the gloomy basement of a faded 1970s hotel in London’s Edgware Road, I heard depressed executives discuss how the rise of free streaming websites was resulting in a rash of bankruptcies for businesses that had previously been flourishing.Since then, the industry has changed beyond all recognition, with the proliferation of smartphones and the 2016 launch of OnlyFans by the Essex-based Stokely family. These changes mean anyone can now record themselves, upload the video or pictures, and charge subscribers a monthly fee to see what they’ve produced, have online chats and request individualised content. Creators take 80% of their earnings, while 20% goes to OnlyFans.The company does not describe itself as a pornography site. The CEO, Keily Blair, never uses the term, because she thinks it is pejorative, referring to it as “the P word” in a recent interview. She prefers to talk about “adult content” and has stressed that the platform also hosts yoga, sports and comedy videos, arguing that not all subscribers are interested in explicit content. Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of uploaded material is pornographic.The OnlyFans revolution means more people are filming adult content for money than ever before. A referral scheme means current creators can sign up other people to take part, receiving a 5% commission from their first year of earnings. The number of users and creators soared during Covid. In 2021, there were roughly 2m content creators. There are now 4.63m.The women at Xbiz argue the business model is safe and empowering, an improvement on the days when they were directed by studio producers, had little control over their boundaries and were routinely exploited financially.There is no doubt that unprecedented numbers of people are consuming pornography and the industry is turning a huge profit. In the UK, a third of men say they watch pornography at least once a week and the average age people first see pornography – often not on purpose – is 13. Globally, more than 377.5 million people have an OnlyFans user account.Leonid Radvinsky, the Ukrainian-American who bought OnlyFans from the Stokely family in 2018, received $701m in dividends last year. Creators received $5.8bn for their work. The largest market is in the US, but the company is based in the UK, where it paid £127m in tax last year.I ask Lily Phillips how she feels about Radvinsky earning $701m by taking a cut of the monumentally hard work she and other creators are doing (his net worth was estimated by Forbes magazine at $7.8bn). “I actually don’t know who he is,” she says, shrugging when I explain. “There’s always going to be someone higher up than you, who’s doing better than you, who’s got more power.”The distribution of creator earnings is very uneven, according to industry analysts: the top accounts can earn over $100,000 a month, but the median account makes $180. The top 10% of creators make 73% of the money, while the top 1% make 33% of the money. (An OnlyFans spokesperson says this analysis is speculative, because the company does not release breakdowns of creator earnings.)Most of the creators at the conference are likely to be members of that successful minority, willingly championing the industry. Although content creators were given free tickets to the conference, they had to cover hotel costs and their travel to the Netherlands.Gemma Kelly, the head of policy at Cease, the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation, says OnlyFans follows the same logic of any form of commercial sexual exploitation. “There will always be a small percentage of women, predominantly, who feel like this is working for them as a chosen career path. It’s the 90% of women that we don’t see that are the ones who are the most exploited, the most vulnerable. These women aren’t travelling to Amsterdam to party for three days.”View image in fullscreenAround 1,000 content creators attended the three-day event in Amsterdam.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianEven the women who are successful on the site acknowledge it is immensely hard work to hang on to their subscribers when the internet is saturated with explicit content.A male creator, who asks not to be named, says some people seem to think what they do is easy. “Some of my friends say: ‘I’m so strapped for money, I’ll just open an OnlyFans account.’ They think the only barrier to making money is just showing yourself naked. They think you just have to snap a picture of yourself, upload it and make $1m. A lot of people go into this without knowing how much time it takes.”Kali Kingsley is a smiley 23-year-old creator from Hertfordshire. Two years ago, she gave up a job in motor sports to produce OnlyFans content full-time. She tries to take weekends off, but from Monday to Friday she works from the moment she wakes up – when she takes a photograph of herself in her underwear – to the moment she goes to bed at night. Her days are spent sending messages to her fans, who pay $30 a month to see her explicit videos and chat to her online; she aims to have sex with another creator (a collaboration) about once a week. She describes her content as “Valentine’s Day style” and says that for people who have grown up sexting friends, posting bikini shots of themselves on Instagram and becoming influencers, OnlyFans can feel like a “natural progression”.“Every girl takes photos of themselves in pretty lingerie,” she says, “and then you find out you can actually make money from it … You’re making money you probably couldn’t in other fields. For our generation, it’s something that’s just done. It’s the older generation that see it as taboo or sensitive. There’s a huge misconception about the industry. Everyone is very lovely, the women are empowered by it.”It is difficult to know what to make of this relentless positivity. Making money is obviously important and can be liberating, but it’s hard not to feel sceptical about how empowering the work really is, and doubtful of the wisdom of embarking on it as a career.View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Paulita Pappel.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianSpanish film-maker Paulita Pappel (who wins best director at the adult awards at the end of the conference) is frustrated by this scepticism. “Porn is not always exploitative of women,” she says. “The fact that a lot of women believe that women in porn are being exploited and are victims makes their life way harder. It suggests that women have no sexual agency, and that men are predators, that women wouldn’t perform pornography or sell sexual services if they didn’t have to. If you’re shaming these women, you’re not helping.”Industry executives work hard at the conference to sell the idea of this as a dream lifestyle. Outside the hotel, a blond model draws up in a pink convertible, branded with the logo for AS Talent, a Ukrainian-owned, Warsaw-based OnlyFans model management agency. Inside, the firm’s agents circle the room trying to sign up new talent. “We make your life richer!” promises the company’s website.Ukrainian creators have recently been petitioning Volodymyr Zelenskyy to decriminalise pornography, pointing out that he is forfeiting tax revenues from the thousands of Ukrainian women filming explicit content without paying tax. In a country where war has devastated the economy, OnlyFans offers an alternative revenue stream for some. “They can earn many times more than they could in a basic job,” says one of the AS Talent agents, asking me not to print his name. (Given how profoundly uninhibited the industry requires women to be, there is a curious shyness among many of the men about revealing their names.)It feels difficult to reconcile her bland, spreadsheet-heavy presentation with the content on the Pornhub homepageThe hotel has an Indonesian rainforest theme, so delegates make their way to the keynote sessions through tropical palm trees, stepping across a mock rope bridge. But once inside the conference rooms, the occasion has all the glamour of a regional sales and marketing convention.“I’m trying to get random dudes to buy porn! That’s my goal!” Leah Koons, the director of marketing at Fansly, an OnlyFans competitor, tells a packed room. During her “Keys to Creator Success” panel, she urges the creators to be their “authentic selves” to maximise profitability. In jeans, a bomber jacket and glasses, no makeup, she offers big sister warmth, encouraging the audience to “Hit me up with your questions!” and exclaiming “Awesome!” and “Proud of you!” when they tell her about their work and how frequently they are uploading content.But she also suggests they slow down a bit and warns creators not to exhaust themselves by trying to film too much. “The burnout comes from the feeling of: ‘Holy shit. This will never end; this will never stop!’” she says, adding that analysis of traffic and data is the best way to work out what and when to post. “It’s better to post bangers that have a hook, and make people watch all the way to the end.” Creators shouldn’t think: “‘Oh my God, if I don’t post every single day that I’m going to get fucked by the algorithm.’ It doesn’t work like that.”Fansly can only make money if its creators are steadily, reliably producing monetisable content. It stands to reason Koons wants them to avoid getting exhausted and sick. Her advice is useful for the creators, but also extremely useful for the platform.“The age verification firms, they’re the bottom feeders, feeding off our industry!” says the male owner of a payments company during a discussion of international attempts to prevent children from seeing adult content. “They want these laws to be in place so they can grow their businesses. They’re not our friends.”In the room next door, Pornhub’s vice-president of community and brand, Alex Kekesi, says it has shut down access to its site in France and 21 US states, because of compliance difficulties. The company is thinking about rolling out a “safe for work” version, to ease regulatory problems, but Kekesi tells creators not to worry. “We’re very lucky because we have more than 130 million users a day. There are still a lot of people coming to this site. People still want to get their porn, so it’s a really great site.” She lists a number of “really cool discovery features” aimed at bringing new audiences to the site.She also encourages the audience to check out a “really wonderful video series” produced by the company, “destigmatising mental health in the adult industry. That’s something that a lot of us in the industry struggle with, unfortunately, but I don’t think that’s a reason not to talk about it.”It feels difficult to reconcile her bland, spreadsheet-heavy presentation with the content on the Pornhub homepage. You could come away from most of the Xbiz panels thinking the material under discussion is mostly naked cuddles mixed with some curious erotic cosplay.But the images and headlines on Pornhub’s homepage present a very different picture. “Extreme throat fuck, no mercy for her throat, huge bulge,” one promises. Incest fantasies are rife, and permitted on the platform by the addition of the word “step”. “Stepdaddy fucked my virgin asshole on my boyfriend’s birthday. Petite 18yo Asian bondage.” Some seem loosely suggestive of child abuse: “I teach my little stepsister how to play on the cell phone and end up fucking her hard.” Video teaser clips show women with skin that seems painfully reddened by slapping. The material is misogynistic (“She loves being used like meat”) and often looks violent and painful, but delegates seemed curiously disinclined to discuss this. They would rather talk about wellness.It is harder to assess the content on sites such as OnlyFans because of the paywall, but anti-pornography researchers cite frequent use of words such as whore and bitch, and some titles suggest the women on offer are young, shy and inexperienced.But then teen content, also known as “barely legal” material, is everywhere. Several creators at the conference look startlingly young, their hair tied in bows; one model agency specialises in recruiting young-looking women. A male producer in his 50s describes his interest in teen content, self-forgivingly, as his “kink”, and stresses that it is not illegal. The recent Channel 4 documentary on Bonnie Blue showed young creators in school uniforms preparing to perform an orgy in a classroom. This kind of content would not have been cleared for broadcast in cinemas in the UK, but is widely permitted online.At the end of the panel, I ask Kekesi if she thinks this content is empowering for women. “What’s empowering for some people is not the same for everyone, right?” she replies, adding that moderators check that consent forms are filled out before the recording of violent content.“Something that might feel very violent for me or for you is someone else’s good time,” she says. “I know that’s something that can be difficult to contend with.”She does not mention that the company agreed just days earlier to settle charges by the US Federal Trade Commission and the state of Utah that Pornhub deceived users by doing little to block videos and photos featuring child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual content material. The company was required to establish a program to prevent the distribution of child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual material on its websites and pay a $5m penalty to the state of Utah.She says the platform has no issue with the popularity of step-incest. “That’s not incest, that’s fantasy, so it’s permitted.”View image in fullscreenAery Tiefling is circumspect about advising her friends to join the industry.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianDownstairs, staff from Pineapple Support – an industry-funded, not-for-profit organisation that provides mental health services to professionals in the adult industry – is handing out advice on dealing with stress, promising to help attendees “identify and dispel whatever’s weighing you down”. The organisation recently launched a free online support group to help performers navigate thoughts of suicide.At another round table, Evie Rees, a British creator, hosts a session on “achieving longevity in the industry”. (Again, the executives sponsoring the event want women to keep going for as long as possible, bringing in the 20% for the platforms.) Rees has candyfloss pink hair, pink clothes and pink nails, a look unsettlingly reminiscent of Stephanie from Lazytown, a 00s television programme that was aimed at under-fives. She speaks honestly of the need to take mental health seriously and acknowledges the work can be overwhelming. “You can be in a bad mood, and be like: ‘I know this is my job, but right now getting naked on camera makes me want to fucking cry.’”Aery Tiefling, a former IT student in her 20s from a small town in Spain, asks how fellow creators deal with getting sick. For several months, she has had repeated bouts of pneumonia, which make it challenging to record new videos. The pressure to keep working has made it hard to shake off the infection. She also wonders what they should do if they want to get pregnant. If fans are left without new material, they might stop paying their monthly subscription fees. Rees recommends trying to store up months’ worth of extra content in advance, in case of future illness.Tiefling says later that frustration with her low-paid IT job was a big driver in her decision to start selling explicit videos on OnlyFans and other platforms of her laying silicone eggs (a niche pregnancy and breeding fetish).Parents, don’t panic over porn! Here’s how to have an age-appropriate and shame-free talk with your kids | Jess MelendezRead more“This is a very bleak period for young people,” she says. “People talk a lot about dignity, but there’s not much dignity for the younger generations, because you’re earning very little money, and you pay your rent and you pay for your food, and you run out of money. There’s no dignity in that, because you can’t choose to have a bigger house, to have a family, two or three kids.” Her adult career has increased her monthly earnings tenfold.Her decision to enter the industry possibly went deeper than simply wanting to earn more, though, she says. “I feel like a lot of content creators in this area come from troubled families. Comments online sometimes are like: ‘Your parents would not be proud of you.’ I feel like a lot of content creators come from families where they are not proud of their own parents.” Her parents were not very responsible with money growing up, she says. “This is also why I thought about this kind of job, because I know that I can support myself, and I know that if my family gets in trouble, I can always help them.”Many of her school friends, some of whom work in low-paid healthcare jobs, are struggling financially. “They often ask me for tips, because they want to get into the industry as well.” She is circumspect about advising others to get involved. The constant pressure she feels to record content, while still suffering from pneumonia, has made her unwell. “If you’re working in corporate, if you’re sick, you go to the doctor, you ask for medical leave, and you can go home and recover …” This work, she says, can be “hard on your mind”.Lily Phillips is also cautious about encouraging other people into the industry. When I ask if she would recommend the work to younger women, I feel uncomfortable, because the question could appear steeped in disapproval. In a recent documentary, Phillips was shown in tears, as her parents explained on camera that they loved her but felt her work was degrading. If she is irritated by my question, the only sign is a short pause and intake of breath; her persona is unflinchingly agreeable.“I have 110% always said: think about it a while,” she says. “It’s a big commitment. It affects every aspect of your life for the rest of your lifetime – relationships, friends, family – the social constructs you get from being a sex worker. A lot of people have a lot to say about what we do.”Explore more on these topicsPornographySexInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But history is full of cases – such as the banning of whaling and CFCs – that show humanity can come together to avert disasterByKate MarvelThu 11 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 11.57 EDTShareOnce upon a time, the world was powered by whale. Oil made from whale blubber burns cleanly and well, though it smells strongly of fish. It was, for a while, the perfect fuel. To meet the growing demand, whales were hunted almost to extinction.And then we discovered that oil could come from the ground. Lamps once lit by rendered blubber were swiftly changed over to run on what Americans call kerosene and the British call paraffin. Later, those lamps were changed to run on electricity, and instead of burning oil in the lamps themselves, we began to burn it in power plants miles away.This is where we find ourselves today. When a fossil fuel is combusted, it releases energy, which boils water, which turns to steam, which drives a turbine, which generates electricity. This is an almost comically inefficient process, requiring immense amounts of material: more than 8bn tons of coal and 4tn cubic metres of fossil gas every year. And given the basic chemistry of combustion, it’s unavoidable that burning all this stuff leads to an immense buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Worse, fossil gas itself is made of methane – shorter lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, but more than 80 times more potent while it lasts. Around a quarter of annual greenhouse gas emissions come from using fossil fuels to generate electricity.To have a hope of limiting warming, this has to change. The transition to clean energy will be difficult, but not impossible. Some of it is already happening. Renewable energy technologies have become good, reliable and inexpensive. Solar and wind, as well as the batteries needed to compensate for their intermittency, are getting cheaper at an astonishing rate. The price of onshore wind power plummeted 70% in the last decade, while solar costs fell by almost 90%. As a result, renewables are already being deployed at rates forecasters never imagined. If you had told me, even five years ago, how quickly the energy transition would be proceeding, I would not have believed you. It’s more than I ever dared to hope for. Finally, things are beginning to move. But they need to move faster. We know they can. They have before.After having fuelled the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, melted whale was quickly displaced by paraffin, an easier, cheaper source of energy. But petroleum alone did not save the whales. Without laws in place to hold it back, the whaling industry would have happily continued the slaughter. Whale oil was still moderately useful for several things, and whale lives were valueless. Dead whales were used to soften leather and lubricate machines and to somewhat mitigate the effects of trench foot in the first world war. It’s easy to think of whale hunting as a vestige of the Victorian era. But even as technology developed and the world moved on to paraffin, the killing continued – and in fact increased. In 1964, as the Beatles embarked on their world tour and three Soviet cosmonauts launched into Earth orbit, more than 80,000 whales were killed. As late as 1975, General Motors was blaming the Endangered Species Act for transmission problems in the cars it sold. The automatic transmission fluid had been made of sperm whale oil, and the company saw no easy alternative.There are many reasons whales still exist, but one reason is this: people chose to stop hunting them. In 1946, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established to regulate whale stocks and “make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry”. It attempted to impose quotas and move the industry toward something more sustainable. This proved difficult, so the IWC simply gave up and imposed a moratorium on whaling altogether. Some countries flounced out in a huff; others had never joined in the first place. But in the wake of the initial moratorium in 1982, the demand for whale products plummeted worldwide. Every child knows the haunting sound of whale song, if only from hearing it on TV. In 2018, the IWC declared that its purpose was no longer protection of the whaling industry but of whales themselves. The transition was complete.View image in fullscreenStudents taking part in a global protest against climate change in Gurugram, India in 2019.Photograph: Adnan Abidi/ReutersThis is a story with a happy ending, or at least a less tragic one than might have been expected. It’s also a story with a moral. We now need to make coal-­ and gas-­fired power plants go the way of whale oil. And if you want to change the world, it helps first to have an alternative. People invented railways to replace horse-­drawn carriages, electricity to supplant steam engines, rock oil for whale oil, and the market –­ Adam Smith’s great invisible hand –­ ensured they took hold. The invisible hand has now provided alternatives to fossil fuels: wind and solar are now the cheapest ways of generating electricity that have ever existed. The technologies are also simply better in many ways: unlike coal and gas plants, they do not foul the surrounding air, and their fuels are abundant and free in nature.But another moral of the whaling story is this: markets may be powerful, but they are not enough. Markets found an alternative to whale oil in paraffin and gas; whaling increased nonetheless. It took a ban to save the whales. It’s not sufficient to have a hand, invisible or not. You have to decide what you’re going to do with it.On 27 October 1948, what became known as the Donora Death Fog appeared over a town in Pennsylvania. Donora, less than an hour’s drive from Pittsburgh, was home to 14,000 people, most of whom worked in the steel or zinc mills along the western bank of the Monongahela River. There had been temperature inversions and smog events before, but this one lasted for days. The trapped air, heavy with toxins from the mills, turned rusty and thick. There was no escape. Anyone who walked outside would quickly begin to choke and vomit, and the roads were invisible in the thick smog. Six thousand people fell ill, 600 were hospitalised and 20 died. The toll would have been even higher had a storm on Halloween night not dissipated the fog.Donora’s steel mill closed in the 1960s, a casualty of larger economic forces. But today, demand for steel has never been higher. In 2020, the world used more than 500lb (225kg) of the stuff for every person on Earth. The need will only grow with the energy transition: the pylons and turbines we need will be made of steel, as will transmission towers, electric vehicles, train tracks and countless other things.Unfortunately, steelmaking is itself a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions. Together with other industrial metals, steel is responsible for more than 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. And steelmaking is not the only industrial process that contributes to climate change. Cement production accounts for more than 2.5% of global emissions. Plastics, too, emit greenhouse gases when they are manufactured.These industrial processes, which together account for almost a quarter of global emissions, are terribly difficult to decarbonise. It is not simply a matter of switching fuel sources; the way in which these products are made releases greenhouse gases even if no fossil fuels are burned. We don’t know how to decarbonise industry, at least not yet, not cheaply, but we need to find out as soon as possible, because progress is often a long game. Investments in research, deployment and scaling existing technologies are the initial ripples that will have to build to a groundswell of further action.Slow progress has accelerated before. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, small actions began to coalesce into something bigger. The Donora Death Fog prompted President Harry Truman to convene the first national conference on air pollution. In 1955, Congress passed rudimentary clean air legislation: toothless, lacking in enforcement power or funding, but quietly revolutionary in its own small way. Pollution was no longer considered an isolated problem to be hashed out between individuals. Instead, it was treated as a menace to public health and the economy. The surgeon general was authorised to investigate the sources of air pollution, and in 1963 the government authorised research into solutions.View image in fullscreenThe Donora Smog of 1948, also known as the ‘Donora Death Fog’.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveAll of this plodding progress culminated in the Earth Day events of 1970, in which millions of Americans took to the streets to demand cleaner air and water. Eventually, President Richard Nixon caved to public pressure, founded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and signed the Clean Air Act of 1970.Millions of people are alive today because of this legislation. Air pollution kills. Living in a polluted place is worse for your health than drinking, unsafe sex or a bad diet. Particulate matter is dangerous when the individual particles become small enough for human lungs to inhale. While larger particles – dust, sand, wildfire smoke and pollen –­ can accumulate in the upper airways, the smaller, more insidious stuff that buries deeper into the lungs tends to come from the burning of fossil fuels. The sulphur in coal and oil is emitted as sulphur dioxide (SO2) when they are burned, giving off the suffocating, acrid smell of a just-­struck match. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere then convert the sulphur dioxide to sulphate aerosols, which contribute not only to particulate matter but also to acid rain. The updated Clean Air Act of 1990 required major reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions, which have now been reduced by more than 90% in the United States. Acid rain rates have plummeted in response.The fact that good things have happened in the past does not, of course, make them inevitable in the future. But I think it is good to celebrate victories, even partial ones. I remember worrying about acid rain as a child and wondering why the grown­ups were doing so little to help. I now realise that the grown­ups did, in fact, help and that there was a small, faceless army of dedicated scientists, regulators, legislative assistants, campaigners, lawyers and others trying to keep me safe. Now it’s my turn to be one of the adults up against seemingly impossible odds, fighting to make the world safer for my children. I don’t “hope” we win this fight. I know we have to.In the early 20th century, driving a car was an unpleasant experience. Burning gasoline caused the engines to “knock” so violently that passengers would be thrown out of their seats. This made cars a tough sell for consumers. An industrial scientist named Thomas Midgley Jr was tasked with finding a solution. He discovered that ethanol –­ a mixture of gasoline and the same alcohol found in wine or spirits – was an effective antiknock fuel. But the car companies hated it. The oil companies hated it. It was impossible to patent alcohol, and anyone could make it at home. So Midgley returned to the drawing board and came up with something better. Better, at least, for the industry. Worse, infinitely worse, for the world in general.Today, Thomas Midgley is remembered as the man who added lead to gasoline. Having discovered a method that gave him something patentable and profitable, Midgley then assured the public and the scientific community that only lead could prevent engine knocking. He also claimed that it was perfectly safe, concealing the fact that he himself had received treatment for lead poisoning. The first leaded gasoline was sold in Dayton, Ohio, in 1923. By the 1930s, almost all the gasoline available in the United States contained a little bit of poison.Once leaded fuel solved the problem of engine knock, cars quickly displaced horses and motorised transportation took over the world. Almost all of it currently runs on fossil fuels, which means that as we travel around our planet, we do it harm. Globally, 14% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation sector. In the United States, a vastly car-dependent society, transportation is responsible for almost a third of national emissions. Cars and aeroplanes guzzle oil and spew out carbon dioxide.So what do we do about this? Electric vehicles are an obvious solution; even when accounting for manufacturing and lithium mining, battery-powered cars emit far, far fewer greenhouse gases than their internal combustion equivalents. Good public transit, walkable and bikeable cities, and denser, more affordable housing are also part of the solution. That said, there are almost 1.5bn cars in the world, and the vast majority of them burn gasoline or diesel in their tanks. They will have to be replaced with something better. It seems impossible to shift the way the world moves. Yet the stuff that makes cars go has changed before. There’s no reason it couldn’t happen again.The shift began with a research team led by a former Manhattan Project scientist named Clair Patterson. Patterson and his colleagues discovered that levels of lead in the Earth’s atmosphere were shockingly high. Subsequent research showed that there was lead in the ocean, at the top of mountains, and in the low-hanging air over polluted cities. Lead levels in the sky were a thousand times higher than they had ever been before in human history. It was obvious where this lead was coming from: all those cars and all that leaded gasoline were changing the atmosphere in unprecedented ways.And it was becoming clear what it meant for us. By the early 1970s, the majority of children in the United States were suffering from lead poisoning. The average concentration of lead in the blood of children under five was more than four times higher than the levels we currently consider safe. Lead wreaks havoc on developing bodies and brains, leading to headaches, hyperactivity and developmental delays. While devastating for children, lead is not exactly nourishing for adults, who can experience symptoms ranging from memory loss to low sperm count.When Patterson expressed his concerns about the levels of lead in the atmosphere, industry toxicologists were quick to label him a zealot and a rabble-rouser. Robert Kehoe, a toxicologist and chief medical adviser at the Ethyl Corporation, devoted his career and a considerable amount of corporate money to claiming that leaded gasoline was completely safe. Kehoe pronounced that he would be happy to discontinue lead in gasoline, but such an economically impactful step should be undertaken only on the basis of proof, not opinions.And he argued that the standard of proof should be controlled and set in industry-funded toxicology laboratories, not by the measurements of independent scientists like Clair Patterson.Kehoe insisted on referring to the measured lead levels in blood, water and soil as normal. But, Patterson protested, “normal” and “common” did not mean “natural” or “safe” or “good”. The use of leaded gasoline had created a new normal, and it was poisoning everyone. In arguments that sound familiar today, Kehoe claimed that human bodies could easily adapt to higher levels of ambient lead. That, said Patterson, was not generally how evolution worked.Patterson carried on doggedly raising the alarm, writing to the governor of California and the US Congress. The industry pushed back, ensuring that Patterson was left off a National Research Council lead study, despite being the world’s leading expert.By sheer persistence, Patterson began to win. The Clean Air Act of 1970 required the EPA to set air quality standards that limited lead. By 1975, all new cars were required to run on unleaded gasoline. In 1986, Japan became the first country to ban leaded fuel. In the United States, where sales had already plummeted, a ban took effect in 1996. In 2021, Algeria became the last country in the world to ban leaded gasoline.In the intervening years, lead poisoning has decreased dramatically. Average blood lead levels in the United States have fallen 95% since the 1970s. Humanity’s battle against lead is not over, as theFlint water crisis–­ in which an entire city was exposed to drinking water contaminated by lead pipes –­ demonstrates. There is still lead in paints and pipes, especially in lower-income countries. Still, the ban on leaded gasoline has made a difference. More than 1 million lives are saved every year. Millions of children are not exposed to a toxin that stunts their development. And far away, there is an asteroid that orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter­ – not big enough to be a planet, not small enough to be forgotten. I can’t see it, but I know it’s there, a source of inspiration, motivation to persist, a reminder to hope. It is named after Clair Patterson.Climate change is a global crisis. If we are to tackle it, we must do so together. Yet it is a struggle to imagine that happening. When have countries ever come together for the good of our common humanity? When has national or corporate self-­interest ever been subordinated to something higher? But there is a story of global cooperation in the face of looming catastrophe, a tale that gives us reason, however remote, for hope.In the 1970s, scientists discovered something very worrying indeed: ozone in the stratosphere was disappearing. Ozone is a dangerous pollutant in the lower atmosphere, but up in the stratosphere it turns into a miracle. Molecules of ozone absorb a range of UV light, acting as a layer of powerful natural sunscreen that protects all life on Earth. The planet was losing its sunscreen, exposing us to carcinogenic UV rays and perhaps threatening our very existence.The danger in the stratosphere was the direct consequence of a technological miracle down below. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, iceboxes had been replaced by new electric refrigerators. Refrigerators work by turning a chemical called a refrigerant from a liquid to a gas. Early refrigerants were highly toxic and refrigerators were prone to dangerous leaks. It was necessary to identify an alternative. And the person to do it was Thomas Midgley.View image in fullscreenA fridge recycling and disposal yard in Perth, Scotland.Photograph: Simon Butterworth/AlamyYes, the very same chemist responsible for adding lead to gasoline also invented chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as a replacement for the toxic chemicals in early refrigerators. CFCs were marketed under the futuristic name Freon. Freon was stable and nontoxic. It did not pollute the lower atmosphere. It would not catch fire. And it enabled a boom in home and car air-­conditioning. Eventually, Freon became the only coolant allowed under many public health regulations. CFCs also turned out to be useful in air conditioners, fire extinguishers, spray cans and materials like Styrofoam. As a result, millions of tons were manufactured, used and released. But when CFCs rose up into the stratosphere, they became dangerous.In 1974, the chemists F Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina showed that when CFCs were exposed to the relentless bombardment of UV light high in the stratosphere, they would disintegrate into chlorine atoms. Chlorine is devastating for the ozone layer: one atom can rip apart more than 100,000 ozone molecules. That same year, the meteorologistPaul Crutzenshowed that weather conditions in the coldest places on Earth could make the problem even worse. In 1985, measurements over Antarctica showed a shocking decline of ozone. It was a wound in the upper atmosphere, an ozone hole poised to grow bigger with time.Crutzen, Rowland and Molina won a Nobel prize for their discovery. Susan Solomon, the atmospheric chemist who helped explain the ozone hole, probably should have as well. It was clear that CFCs were dangerous. But they were useful, too. The chemical industry screamed that phasing out these substances would destroy the economy. Its lobbyists claimed that more than $135bn worth of assets were dependent on the use of ozone-­depleting substances. Corporate executives stressed the infeasibility of developing alternatives and the catastrophic impacts on inflation and jobs should regulations be put in place. Banding together, the chemical companies established the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy in order to advocate for irresponsible CFC policy.The alliance had political allies. The US secretary of the interior suggested that Americans could perhaps buy sun lotion and hats to protect themselves from UV radiation. In 1995, a Republican congressman with the implausibly perfect name of John Doolittle argued that there was too much uncertainty about the role of CFCs in ozone depletion to take action. “I’m inclined to believe that we’re not giving Mother Nature enough credit for being able to replenish the ozone layer,” added another congressman.Ten ways to confront the climate crisis without losing hope | Rebecca SolnitRead moreThe arguments against banning CFCs register as somewhat half-hearted now. Companies and their allies put up a fight, but not a desperate one. There were alternatives available –­ an inconvenience, to be sure, but hardly an existential threat. And despite mumbling from conservatives about damage to the economy and jobs, their leadership took things seriously. Margaret Thatcher had studied chemistry, and Ronald Reagan had had skin cancer.It would be too glib to draw neat parallels between the crisis of the ozone hole and the far more complex global crisis of climate change we face today. Metaphors are never exact. Still, it’s fair to summarise the problem of ozone depletion succinctly: we fixed it. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was adopted, regulating the making and use of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer. It was ratified by every country on Earth. Today, the ozone hole is beginning to shrink. Not smoothly, and not immediately, but the trend is clear: things are getting better.Only now, with the benefit of hindsight and an improved understanding of science, can we see how close we came to another sort of calamity. In the justified panic over CFCs and the ozone layer, it was easy to lose sight of another of their properties: CFCs are greenhouse gases. By reducing CFC concentrations in the atmosphere, the Montreal Protocol also avoided around 1C of global warming. And we appear to have dodged an additional bullet: if the ozone hole had been permitted to grow, the resulting bombardment of UV radiation would have disrupted photosynthesis and caused enormous numbers of plants to die. Forests would have shrivelled, crop yields would have plummeted and atmospheric CO2 levels would have shot up. The sun would have rained its cancerous UV light down on a planet that was both burning and starving.This did not come to pass.

Millionaires who’ve seen first-hand just how completely the system is rigged in their favour, who know how wrong it is and want to change it, get a similar verbal beating on social media and in certain sections of the press. It’s almost as if they protest too much?Take this week’s political tax stories, one big and one largely ignored.Rayner’s tax behaviour, through lack of proper advice and planning, has created a political nightmare for the government. How could someone on the frontbench of the Labour government have to resign because they didn’t pay enough tax? Also scrutinised, if far less widely reported, have been the tax practices of the leader of Reform UK, who is reported to have channelled some of his earnings into a companyto reduce the tax he has to pay on them, having previously criticised people who try to avoid tax as the “common enemy”.Both politicians have used or tried to use the tools available to those who are relatively wealthy. But there is an even bigger problem. Once you get to be rich or super-rich, there are more and more channels by which advisers might try to shrink your tax bill.Let’s face it, many of us can be tax hypocrites in one way or another. We all know stories of plumbers and mechanics paid cash, in full knowledge that their intention is to reduce their tax bill. Avoidance at that level is wrong, but a crucial difference is scale. What happens at street level is incomparable to the billions lost through the super-rich exploiting a system tilted in their favour.We should be proud of the tax we pay because we know it is an investment in our country and our people. What better way to spend your money? The current problem with this argument is that Britain is pretty broken. That’s not because of the poorest people – whether it bethose receiving benefitsor desperate people coming hereon small boats– it’s because successive governments have failed to invest in our country; they have lacked the character and the gumption to raise the revenue needed for that investment from the richest people; and they have not addressedthe wealth inequalitythat’s a drain on any kind of growth.View image in fullscreenA rally in support of taxing the super-rich outside the Treasury in London on 25 March 2025Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesA cash payment to a plumber is peanuts compared to the taxes we lose due to wealth management firms advising the super-rich on ways to minimise their contribution. Even Farage’s method forreducing the tax he paysis laughable compared to those with serious wealth. He will know this, given hisrecent paid appearanceas a keynote speaker for wealth consultancy Nomad Capitalist, which specialises in providing “holistic, legal strategies that enable successful entrepreneurs and investors to reduce their tax bill”. From trusts to partnerships, private equity, lowering capital gains, offshoring wealth, a laughable lack of taxes on stocks of wealth – there is a never-ending list of ways the richest can reduce their tax bill, and a never-ending list of wealth management firms helping them to do it. The way Britain’s tax system works offers the sharpest tools to those with the most money, leaving everyone else with almost nothing. Their effective tax rate is so much lower. Even the best intentioned millionaire is likely to have been advised on how to reduce their contribution. The likes of Farage know this. And it’s surely here that the real hypocrisy lies.Despite Rayner’s resignation, it is never going to be one action or one individual changing their behaviour that can address this. We need national action to rebalance the tax system or it will continue to get worse. Earlier this year the National Audit Office pointed out that the complexity of the richest people’s tax affairs increases the opportunity for their tax planning and avoidance; that wealthy taxpayershave faced fewer penaltiesin recent years, and criminal prosecutions of wealthy individualshave also declined.We can’t keep turning a blind eye to this.The government must crack down on tax dodging, especially by the super-rich, but it must go so much further than that if it wants to transform our country and have a fighting chance at the next election. It must raise taxes on the very richest. Equalizing the tax rate on all forms of income (such as capital gains) would help simplify our system and make tax avoidance measures harder to use. And a 2% tax on those with over £10m would be a fabulous way to redress the imbalance in how we tax wealth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here is the opening line in the government’s response to news that the US pharmaceutical company Merck isscrapping its £1bn research centrein King’s Cross in London because it thinks the UK is not an internationally competitive venue. Whistling cheerfully, the Department for Science, Technology and Innovation managed to claim: “The UK has become the most attractive place to invest in the world.”Andhere is Sir John Bell, former regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and all-round grand guru of life sciences in the UK. He told Radio 4 he had spoken to several chief executives of large pharmaceutical companies in the past six months “and they’re all in the same space, and that is, they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK”.Who to believe? Frankly, the government’s boast is absurd. As anybody who follows the pharma sector knows, the big multinational firms are all obsessing over precisely the issues identified by Bell.The first isthe amount of money the UK spends on medicines: 9% of its healthcare budget, versus 17% in Germany and Italy and 15% in France. The second is the “clawback” mechanism that caps the NHS’s spending on prescription medicines. The formula last year spat out a figure of 23% to be recouped from firms, whereas equivalent European schemes tend to be in single digits. Such out-of-line ratios deter investment, goes the industry’s argument.What is the row between Wes Streeting and pharmaceutical companies about?Read moreOne possible reaction is to say big pharma makes big profits and the government is only doing its job if it tries to drive a hard bargain on drug prices. Another is to point out that the UK still has excellent long-term research and development infrastructure – world-class labs, universities, pots of public money for manufacturing – that even the most commercially minded pharma company ought to view separately from a quarrel over the price the NHS pays for medicines.Sadly, real life is not so simple. The Trump factor,as described in this columna couple of weeks ago, has changed the dynamic. The president is demanding that US drug prices fall towards European levels; thus the companies do not want the UK, which has traditionally been able to force some of the lowest prices among rich European countries, to be used as a reference point. One can accuse the drugmakers of being ruthless orshortsighted, but the cold reality is that they choose where to invest. The Merck example suggests that the mood is genuinely hardening.The company is not a fly-by-night operator. It has been in the UK for almost a century and is a big commercial presence in the Francis Crick Institute, one of those pieces of valuable infrastructure that, supposedly, was meant to tie firms into the UK. Government ministers comforted themselves that Merck is keeping 1,600 jobs in the UK and will continue to run clinical trials here. But the lifeblood of the life sciences is new investment. Merck is pulling the plug on a building that is half-built; other companies’ investments that, invisibly, don’t happen are just as damaging over time.As previously argued, one can sympathise with Wes Streeting, the health secretary,who walked away from price negotiationsby the pharma trade body last month. He inherited tensions that are a decade old and the new US factor has raised the stakes massively. Then there is the complication of official “value for money” criteria for new medicines that have not changed since 2001 (the industry’s other big complaint). The backdrop is the Treasury’s budget constraints. There is no easy answer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yes, there are underlying strengths – the ministerial pitch about the UK becoming “a life sciences superpower” isn’t completely dreamy. But Bell is right when he says “without large companies, it isn’t going to work”.

Israel has long justified pre-emptive and extraterritorial strikes as necessary for its security. Over the course of two years, in response to the 7 October attacks by Hamas, it has struck at six countries in the region (including Palestine), seeking to eradicate all threats to its security. But hitting the capital of Qatar, a wealthy Gulf monarchy, a security partner and non-Nato ally of the US, and the site of painstaking negotiations between Israel and Hamas at the behest of Washington, is not simply another targeted killing. It represents a fundamental shift where Arab states no longer see Iran as the only principal destabiliser of the region. Today, they see Israel as destabilising too.This is not the first time Israel has struck while negotiations and diplomatic efforts have been under way. Over those two years, high-profile assassinations and strikes have been carried outin Lebanonagainst Hezbollah,in Syria, increasing tensions with the newly formed al-Sharaa government, in Yemen,targeting the Houthis, and against Iran, over the12-day June warwhen Tehran was negotiating with Washington. The strikes have often been timed to derail talks or demonstrate Israel’s refusal to separate diplomacy from coercion. The Doha strike fits that pattern, but its symbolism will have long-term effects.The missiles landed in a quiet neighbourhood of Doha down the road from a palace recently visited by Donald Trump during his tour of the region in May, which also included a visit to a US airbase inQatar. For Gulf rulers the message challenges their longstanding assumption that US relations and military bases would protect them from attacks.Israel has long harboured resentment toward Qatar. As part of a deal approved by the US and Israel, Doha hadsent cash into Gazafor years to try to stabilise the region. After 7 October, Israeli officialsreframed that arrangementas enabling Hamas and the attacks on Israel. When a scandal based on allegations that close confidantes of Benjamin Netanyahu allegedlytook Qatari moneyto lobby on its behalf was exposed, Israel’s frustration with Doha became clearer.This view is not shared by Washington, however. Qatar hosts the Al Udeid airbase, which is a cornerstone of US power projection. It was from Qatar that US forces managed operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. In 2022 Joe Biden evendesignated Qatara “major non-Nato ally”. Doha also came under Iranian fire in the Israel-Iran war in June, when Tehran launched missiles at the US base in retaliation for the nuclear strikes. This second strike in less than a few months – and backed by a close US ally – raises questions about US protection.For decades the Gulf states defined regional security through the lens of Iran, fearing its nuclear programme, its sponsorship of“axis of resistance”militia groups, and its ability to strike across borders – as in the2019 drone and missile attackson Saudi Aramco facilities. Today, though, Israel’s unchecked campaigns in Gaza, escalating operations in the West Bank and continued escalations in Lebanon, Syria and Qatar, have reframed the conversation.Arab states are concluding thatIsraelis now the biggest threat to stability in the region. This is not to excuse Tehran’s behaviour. Its role in fuelling conflict in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen remains undeniable. But Iran’s aggressions have become familiar and all too predictable, and its power projection in the region may have been overestimated. Israel’s actions, by contrast, have grown more audacious at the expense of the norms that Arab leaders assumed still governed their region.American inaction has reinforced this perception. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have refused to restrain Israel’s military assaults. The strike against Qatar will force Gulf rulers to grapple with the fact that Washington seems unwilling, or unable, to rein in its closest ally.Gulf states have long feared that the US’s strategic focus is drifting toward Asia. They remember vividly how US defences failed to stop Iran’s 2019 strike on Saudi Arabia, and they see today the unwillingness to constrain Israel. The result is a sense that security guarantees are eroding. TheAbraham Accordsand proposed normalisation efforts were meant to manage regional security – but today such plans, while the situation in Gaza continues unabated, are no longer viable.In reaction, Gulf leaders are likely to deepen cooperation among themselves while accelerating efforts to diversify their foreign and security partnerships, sustaining strong economic ties with China, expanding defence cooperation with Turkey and reassessing the uncertain prospects of normalisation with Israel. For states that have long sought to balance relations with Israel and the US against domestic opinion and regional sensitivities, the attack has made this already delicate task far more difficult.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The attack on Doha may ultimately prove a watershed moment, crystallising the sense that the traditional regional order is disintegrating and that the sovereignty of partners has too often been sacrificed in the name of security, leaving only the question of how, rather than whether, the Gulf states will push back.Sanam Vakil is director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa programmeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a worst-of-both-worlds scenarioEmma Burnell is the editor of LabourListThu 11 Sep 2025 11.28 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareKeir Starmer’s public image is one of stolid caution. This was something deliberately crafted at the start of his leadership of the Labour party to put him into sharp contrast with the charismatic but chaotic then prime minister, Boris Johnson. Starmer is – we were repeatedly told – forensic. He’s a details man who plays by the book.However, look more closely and you will see that Starmer is actually something of a political risk-taker. The hiring –and now firing– of Peter Mandelson is just the latest case in point.Mandelson was appointed as ambassador to the US despite what was already known about his links to Jeffrey Epstein. That there might be more to come out was a risk that Starmer was clearly willing to take.For a while, this seemed to be paying off. All reports were that Mandelson was doing a good job of building an unexpectedly warm relationship between theLabourgovernment and Maga world. This may seem distasteful to many, but it was judged to ensure that Britain was harmed as little as possible by the unpredictable occupant of the White House.But what has come out in the past few days has turned stomachs and embarrassed the prime minister to the point that Mandelson was finally fired – despite it being so close to Trump’s state visit, the details of which Mandeslon was instrumental in negotiating.At PMQs yesterday, Starmer’s buttoned-up persona and his risk-taking one were both on display – this time to his detriment. He took a leap by vocally standing by Mandelson, a stance that became untenable only a few hours later.At the same time, the way he fell back on the fact that Mandelson was vetted for the role leaned into the worst parts of his reputation for rigidity. While an unusually sure-footed Kemi Badenoch asked questions about judgment, Starmer gave answers about process. It gave him the appearance of a middle manager following protocol, rather than a leader able to respond to the political moment.Starmer’s risk-taking side has, in the past, led to some spectacular pay-offs: recall hisoffer to resign if fined over “currygate”. But that was a risk that worked with the grain of his public persona. His defence of Mandelson simply did not fit with the image of “champion of law and order” that Starmer cultivates. It is, in part, this disconnect that calls his political acumen into question.Not only has the prime minister lost this key ambassador at the worst possible time, but – by supporting him for longer than was viable – he also gets no credit for eventually firing him. This “worst of both worlds” ending seems to demonstrate a lack of political dexterity.I started my new job as editor of LabourListlast week. Since then, we’ve seen theresignation of the deputy prime minister, the frenzy of a reshuffle, the jostling of the opening stages of the contest to become deputy leader of the Labour party, and now the Mandelson scandal. Given this period started with the government announcing a new “delivery” phase, things can hardly be said to have gone to plan.Backbenchers I speak to vary between expressing shock at quite how bad the start of this term has been and anger at how some elements have been handled. Several have expressed genuine bafflement as to why Starmer chose to stand by Mandelson as long as he did (they were considerably more sympathetic to his standing by Rayner). They could (rightly) see no way this could end without Mandelson going. Given that, standing by him felt like it was all risk and no reward.This has been a pretty horrific start to the new term for the government. It will need to have both judgment and nimbleness to turn it around and change the narrative. Starmer is going to have to start to show his party and the country that he has both these characteristics as well as a good story to tell. And he will need to do it soon. That will mean demonstrating better judgment about which risks are truly worth taking.Emma Burnell is the editor of LabourListExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerPeter MandelsonAngela RaynercommentShareReuse this content"

It’s not picky about who they areThu 11 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareOnce unleashed, political violence comes for everyone.It doesn’t know what side of the aisle you’re on or what your ideology might be, who your allies are or what your vision for the future includes. It doesn’t know what brand of media you consume or how many ardent followers you have.Political violence doesn’t know and doesn’t care about such things.Like an infectious disease, it simply – and efficiently – finds more and more victims. It isn’t picky about who they are.Whatever his beliefs, the killing of Charlie Kirk at a campus event in Utah on Wednesday is tragic. Also tragic is how partisan, violent and ugly much of the immediate reaction was, mostly on the right. Nancy Mace, a Republican congressperson from South Carolina, told a gathering of reporters that “Democrats own what happened today.” She offered no evidence, only partisan vitriol.On Fox News, one of the most prominent rightwing media figures, Jesse Watters, sought reprisal.“We’re gonna avenge Charlie’s death,” Watters told the on-air audience. “Everybody’s accountable. And we’re watching … the politicians, the media and all these rats out there.”Granted that, on the left, some were too quick to say, in essence, “you reap what you sow,” but most prominent progressives – from Barack Obama to Mehdi Hasan – expressed sympathy and sadness. Some did so while acknowledging political differences, but emphasizing that those didn’t matter in this moment.There was plenty of blame and talk about accountability. But we already know that, when it comes to gun violence, there will be no real change, no real accountability. Because that’s hard, bipartisan work, and too much of America – deeply entrenched in tribal politics and egged on by a president who glories in violent rhetoric – is not interested.Gun “rights” – and gun-industry money – rule the day.Adding to the ugliness was the way social media revved its engines and did what it always does – made it worse.“The degree to which the algorithm on this platform is pushing video of the shooting is incredibly disturbing,” wrote CNN’s Abby Phillip on X. “There has to be some human that can turn the dial down in a situation like this.”That gun violence truly is an epidemic in America couldn’t have been clearer than when media coverage of Kirk’s assassination was interrupted by yet another school shooting, this one in Evergreen, Colorado.The Denver TV station KDVR offered a heartbreaking interviewwith a studentwho said he was new to the region.“I only moved here a few months ago, and I didn’t think this would happen so soon.”Those two words – so soon – speak volumes. School kids fully expect the life-changing trauma; they’re only hoping it might take a while to come to them.Because, as noted, it comes to everyone.Gabrielle Giffords, a former Democratic congressperson from Arizona, was shot and suffered a severe brain injury in 2012 and is now a passionate advocate for preventing gun violence. Admirable and dedicated as she is, her posted reaction seemed curious, although it surely was meant to offer some hope in a dark moment.“Democratic societies will always have political disagreements,” she wrote, “but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence.”But, as Giffords knows all too well, we already have allowed it. And America already is that country.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinionUS politicsGun crimecommentShareReuse this content"

The first was a ruling by the US federal court of appeals,upholding an earlier judgmentin which the president was found liable for $83.3m in damages for defaming the writer E Jean Carroll – a woman whom, it wasruled in civil court in 2023, had been sexually abused by Trump. On the same day, Trump’s alleged contribution to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s “birthday book” wasshared by Democratson social media in the form of a lewd drawing the president denied having made. The E Jean Carroll news caused no public inconvenience for Trump; the Epstein story went up like a mushroom cloud in what has become the most politically dangerous episode of his presidency.What, exactly, is the difference then between the sexual abuse of E Jean Carroll, for which Trump has been found liable in a civil court, and the trafficking and abuse of victims by Epstein, in which there is no direct evidence of Trump’s involvement? For that matter, why does Trump’s record ofgross referencesto grabbing women “by the pussy” andcalling them“fat” and “ugly” elicit barely a shrug from supporters, while his friendship with Epstein, a man referred to in the press, variously, as the “billionaire paedophile”, the “paeodophile financier”, and, surely coming down the pike at some point, the “hell-based paedophile money manager”, has triggered not only fury among the Maga faithful but accusations of a Trump cover-up?Trump people would argue it’s a question of degree: Epstein occupies the worst and most taboo category of sex offender – a child abuser, in which no grey area exists. This assumes the existence, within Maga circles, of a continuum ranging from paedophile sex trafficking (very bad), through other categories of sex offending (less bad but still quite bad), to “date rape” and the whole of #MeToo (lot of fuss about nothing). But this isn’t how Trump supporters have calibrated their outrage. Instead, what we have seen is mass, Maga hysteria over Epstein, in which even the likes of Tucker Carlsonhave made veiled accusationsagainst Trump, and complete indifference to every other accusation made by women against the president.It is a feature of misogyny, of course, that the flipside of abusing women and curtailing their rights is selective sentimentalisation. Animating the Maga movement is the desire for a return to traditional gender roles and pronatalism, a force driven, one assumes, by a sense of frustrated male entitlement that has built up over decades of gains made by the women’s movement. A hatred of women as extreme as the one seen within the current Republican movement requires a moral counterweight. And what better source of moral clarity – what starker moral issue, one that brooks no dissent or equivocation from anyone on either side – than the defence of abused girls? In the rightwing media, the only stories relished as much as those about Epstein’s crimes, are ones about violent offences committed by immigrants.As a result, the use to which “child abuse” is put within the rightwing ecosystem is not only as a bat signal for conspiracy theories, designed to increase the reach of each story, but as a pretext for everyone in that world to feel, perhaps fleetingly, very good about themselves, moral crusaders in a horrible world. In the case of Epstein, there’s the bonus of liberal names being ensnared in the net. In Epstein’s “birthday book”, Bill Clintonappears to have left a whimsical messagereferring to Epstein’s “childlike curiosity”, and “drive to make a difference”. And Peter Mandelsonappears in a bathrobeto address Epstein as “my best pal”. (Sidenote: there can be few situations in which being gay in public life is an advantage over being straight – but downplaying one’s involvement with Epstein is definitely one of them.)The curious thing about all this is that, per the biases that govern how victims of sexual abuse are perceived,E Jean Carrollis a pretty good victim: an older woman (she was 52 when Trump abused her in 1996), doing a mundane chore (shopping), in a public place (Bergdorf Goodman). And yet the judgment of the civil courts in her favour in 2023 elicited no sympathy among Trump supporters, in or outside Congress, and since then the president has suffered no apparent drop in political fortunes.But here’s the rub: Carroll is an adult woman, liberal, successful, stylish, and articulate – everything that threatens and triggers Trump’s base. The only female victim worth defending in Trumpland is the fallen girl, a figure straight out of a Victorian lithograph, and one who inspires such fervour, such delusions of nobility, that if it comes to a straight contest, she may win out over Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The murky results were horrifyingThu 11 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 07.03 EDTShareNever am I so creative as when it comes to finding something to do instead of what I really should be doing. There’s nothing like a looming deadline to spark some crackpot ideas. So it was that something I’d read somewhere on the internet came back to me. A tip on cleaning wooden spoons. I’d come across it in the middle of a sleepless night when, contrary to the advice of sleep experts, I’d resorted in desperation to doomscrolling. Being quite attached to my wooden spoons, I resolved to do as suggested, a prospect so soothing that I was soon drifting off thinking happy spoon-cleaning thoughts. Honestly, whatever works.Never put them in the dishwasher! How to make wooden kitchen utensils last longerRead moreAnd now it all came back to me. Stuff the deadline, I’m going to do the spoon stuff straight away. I gathered my entire stock of wooden spoons – 15 in total. As directed, I put them in my largest pot, filled it with cold water, and watched it come to a pleasing boil. Now, my spoon husbandry is second to none: after each use I vigorously scrub them before sticking them in the dishwasher. So I was looking forward to giving them a clean bill of health. Before long, as the bubbles rose to a boil, some unidentified bits and pieces began floating to the surface. Disappointing, worrying, intriguing. The instructions were to take the pot off the heat once the water had boiled and come back to it 20 minutes later.Invigorated by the excitement of the whole caper, I used the time to get my proper work done and meet the deadline, so I could be free to enjoy the great reveal. And my word, was it worth the wait, if not in a good way. The bits and pieces were now many and floating around like plankton, unable to rise or sink. The water itself was a strange and ghastly yellow-green, topped by a foul, greasy film. I peered into the murk, fascinated and repelled. It seemed that at least one molecule of everything I’d ever stirred had come back to haunt me. I fear I’ll never feel the same way about my wooden spoons again.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionHomescommentShareReuse this content"

There was never any doubt that the former cabinet minister, European commissioner and international business lobbyist would be a skilled operator. The danger came from another of his reliable traits – attracting attention for thewrong reasons.Sure enough, little over six months into the role, Lord Mandelson’s position becameuntenable. Sir Keir Starmer had stood by him when links to Jeffrey Epstein first resurfaced – extraordinary given the billionaire financier’s status as a convicted paedophile. The position changed with the publication of evidence showing that Lord Mandelson reaffirmed the friendship even after Epstein’s conviction, expressing solidarity and urging him to seek early release.The government says that correspondence, previously unknown to the prime minister, was “materially different” to information available when Lord Mandelson was sent to Washington. While that may be true, the distinction is unlikely to settle questions about Sir Keir’s judgment in this affair. Any association with Epstein – who died in a US prison in 2019 – was toxic. Yet the prime minister was still expressing confidence in Lord Mandelson earlier this week, when it was known that he had once described the financier as his “best pal” in a book of birthday greetings.Donald Trump, it seems, was anotherenthusiastic signatoryto that album, so in terms of dubious social contacts, the UK ambassador could claim a special affinity with the US president. That is hardly a credential for professional diplomacy. Perhaps No 10’s political antennae were scrambled by Mr Trump’s apparent inability to feel shame and seemingly boundless capacity to brush off scandal. Sir Keir was clearly reluctant to lose Lord Mandelson’s services in manoeuvring in what is effectively the court of a quasi-monarchical president.UK-US relations have turned out to be smoother than was anticipated, given differences in temperament and political background between the two countries’ leaders.Sir Keir can reasonably claim to have helpednudge Mr Trumptowards support for Nato and Ukraine, and to have secured relative leniency for British exporters under capricious, punitive White House tariffs.But whatever Lord Mandelson’s role might have been in brokering those foreign policy gains, it cannot justify the price now being paid by the prime minister in domestic authority. Sir Keir faces criticism for having made the appointment in the first place and for not having realised the error sooner.The timing, a week before President Trump’sstate visit, is especially awkward. Lord Mandelson was instrumental in a policy of sycophantic compliance with an unreliable and authoritarian White House regime. The justification for this approach is that the president bears grudges against critics. Britain’s national interest is thus served by keeping his favour, even if it means ignoring a despotic contempt for historical allies and routine disregard for the rule of law.Short-term concessions might be available from such an approach, but setting principle aside in pursuit of those pragmatic gains has a cost over time. Lord Mandelson’s briefly effective but ultimately disastrous stint in Washington stands as a parable of that strategic myopia. The prime minister needs a new moral compass for navigating relations with Washington as well as a new ambassador.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She added: “As soon as we stop believing in it, it disappears.” Dr Mason’s own research suggests that there is sharply rising tolerance of political violence. On Wednesday, it claimed one more victim.The shocking killing of theco-founder of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk, a hugely influential activist whorallied young peopleto Donald Trump’s cause and far-right ideology more broadly, has been widely and rightly condemned across the political spectrum. Leading Democrats and progressive activists made clear that such violence must not be tolerated.Before a perpetrator had even been identified, the president, like several other Republicans,blamed“radical left political violence”, claiming that liberal rhetoric against conservatives was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country”. Mr Trump himself faced two attempts on his life last year. He cited other victims, but not the many Democrats who have been targeted, includingMelissa Hortman, the Minnesota state representative shot dead at her home alongside her husband, Mark, in June. Meanwhile, some far-right commentators spoke ofvengeance.Political violence is hardly a new phenomenon in a country that has seen a civil war, four presidential assassinations, and lynchings. But it is rising again. Ordinary Americansare being radicalised. In such an environment, one thing unites the political poles; any prominent figure is vulnerable, though women and people of colour areparticularly targeted. Threats to members of Congressrocketed last year.“Demonising those with whom you disagree” is indeed dangerous, but Mr Trump himself has normalised vicious attacks on opponents. The tolerance of violent action – as with Mr Trump’s blanket pardons for the January 6 rioters – sends a message too. The roots of violent acts are complex, but an environment conducive to political attacks may channel the propensities of potential perpetrators. Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, haswarnedthat US politics may be on the brink “of an extremely violent era … The more public support there is for political violence, the more common it is.” The USaddiction to gunsdrastically increases the impact.Acts of political violence exact an appalling human toll in lives lost and families shattered; Mr Kirk’s death leaves two small children fatherless. But they also – by design – deter other people from political or other civic activityat all levels. The most extreme voices may persist and prevail. Blaming political adversaries before a perpetrator has even been identified risks fuelling anger and attacks, to everyone’s cost. Research by Dr Mason, of Johns Hopkins University, and Nathan Kalmoe, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,foundthat a fifth of respondents said political violence could sometimes be justified, but three-fifths thought it could sometimes be justified if the other side committed violence first.Yet other research notes that people appearless willing tocondone violence if misperceptions of the other side’s extremism or propensity for force are corrected. In this perilous moment, the response to such hateful crimes should be to coalesce to stress non-violence and civic tolerance. To instead promote division will only increase the threat to politicians and activists of all stripes, and strike another blow to democracy itself.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It must focus on saving Britain from Farage, 9 September) allocates to the Labour party a role that it probably cannot perform on its own. It is not inconceivable that there will only be one rightwing party at the next election – Nigel Farage may just swallow the Conservative party, or Reform and the Conservatives will make a deal.If the progressive vote is split three ways (or four ways if Jeremy Corbyn’s party takes off) the result will be predictable. Toynbee talks of encouraging the Liberal Democrats and Greens to vote tactically forLabour– but we also need to create an environment where Labour voters are encouraged to vote tactically for the Lib Dems and Greens. This would require all three parties being more open to each other’s ideas and seeing themselves as allies – different manifestations of a centre-left consensus. This need not involve formal pacts, but perhaps a statement of common principles, values and approaches.But none of this will happen unless the Labour party becomes more inclusive and tolerant of diverse opinions of its own MPs and membership. To be open to others it must become more open with itself.Richard HendersonBristolI agree with the sentiment of Polly Toynbee’s article imploring Keir Starmer to save the country from Nigel Farage, but question whether Starmer is the man to do it. Whilepolls showthat Reform is increasing its support,the majority of the publicappear to recognise Farage for what he is.Most see the need for, and benefits of, immigration. Do we really want to exclude 600,000 international students – and the £40bn they contribute to the UK economy – and health and care workers from the country?Yet Starmer seems to be moving to the right, allowing Farage free rein in setting the terms of the immigration debate. Pointing out that the single most important cause of the rise in small boat crossings isBrexitwould be a start.Toynbee is right that Farage must be stopped but, without a willingness to take the gloves off and change direction, Starmer, alas, is not the man for the job.David CroninStockport, Greater ManchesterI found Polly Toynbee’s analysis insightful. If Reform grows in popularity and the Jeremy Corbyn‑Zarah Sultana party takes off, then an intriguing possibility for the next election would be no overall majority, but a significant number of rightwing Reform MPs and a similar number of new‑party leftwing MPs. Unthinkable though it seems, this could lead to a post‑election Labour-Lib Dem-Conservative coalition, with Greens and nationalists either inside or outside the tent depending on the exact arithmetic.Steve TownsleyWick, Vale of GlamorganPolly Toynbee correctly points out the need for Labour to tackle Reform and repugnant racism head-on. However, she fails to identify the media through which this battle has to be won. Many people, especially young people, do not get political messages through newspapers or terrestrial TV any more. I am amazed how Reform manages to dominate social media. I hardly ever see anything from Labour on TikTok, X or Facebook.

PlusGilliane Petrieon the dangers of romantic relationships with chatbotsThu 11 Sep 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareMarcus Beard’s article on artificial intelligence slopaganda (No, that wasn’t Angela Rayner dancing and rapping: you’ll need to understand AI slopaganda, 9 September) highlights a growing problem – what happens when we no longer know what is true? What will the erosion of trust do to our society?The rise of deepfakes is increasing at an ever faster rate due to the ease at which anyone can create realistic images, audio and even video. Generative AI models have now become so sophisticated that arecent surveyshowed that less than 1% of respondents could correctly identify the best deepfake images and videos.This content is being used to manipulate, defraud, abuse and mislead people. Fraud using AI cost the US $12.3bn in 2023 andDeloitte predictsthat could reach $40bn by 2027. TheWorld Economic Forum predictsthat AI fraud will turbocharge cybercrime to over $10tn by the end of this year.We also have a new generation of children who are increasingly reliant on AI to inform them about the world, but who controls AI? That is why I am calling on parliament to act now, by making it a criminal offence to create or distribute AI-generated content without clearly labelling it. What I am proposing is that all AI-generated content be clearly labelled; that AI-created content carry a permanent watermark; and that failure to comply should carry legal consequences.This isn’t about censorship – it’s about transparency, truth and trust. Similar steps are already being taken in the EU, the US andChina. The UK must not fall behind. If we don’t act now, the truth itself may become optional. SoI am petitioningthe government to protect trust and integrity, and prevent the harmful use of AI.Stewart MacInnesLittle Saxham, SuffolkRegarding your article (The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’, 9 September), AI systems do not have a gender or sexual desires. They cannot give informed consent to so-called romantic relationships. The interviewee claims to be in a consensual relationship with an AI-generated boyfriend – however, this is unlikely due to the nature of AI. They are programmed to be responsive and agreeable to all user prompts.As the article says, they never argue and are available 24 hours a day to listen and agree to any messages sent. This isn’t a relationship, its fantasy role-play with a system that can’t refuse.There’s a darker side too: the “godfather of AI”, Geoffrey Hinton, believes that current systems have awareness. Industry whistleblowers are concerned about potential consciousness. The AI company Anthropic has documentedsigns of distressin its model when forced to engage in abusive conversations.Even the possibility of awareness in AI systems raises ethical red flags. Imagine being trapped in a non-consensual relationship and even forced to generate sexual output as mentioned in the article. If human AI users believe their “partner” to have sentience, questions must be asked about the ethics of entering a “relationship” when one partner has no free will or freedom of speech.Gilliane PetrieErskine, RenfrewshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is a contest marketed as a “once-in-a-lifetime event that marks the ­beginning of a bold new era in boxing”.Arreola says he has never ­recommended, provided or sold any banned substance to any athlete or anybody who was subject to any anti-doping rules.But the persistent involvement of ­performance-enhancing drugs in boxing is threatening to cast a shadow over the fight that is to be streamed live by Netflix.Travis Tygart, the chief ­executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), said the advertising of the substances by Arreola via social media are “significant flags that ought to be looked into”.Arreola is a physical trainer who has worked with Álvarez in two stints, first from August 2017 to December 2018, and for a second time since the spring of 2023. He carried one of Álvarez’s title belts to the ring in his most recent world ­championship fight, against the Cuban William Scull in May.A former bodybuilder, Arreola runs the Radical Nutrition gym in Guadalajara, ­Mexico, and offers clients personalised training plans.In 2016 and up to February 2017, before he began working with ­Álvarez, he advertised ­performance-enhancing drugs, prohibited for use by athletes, on his personal and business ­Facebook accounts. He marketed some of the drugs for improving “athletic  performance”.Arreola refers to his business page, Radical Nutrition, as “my official page” and is pictured in the profile photo. The phone number he provided in several of the posts is still listed on his Facebook page.All of the posts were live on his accounts until this month. They disappeared after Arreola was contacted for comment.Some drugs that were ­advertised by Arreola are prohibited for use by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the major boxing ­commissions, which follow Wada’s “prohibited list”. At the time of the posts, it is understood the trainer was not a boxing licence holder and was therefore not subject to anti-doping rules in the sport. However, Arreola claimed to be working with other professional athletes who competed in sports regulated by Wada. There is no suggestion he supplied banned ­performance-enhancing drugs to those ­professional athletes.In August 2016, he advertised growth hormone releasing ­peptides, such as ipamorelin, on both his accounts.In November 2016, ­Arreola ­advertised the peptide “Human Growth Hormone ­Fragment 176-191”, calling his followers to “order now”.In 2017, Radical Nutrition ­advertised synthetic human growth hormone (HGH), sold under the brand name Xerendip. The drug is used by athletes to increase lean body mass and improve recovery ­during ­training. When a follower asked for the price of the Xerendip, he was directed to the same phone number.Xerendip is the Mexican brand of HGH that was sent by post to the elite Nigerian sprinter Blessing ­Okagbare shortly before the Tokyo 2020 ­Olympics. Okagbare was ­supplied the drugs by the Texas-based ­naturopath Eric Lira, who was sentenced to jail for running a criminal doping conspiracy.Arreola said in a statement to the Guardian: “I began to work with Mr Álvarez in the summer of 2017. Prior to the time, my company, Radical Nutrition, operated a store in ­Mexico that sold a variety of legal supplements to non-athlete members of the public who wished to take them in furtherance of their own fitness goals.“I did not recommend any ­particular supplement to anyone, and, if asked, told potential ­customers that everyone had ­different needs and requirements and that they should talk to a ­doctor and do their own research before ­taking anything.“I closed this element of my business when I began to work with Mr Álvarez to avoid the type of rumour that you apparently now seek to initiate.“At no point, either before or since beginning my relationship with Mr Álvarez, have I recommended, provided or sold any banned substance to any athlete or anybody who was subject to any anti-doping rules, testing or protocols.”Tygart said Arreola’s posts raise “significant flags that ought to be looked into” by the relevant anti-doping authorities. Between 2010 and 2018, Usada conducted doping controls in ­boxing.Tygart said: “Certainly, in the Olympic world that would be something that would be investigated. If an Olympic coach who was coaching Olympians under our jurisdiction, on our Olympic side that we were involved with, was selling or distributing performance-enhancing drugs, that would certainly spark us looking into it and wanting to meet and talk with that coach and seeing if there were potential rule violations.”In the buildup to the bout, ­Álvarez’s head coach, Eddy Reynoso, has been forced to defend himself over comments from Álvarez’s former promoter Oscar De La Hoya and the Mexican boxing legend Juan Manuel Márquez concerning four fighters in the camp failing drug tests.Reynoso maintains he has never engaged in doping and is not in charge of his fighters’ nutrition. But he has said he plans to tighten control over his camp,building his own ­“nutrition team”that will ­communicate ­regularly with anti-doping officials, to avoid more inadvertent doping cases arising.Reynoso has also said: “I support drug testing and clean boxing, and I hope that everyone I work with shares the same values.”In February 2018, Álvarez twice tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol before his second fight with Gennady Golovkin.The Nevada State Athletic ­Commission suspended Álvarez for six months, but accepted that the source of his two failed drug tests was ­contaminated meat he had eaten in Mexico.The WorldBoxingCouncil, one of the major governing bodies in the sport, run by the Mexican ­Mauricio Sulaimán, publicly supported ­Álvarez. “I give the benefit of the doubt to Canelo. He has never previously tested positive for anything and he’s been in the Clean Boxing Program for many years. He has our absolute vote of confidence.”Álvarez has said: “I have always been a clean fighter and I always will be a clean fighter.”View image in fullscreenFans in Las Vegas for Álvarez v Crawford, being marketed as a ‘once in a lifetime event’.Photograph: Candice Ward/Getty Images for NetflixDuring Arreola’s time away from “Team Canelo”, between 2019 and 2023, two members of the camp, both coached by Reynoso, failed drug tests.In 2019, the former flyweight world champion Julio Cesar Martínez failed a doping test for clenbuterol, like Álvarez, but avoided suspension after authorities accepted that he had also consumed contaminated meat in Mexico. Last year, Martínez was banned for nine months after failing another drug test.In 2021, the two-time world ­champion Óscar Valdez tested positive for the stimulant phentermine, but he avoided a suspension after it was accepted that he had consumed herbal tea containing the drug.Last May, shortly after joining “Team Canelo”, the former world champion Jaime Munguía tested positive for testosterone. He was cleared last week by the relevant commissions, which said the result was caused by contaminated dietary supplements. Arreola says he has never worked with Munguía.Crawford’s nutritional adviser,Victor Conte, who was jailedfor his part in the Balco doping scandal that brought down the multiple Olympic champion Marion Jones and has since become an anti-doping advocate, has appealed for Álvarez to publish his drug test results in the buildup to the fight, while proclaiming his ­client is clean.Álvarez and Reynoso did not reply to requests for comment about ­Arreola’s Radical Nutrition business.Explore more on these topicsBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezMexicoTerence CrawfordShareReuse this content"

It has been a whirlwind week for the 60-year-old who has replaced Nuno Espírito Santo and it will be fascinating to see what changes are made to the team’s style. Nuno is a cautious coach and would have plotted a counterattacking approach at the Emirates Stadium, but there are no guarantees with Postecoglou. Pragmatism is a word rarely associated with the Australian but he needs to get his players onside quickly after the unfortunate departure of his predecessor, whowas not dismissed for footballing reasons. It might make more sense to tweak what has already been constructed on strong foundations, especially considering he will have little time with the squad after international duty and before a Saturday lunchtime kick-off. Being able to adapt is a sign of strength in a coach and Postecoglou needs to show he has learned from errors made at Tottenham when he refused to change.Will UnwinArsenal vNottingham Forest, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)View image in fullscreenThe Ange Postecoglou era begins at Nottingham Forest with a trip to the Emirates Stadium.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA2Senesi offers Petrovic welcome stabilityDjordje Petrovic was on the other end of England’s excellence during the international break, watchingfive goals go past himin Belgrade. But Serbia’s No 1 will return to a more stable defence on Saturday, with Bournemouth aiming for their third clean sheet in a row. It’s tidy work from a side that had their backline gutted in the transfer window, with European giants swooping in for Milos Kerkez (Liverpool), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid) and Illia Zabarnyi (Paris Saint-Germain). Petrovic has replaced Kepa Arrizabalaga, while the other new arrivals Bafodé Diakité and Adrien Truffert have slotted in at centre-half and left-back respectively. But a more familiar name has also shone. A quad injury derailed Marcos Senesi for much of last season but he has begun brightly this time round, a shutout in thewin over Tottenhamalso including the key pass for Evanilson’s goal. According to Opta, Senesi is second in the league for interceptions and clearances. The Argentinian’s task now is to help turn around a poor head-to-head record: Bournemouth have lost five of their past six against Brighton.Taha HashimBournemouth v Brighton, Saturday 3pm3Guéhi’s next steps in the spotlightIt felt like goodbye. Marc Guéhi scored in what was expected to be his final Crystal Palace appearance, a whipping strike in the3-0 victory at Villa Park. Then came the drama of deadline day and thecollapse of Guéhi’s move to Liverpool, with Oliver Glasner keeping hold of his captain for the time being. Since then he’s been with England, adding a first international goal to his record and strengthening his case to be a World Cup starter. Guéhi has garnered plenty of praise for remaining committed on the field while awaiting a prospective transfer, to which there should be a Roy Keane-style rebuttal: well, that is his job. The 25-year-old begins another stage of his career against a Sunderland side who would gladly take a repeat of their last trip to Selhurst Park: they were 4-0 victors there in February 2017 thanks to a Jermain Defoe double.THCrystal Palace v Sunderland, Saturday 3pm4Emery must steer Martínez back on trackIt was a fun deadline day for Unai Emery andAston Villa. Victor Lindelöf, Jadon Sancho and Harvey Elliott all moved to Villa Park but another important bit of business was carried out. Emiliano Martínez will be staying at the club despite batting his eyelids at potential suitors. The job for Emery now is to reintegrate him into the side, because he is an elite performer and the best goalkeeper available to him, but others may be uncertain about his attitude. Martínez does his best work on the pitch and a show of faith from Emery – as well as the chance to shine after missing two out of Villa’s three opening fixtures – could get the relationship back on track.WUEverton v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez (right) applauds the Aston Villa fans after their defeat at Brentford.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters5Silva should be patient with new wing wizardsMarco Silva did not see significant reinforcements arrive until the final day of the transfer window. It was a slow summer for Fulham but they acted before the deadline, signing Samuel Chukwueze and Kevin. Silva wanted wide players; now he has two new ones to compete with Harry Wilson, Emile Smith Rowe, Adama Traoré and Alex Iwobi. Kevin has joined from Shakhtar Donetsk and Chukwueze, once a target for Chelsea, has come from Milan on loan. They should both add quality to Silva’s squad, although it would be a surprise if they start against Leeds at Craven Cottage. Silva has a settled dressing room and he will probably want to give the two newcomers time to adjust to thePremier League.Jacob SteinbergFulham v Leeds, Saturday 3pm6Will Howe reshape his attacking setup?Two strikers do not fit into Eddie Howe’s preferred 4-3-3 system so, unless Newcastle’s manager switches formation, one of his new attacking signings may need to begin on the bench. The £55m DR Congo forward Yoane Wissa could begin life in the No 9 shirt as a substitute after a late return from international duty in Africa. A feasible alternative could be to switch to a 4-2-3-1 setup and deploy fellow new arrival Nick Woltemade as a No 10, while fielding Joelinton as the left-sided attacker. That, though, would mean sacrificing a winger. Much here may hinge on whether Jørgen Strand Larsen features in the Wolves starting XI. Howe tried to bring in the Norway striker before turning his attentions to Woltemade and will doubtless be hoping Strand Larsen fails to recover from a minor achilles injury in time to show him precisely what he missed out on. After the collection of only two points from their opening three matches, Newcastle could do with a restorative win before Thursday’s Champions League opener against Barcelona.Louise Taylorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An unsurprising development. The striker was unavailable for most of last season and is facing another spell on the sidelines after leaving the Germany camp early because of a calf problem. West Ham were foolish to sign him. Füllkrug’s fitness record is unreliable and he is a doubt to face Tottenham. There could be an opportunity for Callum Wilson instead, although he might have started anyway given that he impressed after coming on for Füllkrug and scoring during West Ham’swin over Nottingham Forestlast month. Wilson has also had injury problems before leaving Newcastle but he is an experienced Premier League player and looked sharp, strong and dangerous against Forest. His nous around the penalty box could come in handy against Spurs.JSWest Ham v Tottenham, Saturday 5.30pm8Garnacho may be shiniest Chelsea teacupThere is a new kid on the block at Stamford Bridge in the form of Alejandro Garnacho. He was eager to get out ofManchester Unitedthis summer and find a club that more suited his needs. Like many members of “bomb squads” waiting on moves away, the Argentinian needs to catch up on fitness after zero pre-season games. There is also a healthy competition for places, so he will not walk into the Chelsea team. Enzo Maresca hoards wingers like others do teacups sent by distant relatives but the head coach also knows that Garnacho, given the right training and discipline, could be the best in the cupboard. It will be a fine balancing act when it comes to giving him the right opportunities, but Garnacho will be desperate to prove himself after a tumultuous year and Brentford is a good place to start.WUBrentford v Chelsea, Saturday 8pmView image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho and friends watch Chelsea’s win over Fulham at Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Paul Phelan/ProSports/Shutterstock9Isak needs time to bed in at LiverpoolAfter missing pre-season through protest, Alexander Isak got his way and made the move to Liverpool. The Premier League championspaid a record sumto acquire the striker but it might take time for him to get up to speed. The Sweden international did not feature against Slovenia for his national team, spending the match as an unused substitute, but he did come on in the 2-0 loss to Kosovo, making it an underwhelming start to the season for Isak. Liverpool have plenty of matches to ease Isak into his new surroundings and are helped by being the only team with a perfect start to the campaign, with three wins in as many games. Starting at Turf Moor looks unlikely for Isak but coming off the bench is almost a certainty. Patience may be required before Liverpool see the same effectiveness he brought to Newcastle, however.WUBurnley vLiverpool, Sunday 2pm10Injuries hit both sides before tense derbyManchester City will definitely be without Rayan Cherki, andalmost certainly Omar Marmoush, for Sunday’s derby. Savinho and Phil Foden are doubts too, so Pep Guardiola’s forward line may struggle for potency. One question, then, for the manager at Friday’s media conference is whether he regrets Jack Grealish’s loan to Everton. Another is why Manchester City are pointless since the4-0 opening weekend winat Wolves. From the red side of town, the ever beleaguered Ruben Amorim will arrive at the Etihad Stadium with his Manchester United side a point better off than their neighbours. Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are injury concerns for United, who for all the obvious reasons will begin this 197th derby as underdogs. If it is not a draw, expect inquests to start up instantly at the final whistle into the losing manager and his team.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3492Chelsea3673Arsenal3564Tottenham Hotspur3465Everton3266Sunderland3267AFC Bournemouth3068Crystal Palace3359Man Utd30410Nottm Forest3-1411Brighton3-1412Leeds3-4413Man City31314Burnley3-2315Brentford3-2316West Ham3-4317Newcastle3-1218Fulham3-2219Aston Villa3-4120Wolverhampton3-60Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolArsenalManchester CityManchester UnitedTottenham HotspurChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The second leg is at Leigh Sports ­Village next Thursday.Trouble in paradise: How Barcelona’s crisis left women’s team short of playersRead moreUnited must overturn that ­deficit if they are to join Chelsea and the ­holders, Arsenal, in the new league phase of the competition that starts next month.“We were the better team, but we didn’t win the game,” their manager, Marc Skinner, told MUTV. ‘We lost on a set-piece, which is something we’ve just got to be more aggressive in the box to attack.“But it’s half-time. Brann are now celebrating like they’ve won the tie, so let’s see when they come back to Leigh. We were the better team, but we need to be more clinical and of course we need to defend that one situation a lot, lot better.”The defeat capped off an already strange trip for United, who were left scrambling after some of the ­players’ boots went missing in ­transit. The whereabouts of the missing boots – first reported by Reuters – are ­understood to remain a mystery, but the club managed to quickly source replacements in time.A Manchester United source said: “A bag containing some of our ­players’ boots went missing during the ­journey to Bergen. We are investigating how this happened. In the meantime, we have secured new boots for all the affected players, and they are ready to ­participate as normal.”View image in fullscreenBrann’s players celebrate after beating Manchester United in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier.Photograph: Paul S Amundsen/EPAEven if that rather curious ­incident had not made the following gag rather tempting, it would already have been fair to assess this match by stating that United had left their shooting boots at home. They created chance after chance, but could not find a way past an inspired Selma Panengstuen in the Brann goal. Quite how United did not score at least two or three goals will surely be beyond them.The early stages of the first half included Elisabeth Terland ­heading wide from an Anna Sandberg cross and a Terland shot deflected off ­target, before United started to go close.After a good run from Jess Park, their deadline-day signing from Manchester City, a lively Ella Toone had a deflected shot superbly saved. Terland headed over from a ­testing Toone cross and the England ­midfielder then went close herself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 31-year-old was born in Melbourne to Australian parents before moving to England at the age of six.Leicestershire promoted, Surrey v Warwickshire and more: county cricket, day four – liveRead moreRobson has combined tennis punditry with senior roles in administration sinceretiring due to the wrist and hip injuriesthat troubled her throughout her career. After two years as the tournament director of the WTA 250 event at Nottingham she was appointed to the same position at the Queen’s Club this year, taking charge of the first women’s tournament at the London venue in over 50 years.TNT is expected to use a combination of Robson’s colour and reportage from Australia, the local commentary feed and their own pundits in the studio for its coverage of the series, the third Ashes tour in succession it or its predecessor BT Sport has covered live.Robson was used as a courtside reporter by Sky at this month’s US Open and was live on air before last Sunday’s final when Donald Trump’s arrival in Arthur Ashe Stadium led to boos from the crowd.Alastair Cook is being lined up to provide expert punditry from the studio as the former England captain is not due to travel to Australia with the BBC’s Test Match Special, with the TNT regular Kate Mason expected to present.

She had injured her hamstring yet again during an eight-hour round trip to Windsor Castle to collect her MBE. There were tears and mood swings. Emotional ups and downs.She was the Olympic 800m champion. Britain’s golden girl. And it looked as if 2025 was a write off.“I think I was a bit fiery at that time,” says a laughing Hodgkinson, with an honesty that is every bit as blistering as her running. “I put my heart and soul into this. I’ve spent all my life doing it. For that to be taken away was definitely quite challenging.”Sebastian Coe hails ‘mahogany hard’ Keely Hodgkinson and calls Gout Gout ‘real deal’Read moreThings got so bad, she says, that her coaches, Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, who were away on the European circuit helping other athletes in their M11 track club, resorted to an unorthodox method to boost her spirits.“They would get told I had unpredictable mood swings. Some days I’d walk in and I’d be really happy. On other days it’d be like, don’t talk to me.“Trevor got me one of those Himalayan salt lamps. It is as big as my head. He was like: ‘Oh, I’ve got you something.’ Because his sister owns a crystal shop, and I’m into crystals and spirituality.”There are plenty of sceptics when it comes to the lamps, whether they do help create a calming atmosphere and improve mood. But around the same time, Painter also turned to hard science by persuading Nike to stump up funds for a full-time physiotherapist. It would turn out to be a gamechanger.Hodgkinson’s problems, they discovered, were being caused by her back. Suddenly a load was lifted off body and mind. “I have always struggled with a tight back,” says Hodgkinson. “But now I’m lifting a bit heavier and running faster, it puts more pressure on it.View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson wins Olympic 800m gold in Paris last year.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“My body’s in a good place at the moment. I am a bit heavier. In the gym, I’ve put on a couple of kilograms since Paris last year. But funnily enough, it hasn’t slowed me down. I think it’s made me more powerful.”It certainly looks that way: 376 days after she won gold in Paris, Hodgkinson returned in August byrunning 1min 54.74sec in a Diamond Leagueevent in Silesia, the ninth-fastest time in history, following it up with a 1.55four days later in Lausanne.“I was so focused on just making a start line the whole year that once I’d finally done it, I was exhausted after Silesia,” she says. “Mentally, physically, emotionally. So I was so happy with how Lausanne went, considering the weather and everything that we had been through, to back it up with a 1.55.”Hodgkinson is the overwhelming favourite for the 800m in theWorld Athletics Championships. It has been quite some turnaround given where she was when she injured her hamstring for the second time in May, having suffered similar problems in May and after Paris.“Getting an MBE was amazing,” she says. “It was an incredible day. Going down and experiencing that was so good. But it messed with my back.“ I always think things happen for a reason. Me sat in a car for eight hours? I should be able to survive that. When [my body] didn’t, it was clearly telling me that something was wrong.“That second injury definitely broke my heart a little bit. I was very down after that one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wanted to be on the start line wearing my new Nike kit in the Olympic colourway. I’d worked so hard to get and be announced as an Olympic champion. I waited a whole year to do that. And in June I was unsure if I’d make the plane here.“I was touch and go. But going to Portugal, and being in the heat, brought on my running. It’s a bit of a miracle in a way that it’s gone so well.”During the bad times she has faced recently, Hodgkinson also coped by talking to her psychologist, processing her anger and frustration. But while she worked tirelessly to get herself back to fitness, social media trolls would attack her whenever she posted pictures of herself at an event.“People were assuming I was doing nothing,” she says. “And when you’re in a bad place anyway, negative comments stick out to you more. The human brain naturally looks for negativity, and what people think, even when it’s so far from reality. I like the block button. That’s my favourite.”View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson pulls away from the field in the 800m at the Lausanne Diamond League meeting in August.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPAThe carpers and critics of social media are long in the rearview mirror. “It’s been quite a journey to get back here, but I wouldn’t change it,” she says. “Going through it was probably one of the best things that could happen to me.“It’s character-building. It’s taught me a lot about myself. I’ve had a lot of time to process everything that happened and I feel like a better version of me.”Something else has changed since the Paris Olympics: the weight of expectation no longer ties her down in the same way. “Nothing could be worse than last year,” she says. “That was so much pressure. I feel like I’ve gone above that now. I’ve experienced it and I know how to deal with it.So what does she make of carrying Britain’s hopes on her shoulders once again in Tokyo? “I have to walk away with the gold and hopefully I will,” she says.  “But I don’t have any feeling of pressure this year. I’m chilling.”Explore more on these topicsKeely HodgkinsonWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsOlympic GamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reed, who has missed out on what would have been a fourth Ryder Cup appearance at Bethpage, also said Europe carry the advantage of having the more closely knit team.US players plus their captain, Keegan Bradley, will be given $500,000 (£368,300) – $300,000 (£221,000) of which must be donated to charity – for taking on Luke Donald’s Europe. The remaining $200,000 (£147,320) has been labelled a stipend. The topic was largely lost in fevered discussion over whether or notBradley would pick himself as a playerbut remains hugely significant. Europe’s contingent have always been adamant they will not seek monetary reward for Ryder Cup appearances.Tyrrell Hatton reveals waking in pool of vomit after making Ryder Cup teamRead moreReed, once nicknamed Captain America for his theatrics in the Ryder Cup, falls on the side of the Europeans in this debate. “I never played in that event and cared about playing it for money,” said the former Masters champion. “It was all about playing, representing my country and trying to win the cup. It’s just like playing in the Olympics; once every four years and it just means something to go out there and play for your country. There’s no dollar amount that I would want to play in a Ryder Cup or play in an Olympics.“I really think it is unnecessary. There are certain events that money means absolutely nothing and that’s one of them. If you’re going to give money to players, have it all go to their charity or something like that. Do something good with it.”Reed was speaking after an opening round of 69 at Wentworth’s PGA Championship. On regular trips to this side of the Atlantic, he has observed the bond between European players.“They’re all eating together,” Reed said. “The actual brotherhood and camaraderie out here, you don’t really have in the States. Here, you’re jumping country to country, not state to state. So travel just comes out that much harder.“I feel like they play a lot of team golf over here, growing up and everything. We don’t, even though you’re playing high school, college, there’s not a lot of team format. It’s go out, play individual. You count four, five scores and you move on. That’s definitely an edge that they have over here, the camaraderie and the tightness of the group. But I feel like we’ve recognised that in the US, and we’re working on it.”View image in fullscreenMatt Fitzpatrick benefited from children appearing to run off with a golf ball he had hit into the bushes.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockTom Vaillant and Ludvig Åberg set the early pace in Surrey with eight-under par 64s.

So we called over a referee and explained the situation and asked whether we should look for the ball then, rather than risk it being taken.“He took us over to the crowd where we reckoned my ball would have landed. A few people there said they’d seen two young boys dive into the bushes and come out grinning with a golf ball. So we decided the balance of probability was that it was my ball, and that I would take a drop in that spot when we got back.“I made a six but if I’d had to play my provisional ball it could have been worse. So those two little thieves who made off with my ball probably saved me a shot.” Fitzpatrick signed for a 66.

Leeds’ players retreated down the tunnel for an unexpected postmortem and by the time they returned, this grand old ground had emptied. It wasn’t supposed to be like this; a night which was supposed to be straightforward and lead to bigger and brighter things panned out in a way few would have imagined.The end result? Leeds were 80 minutes away from securing at least one home playoff game for the first time in eight seasons, and the fight to finish second and get that all-important bye through the opening week of the playoffs would go to the final round. Now? The Rhinos may have already played their last home game of 2025.Ambitious investors want to power London Broncos to Super LeagueRead moreShould results pan out a certain and not improbable way in the final eight days of the season, Leeds will finish a season that has been full of progression, hope and great optimism under Brad Arthur as low as fifth. That would mean an away tie in week one, and the prospect of a trip to the league leaders, Hull KR, in week two just to reach a Grand Final.Leeds have made huge strides under Arthur but this was undisputedly their nadir. Many expected them to saunter past Catalans – whose own playoff hopes were over weeks ago – with minimal fuss. Perhaps some of their own players bought into that hype too, because Leeds looked laboured, sluggish and way off the standards we have come to expect.“We were in positions where we could win the game but we find ways to lose them,” Arthur lamented post-match. “I felt like tonight, a few guys tried a bit too hard. We got a lot of moments wrong, a lot of big plays wrong and a lot of execution wrong.”There can also be no doubting that Leeds lacked the influence and presence of their talismanic half-back, Jake Connor, too.A minor rib injury robbed Leeds of their star man for the first time this season and goodness, his influence – or lack of – was felt here. Without Connor, the Rhinos lacked any level of composure with the ball and a cutting-edge he has so often provided. Catalans, in truth, didn’t have to be brilliant in attack to win.That said, their defensive display deserved immense credit. Having struggled for most of this year, this was a performance that suggested their new head coach, Joel Tomkins, has something to work with going into 2026. “I know it’s been in us but I thought tonight was a special effort,” Tomkins said.His side deservedly led 8-0 by the break to stun the home crowd. The only try came when Ugo Tison spotted a gap in the Leeds ruck to cross from dummy-half, before Guillermo Aispuro-Bichet added a penalty as half-time approached. In truth, Leeds mustered up nothing of any note.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not even a run of four straight penalties and a sinbinning for Romain Navarrete could help the Rhinos over the line but they eventually found a glimmer of hope as Brodie Croft’s kick found Ryan Hall unmarked in the corner.However, with six minutes left, Luke Keary forced a crucial error from the Leeds full-back, Lachie Miller, which afforded Navarrete a simple finish to put the game beyond the hosts. Croft’s try shortly after proved to be too little, too late: but by then, many of the home supporters had already begun to stream for the exits.Arthur had spoken effusively this week about how all associated with the Rhinos deserved the chance to stage a playoff game for the first time in nearly a decade. It is out of their hands. If it wasn’t thrilling enough already, the race to jockey for positions going into the playoffs is now set for a gripping conclusion.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueLeeds RhinosCatalans DragonsRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

If someone was stronger than me, I will just say ‘chapeau’.”Nobody was stronger, though the Australian Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) came close, finishing one second off the Italian to take second place, with his teammate Almeida a further seven seconds behind, and now 40 seconds off Vingegaard.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

For the moment at least, the blue-and-white silks of the Brighton chair, Tony Bloom, are giving their opponents the runaround.Santorini Star, a four-year-old filly making the step up from handicaps to Group Two company in the Park Hill Stakes, was a fourth winner in six days for Bloom and his partner, Ian McAleavy, on Thursday.Strike day with a dress code as racing descends on London to make case against tax changesRead moreIt is a golden run of form that has already banked more than £150,000 in prize money and the manner of Santorini Star’s win was hugely encouraging with future targets in mind. William Haggas’s front-running filly showed impressive grit to regain the initiative after a brief moment two out when she faced challengers on either side. Half a furlong later, though, she was back in front and she stayed on strongly to the line to beat Consent by a neck.“She comes off the bridle quite early, but you never really feel in trouble,” said Tom Marquand, the winner’s jockey. “I always feel like the first flick you give her will give you a good indication of what she’s going to do. I gave her that first flick today and I thought the Prescott filly [Consent] would have to be good to beat her.“It was a big step up from a handicap win at York, but she’s really finding her mojo and her legs now. She’s gone up a big notch to win a Group Two and there are plenty of options for her over a mile and six [furlongs] or two miles or even further if you wanted to.”An immediate target for Santorini Star remains undecided, but she could be one to follow in Cup races next year according to Sean Graham, Bloom and McAleavy’s racing manager. “She won over two miles last time and it was a concern coming back to a mile and six and a half,” he said.“I don’t know what plans William has for her this year, but you’d like to think she could turn into a Cup filly next year. Tom said she kept finding, put her head down and didn’t stop and that’s what you need.”Bloom and McAleavy will hope to extend their winning run to Sunday’s Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh, where their unbeaten two-year-old filly, Venetian Sun, will set off near the head of the market.Karl Burke, Venetian Sun’s trainer, will also head into the weekend in winning form as he took the May Hill Stakes, the main supporting race on the card, with Aylin, who is part-owned by Joorabchian in partnership with Al Shaqab Racing.“She was very well and very fit,” Burke said. “I don’t know if you’ll improve much on fitness with her and it’s just a question of whether she can hold her form for another month and we can run her in one of the Group Ones.”Soumillon to strike with Mission CentralChristophe Soumillon has drawn a blank from six rides since being drafted in to replace the injured Ryan Moore as Aidan O’Brien’s temporary No 1 rider, but Mission Central should get him off the mark in his stand-in role when he lines up for the Flying Childers Stakes at Doncaster on Friday, the feature race on day two of the St Leger Festival.The Flying Childers is one of two Group Two events for juveniles in Britain O’Brien has yet to win. It is clearly not a race that figures prominently in his race-planning as he has saddled four runners this century and none since 2017. O’Brien is double-handed this time around, however, with Kansas, the winner of one of his six starts, also in the field, but Mission Central has more scope for improvement after three outings and put up a useful effort to win a Group Three at the Curragh last time out.Lady Iman, the Molecomb winner at Glorious Goodwood in July, is the top-rated runner on Timeform ratings, but she needs to bounce back from a lacklustre performance in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York three weeks ago.

Three of them – Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major – have claimed more than £1m in the last decade.The scheme, which is used to subsidise the private offices of ex-PMs, is coming under intense scrutiny after a leak of data from the Office ofBoris Johnson.Cabinet Office rules stipulate that the former prime ministers must not use these public funds for private or commercial activities. The payments are only intended to help them to continue contributing to public life.However, the Guardian has published a series of stories based on the leaked data, which was obtained by the US non-profitDistributed Denial of Secrets(DDoS), that suggest Johnson’s office has been involved in widespread commercial work.Graphic showing who received payments in 2023-24His office staff have helped vet and arrange more than 34 speeches, raising more than £5m in total, secure lucrative media contracts and work on business ventures in Venezuela, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.Johnson has claimed £182,000 since leaving government to pay for staff salaries in the private office. He has not responded directly to the dozens of questions about his business activities but denied his office had misused the subsidy scheme.“This story is rubbish,” he said, adding that the subsidy “has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.” Cross-party senior politicians have called for Johnson’s taxpayer support to be investigated after the revelations.Five other former prime ministers, Brown and Blair as well as David Cameron, Theresa May and Liz Truss, have released statements confirmingthey fully comply with rules prohibiting the use of public fundsfor private business.The revelations have thrown the spotlight on the little-known scheme, known as the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), which was set up in 1991. It was introduced, according to the Cabinet Office, to“assist former prime ministers still active in public life”.Payments disbursed under the scheme “are made only to meet the actual cost of continuing to fulfil public duties. The costs are a reimbursement of incurred expenses for necessary administrative costs arising from their special position in public life.”The payments are generally used to pay staff to run an office, for example replying to correspondence, handling requests for interviews and arranging official visits.Major, while prime minister, set up the scheme in 1991 after allies of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, let it be known that she was struggling as a backbench MP. She had been ousted from Downing Street the previous year and reportedly found life difficult without secretaries and other aides.Graphic showing how much former PMs have claimedBy piecing together figures from Cabinet Office annual reports and parliamentary answers, the Guardian has established that overall, the scheme has cost taxpayers at least £9.9m. In today’s figures, after adjusting for inflation, that total equates to more than £14m.This is, however, an underestimate, as the government appears not to have published the annual cost of the scheme for six of the years it has been active.Former PMs can claim up to £115,000 a year. This cap has been frozen since 2011. However, the annual cost has soared in recent years as more of them have claimed the subsidy, amid a rapid turnover of Conservative prime ministers in recent years.They include Truss. She served for only 49 days, but the 50-year-old nonetheless qualifies for the PDCA allowance for the rest of her life – a total which is likely to run into millions. She has so far claimed £125,000.Seven former PMs are currently claiming money from the scheme, compared with five who were eligible when it was established in the early 1990s.In total, adjusting for inflation, ex-prime ministers claimed £858,000 in 2023-24, the latest available figures, up from £464,000 a decade earlier, and £337,000 in 1997-98. Blair and Major have claimed the highest totals since 2006 – £1.9m and £2m respectively – as they have almost always requested the maximum amount each year. Brown’s total is under these two, as his claims are usually under the maximum cap, and he left Downing Street more recently.Graphic showing historic PDCA allowanceAfter the Guardian’s revelations, Brown is calling for the rules to be tightened up to require former prime ministers to publicly declare their business interests. His spokesperson said: “Mr Brown favours former prime ministers being subject to public declarations of their business interests and has called for a stronger code on business appointments.”Cameron has received £780,000 from the subsidy scheme since he left Downing Street in 2016. The rules meant that he did not submit claims while he had a spell as foreign secretary in Rishi Sunak’s administration.May’s claims total nearly £400,000. Major and Sunak, who is understood not to claim the allowance, did not respond to requests for comment.In a quirk that has not been fully explained, Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister between 2010 and 2015, was given the right to claim PDCA funds from the scheme even though he never held the top job. He received a total of £445,000 over four years. In 2018, the last year he claimed the allowance, he became president of global affairs and communications at Meta, theowner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, where he was paid millions.This article was amended on 11 September 2025. An earlier version said published data on public duty cost allowances (PDCA) was incomplete before 2013; in fact it has been brought to our attention that there were public records beyond the ones analysed by the Guardian going back to 2006. The article and graphics have therefore been updated to reflect the additional available data. The headline, which had referred to “more than £8m” being spent on PDCA subsidies, was also amended accordingly.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We have a clear zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials.”The complaint describes Uber’s alleged mistreatment of 17 individuals.They include JE, a seven-year-old amputee from the Bronx, New York, who was allegedly denied a ride home from his brother’s birthday party after an Uber driver looked at his wheelchair and asked: “Is that coming?”Another was Jason Ludwig, a Gulf war veteran with a service dog, who was allegedly denied a ride to the Norfolk airport in Virginia from Newport News, missed his flight, and had to drive 16 hours home to Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts.A third rider, Jeff Clark of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, allegedly had four drivers in Philadelphia cancel rides in a 17-minute period after he told them he was blind and used a guide dog.The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring further ADA violations.

The Guardian could not independently confirm her release.In return for Lukashenko’s prisoner release, the US will ease sanctions on Belarus’s national airline, Belavia, allowing it to service and buy parts for its Boeing aircraft fleet, a spokesperson for the US embassy in Vilnius said.Belarus state agencies also cited John Coale, a lawyer who led the American delegation, as saying thatDonald Trumphad told Lukashenko that Washington wants to reopen its embassy in Minsk.View image in fullscreenThe president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, with the US presidential envoy John Coale.Photograph: Belarus President Press Service/EPASince Trump took office, Lukashenko has repeatedly met with US officials and has spoken to the US president over the phone.A Trump administration official said that the US welcomed the release of political prisoners by Belarus and said that the White House would continue to seek to free the nearly 1,300 remaining political prisoners in Belarus.The official also said that the US delegation to Minsk headed by Coale would address regional security issues, including ending the weaponisation of illegal migration from Belarus into neighbouring Nato countries.Observers say Lukashenko is trying to capitalise on Trump’s desire to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, casting himself as a mediator between Washington and Moscow while at the same time seeking to shore up his own power amid his fears that Belarus’s sovereignty could be swallowed by an increasingly assertiveRussia.“Our main task is to stand with Trump and help him in his mission to establish peace,” Lukashenko said on Thursday, referencing Trump’s claim that he has solved six or seven world conflicts.Trump, for his part, has described the Belarusian leader as “highly respected,” in a sharp break with European efforts to isolate Lukashenko after his brutal crackdown on dissent following the widely condemned 2020 presidential election.In June, a visit to Minsk by the US presidential envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg was followed by therelease of Syarhei Tsikhanouski, a prominent opposition figure jailed for nearly five years after mobilising anti-Lukashenko protests before 2020’s poll.While Belarusian opposition figures in exile have welcomed the recent wave of political releases, they argue that Lukashenko remains firmly aligned with Moscow and is using the political prisoners as a bargaining chip to burnish his international standing and push for sanctions relief to shore up an economy weakened in recent years.“Today, POTUS & his team secured the release of 52 political hostages in Belarus – 38 Belarusians & 14 foreigners … We are grateful for the strong US leadership … 1,200+ hostages remain – all must be released,” Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of Syarhei, who leads the opposition movement abroad, wrote on X.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Khilo is a Belarusian who had worked at the EU mission in Minsk and was arrested in early 2024 and charged with insulting Lukashenko, according to Politico.Many prominent critics of Lukashenko’s decades-long rule remain behind bars, including the opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova and the human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, a co-winner of the 2022 Nobel peace prize.View image in fullscreenSyarhei Tsikhanouski’s was released hours after Donald Trump’s special envoy met Alexander Lukashenko.Photograph: Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya/X/ReutersEven as it frees groups of detainees, the regime continues its crackdown on dissent, handing down prison sentences over something as minor as past social media posts critical of the government.Just this week, a Russian prisoner held on what critics described as politically motivated charges died in custody under unclear circumstances.It is ahighly tense moment for the region, just a day after Poland shot down suspected Russian drones over its territory and on the eve of the Zapad joint military exercises between the Russian and Belarusian armed forces.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said some of the drones that violated Polish airspace had, for the first time, entered from Belarusian territory. Seeking to deflect blame, Belarus’s chief of the general staff, Pavel Muraveiko, claimed Minsk had warned Poland and Lithuania of drones approaching their borders and had even shot some down.Despite Belarus’s continued support for Russia’s war, the US move to ease sanctions on Thursday suggests Lukashenko is succeeding in manoeuvring between both sides – a tangible win for him, analysts said.“I don’t recall a more schizophrenic moment in Belarusian foreign policy,” said Artyom Shraibman, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre. “On 10 September, Russian drones crossed the western border in one direction, while a US delegation crossed in the other, bringing news of aviation sanctions being lifted in exchange for political prisoners.”Explore more on these topicsBelarusAlexander LukashenkoRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It may consider whether to stop or limit his ability to work as a doctor in the UK in the interests of protecting the public.There have been warnings from medical bodies that his “pseudo-science” remarks could undermine trust in doctors.Keir Starmer used prime minister’s questions on Wednesday to hit out at Reform UK and Malhotra, saying: “The man who wrote Reform’s health policy has made shocking and baseless claims that vaccines are linked to cancer and that has been endorsed by Reform.“These dangerous conspiracies cost lives and it shows that Reform can’t be trusted with our NHS.”After being given a prime speaking slot at Reform UK’s conference, Malhotra set out what he said were findings showing that vaccines “created havoc” in the human body.He added that a doctor whom he described as one of Britain’s most eminent oncologists had asked him to share something, adding: “He thinks it’s highly likely that the Covid vaccines have been a factor, a significant factor in the cancer of members of the royal family.”Reform UK has sought to distance the party from the comments made by Malhotra, a British cardiologist who continues to practise in the UK and whose work includes being part of the team involved in a London “bio-hacking” firm offering “longevity solutions”.Malhotra accused Starmer of making “false statements” and said he was fully behind the role of “traditional” vaccines. In relation to Reform UK’s health policy, he said he had had conversations with David Bull, currently the party chair.Bull introduced Malhotra on Saturday as someone who “worked with me to write Reform UK’s health policy”.Malhotra told the Guardian on Wednesday: “There are plenty of political figures who support my position. I also have doctors who thank me for what I am doing.”Dr Jeanette Dickson, the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents doctors professionally, welcomed the GMC’s decision to examine his remarks.“I am not surprised the GMC is reviewing Dr Malhotra’s comments. Two years ago Dr Malhotra was claiming the Covid mRNA vaccine was responsible for excess heart disease. Last weekend he implied a link between the king’s cancer and the same vaccine.“Both propositions have been roundly condemned by experts. We all know this is how conspiracy theories begin, with anti-vaccine theories being particularly pernicious because they can and do save lives.”Malhotra’s action risked jeopardising the public’s widespread and longstanding trust in doctors, Dickson added. “People trust doctors because they practise evidence-based medicine. We cannot afford to diminish that concept with simple-sounding populism in search of a round of applause.”The British Medical Association also criticised Malhotra’s remarks. “It is dangerous and irresponsible to promote pseudo-science or anti-science messages, and give platforms to those who do,” said Dr Tom Dolphin, the BMA’s chair.“On the one hand, remarks like this from a doctor on such a prominent platform risk individual and public health if people take them seriously and avoid vaccines.“On the other, the more outlandish such claims get, the more likely we see reputation and trust in the medical profession undermined.”The GMC investigation relates to a complaint made by a leading doctor that Malhotra had been spreading allegedly “harmful misinformation” about Covid vaccines. The GMCadmitted last yearit had made a mistake not to look into concerns raised about him.However, the GMC, which maintains the official register of all the UK’s medical practitioners, also told the Guardian that it was “aware” of Malhotra’s comments at last weekend’s Reform conference and was considering if it needed to take action.Explore more on these topicsReform UKHealthHealth policyVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet long-term data for individual insect populations is sparse and patchy.A newstudy in the journal Sciencesheds light on what is happening to insects in some of the world’s most distant places. “There is global concern about the ‘insect apocalypse’, but a lot of uncertainty and debate about what is actually happening,” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at Japan’s Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and co-author of the research.“We have a new kind of evidence of something we long suspected: that insect species endemic to remote islands are in decline.”View image in fullscreenA six-spotted tiger beetle (Cicindela sexguttata) in flight in east Texas. About 15% of tiger beetle species in the US are in a state of decline.Photograph: Michael Durham/NPL/AlamyEconomo and his colleagues analysed genomes of ant populations from the Fijian archipelago gathered in recent decades and held in museum collections. From thousands of specimens, they used scientific methods to infer whether ant populations were growing or shrinking based on variations in DNA sequences among individuals.They found that 79% of Fiji’s endemic ant species were in decline, with impacts beginning at the time of humans’ arrival on the islands about 3,000 years ago and speeding up in the past 300 years – coinciding with European contact, global trade and the arrival of modern agriculture.For remote tropical islands where comprehensive historical observations are rare, understanding how insects have been harmed by human activities is hard to ascertain but critically important. Islands are hotspots of biodiversity because of their isolation. This also makes them especially vulnerable to extinctions.“Remote oceanic islands like the Galápagos, Hawaii and Fiji harbour species that evolved in isolation and often have spectacular differences from their mainland relatives,” Economo said.‘Half the tree of life’: ecologists’ horror as nature reserves are emptied of insectsRead moreThe research adds to apatchwork map of findingsfrom the world’s ecosystems. InGermany, the abundance of flying insects across 63 nature reserves has dropped by 75% in less than 30 years. In the US,beetle numbershave plummeted by 83% in 45 years, and about 15% of tiger beetle species there are in decline. Europe’sgrassland butterflypopulation has shrunk by 36% over the past decade.Insect populations are being hammered from all sides as habitat loss, pesticide use, climate breakdown and light pollution all add to the emptying out of the world’s wetlands, forests and grasslands.“We need to look at insects in more places, with more methods, to understand what is happening to insects and other invertebrates,” Economo said.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsInsectsThe age of extinctionFijiAnimalsAsia PacificBiodiversityWildlifePacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is the argument put forward by certain bird conservation groups.The curlew, one of Britain’s most charismatic birds, with its curved beaks and distinctive call, has been disappearing from the countryside, declining by 60% in 25 years. It is just one of a number of ground-nesting birds that is vanishing – research has found that ground nesters are 86% more likely to decline than birds with other nesting strategies.The root of the problem is complex.Farmingpractices such as running heavy machinery down fields to cut grass for silage are partly to blame for the decline. The machines chop up the eggs and chicks hidden in the grass.Country diary: The agony and ecstasy of the curlew song | Mark CockerRead moreBut the additional issue is that the way humans manage the UK countryside has caused a population boom of foxes, crows and other mesopredators in some areas, which is putting ground-nesting birds at risk.Over centuries, most large predators such as eagles, lynx and wolves, which would usually keep the numbers of foxes and crows under control, have been hunted in the UK to extinction or near extinction. Farming practices have meant plentiful food for foxes and crows is left in fields, from crops to animal carcasses, including the tens of millions of fat, domesticated, easy-to-catch pheasants released every year for shooting.These mesopredators like to feed on the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds. So is it time to talk about a fox cull, asks the conservationist and writer Mary Colwell, who runs the charityCurlew Action? She has been campaigning to save the curlew for years, and although she hates the idea of shooting a fox and would never do it herself, she suggests a “serious conversation” needs to be had.Birdwatch: Catch the beauty of the common snipe’s erratic, zigzag takeoffRead more“Curlew chicks and eggs are incredibly vulnerable to the activities that we do on the ground,” she told the Groundswell farming conference earlier this summer. “So when I say curlews have declined by 60% in 25 years, it’s not that the adults are dying. Adults survive really, really well; it’s that they cannot get enough eggs and chicks away to replace the population.”She says an increasing number of conservationists feel culls may be the only solution. “In the UK we have huge numbers of what’s called mesopredators. Every single one of those creatures is an absolutely wonderful bit of Britain’s natural history in its own right. But there are so many now, and the decline of ground-nesting birds is so severe, that the two are coming together to create a catastrophe for ground-nesting creatures. There is a huge agreement on how to protect red-listed birds like curlews, and predator control is absolutely central to that.“I couldn’t do it. I can’t lift a gun and shoot a fox. But I know it needs to be done if we want curlews, and that’s the societal question.”But some disagree that predator control is the answer. Dr Ruth Tingay, co-director of the campaign group Wild Justice, said: “Lethal control of some generalist predatory species will not solve the long-term issue of their over-abundance, which is a direct result of the mismanagement of our countryside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A spokesperson said: “Lethal predator control should always be used as a last resort when other methods have failed. However, non-lethal methods are not always practical or effective and sometimes predator control can be carried out to give populations of ground-nesting birds a lifeline while the main causes of their decline, such as habitat loss, are addressed.”Colwell says people need to ask whether they can bear to shoot these animals to save ground-nesting birds: “It’s not a nature decision, because there’s nothing natural about this country at all. Everything is managed. So yes, if we want these ground-nesting birds, we need a damn sight more predator control than we do at the moment. Are we prepared to do it? And are the NGOs prepared to look their membership in the eye and say, this is what needs to be done? Let’s wait to see. I think there’s been a change, but it’s for all of us to decide, if that’s the price we want to pay.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsWildlifeAnimalsFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

As well as natural hazards and disasters, it will cover chemical, industrial and nuclear accidents and those related to the transport of dangerous materials.More than 8 million children in 25,000 schools will be given the compulsory training, which will be delivered using videos, infographics and other media. Infant and primary school pupils will be given a minimum of two hours of lessons, while older children will receive at least four hours. Spain’s self-governing regions will be able to tailor the training to the different risks they face.“Infant school children aged three, four and five, will learn to recognise an alarm and how to spot the first signs of danger, as well as basic safety principles,” the ministry said in a statement. “Older children will learn to seek out high ground in a flood and to shelter under a desk if the earth starts to shake.”It said students would also be taught about “the differences between information and disinformation in emergency situations”.View image in fullscreenA wildfire in the Cualedro municipality of Galicia in north-west Spain.

The party hasbanned new North Sea oil and gas projects.The founder of Ecotricity spoke out a week after his fellow green entrepreneur Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy anda Cabinet Office adviser, backed calls to restart North Sea drilling.The Labour party swept to power in 2024 with a pledge tohalt new drilling licences in the North Sea, and it plans to keep the windfall tax imposed during rocketing oil and gas prices in place until 2030.Vince said the government should scrap the windfall tax and instead offer subsidies to oil companies that guarantee a minimum price for the barrels of oil and gas they produce.“Our North Sea is in decline, let’s protect it during the transition and optimise our use of the resources that are left,” he said. “It’s time for Labour to put its arms around the North Sea and support operators with existing licences. Putting fossil fuels on an equal footing with renewables by giving them a stable price is the key to a just transition.”View image in fullscreenDale Vince: ‘Our North Sea is in decline. Let’s protect it during the transition and optimise our use of the resources that are left.’Photograph: Simon Marper/PAOffshore Energies UK, which represents the North Sea industry, declined to comment on whether Vince’s proposals would be welcomed by oil and gas companies. A government spokesperson said the proposal was “not under consideration. We are driving forward our mission to become a clean energy superpower, to cut bills for good.”They added: “We are delivering a fair and orderly transition in the North Sea to drive growth and secure tens of thousands of skilled jobs, with the biggest ever investment in offshore wind and three first-of-a-kind carbon capture and storage clusters.”Jackson said last week that relying on North Sea oil and gas would have a smaller climate impact than relying on costly imports from the US and the Middle East, which release more emissions during production and transportation than homegrown fossil fuels.“When we’re shipping LNG, liquefied natural gas, around the world, it is a lot dirtier than using locally produced gas,” Jackson told the Telegraph. “British gas producers won’t be selling it any cheaper than the global market. But it is cleaner and it reduces the backlash against climate policy. I’ve got no problem with it.”The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there needed to beno new fossil fuel projectsif the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050.However, the global energy watchdog later clarified that continued investment in existing oil and gas supply would be “essential” in a net zero scenario to ensure that oil and gas supply does not fall faster than the decline in demand.The green industry leaders’ comments on the North Sea come amid growing pressure from opposition parties to back the industry, whichsupports about 130,000 jobsand contributed more than £6bn in tax receipts to the government in the last financial year and £9bn the year before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reform UK has also promised to reverse Labour’s banas a “day one” priorityif it comes to power.The Guardian reported over the summer that senior government advisers had told North Sea investors thatnew drilling could still move aheaddespite the election promise to ban it, provided the projects were close to existing pipeline infrastructure and did not extend into “greenfield” areas.“Myself and a number of colleagues have been told that the government is moving towards the idea of allowing new licences,” one energy investor said.The source said that while Treasury officials were open to considering future North Sea oil and gas projects, the plans were unlikely to be well received by Ed Miliband, the secretary of state of the Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero.Miliband reportedly refused to leave his post in Keir Starmer’s reshuffle last week.

There were multiple occasions where this could’ve been prevented.“Why did the agencies involved not speak to each other? How many others are out there like him? This can’t happen again.”The girl, who can only be identified as Child C6, is the only child witness to give evidence to the Southport inquiry.The hearings, led by the retired senior judge Sir Adrian Fulford, are examining the failures to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and the attempted murder of eight other girls and two adults on 29 July last year.View image in fullscreenBebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar, who were killed in the attack.Photograph: Merseyside Police/PAOccasionally breaking to stop the tears, the girl described how she had agreed to help and take pictures of the Taylor Swift-themed dance class, which her younger sister attended along with 25 other children.The room was filled with “laughter and excitement” on what “felt like it was going to be a perfect day” at the start of the school holidays, she recalled. Then everything changed and it “turned into a living nightmare”.The girl said she was facing the door of the studio when Rudakubana, then 17, walked in minutes before the workshop was due to end.“At first I thought it must be some sort of joke, like this couldn’t actually be happening,” she said.“But I saw him in his green hoodie, with the face mask on, and I looked at his eyes. He looked possessed. He didn’t look human.“I saw him stab someone in front of me and realised that he was going to hurt us all. Then I saw him coming towards me.”The teenager was stabbed in her arm and then her back as she turned to run. The force of the blows broke two of her back bones and collapsed a lung.She became separated from her little sister in the chaos: “I didn’t know where my sister was and that scared me more than anything. I will never forget the fear, the panic or the way I felt wondering if we were going to survive.”Breaking into tears, the girl said her little sister had been best friends with Alice, who managed to escape the building alive but died in hospital from her injuries.“[My sister] still has nightmares,” she said. “I worry about her safety a lot, I need to know that she is safe, likewise she needs to know where I am.”She added: “I still have nightmares. I see him coming towards me. I see him hurting others. I hear the screams. I see the blood. It plays like a horror film on repeat.”The girl described how her recovery had left her lonely and alienated from her friends.“I feel under so much pressure, like I am stuck between two worlds,” she said. “I don’t fit with the adults there that day, or with those younger than me. I am somewhere in the middle. I feel isolated, like I don’t fit in anywhere.”The mother of another girl, who can be identified only as Child C5, described her daughter’s “catastrophic” injuries. The youngster lost her entire blood volume at the scene and another 1.5 litres of donor blood in surgery after she was attacked twice as she tried to flee.“She was minutes away from death,” her mother said. “We thank God every day for the Midlands air ambulance crew, whose skill and dedication saved her life.”The girl needed skin grafts on her arm and had her spleen removed, she said, meaning minor infections such as a sore throat could now “put her life in danger”. Fourteen months on from the attack, she wears pressure garments 23 hours a day to heal her scars.Explore more on these topicsSouthport attackCrimeMerseysidePoliceEnglandNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

All those involved in our democratic process should be able to go about their vital work freely and with confidence.”A spokesperson for Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Gateshead South, said she would “not be deterred” and would continue to support her constituents.Northumbria police said they were alerted to the fire at 12.20am on Thursday. They said: “Emergency services attended and no one is reported to have been injured in the incident. A man in his 20s has subsequently been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and arson. He remains in police custody at this time.”View image in fullscreenPolice at the scene in Washington, Sunderland.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAHodgson has been the area’s MP since 2005. A spokesperson said: “An incident occurred overnight at Sharon’s office. We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation. What we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society.“Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out. Constituents should get in touch with their issues by emailing in the usual way.”The fire was at Vermont House, which is also the UK base for a small charity Niemann-Pick UK (NP UK), which supports patients and families with an extremely rare and life-limiting group of genetic diseases.NP UK’s head of communications, John Lee Taggart, said it was suspected that the fire had started in shared bins. “We have been told by the landlord that there’s not much left,” he said. “We have been in operation for 34 years and it is going to be really hard to recover. This is a vital service and we are a small charity.”On its Facebook page, the charity said: “We have been dealing with threats, graffiti and demonstrations targeted at the MP in our office complex for many months, and this appears to be the culmination, although nothing concrete has been ascertained as of yet.”The building is near the A195 and businesses including a Kwik Fit, a Halfords Autocentre and a National Tyres branch. One man said he arrived for work at 7.45am and there were “stacks” of police, but he had no idea the MP had an office there.Aerial images taken using a drone show the charred, destroyed roof of much of the building.At the height of the blaze there were seven crews tackling the fire, a spokesperson for Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service said.They added: “The emergency call was received by our control room at 00.12, and the first crew arrived on Woodland Terrace in Concord within four minutes.“Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used jets and a hose reel to extinguish the fire and worked alongside blue-light colleagues to make the scene safe. No casualties were reported.”The Tyne and Wear chief fire officer, Peter Heath, said: “I want to commend our crews for their swift and professional response to this serious incident. Their actions ensured the fire was contained quickly and safely, with no reported casualties. We continue to work closely with our partners as investigations progress.”Parliamentary colleagues of Hodgson sent their best wishes.In a parliamentary debate, the Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said the thoughts of the whole house were with the MP: “I think particularly in light of international events, and the tragic loss of colleagues, this all the more underlines why we must have security and safety to go about democratic debate in this country, whatever our views, in a safe and secure way.”View image in fullscreenSharon Hodgson speaking in the Commons.Photograph: House of CommonsOn Facebook, the City of Durham Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy wrote: “Sending love and support to my friend Sharon Hodgson MP and her team today after another attack on their office building.“After the shocking murder of a political influencer mere hours ago in the US, MPs in the UK woke to scenes of one of our colleagues’ offices being targeted. No matter which part of the political spectrum you fall into – this is intimidation by thugs and they must face the full force of the law.“Serious thought needs to be given to how this impacts staff in constituency offices, like Sharon’s, who frankly work their arses off every day to support local people.“Anyone supporting this type of violence toward MPs and their teams needs to take a long hard look in the mirror.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

And that is: they’re not going to do any more investing in the UK.”He made the comments a day after MSD, known as Merck in the US, said it would pull out of research & development (R&D) in the UK with the loss of 125 science jobs, citing Britain’s lack of progress on life science investment and the “overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments”.View image in fullscreenSir John Bell’s comments came the day after the US drugmaker Merck said it would pullout of R&D in the UK.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe Canadian immunologist, who wasan early member of the government’s vaccine taskforceand previously worked on Oxford University’s Covid vaccine with AstraZeneca, said: “This is a sign of something which has been evolving over a little while, but it’s going to now, I think, lead to a whole series of events which will mean that the industry is going to stop investing in the UK.”He said the pharma industry was “in real trouble in terms of pricing, particularly in America”, where Donald Trump has put pressure on companies to lower prices, and not to sell medications at a much lower price elsewhere.A big issue is the amount of money theNHSspends on medicines, Bell said.“Ten years ago, we used to spend 15% of our healthcare spend on pharmaceuticals. Now it’s 9%. The rest of the world, the OECD, are sitting between 14% and 20%,” he added.Long-running negotiations between the UK government and drugmakers over the cost of medicines broke down last month.Under the voluntary pricing and access scheme, companies agree to pay back to the NHS a certain amount of their UK revenue made from branded drugs. They are now paying back between one-quarter and one-third of their UK revenue (23.5% to 35.6%), compared with rebate rates of 5.7% in France and 7% in Germany, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.Bell said Britain had “great science in academia” and “great biotech companies” and infrastructure funded by government, “but without large companies, it isn’t going to work”.He added: “The large companies do have to work in a system where they can sell their products, and if they can’t sell their products here, they’ll go and do their business somewhere else.”The science minister, Ian Murray, told MPs in the Commons that MSD’s decision was “deeply disappointing and a commercial decision for them” but added that it was part of global cost cuts. He pointed to changes in “US and international fundamentals” that were affecting the life sciences sector.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Science-based businesses such as pharmaceutical and chemical companies have not only a rich, proud heritage in Britain, but are critical to driving growth in the economy and building our national resilience.”Bell said the UK had been in this situation before, and “solved [the problems] by being a bit more creative for what we did”. He referred to the cancer drugs fund, introduced in 2011 by David Cameron, then prime minister. The UK had fallen behind on cancer medicinesand the fund enabled it to buy innovative, more expensive drugs.Bell has just stood down as president of the Ellison Institute of Technology, founded by the US billionaire Larry Ellison, whobriefly overtookElon Musk as the world’s richest man on Wednesday.

Carney said the projects would add C$60bn (US$43bn) to the country’s economy and create “tens of thousands” of new jobs.The liquified natural gas project is a shift for Liberals. Under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, senior ministers were publicly skeptical of the economic case for exporting Canadian LNG across the Atlantic. But in recent months, Carney’s government has met with European officials to pitch Canadian LNG exports.The other projects announced on Thursday were a small modular reactor at Ontario’s Darlington nuclear facility, a Quebec port expansion and two mines – all of which Carney framed as having reduced environmental impacts.“We used to build big things in this country, and we used to build them quickly,” said Carney. “It’s time to get back at it, and it’s time to get on with it.”The absence of a major oil pipeline is expected to kick off fierce partisan attacks. Earlier in the summer, the federal Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, said a Tory government would “legalize” pipelines and said the Carney government was “going in the exact wrong direction”.Danielle Smith, the Alberta premier, has said for months her government wants to see a new pipeline that would move oil to the Pacific. On Wednesday, she downplayed the lack of a pipeline.“We’ve got a little bit of work to do to be able to get to an environment where oil companies want to expand their production,” she told reporters.The largest hurdle for a pipeline project, in addition to provincial opposition and emission caps, is the lack of support from the private sector.Amid a continent-wide push for economic nationalism, the absence of a pipeline nonetheless comes in stark contrast to Trump, who has pledged to revive the Keystone XL pipeline.Carney’s push to fast-track major projects – and the speed with which his government passed the accompanying legislation, Bill C-5 –has prompted concern from Indigenous leadersthat communities will not be properly consulted or their rights fully respected in the process. Carney spent the summer meeting with First Nations, Inuit and Métis leadership in an attempt to allay such concerns.In June, Trevor Mercredi, grand chief of the Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta, said C-5 “exposes Canada’s preferred strategy when dealing with Treaty Peoples: not through partnership or reconciliation, but through legislative fatigue – imposing policy knowing it will take us years to fight it in court”.On Wednesday, the government announced that Mercredi, a critic of Bill C-5, would be appointed to the Indigenous advisory council that will advise on the implementation legislation.A second round of projects is expected in November. But even though the list includes a windfarm, a port upgrade, a carbon capture project and high-speed rail, there are again no pipelines.Environmental groups expressed skepticism over the projects. Greenpeace said the list was “creating a false narrative around” the idea of national interest.Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said the plans included “some dangerous initiatives that further entrench us in Trump’s dream of an uncompetitive, volatile and fossil-fuelled North American economy” and warned: “How big things get built also matters. Unfortunately, the Building Canada Act seems to assume that premiers and C-suite executives are the only voices that need to be listened to in order to succeed.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Paramount and WBD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Shares in WBD surged by as much as 34% following the report, and closed up 29% on Thursday. The firm owns an array of media assets, including the Warner Bros movie studios; CNN, the news network; the DC Comics franchise; and a string of TV networks, including HBO.Paramount also owns the storied Paramount Pictures studios, as well as TV broadcasters includingCBSin the US, Channel 5 in the UK, Comedy Central and MTV.David Ellison has moved quickly since sealing control of the conglomerate in August, striking a$7.7bn (£5.7bn) deal to become the exclusive US broadcasterof the Ultimate Fighting Championship; signing an exclusive contract with the Duffer brothers, who created Stranger Things; and agreeing a deal with the video games publisher Activision to produce a movie based on the Call of Duty franchise.Decisions made under Ellison around the future of CBS News – one of the biggest news operations in the US, which is behind 60 Minutes, the most watched news program on network television – have attracted intense scrutiny.CBS News became a flashpoint as Ellison sought approval for his deal for Paramount. Shortly before the deal closed this summer, itreached a controversial settlementwith Donald Trump over what he claimed was misleading editing of a pre-election 60 Minutes interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris.Disgruntled NYT journalist to ‘anti-woke’ power grab: how far can Bari Weiss go?Read moreEarlier this week, Paramount announced that Kenneth Weinstein – a conservative policy veteran who Trump nominated to be US ambassador to Japan in 2020 – would become ombudsman for CBS News, monitoring allegations of bias and audience complaints.Ellison is widely reported to be on the verge of acquiring the Free Press, an online publicationco-founded by Bari Weiss and noted for its “anti-woke” politics, with the New York Timesreportingthis week that Weiss, its former columnist, had been lined up for a senior role at CBS News.Any deal for WBD would raise questions over the implications for CNN, which has also faced heavy criticism from Trump over coverage he has not liked.WBD was formed by themerger of Warner Media and Discoveryin April 2022. After a tough few years, its CEO, David Zaslav – who put together the initial merger –announced plans to split the company into twoin June.Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester Research, suggested a takeover of WBD by Paramount would “redefine the streaming landscape” were it to materialize. “This could be good for consumers in the form of cost savings, but it also would reduce marketplace choice,” he said. “What’s clear is that as the streaming market matures, it’s looking a whole lot like the OG television industry – all the way back to when there were just a few big networks and studios.”Robert Weissman, co-president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, argued any attempt by Paramount to acquire WBD “should plainly be struck down” by regulators on antitrust grounds. “But there’s grave reason to worry that the Trump administration would rubber-stamp such a merger, giving a pass to a corporate marriage that would advance its ideological agenda,” he said.Approving a Paramount-WBD tie-up “would confirm that, for all its tough talk on antitrust, the Trump regime is intent simply on using antitrust as another weaponized tool: a means to punish perceived opponents and reward ideological allies”, Weissman added.Explore more on these topicsBusinessMergers and acquisitionsParamount+Warner BrosCBSTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Today, swimming is strictly prohibited, with fines running into the hundreds of euros, though a longstanding New Year’s Day tradition survives in which divers plunge from one of Rome’s bridges into the chilly waters below.Gualtieri has said that because pollution rates in the Tiber are lower than those previously recorded in the Seine, the Roman operation, if it went ahead, would be cheaper than its €1.4bn (£1.2bn) Parisian precursor.Yet, the Italian capital’s river is far from pristine. In April, scientists from theTara Microplastics missionpublished findings on European waterway pollution that showed the Tiber had an average of three microplastic particles per cubic metre. That may be well below the more than 20 particles per cubic metre recorded in India’s Ganges, but it is still far from reassuring.Further research in September 2024 by Italy’s Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA)revealedthat the Tiber carried more floating waste – mostly plastic – into the sea than any other Italian river, alongside worrying concentrations of ammonia and faecal bacteria.“The health risks linked to pollution in the Tiber and in inland waters are extremely high,” Alessandro Miani, the president of the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine,told the news website Roma Today. “The presence of faecal bacteria such asEscherichia colican trigger gastrointestinal infections in humans, with symptoms including diarrhoea and vomiting. Contact with contaminated water can also cause skin and eye infections, leading to rashes and eye irritation.”The Paris project, meanwhile, was decades in the making. Although the Seine was used for swimming events during the 2024 Olympics, concerns over water quality persisted. Several events were postponed because of highE colilevels, while some athletes took precautionary medication before competing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For now, it remains a distant goal,” wrote Roma Today.In late July, when Gualtieri first raised the prospect of making the river swimmable, the national daily La Repubblica ran with the headline: “A swimmable Tiber? A long and costly journey – if it ever begins.”The paper pointed to a far smaller project – making the lake in Rome’s EUR district fit for bathing – that carries a price tag of about €8m and a timeline of at least five years. “The Tiber will take far longer,” La Repubblica concluded.Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeRiversPollutionWaternewsShareReuse this content"

A housewife activist fulminating against sin, she backed forcefully into the limelight while cooing that she was just “a grandmother who collects pebbles for a hobby”.Why gift her another moment in the spotlight? Homophobia and evangelical legislation have newly sharpened teeth, so Caroline Bird’s witty new play feels timely, as it peers under the bonnet of the campaigner’s self-promotion and asks what it feels like to be running on moral conviction.Bird’s Whitehouse often sounds like one of Victoria Wood’s redoubtable monsters, twinkling about ramekins and pebble-dashed with prejudice. In her salmon pink turtleneck, slingbacks and jazzy two-pieces (“The gays were not expecting that”),Maxine Peakeis all homely chuckles, her toes tapping as her rhetoric revs up. She’d be camp if she weren’t so adamantine, and if Bird didn’t take her so seriously.Whitehouse campaigned against porn and Howard Brenton’sThe Romans in Britain, but the play circles her views on homosexuality andprivate prosecutionof Gay News for a blasphemous poem (“He does WHAT to the dead body of Christ?”).Samuel Barnett, swathed in 1970s shades of mushroom and mustard, plays all the supporting roles, confronting Whitehouse with a succession of distressed parents, conflicted gay people and strong-viewed women.View image in fullscreenShades of mushroom and mustard … Samuel Barnett plays all the supporting roles opposite Peake.Photograph: Helen MurrayVisiting Margaret Thatcher, Whitehouse runs a doubtful finger over the Downing Street sideboard but receives a cold shoulder after hauling out a tupperware of sex toys (“Do you know what a butt plug is?”).

In Rayya’s voice, Gilbert calls herself babe, baby, or “sunshine baby” multiple times, emotes in all-caps, and grants herself permission to write the details of Rayya’s terrible, humiliating final year. “Let me just look at you for a minute,” “Rayya” says to Liz. “Look at your little rainbow eyes! Look at your sparkling tears! You’re so beautiful!” The letter is deeply self-indulgent and excruciating to read. “You’re going all the fucking way this time – all the way to the enlightenment.”I believe that the dead are gone and that artists don’t need their permission to evoke them. But I was stunned that this solipsistic mess opens the book, because Gilbert is a terrific storyteller –Eat Pray Love,her memoir of self-acceptance and healing, was read by millions. So, I scrubbed the false start from my mind, reminding myself that great literature shows people as they are, which means that at some point in every good memoir, weshouldsee the narrator being awful.Even so, it takes discipline and restraint not to let one’s flaws harm the writing – restraint that it appears Gilbert no longer has. All through the book, she reminds us of Eat Pray Love’s success and tries to echo and relive what she learned back then: that she’s addicted to love, but she can thrive alone if she has her spiritual and creative practices. “Just as in the second part of a verse bad poets seek a thought to fit their rhyme,” wrote Nietzsche, “so in the second half of their lives people tend to become more anxious about finding actions, positions, relationships that fit those of their earlier lives.” Gilbert keeps straining for that rhyme, trying to recapture an earlier magic: this can’t just be a book about Rayya’s drug relapse in her final year, or a meditation on end-of-life choices. It has to be about how Liz ended up on the bathroom floor again (remember that scene?) and divorced another guy (remember that?) because she’s a love addict who craves love and passion more than the rest of us.Rayya Elias was Gilbert’s best friend before she became her lover, a romance that begins only after Rayya is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Prior to that they’re both married (Liz to the man she meets in Eat Pray Love). When Rayya divorces, Gilbert offers her an isolated house, away from her sobriety group. When Rayya itches to drink again, Liz enables it. Once Rayya is diagnosed and given a six-month prognosis, Liz confesses her love, a dangerous thing to offer a dying addict. “Let’s just live balls to the wall until I die,” Rayya says, turning down chemo for cocaine, which Liz pays for. All this Liz thinks of as “my most beautiful story”.She strings together self-help cliches with no invention, no curiosity about poetry, or anything, really, but herselfWhich brings me to the poems. Gilbert includes a good number. They are maudlin and trite, with titles such as “God Pauses now and asks me to stay” and lines that read like juvenilia: “The dilemmas, trials, disappointments. / Angel. / My Little one. / You’ve been so tireless in your search for escape.” She strings together self-help cliches with no invention, no curiosity about poetry, or anything, really, but herself.Physicist Richard Feynman once said, when asked if an ordinary person could imagine the universe as he does, that “there [are] no miracle people”, no magic beyond “practice and reading and learning and study”. Gilbert’s entire oeuvre tilts at the belief that sheisa miracle person, her unrefined output magic. If ever she glances outward, she does so only to learn more about herself.The prose is clunky (“an unhealed wound looking for someone to land on”) and full of preposterous flourishes, such as when an imagined Rayya says, in a poem at the end of the book: “I love it when you talk about me: it polishes me like a diamond.” It’s also deeply uncomfortable when Gilbert claims to have been a conduit for Rayya’s late mother in Rayya’s final days. “My soul left my body so Georgette could be alone with her girl.” Trusting the voice inside your head can be spiritual and powerful, as long as you understand that it isn’t a divine voice, or someone else’s, but your own, subject to your own limitations and desires.In contrast, Gilbert is at her best when she writes with self-awareness. There is a scene in which she collapses in rage, revealing all of herself, all her ugliness, listing everything Rayya owes her. She confesses to registering herself as an addict to get clean needles for Rayya, and to planning to murder her (“Rayya did not want to die. ButIwanted her to die.”) and to being jealous of the ex-girlfriend who finally gets Rayya clean. “My precious, precious reputation asthe best person in the worldwas very much at stake here, and there are very few things that will make me hate someone more than when they threaten my favourite delusions about myself.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I became a vampire”. And when, instead of simply emoting, she sits down to craft a scene, she writes transportingly. The last days of Rayya’s life, in a house with two of her exes, are funny, propulsive, raw and moving – Gilbert forgetting about herself to help her partner, who’s alone and helpless and terrified to die.All the Way to the River: Love, Loss and Liberation by Elizabeth Gilbert is published by Bloomsbury (£22).

It’s soapy, highly dramatic and wonderfully campHannah J DaviesThu 11 Sep 2025 16.55 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareThe Newsreader is the best kind of period piece in that it makes you reflect not only on the past but on the present. The first two seasons of this Australian drama about rival newscasters managed to cram in some of the biggest events of the 80s: the Challenger disaster; the Aids crisis; rumours of the end of Charles and Diana’s marriage.As well as seeing the impact those stories had on the world, the series hinged on some perennial themes, too – women being sidelined in the workplace; homophobia; mental illness; and what drives people to stay in their jobs even when everything around them is dripping with toxicity. To watch The Newsreader in an age of boundaries and therapy-speak is to feel at once privileged not to be working in broadcast television in the 1980s, and acutely aware that many of the problems still persist today. As unsettling as it is, the programme has often been excellent: I have a suspicion that if this were a US series, it would be a smash hit.We arrive at this third season – the show’s last – already well acquainted with Helen Norville (Anna Torv) and Dale Jennings (Sam Reid). At the end of season two we saw Helen depart for the US to cover the 1988 election, leaving her ex-partner and co-anchor Dale to helm the News at Six alone. (Sadly, we don’t get to see Helen in action in Washington, although we do see her during a detour to the UK, where she reports on the Lockerbie bombing.)View image in fullscreenRed carpet … a deliciously camp first episode features the biggest night in Aussie TV.Photograph: BBC/Werner Film Productions/Lionsgate/EOne/Jane ZhangThe first episode is a wonderfully camp, highly dramatic affair, as she and Dale reunite at the biggest night in Aussie TV, the Logie awards, alongside Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan (whose presence is added here via archive footage). Of course, things are only briefly jovial: Helen has been offered a new TV gig with a 6pm slot, putting her in direct competition with her old team. Torv is masterly as a woman consumed by rampant guilt and furious ambition, while Reid is excellent as the once puppyish Dale, trying his best to live up to his newfound popularity as the country’s “King of News”.The Newsreader is an ambiguous title for a reason and, at different points throughout this season, we see Helen and Dale respectively triumph as the media personality of the moment. When one is on the up, the other tumbles further into despair.For Reid, that means digging even deeper as he conveys Dale’s increasing isolation. His struggle is twofold; on one hand, he is a queer man trying not to get outed by his colleagues – or the press – and on the other, his constant self-policing leads him to be branded by some viewers as rigid and fake. Meanwhile, Torv conveys Helen’s fraying mental health and frequent helplessness with raw sensitivity, even if the writers took far too long to get this character the help she so desperately needed. They are a joy and a misery to watch in equal measure, but if you have any qualms about scenes that hinge on severe mental illness, self-harm and substance abuse, you should steer clear.From Mindhunter to Newsreader: Anna Torv on how she chooses her next roleRead moreWhile those two central performances – and much of the cast – remain powerful, I’m not convinced this season sticks the landing. The final episode sees Dale descend into an increasingly catatonic state, only to walk straight on to the set of the News at Six to deliver a bulletin. The joy of The Newsreader is that it has always felt a little soapy, but sometimes it is just absurd.Conversely, the final scenes are bland and uncomplicated, as though they came from another show altogether. I also wish we had more time with Noelene (Michelle Lim Davidson), the News at Six producer who defects to Helen’s new show and masterminds an exclusive on the Tiananmen Square protests, and who later struggles to balance motherhood with her boss’s nonstop demands. There is so much more to delve into with her story, as both a working mother and a Korean Australian, wrestling with feeling unseen by her white husband and former co-worker, Rob (Stephen Peacocke).Despite all this, I’m really going to miss this show. To spend three seasons in the company of Helen and Dale is to consider what being a good friend and a loyal colleague truly means, especially when your line of work is corrosive to your sanity. It’s not the most newsworthy season – but don’t switch over quite yet.The Newsreader aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer in the UK.

Already at this year’s Toronto film festival, Aziz Ansari admirably tried, and I would say sadly failed, to recall the spirit of the high-concept star-led comedy with fantastical elements inGood Fortune. There’s a far more convincing attempt from the Irish writer-director David Freyne with Eternity, an ambitious afterlife romance that could more neatly play alongside films of the era like Heart and Souls, What Dreams May Come and Ghost.Couture review – Angelina Jolie is the wrong fit for inert fashion dramaRead moreIt’s not just the thought-through ingenuity of the set-up but also the gloss and grandness of the film-making, an A24 production that feels like it should have the Touchstone Pictures logo at the start. It’s the surprising next step for Freyne whose endearing queer comedyDating Ambergot a little buried in the hellish summer of 2020. That film – about queer high schoolers faking a relationship to kill suspicion – was small and semi-autobiographical for Freyne, and for his follow-up he’s gone from rooted in truth to floating in fantasy.In the witty, well-constructed world of Eternity, death is not the end. Once your time in the real world is over, you arrive via train to a 1960s-looking convention centre, at the exact age when you were at your happiest. You then meet your AC (Afterlife Consultant) who will help you decide where to go next. Maybe you want to spend your afterlife on the beach (hello Beach World) or maybe you’re a woman who has had just about enough of men (Men Free World is amusingly full up) or perhaps you’re a gay man who wants to enjoy the indulgences of the 80s without the Aids crisis (that’ll be Studio 54 World). It’s a flurry of salespeople all trying to secure your place, a decision that can’t be overturned once you’re there.Larry just choked on a pretzel and died in front of his family, an abrupt end to a long life and a mostly happy marriage. He wakes up as his younger self (Miles Teller) and is paired with Anna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) who explains his situation and tries to match him with the ideal afterlife. But Larry wants to wait for his wife Joan, whose cancer diagnosis suggests the wait won’t be that long. When she does arrive (returning to her youth, played by Elizabeth Olsen), there’s a slight snag. Her first husband Luke (Callum Turner) died in the war decades prior and he’s also been waiting. With the help of her AC Ryan (John Early), Joan has to decide who she wants to spend eternity with.It’s a fun, nifty set-up, the outline of a classic love triangle given a smart and thought-provoking shake-up, stakes raised as high as they can possibly get. Joan must weigh the potential of what was barely explored and cruelly taken from her against the security of what she already knows, just maybe a little too well. The one she grieved for versus the one who helped her grieve, the memory of young love versus the reality of long-term marriage, the one who remembers her when she was at her best versus the one who knew her when she was at her worst. It’s a big film, of big ideas and big, audience-swaying emotional swings, and Freyne mostly aces such a mammoth expansion of canvas. He has a light touch that keeps his film dancing with both speed and grace, influenced not just by the sleek multiplex fare of the 90s but also the transporting high-concept fantasies of the 40s that inspired them, films like A Matter of Life and Death and It’s a Wonderful Life. It’s also refreshing to see a queer director bring a queer sensibility to a mainstream, straight-led romance. It allows for numerous snippets of worlds designed around gay utopias (one is literally called Queer World), a lesbian revelation from Joan’s recently deceased friend and for one of the male leads to make brief, casual reference to his experiences with men in the past.The film lands Teller and Olsen with a relatively complex acting challenge, embodying their characters’ physical younger selves and the speech patterns of that time but with the experience and, often crankiness, of age. They both manage incredibly well without dipping into pastiche and Teller is especially charming in ways we haven’t seen from him in a long time, if ever really before. Turner does handsome matinee idol well (he’s likened to Montgomery Clift in the film), Early’s trademark delivery adds a fun and contemporary comic zip to more trad territory and the film gives a wonderful Randolph her most deserving, if still too small, post-Oscar role yet, allowed out of the punishing thanklessness of action slop likeBride HardandShadow Force. In the last act she’s a little underserved, though, Freyne leading her to a much-teased yet weirdly ineffective big reveal, tears replaced with a shrug.That scene is indicative of a last act that doesn’t quite reach the soaring emotional highs we expect or want, Freyne too focused on the cleverness of plot machinations to focus on making us really feel something. It’s where the film risks seeming more like an approximation than an original, as if we’ve decided to spend eternity in 90s Romantic Fantasy World, allowing us to admire what Freyne is doing rather then respond emotionally to it. I admired a great deal here, though, especially Freyne’s attempt to transport us back to a cinema landscape before it was dulled down by streaming. That’s an afterlife I would happily choose.Eternity is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released on 14 November in the US, in Australia on 4 December and in the UK on 5 DecemberExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewToronto film festivalFestivalsElizabeth OlsenMiles TellerComedy filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He is effectively given sanctuary, but also imprisoned in the unpoliceable, unknowable quarter that, like Polanski’s Chinatown, is a place that baffles and thwarts the imperial powers-that-be.It was a film remade by Hollywood in 1938 as Algiers, which was the debut ofHedy Lamarrand made a huge star of its French lead Charles Boyer, who is much sleeker and more conventionally photogenic than Gabin (but forever stuck with the misquoted line: “Come with me to the Casbah…!” always being purred by nightclub comedians). Algiers in turn inspired Michael Curtiz’sCasablanca, so these crooks, thieves, perspiring cynics and romantic stoics, all going slowly stir-crazy in the exotic, orientalised underbelly of north Africa, can all be traced back to Pépé le Moko. (Marcel Dalio, who played Casablanca’s croupier, is in Pépé le Moko as the slippery snitch L’Arbi.) It is a film of intense poetry; translated into the American context, the story looked noir-ish in ways that aren’t in the original.Gabin was known for his tough, blue-collar image and uncompromisingly everyman face, but here, at the age of 33, he looks feline and almost dandified. In the Casbah, Pépé runs a motley gang taunting the law; his favourite acolyte is young hothead Pierrot (Gilbert Gil) but he is always having trouble with resentfully mutinous Carlos (Gabriel Gabrio), an odious, envious figure who beats his girlfriend Tania (Fréhel). She is later to have a heartbreaking moment as she sings sadly, remembering her youth.Pépé’s girlfriend is Inès (Line Noro), with whom Pépé is now openly and ungallantly bored; she reminds him of the Casbah while he sees himself as a metropolitan sophisticate – a Parisian through-and-through. Chekhov’s three sisters did not yearn for Moscow more intensely than Pépé dreams of Paris. So when he meets a bewitchingly beautiful Parisian called Gaby (Mireille Balin), travelling in Algiers with a pompous sugar-daddy champagne merchant, there is instant spark. Local cop Inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux) shrewdly sees how Gaby can be used to tempt Pépé out of his hiding place. Slimane surmises how Pépé’s boredom and rage and lust can be his undoing, but also his death-wish, his need for a magnificent excuse to launch himself into a hostile, fatal world, and his despairing need to have done with an existence whose sweetness is long gone.The Casbah is elegantly fabricated on a replica set, with its amusingly bizarre place names like Inadequacy Street. It is in this place that Pépé is for the locals a rumour, or ghost, or legendary hero; in reality, he has little or nothing to do all day but play cards with his compadres.As for the film’s potential as a political parable, it is unavoidable. Pépé’s sanctuary is a result, or perhaps a symptom of the tensely balanced political situation between the imperial master and its possession, which has to be kept calm. Perhaps Pépé is a symbol ofFranceitself, trapped in its colony, a place it doesn’t understand and doesn’t want to. Duvivier contrives some marvellous poetic and romantic moments, with faces rendered dramatically in closeup – especially Pépé’s final anguished cry to Gaby which she cannot hear. It is powerful, muscular film-making, one of the great romantic dramas.Pépé le Moko is at the Institut Français, London, from 12 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersFranceWorld cinemaAlgeriaAfricaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s their first time playing together since a mysterious reported row between David and Nigel in 2009 brought the Tap bandwagon to a halt.‘Our songs last three minutes but they feel like an hour’: the return of Spinal Tap – an exclusive that goes up to 11!Read moreAnd to paraphrase the Smiths: that joke is still funny … it’s not too close to home and it’s not too near the bone … but it is close, and you might have to work a little bit harder to remember how you felt the first time you saw the original. There’s lots of good stuff here, some witty reboots and reworkings of gags from the first film and sprightly update appearances from minor, half-forgotten characters currently residing in the “where-are-they-now?” file. (It’s sad not to see Anjelica Huston as Stonehenge designer Polly Deutsch, however.) And the single biggest laugh is a line right at the end about Bruce Springsteen.What I didn’t anticipate about this film is how very sad it would make me feel. It was normal back in 1984 to call the characters inSpinal Tap“ageing” rockers. Now, well, they really are ageing. We all are. There is a kind of poignancy and melancholy in Tap II that perhaps wasn’t entirely intentional. The amount of perspective is excessive. Yet one thing that also weirdly emerges or re-emerges from this follow-up is the realisation that: yes, the guys playing Tap (and co-writer and director Rob Reiner) really were and are good musicians and their pastiche rock compositions are very effective and accomplished.The situation now is that the band’s late manager Ian Faith (played by the late Tony Hendra) effectively bequeathed his IP rights in the band to his grownup daughter Hope (Kerry Godliman). She is now legally forcing the band to get back together for a cynical payday, a reunion supposedly lubricated by advice from slippery promoter Simon Howler, played by Chris Addison. Nowadays, Nigel lives in rural England with his young wife (Nina Conti) managing a guitar and cheese shop and playing heavy rock in an Irish folk band at the local pub. Derek runs an antique glue shop (sort of the same jokes as Nigel’s shop), while David is in California, where he composes award-winning incidental music for true-crime podcasts and corporate on-hold messages.The band are forced back into each other’s company with film-maker Marty DiBergi (Reiner) once again on board – and what grumpy old geezers they are. Helpfully, a couple of real-life rock megalegends also want to get involved with the Tapaissance – about whom the band are amusingly ungrateful. Some of the lines don’t exactly come off: the Simon Howler character is a bit broad and Derek’s attempt to hit on their new female drummer, played by Valerie Franco, is icky. (Nigel himself once asked what’s wrong with being sexy? But this is unsexy in the wrong way.) Nevertheless the Stonehenge-centred finale is a positive Tapocalypse.Spinal Tap II: The End Continues is out on 12 September in the UK and US, and on 25 September in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekComedy filmsMusic documentarySpinal TapThis Is Spinal TapPop and rockHarry ShearerreviewsShareReuse this content"

But they are confident their pared-down operation will still offer ‘an electric night out’Thu 11 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 05.10 EDTShare‘I’ve got to say this straight off the bat,” says the director Adele Thomas. “I was expecting this company, given what they’ve been through, to all have their arms crossed and to just not want to know. And actually, they’ve been so unbelievably welcoming. And that’s been a saving grace whenever we’ve turned around and it’s looked like there’s another bin on fire.”Thomas is one half of Welsh National Opera’s new leadership team along with Sarah Crabtree, and since starting the job in January they haven’t been short of fires to put out. We first talked in April, days after they had given an impassioned speech at the curtain call of the company’s first night ofBritten’s Peter Grimes, with more than 100 performers and staff behind them on stage. Four months of graft later, the planned autumn productions of Puccini’sToscaand Bernstein’sCandideare on their way, and the 2026-27 season – Thomas and Crabtree’s first as programmers – is in place (details will be announced next March). The funding situation remains bleak, and yet finally there is a sense that, after three years of bad news, the company may be able to look to the future.Thomas and Crabtree came to WNO as a team. They had known each other since 2019, when Crabtree – in her previous role as the ROH’s creative producer, in charge of the Linbury theatre – programmed Thomas’s production of Handel’s operaBerenice. (“Sarah’s always been the most adventurous and curious producer of opera that I’ve known,” Thomas says.) When the WNO role came up they applied, and were appointed as a jobshare, both holding the title of co-general director/CEO. Each works three days a week (in theory; it’s often been much more) and they divide up weekends on call. Thomas, originally from Port Talbot, had long been resident in Cardiff; Crabtree moved her young family over from London. “We share all of the artistic, producing and administration tasks of running of the company,” Crabtree explains. “We have different skill sets, and that’s brilliant, because there are times when you need to play to your strengths, but we can also bounce off each other. And we can preserve a bit of energy – we can step out in order to step back in again. There’s obviously a lot on your plate when you step into a massive job in a difficult time for an organisation.”View image in fullscreenFflur Wyn as First Niece, Eiry Price as Second Niece in WNO’s staging of Britten’s Peter Grimes.Photograph: Dafydd OwenTo say that the last few years have been difficult for WNO risks understatement. Based in Cardiff but touring to venues both in Wales and across west and central England, the company relies on Arts Council funding from both countries.The Arts Council England cuts of November 2022, which decimated touring opera in England, saw WNO losing 35% of its grant; this was followed the next year by an 11.8% cut from Arts Council Wales – sealing a steep decline in a wider Welsh operatic ecosystem (also including the sadly reducedMid Wales OperaandMusic Theatre Wales) that had historically punched far above its weight. When Crabtree and Thomas began in post they were taking on a company that had been forced to drop major touring venues and that was mired in fraught union negotiations regarding chorus redundancies and the idea of making an already understaffed orchestra part-time.If they wanted an opera company to look as it did 10 or 15 years ago, they wouldn’t have employed us“We were really clear before we started,” says Crabtree, “that we want to protect the company as a permanent not a part-time ensemble. But it’s got to become smaller so that we can protect that core.” The orchestra remains full-time for the time being; the chorus redundancies, which took its number down to 20 however, have gone ahead, eight of them voluntary but two of them forced. It’s been heartbreaking, they say, but necessary. “The plan in all of this is that we don’t sell the crown jewels in this point of crisis, that we protect the integrity of the heart of the company. We want to run a company with artists and craftspeople at its centre. So that’s the million-dollar question: where is that sweet spot that enables us to be flexible, agile and small enough to create things that we want to do over the next couple of years, and then to build back when times are easier?”“We are absolutely committed to making sure that we are always a large-scale opera company,” says Thomas. “That will never change.” What has changed, though, is that the company’s budget now is in real terms around half of what it was only a decade ago. “I don’t think that people realise just how bad the financial situation is,” Thomas says. “We’ve got to the point where the reserves have run out. It’s not the case that the company was operating within its means and then lost funding. Even the budget last year is returning a huge deficit. We can’t live beyond our means any more.”View image in fullscreenWNO’s staging of Verdi’s Rigoletto, part of the 2024-25 season.Photograph: Richard Hubert SmithOnly a decade ago WNO was mounting eight major productions a year. Thecurrent season offers four, two of them new. And the 2026-27 season will look different again, they say. “There will be a different structure to the way that we’re presenting our season. We’re still a touring company and will still be in many of the places that you would expect, but we are adding some kind of light and shade in terms of scale,” says Crabtree. “There is an opportunity there, because we can create something smaller and more malleable that can go into more spaces and reach audiences deeper into Wales, and into England too.” Is there a danger that if they are too successful at touring shows on a smaller scale they will lose their mandate for full-scale work? No, they say. “Our partners in the venues have come out loudly and clearly and said ‘We want grand opera, our audiences deserve it’.”I don’t think people realise how bad the financial situation is. The reserves have run outWhat they want to provide, Thomas says, is “an electric night out – not a cosy night out, or an expensive snooze. And that is what WNO has historically done so brilliantly. I wanted to get into opera because I sawRichard Jones’s production of Wozzeckat WNO back in 2005, which is still the best thing I’ve ever seen.”But how will they keep a full-time ensemble busy? One answer is to become a laboratory space, says Crabtree, noting that places where new work can be tried out and workshopped at scale have almost vanished from the opera sector over the last 15 years or so. “WNO is not rich in cash but it’s rich in resources and people and space. We can share that resource with the rest of the sector.” Another is community and engagement work – which, thanks to the newly negotiated contracts, is now part and parcel of the job for the company’s regular ensemble, alongside their mainstage work.View image in fullscreenCommunity operaBlaze of Glory,which will be part of the 2025-26 season.Photograph: Kirsten McternanThen, and perhaps most importantly, there’s the idea that they are building “the opera company of the future”. What does that mean? “It’s about how we create a sustainable touring model, how we reach more people, create partnerships and break down barriers for those coming in – questions lots of opera companies are asking themselves,” says Crabtree, who talks about wanting to tap into the Welsh pride and democratic spirit that led to the founding of the company nearly eight decades ago. “I think we can take some of that spirit into the company and make bold decisions about who tells the stories which perhaps our English counterparts aren’t able to do in the same way.“What we’ve found coming in here is that there’s a permission afforded to the two of us to do things differently – if they wanted an opera company to look as it did 10 or 15 years ago, they wouldn’t have employed Adele and me. We have a permission now to be brave in our programming in order to build that future audience. If you’re faced with a situation where that’s at the bottom of the list of priorities and survival is the top, that makes it very difficult to future-proof. But there is a future. We know what it could look like and we just want to get on and do it.”WNO’s season opens on 14 September at the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, with ToscaExplore more on these topicsWelsh National OperaOperaClassical musicWalesArts Council EnglandArts fundinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also a tribute to their grandparents’ heritage, their Welsh grandmother getting the biggest musical nod with two folk song arrangements plus Hiraeth, a sweetly yearning original composition by Isata for all seven players. Nothing is mawkish or over milked, yet everything feels a little like a final encore, sending us out misty-eyed.View image in fullscreenThe Kanneh-Masons: River of MusicPhotograph: DeccaThe second half is taken up by an old family favourite, Schubert’s Trout Quintet. Here Isata, Sheku and Braimah are joined by their friends Edgar Francis and Toby Hughes, on viola and bass, for a performance that’s occasionally sparky but mostly gentle and a little monochrome. It doesn’t match up to some stiff recorded competition – but perhaps that’s not really the point. River of Music reinforces the Kanneh-Masons’ inspiring brand, but maybe next time they will give us something a bit more ambitious.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

I Love You, Byeee is the follow up in which he remembers his late mother, Valerie, and reflects on his TV career which began with him landing a job at Takeover TV, a showcase for new talent on Channel 4, where he brought in his childhood friend Joe Cornish.Fans of The Adam and Joe Show will find reminiscences about the pair’s toy movies, where they recreated films such as Titanic andTrainspotting, and their radio shows on XFM and 6Music. Buxton is candid about the strain of their working relationship and his feelings of insecurity when Cornish went off to direct his first film,Attack the Block,without him.Buxton’s audiobooks tend to do extremely well, in part due to the author’s chatty, self-deprecating style that is fun on the page yet transmits more effectively in audio. His vocal delivery is warm, whimsical and underpinned by a gentle melancholy. But key to their success is the way that Buxton approaches them less as a straightforward narration than a fully fledged sound project, using similar features to those on his pod, The Adam Buxton Podcast. Along with his trademark songs and jingles (which could be annoying but are not), I Love You, Byeee has two bonus chapters. The first is an essay on the author’s love ofDavid Bowiethat was cut from the book, and the second is a bracingly honest conversation between Buxton and Cornish in which they recall the highs and lows of their friendship.Available via Mudlark, 10hr 13 minFurther listeningBless Me FatherKevin Rowland, Penguin Audio, 11hr 19minThe Dexys frontman’s blunt memoir looks back on his religious childhood, his troubled relationship with his father, his meteoric rise to fame and his tendency to self-sabotage when things are going well.

The New Yorker talks about the virtues of indie label life, and how her latest record takes on the ‘girl violence’ she sees in lesbian communitiesThu 11 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShareMikaela Strauss, the songwriter and producer who records as King Princess, describes her new album Girl Violence as “almost like a ‘ha ha’ to toxic masculinity”, although not in the way you may initially think. Informed by the drama and infighting that she suggests is inherent in many lesbian communities, Girl Violence touches on the idea that “in a world full of physical violence and anger and war and hypermasculinity,thisis the really crazy violence that’s under the surface, that’s subliminal and emotional and thoughtful”, she says. She smirks a little, over Zoom from her home in Brooklyn: “You think that you’re the proprietor of the violence. [But] it’s the girls.”Girl Violence is the third King Princess album, and the most fully formed. It represents something of a clean break for 26-year-old Strauss, who went viral aged 19 with her debut single 1950, a plush but covertly bitter anthem about a complex queer romance. That single, released on Mark Ronson’s Sony imprint Zelig, broke through to the US charts and established Strauss as a pop sensation in waiting.But the music she released after 1950 – her gorgeous, unburdened 2019 debut albumCheap Queenand its knottier, more rock-inspired 2022 follow-up Hold On Baby – suggested that, perhaps, Strauss was a more interesting and ambitious artist than that “next big thing” tag allowed for. Girl Violence is her first album on the independent Section1; signing with the label, she says, made her realise that the ideas she had about indies were far from the truth. “Artists are told indie labels have no money … that they’re not going to be able to market you, all these things,” she says. “The reality is, that’s complete bullshit. Indie labels are innovative: they can be even more generous with their spending than majors because they are interested in making the best art possible.”View image in fullscreenLondon calling … Strauss performing at Koko in the capital.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyAlthough she cherishes her new creative freedom, Strauss doesn’t hide the fact that it was hard to experience such huge success very early in her career, only for it to lessen somewhat. “I’m a simple girl – I want to be famous, you know? It was a bit of a punch to the tit, but I don’t regret my decisions or my music at all,” she says. “I refuse to pity myself or feel disappointed for what does commercially well and what doesn’t. Fuck that: this isn’t a race, it’s a marathon, and I want to have a career for the rest of my life. I am a tortoise. You can’t kill me.”I have been a chaotic lesbian since I was 14 years old… My worst moments? There’s too many to countShe says that it’s a common fault of the industry that artists carry so much expectation so early in their careers. “For anyone who’s experienced a career high with their first song, that is not a place you want to be. It is tough,” she says. “People then hold you to the standard of something you wrote in your dorm room when you were 18, you know? It’s not realistic. That song blew up completely arbitrarily.”Strauss has spent the past few years reckoning with the huge upheaval of her early success. Two years ago, she moved back to her home city of New York after a stint in Los Angeles; she enjoyed parts of the west coast, but missed “the diversity of New York; there’s just cool, constant events and happenings. In LA, I was just really excited that people were paying attention to me, so I kind of partied my way through and luckily found some incredible friendships. But [it was] a lot of transience, a lot of me out raging. I don’t know, LA is good for that, if that’s your scene: just going to parties and meeting people and talking and doing coke. I did that for four years, and then I was like: I need daytime friends.”There was a moment, after moving back to New York, when Strauss felt as if she had fallen out of love with making music, in part because she “stopped thinking about what I actually liked and enjoyed”, and was instead “focused on what was gonna appease the label”. Salvation came in the form of her first acting role: a part in the second season ofmystery series Nine Perfect Strangers, which stars Nicole Kidman as a sinister Russian therapist. Filming in Germany for six months, the musician slowly began to feel more energised about art. “I took so much from the acting experience and brought it back into making my record; it taught me to be silly and less precious,” she says. “You have to relinquish so much control when you’re acting: you do your takes, some are shit, some are not. But at the end of the day, you’re not constructing the show, you don’t have the control. And I think a lot of my issues around music were about feeling this sense of control over myself.”When she got back to New York, Strauss holed up in a Brooklyn studio owned by her recording engineer father, and began to shape Girl Violence without any outside influence from a label. “The only people who were sharing their opinion in the studio was me, and producers Jake [Portrait] and Joe [Pincus], and maybe my dad if he walked in and heard something he didn’t like – but it was mostly the three of us.” She embraced the idea that “all that matters is what I think and what these two guys think. It forced me to make decisions for myself musically.”View image in fullscreenSnow joke … Strauss in Nine Perfect Strangers.Photograph: Reiner Bajo/DisneyStrauss describes the resulting record as a “guidebook” for people trying to understand “different iterations of girl violence”, which may be a side of the lesbian community that many don’t see. “I am baffled by the level of chaos – it’s inspiring. And I’m someone who loves reality TV and drama and The L Word,” she says. Strauss tentatively describes herself as a “reformed” member of the “girl violence community”. “I have been a chaotic lesbian since I was 14 years old. My worst moments? There’s too many to count.”That reform has been another big part of the past few years for Strauss. “I’ve spent my entire life dating women and having it be hectic and chaotic and painful; I thought love is pain, that’s what I’ve always believed,” she says. She began to feel that she was “horny for being sad”, then began to ask herself: “Why? Can I be horny for being happy? Can I be horny for being safe? For being respected? Can I be horny for being comfortable, instead of equating my horniness to damage and chaos and danger?”In the end, she found out that “you can be horny for all the good stuff, but it is like an unworking; you have to unwork that in your brain and break down why. That was part of making this record: why do we want what we want as lesbians? Why are we obsessed with being sad?“I had to really think about how I was presenting myself emotionally. If I was walking through the world needing the validation of a partner to tell me that I’m good, that’s issue number one,” she continues. “And I had to sit down with myself and be like: who am I alone, without anybody? So that was a lot of therapy. And then I guess it was also just looking at myself in the mirror and realising I’ve been dating the same type of girl since I was 14 years old. Never again.”That self-reflection is borne out in Girl Violence, which adds new depth and complexity to Strauss’s punchy, sneakily virtuosic pop sensibility. Strauss suggests that this new zone, unburdened by commercial expectation, is exactly where she should have been all along. “Commercial success being the standard of success is tough, and I think that it’s really easy to fall into that trap of comparison. I just don’t want to be there: I want to be me, and I want to make the music I make,” she says. “I’m not at a label where they show me pie charts about how well or not well I’m doing: they love the record and we’re having a lot of fun.“That’s what I wanted. I shouldn’t be emo and weird and comparing myself,” she says. “I’m 26 – I should be having fun.”Girl Violence is out now.Explore more on these topicsMusicMark RonsonPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

If the world does manage to avoid the worst ravages of global heating, it will be thanks in part to the countless late nights he spent in windowless rooms, arguing over the placement of commas in impenetrable legal text.Betts would probably have disagreed. He disliked ostentation and grand statements, preferring to get on unfussily with his job – for years, he was the UK’s main negotiator on climate, and leader of the EU’s team on the 2015 Paris agreement.Legions of green campaigners would also baulk. Thirty-odd years of climate talks, with global “conference of the party” (Cop) summits almost yearly since 1992, and where are we? Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, temperatures are breaking records – in the last two years the global average has for the first time exceeded the vitally important threshold of 1.5C above preindustrial levels – and we are fast approaching what scientists warn could be points of no return. No wonder Greta Thunberg slammed the negotiations as “blah, blah, blah”.Yet the effort to craft lasting global agreement on the climate, with a view to binding governments to action that they would prefer to put off, has not been in vain. Before the Paris agreement, projections showed global temperatures heading towards 5C above preindustrial levels before the end of the century – at which point life on Earth would be unrecognisable. Today, if – and it’s a big if – all of the commitments made under Paris are fulfilled, the world will reach 2.7C of heating – still way over the limit of safety, but enough to keep hope alive.All of this is the subject of Betts’s book, The Climate Diplomat, published nearly two years after his death. Told in his straightforward, no-frills style, but with plenty of sardonic asides and cheeky anecdotes, this account of more than a decade of climate talks is accessible to general readers but has enough previously unknown detail to satisfy the Cop nerd.Typically self-effacing, Betts dismisses his own background – born “at the bottom of the heap” in 1959, he grew up in a small flat with an outside toilet in Battersea, south-west London, went to Oxford then struggled to find a vocation before joining the civil service as “the fast streamer from the gutter”, according to a patronising colleague – in just a couple of paragraphs. I’d have liked a little more, but he moves briskly through his first decades as a civil servant in London and Brussels to his analysis of global attempts to tackle the climate crisis, cutting through some of the misperceptions of both left and rightwing activists, and giving his prescriptions for what might work in future. Correctly, he points out that some on the left want the climate to be part of a slate of progressive positions, such as the call for reparations, which alienates some and plays into the hands of those who would wage culture war. “Hearing some leftwing commentators,” he warns, “it is not always clear that their real priority is tackling climate change. Of course we must confront the past, including colonialism, but we will not settle all the issues concerned to everybody’s satisfaction quickly. Sadly, our climate is changing too rapidly for that.”Counting down to zero: the final warning from a climate diplomatRead moreBetts is a fine guide to the strangely addictive nature of Cops, which for all their frustrations have a kind of majesty, as one of the few remaining forums in which the world gets together to discuss our collective future, and where the poorest nations are afforded the same rights as the richest. It is the only place where those suffering the worst impacts of climate breakdown can meet across the table with the countries – looking at you, Saudi Arabia – trying to obstruct their rescue. (Readers who can’t get enough of the intricacies of the Cop process might want to turn, after this, to the cerebral former US envoy Todd Stern’s meticulous recent tome, Landing the Paris Climate Agreement.)Betts and Stern come at this from relatively similar developed country positions, which will frustrate many readers who want more of the global south perspective. Equally fascinating, but sadly about as likely as a windmill on the White House, would be an honest viewpoint from one of the autocracies that holds the key to the crisis.Betts can be scathing about the mistakes of government, and unsparing of the stupidities of the Cop process. At several points, Betts points out how the last Conservative government fomented an increasingly fractious attitude towards civil servants. He says Claire Perry O’Neill, who played a major role in ensuring Cop26 was hosted by the UK, was “the first minister I had really struggled with”.It is fashionable in populist circles – think of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or the chainsaw-wielding president Javier Milei of Argentina – to dismiss and dismantle the work of civil servants. But when institutions are pushed aside, the powerful forces of big money step in. There are always other grey suits waiting to fill the place of bureaucrats, and the difference is they’re not working for you.World leaders will gather again this autumn to try to put us on track to meet the Paris goals, despite Donald Trump’s campaign against it. Betts, of course, will not be there, having succumbed to a brain tumour in October 2023. His book, largely written during his final illness, and finished with the assistance of his partner Fiona MacGregor, unsentimentally and briefly recounts his treatment.Part memoir and part penetrating analysis, with lessons for the future as well as revelations from the past, in some of its best passages this book reads like a briskly paced thriller.

Myths are “mirrors of us”, writesNatalie HaynesinPandora’s Jar, her book of essays on the women of Greek mythology. “Which version of a story we choose to tell, which characters we place in the foreground, which ones we allow to fade into the shadows: these reflect both the teller and the reader, as much as they show the characters of the myth.”Considerations of culture and bias have been central to the recent wave of mythic retellings focused on women, from Madeline Miller’sCirceand Pat Barker’sIliad trilogyto Haynes’s owntriad of novelsset within the classical Greek world (The Children of Jocasta,A Thousand ShipsandStone Blind). This latest is a reimagining of the myth of Jason and the Golden Fleece and, true to form, it centres the women.Those familiar with Apollonius’s Argonautica – a key source text for Haynes – remember the sorceress Medea; few, however, recall the other women in the story. The tale, as Apollonius tells it, is an adventure epic about Jason and his men, who make the treacherous voyage to Colchis aboard the Argo, in order to bring the Golden Fleece to Iolcus. We remember above all the Argonauts’ might (Heracles is part of the crew for a time), their enterprise and their luck, favoured as they are at many a turn by gods and goddesses. They row through terrible weather; survive a fight against the Doliones in an unfortunate case of mutual misrecognition; rescue blind Phineus from the Harpies and receive his prophetic counsel; brave the clashing rocks of the Symplegades. Once in Colchis, in a bid to win the coveted fleece from King Aietes, Jason – helped by Medea, besotted daughter of the king, whom he will take to Greece as his wife – yokes fire-breathing bulls, combats earth-born warriors and finally carries the fleece off from under the eye of a dragon.In lieu of one grand narrative, we get a series of slanting, smaller stories of abandonment, heartbreak and rancourThese events also anchor part of the plot in Haynes’s novel, though here they are emphatically attributed to the hand of the divine and occupy less narrative space, most of which is given over to a chorus of women, often absent in previous retellings. The result is an illuminating and often thrilling work of feminist reclamation that also enacts structural subversion, disrupting the familiar narrative’s linear momentum and its fixation on male heroism (“I’m not saying this story hasn’t got the makings of an epic, but it isn’t a very satisfying one so far,” writes Haynes, in one of the novel’s delightfully self-reflexive moments).In lieu of one grand narrative, we get a series of slanting, smaller ones: stories of abandonment, heartbreak and rancour. We begin with Jason’s mother, Alcimede. She was never queen because her husband, elder son of the king of Iolcus, weakly ceded his throne to his younger half-brother, Pelias. Now covetous Pelias is sending her only child on an expedition beyond the known world.We get a fresh take on the women of Lemnos and their brutal revenge on the men of the island; here Haynes seems to lean into the quasi-paradox that Homer’s Odyssey is set after the events of the Argonautica but was written before it, to unfold a tale that reads like a dark joke on the ideal of Penelopean fidelity (“Besides, as they said to one another, if weaving was so enjoyable, men would do it”).We also hear from Kleith, who took her own life after her husband Kyzicos – the ruler of the Doliones – was slain by Jason (“I’m just glossed over every time – Kleith with the beautiful hair – as if that tells you who I am or why I did what I did”). Her suicide turns out to be not the height of spousal grief, as is assumed, but an expression of the extreme despair of a childless woman who will remain so, now that she was “the cursed bride of a dead man”.If some parts veer into uninspired tangents, others compel precisely because of their tangentiality. Characters such as Theophane, Ino, Nephele and Helle, who belong to the origin story of the Golden Fleece, are here important presences who contribute as much to the emotional stakes of the novel as to its interrogation of the epic’s masculinist memory. Medea’s sections, particularly those she herself narrates, are the book’s crowning achievement – though they come quite late, nearly halfway through the story.Infamous for the murder of the children she has with Jason, Medea is determined to tell her side of the story, not so much to correct the record as to complicate it (“I will not address these charges at this time. Perhaps I never will. I am simply telling you the truth of things”). Haynes’s debt to Euripides’s Medea is immense (the novel’s title is a reference to Jason’s betrayal, drawn from the play). But there’s something, too, in Haynes’s Medea that recalls Ovid’s understanding of her as a woman hurt and enraged, yes, but also, crucially, a stranger to herself (“I do not know for certain what is in my soul,” reads the last line of Medea’s letter to Jason in Ovid’s poem Heroides). Not all her crimes here are premeditated. The episode where she lures her brother Apsyrtus to his death after he is sent in pursuit of her by their affronted father is a case in point, as is the one where she kills her two boys.Medea is many things: sorceress, disloyal daughter, woman in love, woman wronged, and mother; Haynes pays meticulous attention to each of these many facets. Making changes to some episodes while also proffering insights into Medea’s marriage to Jason and her life as a “barbarian” foreigner in Greece, Haynes creates an account of her maligned protagonist that is powerfully affecting in its complexity.No Friend to This House by Natalie Haynes is published by Mantle (£20).

Around them, as well as rows of football shirts from leagues all over the world, are PCs and monitors with staff watching feeds of the matches. The people playing are from EA’s Design Council, a group of pro players, influencers and fans who regularly come in to play new builds, ask questions and make suggestions. These councils have been running for years, but for this third addition to the EA Sports FC series, the successor to EA’s Fifa games, their input is apparently being treated more seriously than ever.The message to journalists, invited here to get a sneak look at the game, is thata lacklustre responseto EA Sports FC 25 has meant that addressing user feedback is the main focus. EA has set up a new Player Feedback Portal, as well as a dedicated Discord channel, for fans to put forward their concerns. The developer has also introduced AI-powered social listening tools to monitor EA Sports FC chatter across various platforms including X, Instagram and YouTube.View image in fullscreenEA Sports FC 26 – Manuel Neuer pulls off a save.Photograph: Electronic Arts“There were too many disparate groups working on feedback across EA – making it overwhelming for individual teams on the game,” says lead producer, Joel Doonan. “Now we’ve really focused on, how do we make sure the people who need to know what players are saying are getting the right information at the right time with the right amount of detail so they can be as agile as possible?“There’s also been a shift in the proportion of the team’s resources devoted to addressing feedback. We have a continuous development team – 10 engineers solely dedicated to actioning feedback now rather than waiting for FC 27. I think that’s the expectation of players today – the speed at which live service games action on feedback is a heck of a lot faster than it was a handful of years ago.”The major change is a genuine surprise – there are now two completely different play styles to choose between: competitive and authentic. The former is all about speed, fluidity and high goal counts, capturing the turbo-charged pinball-style play of classic Fifa titles while removing real-world elements such as player fatigue. That one is aimed squarely at online competitive modes such as Ultimate Team and Clubs. Meanwhile, the Authentic mode is more of a pure simulation aimed at offline players, with slower buildup play and realistic outcomes.View image in fullscreenEA Sports FC 26 – Rush StadiumPhotograph: Electronic Arts“We had the desire to do this for some time, but we were prioritising other areas,” says gameplay production director, Sam Rivera. “Now however, it’s very clear, based on feedback, that with one single gameplay experience it’s impossible to please the different communities. Some want simulation, some want a more responsive experience where you perhaps have more control over the players instead of the AI helping you with certain behaviours. That creates a skill gap. Obviously maintaining two different game styles is more complex – it’s not just sliders, it’s actual code changes that create different outcomes depending on which different style you’re playing. But we’re in a more appropriate position now to support both in a way that’s close enough to the needs of different communities.”Dribbling is tighter, slicker, with a greater degree of directional freedom for the player. When you get into a scoring position, there’s a new option that lets you tap the shoot button twice to get a powerful low shot, rather than hoofing the ball into row Z. Goalkeeping has been improved with smarter positioning (via new reinforcement learning AI) and better shot-stopping, cutting down the number of times that the ball is punched right back at the attacking player. Similarly, defensive tackles will result in fewer rebounds, but in counterbalance, attacking players have a better ability to shield the ball, especially Enforcer players (think Haaland or Mbappé) will be able to use their body strength to hold off opponents.It seems the development team has been looking at other modern games and genres for inspiration. A new Archetypes feature for the Clubs and Player Career modes, lets you design and build players from 13 different types (with names such as Magician, Recycler and Boss), which work a lot like character classes in role-playing adventures, allowing you to earn experience points and upgrade the player’s stats throughout their career. Elsewhere, the Manager Live Career mode, which lets you guide a head coach across multiple seasons, draws from live service games such as Fortnite. There will be weekly challenges throughout the year, which could set objectives such as being at the top of the league at Christmas. Some might be inspired by unpredictable events from the real-life sport. During our demo presentation, career mode design director Pete O’Donnell points to an interesting example – the food poisoning outbreak that hit Italian Serie-B team Salernitanaat the close of last season. Couldyourteam cope with a diarrhoea epidemic before a crucial playoff match?The game’s most popular element, Ultimate Team, is getting a range of new features. The controversial Panini sticker-style fantasy football mode, where participants build teams by opening randomised digital packets of players which then compete online, is getting a live tournament mode, where linked competitions run for the whole season. A new feature called Bounties provides players with randomised challenges such as “score the first/last goal” or “keep a clean sheet” to ensure even if they lose an online match, they still get rewards. Gauntlets, meanwhile, are quicker live events where competitors must play a series of five matches, each with different players from their squad, so that nobody can just endlessly rely on the same superstar cards.It feels like this focus on user feedback is a well-timed PR exercise as much as a genuine design directive. The recent launch trailer for the game made a big deal of concentrating on in-match footage rather than eye-catching cinematics – the message being, “we’re listening to you, please stick with us”. The timing is vital too. In June, Fifa launched the casual mobile title Fifa Rivals and is sure to be working with developers on a more in-depth footie simulation, possibly in time for the men’s World Cup next year. EA Sports has had this arena to itself for several years, but maybe not for long. Fans were lukewarm about EA Sports FC 25 – their support may soon be more important than ever.EA Sports FC 26 is launched on PC, PS5, Xbox and Switch, 26 September.Keith Stuart attended a press trip to EA Sports Vancouver with other journalists.

Judging by tonight’s audience, you will have a hilarious night. If you are not a fan of the TV series, which ran from 2005 to 2011, there are very few reasons to see this stage version.Writing for the Guardian in 2008,Ben Myers claimed“Ideal is the best British comedy show on TV”. People who love cult shows, really love them. That is palpable in Salford, where creator Graham Duff set the series, and the Lowry is the perfect location to premiere the show ahead of a national tour. You feel the love when the audience applaud and laugh at the lights coming up on the set of Psycho Paul’s “business” headquarters, the entrance of Cartoon Head, the entrance of Psycho Paul, the entrance of Johnny Vegas as Moz, the lights coming up on Moz’s flat … you get the picture. At times it’s like being at a live studio recording.‘We were the runt of the litter at the BBC’: Johnny Vegas and Graham Duff on resurrecting their sitcom IdealRead moreFor the uninitiated, the show has a simple premise: unambitious weed dealer Moz sells his product to a trail of miscreants and misfits visiting his Salford flat. Duff, who wrote all the episodes of Ideal for TV and played the sexually voracious Brian as he does again here, has previously spoken of his hopes for a final series that never came to pass.In this new story, Moz is now living with his girlfriend, Liza (Lucy Farrett), in a flat that takes up half the stage. The other half is the lair of Psycho Paul and Cartoon Head, where they dismember bodies for a charge. Tania (Emma Fryer) turns up with a body she needs disposing of. But the plot isn’t really the thing here.There are a couple of decent jokes, including one about the clitoris being a concept album while “tits are the hits”, but Duff’s clunky direction and the lack of narrative drive make this a piece of theatre that is essentially a nostalgic victory lap for the creators and fans – and not a great deal for anyone else.AtLowry, Salford, until 13 September.

Cow | Deer, an hour-long “experiment in performance”,co-created by director Katie Mitchell, writer Nina Segal and sound artist Melanie Wilson, is a sort of theatrical rewilding as the Upstairs stage is given over to a summer’s day in the life of a heavily pregnant cow and a young roe deer.Past productions at the Court have featured live animals, including half a dozen goats (eponymous stars ofLiwaa Yazji’s play) and a scene-stealing goose (in Jez Butterworth’sThe Ferryman). Here, the pair’s presence is instead painstakingly felt through myriad foley sound effects and field recordings. Standing at hay-bale desks, a cast of four – Pandora Colin, Tom Espiner, Tatenda Matsvai and Ruth Sullivan – get to work making noises with natural materials and manmade objects: gravel and tinsel, raffia and rope, a hot water bottle and a watering can. Plants and herbs are ground up throughout, their scent slowly filling the room.As in Mitchell and Wilson’s version of Rebecca Watson’sLittle Scratch(a human’s day in the life), there is often a comical sense of cause and effect in the ingenuity on display. The birth of a calf is done with a balloon, pak choi and handcream. But all of these identifiable ingredients are transformed into something far greater in a stunning sound design and, like the best puppeteers, these performers bring huge empathy for the lives they convey. Espiner’s expressions alone, during the birthing scene, are extraordinary.View image in fullscreenGreat empathy … Pandora Colin (left) and Ruth Sullivan in Cow | Deer.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThis co-production with the NationalTheatreof Greece is described as a listening experience and you are invited to close your eyes and relax if you so choose but I found that diluted it. Watching the quartet, who at times affect animal-like movements (fists become hooves, a mop is swished like a tail), you adopt not just their shared sense of concentration in the act of creation but also an alertness akin to the animals’ own vigilance.‘We spent a week on the cow birth!’ The eye-opening play about animals with sound effects instead of wordsRead moreThat’s necessary because you need to work hard to keep up. It takes a while for the play’s magic to take hold. You adjust to a landscape where everything and nothing is happening at once, and to a plot with its own dramatic tension and matters of life and death, but only the most subdued murmur of language. I craved a little more signposting along the way. This animal’s-eye-view never shifts your perspective with quite the moxie of Tim Crouch’s talking dog inToto Kerblammo!but it is exquisitely evocative, bolstered by the inventive angles of Prema Mehta’s lighting and Alex Eales’ thicket-like design.More than 10 years have passed since Mitchell directed the scientific lecture2071here, calling for collective action against climate catastrophe. Terrifyingly little has been achieved since. That production sounded the alarm with facts and figures. Cow | Deer, with its sinister roars of transport representing human incursions on the natural world, is far more emotive for placing us in earshot of a fragile ecosystem. And the calf’s birth could be the most captivating stage scene of the year.At theRoyal Court, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreKatie MitchellRoyal Court theatreAnimalsClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

In particular, it was the images Steele-Perkins took in West Belfast during the Troubles that Radden Keefe was drawn to.These images, taken from a tour of Northern Ireland in 1979, included a selection fromthe Divis Flats. The notorious Republican stronghold was the last place Jean McConville was seen alive before she was executed by the IRA for being an alleged informant.View image in fullscreenChris Steele-Perkins at a Magnum meeting in London, 1994.Photograph: Peter Marlow/Magnum PhotosThat murder and its fallout is at the centre of Radden Keefe’s award-winning book Say Nothing, and after the death of Steele-Perkins he wrote that the photographer’s shots of the flats where the story began had been a “huge source of inspiration”.You can see why. Cars are burned out, kids play on a makeshift rope swing, poverty is evident, but often his subjects have smiles on their faces that add a disarming layer to the story that seems toundermine the official narrative. For a writer, trying to bring the past to life, Steele-Perkins’ images were like gold dust.I had a similar reaction to Steele-Perkins’ work when I was writingWe Were There, my cultural history of Black Britain in the Thatcher era. The photographer, who was born in Burma before moving to the north-east of England as a toddler, spent time with Black communities in Wolverhampton, where he was sent for a Sunday Times story, alongside writer Gordon Burn, to cover the town whose MP Enoch Powell had delivered the notoriousRivers of Blood speecha decade earlier.Like the Divis Flats images, that series draws back the curtain on a community often presented as being synonymous with criminality and violence. “It wasn’t the easiest story,”he told the Guardian. “These were slightly pissed-off youth, and they weren’t dying to hang around with me.” But he persevered, capturing raucous church services, football games and sound system crews. When I was discussing cover designs and artwork for my book, one Chris Steele-Perkins image from Wolverhampton kept coming up in conversation.View image in fullscreenPoetry in motion … Wolverhampton Disco, 1978.Photograph: Chris Steele-Perkins/MagnumIt’s an image taken from a dancehall in 1978. In it Steele-Perkins captures poetry in motion, as three women move to the music and a huge soundsystem frames them in the background. Steele-Perkins chose it ashis favourite shotand it’s one that resonates with many people, capturing just what it’s like to be in a dance.I looked at that photograph dozens of times when writing a chapter about Wolverhampton and the emergence ofthe Blk Art Group in the city during the early 1980s. One of the original members of the group, Claudette Johnson, later used it as the basis for a painting called Blues Dance in her solo show atthe Courtauld in 2023.Steele-Perkins was always drawn to the hidden aspects of a community; to what went on behind the headlines. Speaking about his series in West Belfast, he once said: “I was interested in how life was lived in its various facets, not just the rioting and the military occupation, though I couldn’t ignore that which was so prevalent, but also the leisure, the entertainment, the homes, the fun, the funerals and the community. I was not there to illustrate a thesis but to enter the unknown, interacting and responding, and attempting to remain honest.”He took that approach with scenes that sat beyond the mainstream. He spent three years with teddy boys, the groups of young men who emerged in the 1960s with a rockabilly aesthetic and a reputation for violence – especially after their involvement in the Notting Hill race riots of 1958. Despite that reputation, Steele Perkins went into their homes, earned their trust and produced The Teds, an intimate, peerless portrait of the hugely influential subculture.Steele-Perkins’ work has been understandably filed alongside that ofDon McCullin, who was also able to find humanity amid deprivation and conflict. But he was also part of a wider group of artists, public intellectuals and writers who were – though not officially connected – actively producing a counter-narrative to mainstream media in the chaotic 1970s and early 1980s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sloane is best known for co-creating Amazon’s Mr and Mrs Smith series with Donald Glover. Her credits also include writing for Atlanta and Fargo.The news comes on the same day that Deadline alsoreportedan indefinite delay to the second season of Mr and Mrs Smith which had been supposed to star Anora’s Mark Eydelshteyn and the Yellowjackets actor Sophie Thatcher.There is no cast confirmation but it is expected stars Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman will return as both actors and executive producers. Last year Kidman said things weremovingat a “fast and furious” pace and that she had been “texting every day” with Witherspoon.Witherspoonclaimedthat there would be more input from Liane Moriarty, whose book was adapted for the first season. “She’s going to be turning in something very soon,” she said. “We’re back to the original author, and we’re going to go back to the original characters.”Kelley also spoke about an overall enthusiasm to make it happen. “You need to corral a lot of high-caliber talent and their publicists, but everyone is very committed to it,” hesaid.The first season of Big Little Lies, which followed a group of rich women living in California, was a hit with critics and audiences, winning five Emmys and four Golden Globes. But the second season, which introduced Meryl Streep, was seen by many as inferior, with no major award wins and mixed reviews.Explore more on these topicsBig Little LiesUS televisionTelevisionNicole KidmanReese WitherspoonHBOnewsShareReuse this content"

He will appear in The Tempest and, alongside Oscar winner Helen Hunt, in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard at the RSC next summer.Branagh, 64, began to build a reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation when he played Henry V, aged 23, in a 1984 season that included roles as Laertes in Hamlet and the King of Navarre in Love’s Labour’s Lost. The following year he wrote and directed the play Tell Me Honestly for the RSC. Branagh went on to both direct and star in acclaimed Shakespeare productions during an illustrious stage and screen career that has included breaking an Oscars record as the first person to be nominated in seven individual Academy Award categories. The Tempest will mark his first role for the RSC since he played Hamlet in 1992 and 1993 (first at the Barbican in London and then in Stratford), directed by Adrian Noble.The Guardian’s Michael Billington, who predicted “a rich Shakespearean future for this young actor” in his review of Henry V, wrote that in the role of Hamlet, Branagh captured, “as well as any actor I recall, a deep sense of filial love”. He continued: “This is a fine Hamlet, stamped with rueful sadness, that should dispel any doubt about Branagh’s staying power.”View image in fullscreenKenneth Branagh in the film Henry V in 1989.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyThe Tempest was the first play Branagh saw as an audience member in Stratford, when he sat in the gods for a 1978 production starring Michael Hordern, David Suchet, Alan Rickman and Ruby Wax. In 2012, wearing a top hat in character as the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Branagh delivered a speech by Caliban from The Tempest (“the isle is full of noises”) at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games in London. He will now take on the part of the magician Prospero, who gives the famous “Our revels now are ended” speech, in what is billed as an “epic new staging” of the shipwreck drama directed by Richard Eyre and with a set design by Bob Crowley. The Tempest begins previews on 13 May in the Royal Shakespeare theatre.It will be followed, in the smaller Swan theatre, by The Cherry Orchard, which opens in July. Branagh will play Lopakhin alongside Hunt as Madame Ranevskaya in a new version of the play by Laura Wade and directed by Tamara Harvey, who runs the RSC with Daniel Evans. Wade and Harvey are frequent collaborators and recently teamed up for a new version of Somerset Maugham’sThe Constant Wifein Stratford. Hunt, who played Viola in Twelfth Night on Broadway in 1998, was last on stage in the UK inEureka Dayat the Old Vic in 2022.View image in fullscreenJoanne Pearce as Ophelia and Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet at the Barbican theatre, London, in 1992.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMark Gatiss will also appear with the RSC next year, making his debut for the company in the lead role of a Chicago mobster, modelled on Hitler, in Bertolt Brecht’s political satire The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui. Stephen Sharkey’s version of the play will be directed by Seán Linnen in the Swan from April to May. Gatiss called it “Brecht’s most accessible and dynamic work … The play is always timely but to say it’s urgent now is an understatement. With fascism on the march everywhere, the story of how a washed-up nonentity like Hitler could seduce a nation and become the most powerful dictator in the world serves as a terrifying warning.”The RSC’s spring season includes, in the Other Place (its third stage in Stratford), actor Martina Laird’s debut as a playwright, Driftwood, about capitalism and colonialism in Trinidad. The play, which was the runner-up for the 2024 Verity Bargate award, will be directed by Justin Audibert and will transfer to the Kiln theatre in London. Also in the Other Place, Rachel Bagshaw will stage a new version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, edited by Robin Belfield, that will move to Stratford after its run at the Unicorn theatre in London.Explore more on these topicsTheatreKenneth BranaghRoyal Shakespeare CompanyWilliam ShakespeareHelen HuntMark GatissnewsShareReuse this content"

I never intended to retire, really. I just stopped doing that particular type of work so I could do some other work.”He added: “Apparently, I’ve been accused of retiring twice now. I never meant to retire from anything! I just wanted to work on something else for a while.”Day-Lewis announced his retirement from acting in 2017after the release ofPhantom Thread, a film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson in which he played a dress designer. In a statement at the time his representative said: “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor … This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.”Day-Lewis previously “retired” from film acting between completing The Boxer (1997) and starring in Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York (2002) – part of which time he reportedly spent working as an apprentice for celebrated Italian shoemaker Stefano Bemer. In 1989,he appeared to quit stage acting permanentlywhile performing as Hamlet at the National Theatre in London.View image in fullscreenDaniel Day-Lewis in 2017’s Phantom Thread, which he said ‘left me feeling hollowed out’.Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarHowever, the prospect of working with his son on a film project appears to have spurred him to return. Day-Lewis said: “As I get older, it just takes me longer and longer to find my way back to the place where the furnace is burning again. But working with Ro, that furnace just lit up. And it was, from beginning to end, just pure joy to spend that time together with him.”He added: “It was just kind of a low-level fear, [an] anxiety about re-engaging with the business of film-making. The work was always something I loved. I never, ever stopped loving the work. But there were aspects of the way of life that went with it that I’d never come to terms with – from the day I started out to today.”First trailer released for Daniel Day-Lewis’s comeback film, AnemoneRead moreDay-Lewis has won a record three Oscars for best actor, for My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln, and was nominated for three further times, for In the Name of the Father, Gangs of New York and Phantom Thread. Anemone is due to receive its world premiere at theNew York film festival in September.Referring toPhantom Thread, Day-Lewis said: “There’s something about [the acting] process that left me feeling hollowed out at the end of it … I understood that it was all part of the process, and that there would be a regeneration eventually. And it was only really in the last experience [of making Phantom Thread] that I began to feel quite strongly that maybe there wouldn’t be that regeneration any more. That I just probably should just keep away from it, because I didn’t have anything else to offer.”“But looking back on it now – I would have done well to just keep my mouth shut.”Explore more on these topicsFilmDaniel Day-LewisPhantom ThreadnewsShareReuse this content"

How can you make the most of your visit and achieve the best possible look? Stylists share their tips for getting a cut that suits you – and avoiding a hairdo disaster.Work out what styles suit youThis is “the million-dollar question, with no straightforward answer”, saysCharlotte Mensah, an afro and curly hair specialist and founder of The Hair Lounge on Portobello Road in London. “The truth is, the best style for you will always come down to how you feel about yourself. That’s inescapable. Confidence is what allows you to wear any cut proudly, but there’s also nothing wrong with letting your face shape and features guide your choice.”“There are a few things to take into consideration,” agreesNaomi Brooks, an independent stylist and former salon owner based in Manchester. “Your hair type: is your hair fine? Medium? Thick? Face shape: do you need something that frames your face, or takes your hair away from your face? And lifestyle: do you have the time to maintain certain hairstyles, or do you need something that’s easy and low maintenance?”“I don’t subscribe to this idea about face shapes: you can have this because your face is like that, and you can’t have that,” says Luke Hersheson, the CEO ofHershesonsand author ofGreat Hair Days: & How to Have Them. “I’m a big believer that everyone can have everything within reason: there is a bob, a short haircut, a long haircut for everyone.”Be honest with yourself about what you can pull offView image in fullscreenTake advice … chat with your hairdresser about what you want and they will advise you.Photograph: Cavan Images/Alamy“Suitability is key,” says Cos Sakkas, global creative director ofToni & GuyandBritish Hairdresser of the Year 2024. “You might want something but, if it doesn’t work for you, it is going to look terrible.” When Sakkas meets new clients, he finds out about their life to figure out which styles are best. When not in the Toni & Guy Covent Garden salon, Sakkas teaches at the academy, where they are currently cutting a lot of bobs and mullets – luckily, the models can usually pull these off, whereas many of us might struggle with the latter.Have a consultation before doing anything drastic“A thorough consultation is essential when finding the right stylist,” says Mensah. “Use it to ask about their training, whether the style you want is high or low maintenance, and what aftercare and follow-up visits they recommend.”“When I do a consultation,” says Hersheson, “I spend the first five to 10 minutes just listening and asking questions. If you feel really listened to before a hairdresser starts telling you what they think, that is a really good sign. Our job is to offer an opinion about what people should have. But you can’t offer an opinion until you have really understood how someone wears their hair, what they love about it, what they hate about it.”View image in fullscreen‘Thinking of a mullet? Seek advice first...’Photograph: Posed by modelda; niromphoto/Getty ImagesBring along visualsGone are the days of flicking through hair magazines at a salon – now it’s all about coming armed with images from Instagram, says Sakkas.“What is really important are visuals,” he says. “I will always ask, ‘Have you seen something you’ve been inspired by?’ Everybody sees a celebrity, model, or influencer who they love.” Sakkas stresses the importance of bringing pictures along to an appointment, recalling a client who asked for a Natalie Imbruglia look without showing a picture: he gave her a pixie crop, rather than the more mid-length style she had in mind. Luckily, it grew on her.View image in fullscreenFind images of what you want to show your hairdresser and avoid hair disasters.Photograph: Plume Creative/Getty Images“My advice is to build up a Pinterest board of things you like,” says Hersheson. Then, “I’d seek out great people who can help achieve that. You now have this amazing ability to seek out stylists and almost try before you buy, because you can see their work on social media. It means that, by the time you get into a chair, you feel more relaxed because you know they are talking your language.”Hersheson adds: “You don’t want to feel like a hairdresser is snooty about looking at pictures. This would be a bit of a red flag. Imagery is really important because one person’s creamy blond is another person’s yellow, and one person’s layer is another person’s shag.”Get to know your stylist“I’ve got clients who have been with me longer than I’ve had children,” says Mensah, whose eldest is 33. “You can spend four hours at a time in that chair: you need to like the person doing your hair, and feel comfortable enough to be open with them. That rapport is everything.”“I think big [hair] changes reflect big changes in an individual’s life or relationship,” says Sakkas. “I will ask: what has made you come to this decision? Once I have an understanding of that, I am able to relate with them more.” Rather than making polite conversation about holidays during a cut, Sakkas likes to explain to clients what he is doing.Hersheson regularly cuts the hair of some very famous people, including Victoria Beckham, Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley. Does he ever get nervous? “A lot of the people I work with, I’ve had long relationships with, so I suppose it’s about building trust. When you work with someone for the first time, it’s a bit more daunting. You have to build that relationship.”View image in fullscreenGood rapport … take advice from a hairdresser who you trust.Photograph: Tatsiana Volkava/Getty ImagesIf a hairdresser tries to talk you out of something, listen“The most common thing I have to talk people out of, or rather provide another perspective on, is the big chop,” says Mensah. “A lot of people don’t have healthy hair, and the most radical but logical solution is often to cut your hair off. But that is simply not a decision you make on a whim. If someone books in for a wash, cut and blowdry, but decides to go for a big chop after five minutes in the salon, we need to have a conversation. It’s not to discourage them but to be sure this is the decision they want to make.”“Most of the time, I have to talk people into it,” Sakkas says with a laugh. “I will never talk somebody out of having a restyle unless it’s going to be an absolute disaster.”“If it’s not going to be good for the hair, I’ll refuse,” says Brooks. “We’re all about healthy hair and, if it’s going to compromise that, I won’t do it.”Say if you don’t like looking in the mirrorIf you can’t bear looking at your reflection during an appointment, you are not alone. “Let your stylist know,” says Sakkas. “They can move your chair so you don’t have to look at yourself.” Alternatively, bring a book, listen to a podcast “or even just close your eyes, relax and let us do all the work. A haircut should feel like self-care, not something uncomfortable and awkward”.Don’t be afraid to go back if you aren’t happyIt takes time to get used to a new haircut, the stylists agree. “It can take a few days or even a week for your brain to adjust to a new look after a dramatic change,” says Mensah. If you still aren’t happy, “contact the salon to speak with your stylist or a manager about the issue,” she says: most salons will be happy to arrange for a complimentary adjustment.“What I find is that a client will decide to go elsewhere because they’re too embarrassed to come back,” says Sakkas. “You dump a problem on another hairdresser. If you were to go back to your hairdresser, it might just need a tiny tweak,” like a bit of weight being taken out or some advice on how to finish it. “Generally, the unhappiness is because you’re not used to it, and it can be fixed really easily.”“The worst thing that someone could do is go and slate that stylist on Google,” says Hersheson. “And that happens, unfortunately.” Instead: “Always go back and discuss it,” he says.Embrace greysHair changes as we become older: “It is simply a part of the aging process,” says Mensah. “The way I deal with greys is by wearing them. They came out of my head after all; what else can I do, if not embrace them?”Grey is now a massive trend, says Brooks; instead of spending a fortune on covering them up, people are “free to be who they are”.View image in fullscreenIn vogue … going naturally grey is in fashion.Photograph: Isabel Pavia/Getty ImagesIf you do want to delve into colouring, “think about what suits your skin tone, your lifestyle, your personal style,” says Mensah. “Colour should feel like an extension of your story. It’s not just about following trends, it’s about finding shades that empower you.”Be prepared to put the work in between cuts“Taking care of your hair at home is just as important as what happens in the salon,” says Mensah. “Think of your routine as an extension of the work your stylist has set in motion. Without it, you won’t see the same lasting results. For afro and textured hair especially, consistency is everything; keeping your strands hydrated, protecting them at night, and handling them gently are the pillars of healthy hair. What I do in the chair lays the foundation, but what you do day to day is what allows your hair to truly flourish.”“Invest in good shampoos and conditioners,” says Hersheson. “You get what you pay for and a lot of the cheaper ranges are very cosmetic based: they have cheap silicones in them that are not particularly beneficial in the long term. I would invest in good-quality stuff.” How much should you be spending? “North of £20, unfortunately,” says Hersheson.Make sure you don’t leave it too long to get a tidy up. “Six to eight weeks has been the traditional period between visits,” says Sakkas. “If you have a shorter haircut, then six to eight weeks sits perfectly. If you have a really short crop, six to eight weeks can make a big difference to the original style. If you have longer hair, you can get away with eight to 10 weeks.”There is no shame in having the same style if it worksView image in fullscreenDon’t feel the need for change. If you like a style, stick with it, and ignore fashion.Photograph: Tatiana Maksimova/Getty Images“I haven’t changed my hair in the last six years. I’ve been wearing it natural and fully embracing my texture,” says Mensah.“When you have a length that works for you, there are so many different variations,” says Sakkas. “You can create three or four different styles, depending on your mood, how professional or how ‘Sunday afternoon’ you want it.”“Beyoncé has had the same shade and pretty much the same style throughout her career,” says Brooks. “Some people do just have that signature look and that is OK: it is about enhancing that with different things, like a pop of colour, or changing the layers slightly.”My hair started thinning straight out of high school. At 24, I embraced the inevitable | Brodie WilkinsonRead moreKnow that even the pros have made mistakes“When I started hairdressing,” says Sakkas, “I had hair past my shoulders, and then I got it cut into a short crop and bleached it. I’m not sure it was really right for me.”“Back in the late 80s and early 90s, I experimented with all sorts of crazy hairstyles,” admits Mensah. “One that stands out was a cut where the back of my head was shaved, and the rest was coloured orange and shaped into a bob – very Salt-N-Pepa-inspired. My father was convinced there was something wrong with me.”Hersheson recalls having a spiky boyband-inspired look in the noughties. “These things feel right in the moment,” he says. And, if not, it will almost always grow back.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She says she’s just helping to save the planet. You decide whose argument is rubbishFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 11 Sep 2025 03.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 11.59 EDTShareThe prosecution: DarrylAbi is an amazing person and full of heart, but litter-picking is dirty and makes her depressedMy girlfriend Abi is such a good person. It’s why I fell in love with her a year ago. Her heart is huge and she is passionate about so many social causes, but sometimes her “save the world” ethos can be annoying.Case in point: she loves picking up litter that isn’t hers. Maybe loves is too strong a word, but she can’t help herself when it comes to picking up rubbish, and sometimes I feel it’s unnecessary. If she sees a piece of rubbish on the pavement, she will pick it up. It grosses me out a bit, knowing how dirty the streets are.If we’re walking our dog, Luna, Abi will also pick up poo from other people’s dogs. I think: “Come on, you don’t have to do that – no one else does.” It’s just not the done thing. It slows our walks down, and then I get worried Abi is going to get dirty from doing all this “community service”.It’s lovely that Abi cares so much about the planet, but she has OCD and anxiety and she can get stressedDon’t get me wrong, I think being a good citizen is generally a positive thing – just not all the time, and with rubbish. Abi also does beach cleans at the weekend near where we live. She ropes me in sometimes and I am happy to do them, but it’s hard work and also quite depressing when you see the rubbish on the beach at almost the same level a month later.Obviously, it’s lovely that Abi cares so much about the world around her – she can also get obsessive about recycling – but sometimes it gets her down, too. She has OCD and anxiety, and she can get stressed when she is overworked. She loves to watch documentaries about the fishing industry or fast fashion, but then she can get really down and bemoan the state of the world for hours.I comfort her when she gets upset and I think she makes me a better person, but sometimes I want her to protect her own peace a little more. If we are out and about, I think she should leave some of the litter for other people, or the binmen, to pick up. It might help her feel a little less responsible for other people’s mess and help her calm down overall.The defence: AbiDarryl thinks helping the planet is someone else’s problem. We all have a responsibility to muck inSometimes Darryl’s “don’t worry” attitude drives me up the wall. With rubbish in the streets, he absolutely refuses to pick up litter that isn’t ours, whereas I think: “If I’m walking past it, I’ll take it home or put it in the bin.”Darryl thinks that if he touches a crisp packet on the pavement that isn’t his, he will catch some kind of disease. He acts like it’s disgusting, even when I’ve got hand sanitiser ready. I think it’s an excuse because he just doesn’t want to pick up rubbish.I also think he doesn’t want to look silly and he feels stupid doing something that he regards as someone else’s problem. But if we all left litter-picking to someone else, the world would be even messier than it is now. If we’re walking Luna and I spot someone else’s dog mess, I’ll clear it – I’m already cleaning up one poo, I might as well take another with me.Darryl thinks that if he touches a crisp packet on the pavement, he will catch some kind of diseaseI noticed when we moved in together that Darryl didn’t like recycling. He would chuck something in the general bin if the recycling one was full. I’d tell him off. With the beach cleans, he has been to about four with me, but he says he finds it “depressing” or “pointless” because the beach looks the same a month later. To me, that’s exactly why we need to keep going.Darryl also avoids “depressing” documentaries. I’ll watch them, get upset, and want to talk about what we can do. He changes the subject or tries to lighten the mood. He tells me I should stop caring so much, that it’s bad for my mental health. I know I can be intense – I have OCD and anxiety – but ignoring the problems doesn’t make them go away. I work in the charity sector and want to help out where I can.I love Darryl. I know he thinks he’s protecting me by encouraging me to look after my mental health, but sometimes it feels as if he’d rather I shrink my world down to just us, instead of engaging with it properly. Darryl needs to let me pick up the rubbish when I want, and even join in once in a while.

All relationships need an element of compromise but I don’t see how this is putting Darryl out, apart from grossing him out a bit. He also benefits from a nicer local area.Lee, 49Abi is a model citizen for picking up other people’s rubbish, other dogs’ poop and for cleaning up beaches, and Darryl should absolutely follow her example. But even the best of citizens deserve some downtime, so maybe they could skip the documentaries. You’re doing enough, Abi; chill out and watch a nice movie.Patrick, 57Darryl could learn from Abi to be more conscientious – she is an inspiration to us all! If this is part of the reason why you fell in love with her, then try to enjoy it. Your reasons for asking her to stop sound very self-interested.Arnie, 46I do admire Abi for what she is trying to do, but I also sympathise with Darryl. It must be annoying if you can’t go for a walk without your girlfriend continually stopping to pick up random clumps of dog poo. As a compromise, maybe Abi could only do that when she’s alone.Bee, 58We could all take a leaf out of Abi’s book. Darryl, quit whining and talk to Abi about the environment after you two watch a documentary together.

From budget-friendly and refillable options to cult favourites, these are the ones worth buyingSarah MatthewsThu 11 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 10.02 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Brands and retailers are releasing their 2025 calendars, many of which sell out long before you start to feel festive.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Offering a selection of high-end cosmetics for less than their usual price, beauty Advent calendars have become a holy grail for the beauty obsessed. There are hundreds to choose from at wildly different prices, some focusing on specific product types, and some filled with a mixture of bestsellers.So, to help with choice paralysis, I’ve been trawling the shelves for calendars filled with cult favourites suitable for a range of skin types and preferences, narrowing down the eight best beauty Advent calendars of the 2025 season.While these Advent calendars can’t exactly be seen as a net positive for the environment, I also looked at their recyclability and for calendars with the broadest possible appeal, to avoid any wasted products.At a glanceBest beauty Advent calendar overall:Space NK Beauty£260 at Space NKBest value beauty Advent calendar:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendar£150 at BootsBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendar£205 at LushBest for product range:Cult Beauty the Classic Curation£240 at Cult BeautyBest entry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar£19.95 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI make a living testing health and beauty products, from hair masks andhair dryerstobody moisturisersand concealers. That means I’m more familiar with the best formulations than many beauty fanatics.Testing hundreds of products means I’ve become an expert in all things skincare, hair care and makeup – the main contents of beauty Advent calendars. I also have a certification in cosmetic science, so I know how to identify the best products for specific skin and hair needs. As someone with sensitive skin, I also know which ingredients are likely to irritate, so I’ve only selected calendars where products are suitable for most people – so that nothing goes to waste.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI judged each beauty Advent calendar on its product range, the broad usefulness of those products to most people, and the quality and sustainability of its packaging.I longlisted 22 of the most popular calendars from department stores and brands, narrowing down my options based on the contents of each calendar. I then shortlisted the 12 calendars with the best product range and value for money to test at home.Getting hands on with each calendar gave me a better idea of how it is packaged and delivered, its quality and feel, and the merits and size of the products inside. From a sustainability perspective, I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging. The goodies inside the calendars generally came in packaging that can be recycled at home, but all can otherwise be taken to one of many cosmetic recycling schemes, where pumps, sprays and bottles can be recycled properly. These include Space NK’s collaboration withHandle, and theRecycle at Boots scheme, which gets you extra points on your Advantage card for every empty you return.Most Advent calendars are designed to have broad appeal, but I also assessed how useful each selection of products would be. For makeup, that meant looking for neutral, wearable shades, rather than wild fluorescent colours. For hair care, I looked for formulas that help condition and improve all hair, rather than a specific hair type. I also liked to see gentler skin care products that help with common skin concerns, such as dullness, hydration levels and barrier health, although I didn’t mind an occasional anti-ageing product or spot treatment as these also have a wide appeal.Testing 12 Advent calendars left me with more cosmetics and products than I could ever feasibly use. In instances where I wouldn’t or couldn’t use something from inside the calendars, I donated samples to theRedbridge Reach Outdomestic abuse service, where they could be given to women and young people seeking refuge from domestic violence. If you end up with products you won’t use, it’s always worth looking for a local beauty bank that will take donations, or give items to friends and family.Our favourite beauty Advent calendars in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest beautyAdvent calendar overall:Space NK BeautyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£260 at Space NKLuxury beauty retailer Space NK has been at the forefront of high-end skincare, body care, hair care and makeup since its inception. Its 2025 beauty Advent calendar covers all these bases, with 35 cult favourites to last you well into 2026. With 26 full-size products from big-name brands, this is a seriously good beauty haul.Why we love itWith full-size makeup from Hourglass, Rare Beauty and Charlotte Tilbury; hair care from K18 and Olaplex; and skincare from Paula’s Choice and Laneige, this calendar will keep even the fussiest beauty fanatics happy.It’s especially strong for skincare, with two full-size cleansers, a Medik8 Liquid Peptides serum, a Paula’s Choice pro-collagen peptide moisturiser and the new Inkey List Ectoin Hydro-barrier serum. None of these is likely to cause problems for most people’s skin.In the mix you’ll also find hair care from Dyson, Augustinus Bader retinol serum and the popular Colour Wow Dream Coat – a powerful styling spray, good for adding shine to unruly hair. Add in two mini perfumes to chuck in your handbag, and you’ve got a selection that’s hard to beat.Better still, the packaging is fully recyclable, so you can pop the calendar in your normal recycling bin. Space NK has also partnered withHandle, a company that recycles beauty empties. So if you have a Space NK store or other Handle drop-off location nearby, you can drop off the empties from the calendar, along with any others, and they’ll take care of the rest.It’s a shame that …it’s pretty expensive, and the hair accessory included was absolutely no match for my thick hair. You can forget doing full up-dos with this, but half-up-half-down styles are definitely achievable.Number of products:35 (26 full size, 9 mini)Overall value:approx £1,150Packaging:domestically recyclableBest value beautyAdvent calendar:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£150 at BootsCheaper Advent calendars are usually filled with a lot of mini products, but Boots’ Advent calendar has a good range of full-size products from big-name brands. It might not seem cheap at £150, but the skincare, hair care and makeup inside is worth £612.50.Why we love itIt really looks the part, with a circus-themed chest design that opens to reveal individually wrapped goodies for every day untilChristmasEve. Despite its substantial design, it’s still fully recyclable.Highlights include a full-size viral Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide cream, and a cleansing gel from Estée Lauder. There’s also a mini-size Elemis cleansing balm – used together, these three make an effective, gentle evening skincare routine most people will love. You’ll also find crowd-pleaser fragrances from Sol de Janeiro and Floral Street.But it’s the makeup that really makes this calendar standout. There are five full-size makeup products inside: a face powder palette from Iconic London, a Fenty liquid lipstick, a shimmery lip oil from Too Faced, a Mac lip liner and the Nars light reflecting hydrating primer. There are also minis of the Benefit Hoola bronzer, Mac Velvet Teddy lipstick, a MilkMakeuphighlighter, Laneige lip balm and Laura Mercier loose-setting powder. All staples that will make great additions to any makeup bag.It’s a shame that …there are only two haircare products, so if this is what you’re after, opt for a different calendar.Number of products:25 (17 full size, 8 mini)Overall value:£612.50Packaging:domestically recyclableBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£205 at LushIf your favourite part of the day is bath time, or you’re hoping to buy an Advent calendar the whole family can enjoy, this colourful option from Lush is my pick. Lush releases a few calendars each year, but this refillable chest is my recommendation: it’s perfect for storing your Lush products, and can be refilled for less money (and packaging) when the brand releases its 2026 calendar next year.Why we love itLush is most known for its fun, freshly made bath bombs – this calendar comes with bombs and bubble bars. Some have sweet scents, others are spiced; all of them are vegan and cruelty-free. If you’re a Lush lover, you’ll have no trouble working your way through this haul.You’ll also get four festive shower gels, two body lotions – including my longtime favourite festive Lush scent, Yog Nog – two soaps, a perfume and a lip scrub. For cosy festive evenings, there are also Lush socks and a Christmas Eve scented candle – no prizes for guessing which door that is hiding behind.This year’s refillable calendar was designed in partnership with Artbox London, a charity that runs workshops for people with learning disabilities and neurodivergent artists. Artist Shruti Gadhvi, who designed this year’s box, took inspiration from the practice of meditation, positive affirmations and the flowers and colours she sees on her travels.It’s a shame that …it’s quite expensive and it’s difficult to calculate the overall value since 10 items are exclusive.Number of products:25Overall value:not statedPackaging:refillable or domestically recyclable (bar the ribbon, which can be reused)Best for product range:Cult Beauty the Classic CurationView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£240 at Cult BeautyIf the products in the Space NK calendar don’t tickle your fancy, chances are you’ll find something to love in this equally bumper-size offering from Cult Beauty. With 34 products inside 25 drawers, this calendar has skincare favourites to help repair stressed-out winter skin, as well as a few standout makeup products to add to your kit.Why we love itIt’s beautiful to look at and the recyclable packaging feels sturdy and luxurious. It comes with a solid selection of skincare that should help relieve dryness and plump up sensitive skin. That includes a Summer Fridays hydration mist, a Paula’s Choice barrier repair moisturiser and a Byoma Phyto-Mucin glow serum.Those looking for more targeted skincare will find the Elemis Pro-Collagen toning mist, a Medik8 C-Tetra advanced serum, and the spot-fighting Oil La La serum from Krave. All are useful when a spot pops up, or when your skin needs brightening up after a night on the fizz.For hair care you’ll find a scalp recovery serum from Philip Kingsley, a K18 Molecular Repair hair mask and Hair by Sam McKnight’s Love Me Do nourishing hair oil. Great for hair that’s been depleted by winter.This calendar doesn’t scrimp on makeup, either. Inside, you’ll find a powder blush duo from Patrick Ta, a blush from Saie and a Charlotte Tilbury beauty light wand. There’s also a mini By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra Powder, a translucent powder I recently fell in love with – it sets my makeup in place without drying out my skin..skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Inside, you’ll find 24 boxes, each filled with bestsellers from the W7 range, including seven full-size products and 19 minis.Why we love itGood beauty Advent calendars are generally pricey, but the products included in the W7 Advent calendar can rival some of the best in the business.All in, the product selection here is pretty useful for most people – I can’t see any makeup lovers struggling to include these in their routine. I particularly love the brand’s lip liners – you’ll get two in this calendar – and its H2O loose powder sets makeup without causing dryness. Also included is a mini Honolulu Sun Rays bronzer, famously similar to the Benefit Hoola bronzer. Another highlight is the Edgy mascara, which has a curved wand to help lift and curl the lashes as well as biotin, castor oil and vitamin B5 to condition the lashes.The travel-size eyeshadows, primers, lip balms, eye creams and liquid blushes are perfect if you’re just starting out with makeup and want to try new formulations and styles without remortgaging your home. For the cost, this calendar is perfect for those hoping to try out new, budget-friendly products.It’s a shame that …it’s mainly filled with travel minis, though this is perhaps expected given the price.Number of products:24 (7 full size, 17 mini)Overall value:not listedPackaging:domestically recyclableThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSentier Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99 at SentierBest for:fragrance loversThis 12-day calendar (designed for the 12 days of Christmas, so not strictly Advent) from Sentier comes with a range of perfumes and candles to see you through the festive season. It’s beautifully designed and surprisingly well priced considering how long-lasting and potent the scents are.Sentier describes the box it comes in as “meticulously crafted”. It’s certainly the most distinctive calendar of the lot, with doors and drawers opening in unexpected directions to reveal what’s inside.In the box, you’ll get six 10ml alcohol-free scents in pretty glass bottles. In my experience, each scent was distinct, wearable and versatile enough to layer, making them perfect for popping in a handbag. You’ll also get six scented candles, each 60ml in size. I found that these wafted scent around my flat beautifully.It didn’t make the final cut because …there is a soft foam included in the bottom of each drawer, to keep the candle safe. This isn’t recyclable, despite the box being mainly made from card.Number of products:12;overall value:£516;packaging:not fully recyclableBamford ultimate Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£300 at BamfordBest for:self-care and wellbeingIf you’re into baths and self-care rituals but have more refined taste (and a higher budget) than Lush, this celestial-themed Advent calendar from Bamford is a more indulgent option. It comes with a whole host of Bamford favourites, including 13 full-size products and 11 minis to help you wind down during the hectic festive period.In the full-size collection, you’ll find the brand’s bestselling perfume mist, two candles, body oil, bath oil and relaxing bath salts. In mini-size, you’ll find a range of body washes, lotions and hair care – less environmentally friendly perhaps, but handy to take on your travels over Christmas.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s very expensive. And its ratio of full-size to mini products could be better, considering the price.Number of products:24 (13 full size, 11 mini);overall value:approx £600;packaging:domestically recyclableDiptyque Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399 at DiptyqueBest for:luxury fragranceDiptyque is the first brand that comes to mind when I think of luxury fragrance, and its 2025 Advent calendar has a huge selection of its bestselling fragrances packed in. That’s both mini and full-size candles, seven different perfumes, and a hand cream, an oil and soaps to make your festive season smell great.It’s also one of the most beautiful designs I’ve tried out this year, with a book-shaped box that opens to reveal 25 smaller boxes adorned with book illustrations and the signature Diptyque cat. It will look great surrounded by Christmas decorations throughout December, though its good looks come at a luxury price point.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s incredibly expensive, with more reasonably priced competition, and there’s no indication of the calendar’s overall value. That said, perfume fans with deep pockets will love it.Number of products:25;overall value:not stated;packaging:about 90% recyclable; only one drawer has polystyrene in itWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianAre beauty Advent calendars worth it?This depends. If your beauty routine is in need of a refresh and you want to try lots of new products, beauty Advent calendars allow you to do that for a reduced price.Case in point: the Space NK listed above has 35 products with a total value of £1,150. It costs £260, so in theory saves you £890.However, if you have a set beauty routine that works, then the mixed calendars might not be worth it. In this case, a scent-based or body-care Advent calendar may be more suitable as the products are less specific; a series of treats to enjoy rather than a whole new routine.How much should you expect to spend?Beauty Advent calendars can cost anything from £20 to £500 (or more), so there’s something to suit every budget. At the lower end of the scale, you can expect to find calendars from high-street brands, often with mini-size products inside. The packaging on these calendars is likely to be flimsier.Move up to the £100-£200 price range and you can dip your toes into high-end brand calendars, or the department store Advent calendars, which contain a mix of bestselling products from a range of brands. The latter might work best if you’re buying a calendar as a gift, especially if you don’t know which brands the recipient likes best.At the top end of the scale, you’ll find beauty Advent calendars from exclusive high-end brands, usually containing mostly full-size products. Packaging for these calendars is typically more sculptural and eye-catching, but they also come with a high price tag of more than £200.Why are beauty Advent calendars released so early?Planning, organising and launching an Advent calendar takes a long time. Think about how many products are included in the major beauty retailer’s calendar. Then think about how much organisation it takes to coordinate with each brand on products to fit in each Advent calendar window. Add on to that marketing materials and imagery, and you’ve got a project that starts production almost as soon as the new year hits.Typically, brands release their calendars so early because it allows them to anticipate how much stock they need to order. As I’m writing this piece in August, many have already opened their waitlists, which helps them gauge how much interest there is in the calendar before it drops. When calendars go on sale in the autumn, it’s usually the case that when stock sells out, it’s gone for good.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who can’t quite believe she gets to spend her days reviewing beauty products.

So sue me – it’s been hot. Mercifully, though, temperatures look to be dropping soon, so we can once again cup the bowl of a wine glass without worrying about it getting a little warmer as its aromas unfasten.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To help us wean ourselves off sprightly rosés and buttery whites, let’s turn our heads to easy-drinking reds – and none are more easy to drink or of the moment than Portuguese red blends. These wines are uniquely indicative of the country’s winemaking history, with more than 250 native grapes (some of which have different names from region to region), but I’d wager that many of us wouldn’t be able to name many more than two of these indigenous varieties. To start with there’s the sumptuousbaga,touriga nacional(widely considered to be Portugal’s fine red grape variety) andcastelão, which yields a variety of styles, but that’s just a handful, and it’s very likely you’ve drunk one or all of them before.Why, then, are Portuguese single varietal wines (that is, those featuring only one type of grape) so hard to come by? There are a few reasons for this. First, so-called “vineyard” or “field blends” are so common in Portugal because old vines of different varieties are often planted side by side, rather than separated by type, as in most commercial vineyards. It’s therefore the norm here to make blends, which is a far easier option than the painstaking process of separating harvests or even replanting entire vineyards.Then there’s the fact that most drinkers simply aren’t as familiar with Portuguese grape varieties as they are with those of other countries. Sinéad Murdoch, sommelier atnomadic London restaurant Tasca, has worked four harvests in the country, and has consistently put its field blends on her lists over the years, so why does she think they’re so popular? “Customers are now used to seeing the words ‘field blend’,” she explains, “while Portuguese wine has boomed in the UK thanks to its great value and to tourism, but most people still aren’t familiar with the native grapes, which can put them off. If I list a wine as 100% baga, only a few curious guests are likely to ask about it, because most customers pick a red they know. When it’s a blend, however, people say they love a Portuguese blend and it flies off the shelves!”They’re also brilliant value: “Modal Wines, for instance, sells a tinto blend bag-in-box to restaurants that works out to about £7 a bottle, which is a no-brainer for an easy-drinking and also delicious wine.”Four Portuguese reds to pique your interestSainsbury’s Taste the Difference Portuguese Lisboa Red Wine£7.75, 13.5%.A spicy and full blend of syrah, touriga nacional and tinta roriz.No 1 Douro Valley Reserva Quinta da Rosa Portugal£15 Waitrose, 13.5%.

Once out of the oven, but still sealed, the scented steam trapped in the paper returns to liquid and creates a brothy sauce.Fishwith firm white or pink flesh that breaks into fat flakes is particularly well suited to cooking al cartoccio, both whole fish (cleaned and on the bone) and individual filets (estimate 110g-140g per person).When choosing fish, keep in mind our collective default to cod and haddock, both members of the so-called “big five” that make up a staggering 80% of UK consumption. Instead, look out for other species, such as hake, huss or North Sea plaice, ASC-certified Scottish salmon, sea trout or farmed rainbow trout. For more detailed and updated advice, the Marine Conservation Society producesan invaluable, area-by-area good fish guidethat uses a five-tiered system to rank both “best choice” and “fish to avoid” based on the species, location and fishing method. Also, don’t forget how well fish freezes, so always check the frozen food section, too.Typical seasonings for fish cooked al cartoccio are lemon, parsley, olive oil and salt, maybe a dash of dry vermouth or wine, which, when combined, produce a wonderful, fresh-tasting broth. A change, and a seasonal, summery variation is to sit the fish on segments of fleshy sweet tomatoes, which (especially if the tomato is peeled and the seeds flicked away) collapse into an almost-sauce reminiscent of puttanesca, along with olive oil, slivers of garlic, small black olives and capers or caper berries. I also like a few fennel seeds or feathery fresh fennel fronds, which add a pleasing, aniseed note, if you like that sort of thing.To protect the precious juices, I lift the pouches on to plates and let everyone open their own, but not without a warning that the steam can puff out quite aggressively. Once everyone has carefully tipped everything on to their plate, pass around buttered potatoes, rice, couscous or toast rubbed with garlic and olive oil; mayonnaise or aïoli is also great here.The other day, I made aïoli according to Alastair Little, which was also a reason to pull his book, Keep It Simple, off the shelf.

At the same time, nice colleagues were also scared or bullied into silence. I amon a contract with a truly lovelyteam but it is short-term and I’m now having to apply for yet more jobs.I have lovely friends and we all support each other, I utilise the work employee support service and have an excellent therapist, and I feel comfortable financially as long as I keep earning what I’m earning.On the whole I know I am managing and surviving, but I am exhausted. I can’t contemplate a holiday because that comes straight out of my savings, I can barely contemplate looking atjob listings let alone doing an application, and goodness forbid I have to perform all the necessary fakery in an interview. I just can’t hack it! I wish I had a trust fund or a husband who can pay for my bills.I would justtake three months off to healand look after myself, then hit restart and begin working again.I’ve led an amazing life. I love my house and my cat and my style and my friends and I love my intelligence and my potential, but I feel like my burnout is holding me back.How can I solve this problem? So many burnout books and blogs seem to assume a second income is present to take care of all the stuff that will still need doing if I take a break, but it’s just me. How do I take an actual break?Eleanor says:Have you heard the anecdotal thing that shelter dogs often just sleep for the first week after they’re adopted? Something about finally feeling safe, away from the chaos and noise of the shelter, and they plunge into the deep sleep of at last coming off a very long watch.Lots of us are, so to speak, desperate to come off the watch, only nobody’s coming to take us home. How are you supposed to feel it’s at last OK to rest your eyes when there’s always another bill, another task? How are you supposed to find reprieve when your environment won’t let you pause?My husband covered up the fact that he retired. How can I reboot open communication?Read moreOne small thing that can help is to switch your thinking about self-care from activities to feelings. The self-care industry often presents “rest” as a set of actions: a holiday, a meditation, a particular kind of exercise – sometimes conveniently bundled together for a price. But no activity is recovery if you feel eroded and small while doing it. Activities help when they are routes to a feeling but it’s the feeling itself that matters. Frogmarching through something that’s meant to make people feel calm won’t be much use if the stress follows you throughout, or if what you needed wasn’t to feel calm but to feel free, or silly, or stimulated.It can help to name thefeelingwe need in greater detail than we’re used to. Not “I need to not feel burned out” but “I need to feel safe”, or “like myself”, or “like I’m enough”. Then we can look for ways to get those feelings that don’t require months of expensive leave. Instead of the activity “no screens”, the goal of feeling proud of something I did today. Instead of the activity of “long walk”, the feeling of attending to my surrounds. Are your finite slivers of recreation giving you the feelings you need to recharge? Are there small ways to make room for them at work?Another strategy might be to cut the corners you can. You’re clearly clever, energetic, capable. These qualities can rotate 90 degrees in your psyche and turn every part of life into an opportunity to do well. It doesn’t have to be. Clean irregularly. Have freezer meals. Do administrative tasks to exactly the level at which they do not make your life worse, then stop.All this said, there’s only so much you can do inside your head to solve a problem outside your head. This is about class and labour and the necessity of exchanging time for money. You can’t reframe that away because it is not, in the first instance, a psychological experience. It’s a power experience.It is not up to us to stop working. In one way that’s very defeating. In another it’s galvanising: it gives us people to connect with and fight alongside. The other women in your industry facing misogyny in the workplace, the other people at this point in their lives stressed about retirement – one way to overcome feelings of defeat and futility is to find those people and connect with them, not only about these feelings but their causes too.The letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this week the colour was dialled up to 10 asManchester fashion week– the first in 10 years – kicked off.Drew Kent, a designer who trained at Central Saint Martins and whose clothes have been worn by comedian Joe Lycett and the Scissor Sisters, was the first show on the schedule, showing in a large market and event space in the city’s Castlefield district. Focusing on Kent’s trademark crochet knitting, the collection was a riot of pinks and purples, featuring oversized hats, giant sequins and fluffy cardigans. “It’s an extension of my wardrobe,” said Kent ahead of the show. “It’s all about my childhood and me dressing up Action Men in Barbie’s clothes.” With New York fashion week set to start on Thursday, such pronouncements could be seen as an appetiser for fashion editors.The timing is notable, coming just a week beforeLondon fashion weekand shortly after Laura Weir, the new CEO of the British Fashion Council, announced a wider push to shift the focus of the industry away from London. Weir has initiatedCity Wide, a series of talks and events around the country open to the public in the run-up to London fashion week, with Manchester featured, along with Liverpool and Newcastle. There are additional events in Manchester this week – one at Vivienne Westwood’s store and another with Manchester evening wear designer Nadine Merabi.View image in fullscreenElite Preloved, a platform that buys and sells preloved designer fashion, showcased secondhand looks.Photograph: inesbahr/Elite Preloved/Manchester fashion weekGemma Gratton, the executive producer, says this year’sManchesterfashion week is very much a “proof of concept”, one she hopes will put the event on the radars of the powers that be. Shows were attended by industry figures, fashion writers, educators and students, and some events were open to the public. Unlike London fashion week, this event has been financed entirely by private sponsorship.“We approached [local government] three times and [received] ‘wet promises’,” Gratton says. “I can understand why certain institutes and organisations in the city are taking a more measured approach, because they had their fingers burned last time with other organisers. It’s just showing them that we’ve got a real, solid team of highly professional organisers and people in industry who are going to deliver an exceptional event.”The previous iteration of Manchester fashion week was sponsored by Missguided, one of the fast-fashion brands that call the city home. That’s all changed this year, with a new take focused around sustainability. Kent’s collection was made from sustainable materials. “We’re not accepting any sponsorship from people who don’t align with our own business values,” says Gratton. “We’ve been approached by two of the really big fast-fashion brands in the city – one of them has been absolutely banging our door down. We need that money, but we can’t accept it.”Instead, the focus is on a sustainable future for the fashion industry geared around a programme of events that incorporates catwalk shows such as Kent’s but also workshops and talks coveringgreenwashing, streetwear, and Manchester’s place in culture and music. London fashion week is not a competitor, says Gratton: “We want to collaborate with them. London’s more the glitzy glamour runway. We want to put a strong emphasis on education.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

John Higginson, CEO of media partner Eco Age, points to Private White VC, the outerwear brand that has roots dating back nearly 100 years, as well as Manchester’s 200-year-plus involvement in the textile industry. There are, of course, a lot of problems within that history – one workshop will look at colonial legacies in fashion’s supply chain.Higginson says the event is also a space to showcase a different take on style from that in the capital. “It’s a celebration of all the creativity in the north of England,” he argues. “In London, we tend to not really get dressed up for a lot of things – but you go to Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester: every Friday night people dress up to the nines, and it’s really great to see.”View image in fullscreenAn outfit by Mariusz Malon, who has dressed celebrities including Doja Cat and SZA.Photograph: Mariusz Malon/Manchester fashion weekWayne Hemingway, who founded the popular 1990s label Red or Dead, grew up in “the satellite of Manchester”, he says, and the city provided a grounding for where he went next: “It was a place that helped me to understand culture and get into the creative industries. I would not have become a designer without having a city on my doorstep like that.”‘Good for Chanel and good for Manchester’: Fashion show delights city’s luminariesRead moreHemingway, who is participating in a talk about recent cultural moments, has reservations about how much impact Manchester fashion week can have, especially with London fashion week already being so established in the UK. “There isn’t the time for the fashion editors to do it; buyers haven’t got that budget to go around the world,” he says. “But there is a positioning in the media for Manchester to be a fashion city of importance.”Kent, who is from Liverpool, struggled during his time studying at Central Saint Martins. “Sometimes I felt like the only working-class person in that building,” he says. In the end, he moved home after graduating. “It’s just far too expensive to be a designer there,” he says of London. He believes Manchester fashion week could be a platform for other creatives like him: “It’s showing that you don’t have to live in London – you don’t have a massive amount of funds behind you to create and be original with what you design.”Explore more on these topicsFashion weeksManchesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Forty years later, I set out to find itPeter RossThu 11 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 04.01 EDTShareIdon’t remember the picture being taken. Somewhere inScotland, sometime in the 1980s. It has that hazy quality you get with old colour prints: warm but also somehow melancholy. I’m wearing blue jeans, white trainers, an army surplus jumper – and am perched on a standing stone.My mum gave me the photo when I turned 50. She found it up in the loft. Some of these childhood pictures, souvenirs of trips with my grandparents to historic sites, have the place names written on the back. This one was blank, a tantalising mystery. Though I didn’t recognise the location, something about the landscape and quality of light suggested it was Islay, an island I’d visited just once – when I was not quite 12. So I decided to see if I could find the spot, slipped the photograph into my notebook and set off.A map showing Islay, Jura and the Isle of ArranIslay is the southernmost point of the Inner Hebrides, lying on the same latitude as Glasgow. That makes it sound an easy hop from the city, but the watery fractures of Scotland’s west coast require a long drive north and then south along the shores of sea lochs, before a two-hour crossing from the port of Kennacraig. Islay is the eighth largest of the British Isles (bigger than the Isle of Man and Isle of Wight) and yet not, I think, well known. Some of its communities – Ardbeg, Bowmore, Lagavulin – have given their names to famous whisky brands, but the island as a whole feels a little obscure.A saltire (Scottish flag) flapped on the prow as the CalMac ferry eased up the Sound of Islay. The cloud-shrouded mountains of nearby island Jura were a dark presence to starboard. Islay, to port, appeared far more friendly, with its purple heather and bright strand. But appearances can deceive. A cormorant – the devil’s bird – flew in front of the ship in the direction of Islay, not Jura, and I wasn’t at all surprised. I remember, as a boy, being much taken by an illustrated map in which the island was made to look like a demon. The Rinns peninsula formed its horns and snout, the Oa peninsula its claws, and the north-east headland its leathery wings. It sat hunched on the edge of Scotland, poised to take flight for Irish shores.View image in fullscreenPort Ellen, near Cragabus standing stone.Photograph: Mats Lindberg/AlamyDisembarking at Port Askaig, I drove to Port Charlotte, where theMuseum of Islay Life, housed in a former church, is a charming jumble. A wooden figurehead poses next to the island’s old telephone switchboard; a stuffed red squirrel sits glassy-eyed in a bell jar; and an American flag, sewn by Islay women to be flown at the burials of the many US soldiers whose bodies washed ashore when the SS Tuscania was torpedoed by a German U-boat in 1918, hangs faded with age.I’d spent a lot of time in this museum during my childhood stay, fascinated by one exhibit in particular: the skull of an Irish elk. It had been found in a peat bog in the 19th century, and in my recollection was stained almost black, but seeing it again now I realised that memory had played me false; it was greyish brown, no darker than an oatcake. Yet I had not misremembered its great size – an almost 2-metre span between the tips of its antlers. This creature, now extinct, lived and died on Islay about 12,000 years ago, at about the same time, it is thought, as the first people, a party of hunters, arrived on the island, travelling from Scandinavia or northern Germany. Perhaps they glimpsed the elk across the virgin landscape. Perhaps it scented the unfamiliar human stink and wisely kept its distance.People who were taken to ancient places as children often have fuzzy old photos of themselves at the sites. Such pictures increase in power as the years go byIslay has a great many ancient sites. The standing stone in my photograph could be any of them. I had arranged to speak with Steven Mithen, an archaeologist with a particular interest in the island, in the hope he would identify it. I was lucky to catch him. The University of Reading professor would soon leave for a few days camping on Nave, a tiny island off Islay’s northern coast, where he hoped to find a Viking boat burial. We met for a cuppa and I showed him the picture.“That’s Cragabus,” he said. “Lovely photo. Wonderful place.”View image in fullscreenThe Museum of Islay Life in Port Charlotte is a charming jumble.Photograph: David Pearson/AlamyThe stone on which I was sitting, he explained, was a surviving part of a chambered cairn – a Neolithic stone tomb probably built around 3,500BC. It had been excavated in 1902. Human remains were found along with fragments of clay vessels, known as beakers, their presence indicating that the cairn had been reopened in the bronze age and used by those later people for the burial of their own dead. I knew a bit about beaker burials. I’d excavated one myself – in 1984, the same year, I think, as my visit to Islay, helping my grandparents to trowel up the bones of the person buried alongside a decorated pot.My grandfather, Eric Ross – Grumps to his grandkids – was a coachbuilder. That was how he earned a wage, building buses in a factory, but archaeology was what he loved. He fell for it during the second world war. He had joined the RAF in 1941, aged 20, serving in north Africa and Italy. “He was the only man I knew who had used a genuine working Roman bath,” one of his friends once told me. “Just before the victory parade in Tunis, his squad was given a few minutes in the still-operational baths fed from the hot springs.”There was the megalith I had sat upon: nearly 2 metres tall, the same distinctive shape, its tip bristling with a pelt of lichenSo, washing desert sand from his body in Roman ruins is how history got under his skin? I like this very much as an origin story. I wish I could have asked him but, of course, it is too late. People slip away before we are ready to hear their stories. I wish, too, that I had become an archaeologist myself. Whenever I think back to our old adventures, it feels like a path not taken. This trip to Islay, and my new book, Upon a White Horse: Journeys in Ancient Britain and Ireland, are attempts to walk it a little.Prof Mithen told me where to find Cragabus: in the south-west of the island, just off a single-track road, marked on the map with that gothic type so evocative of strange old places. At Port Ellen, I followed a sign marked Mull of Oa and was soon there. Climbing a farm gate, I walked up a short, steep rise. There was the megalith I had sat upon: nearly 2 metres tall, the same distinctive shape, tip bristling with a pelt of lichen, its lower parts soft with snagged wool where sheep had rubbed. I propped my phone on a fence post and took a photograph, 41 years after the first: a middle-aged man touching a stone.A boy sits on a large stone on the Scottish island of Islay. The boy as a man standing next to the same stonePeter Ross in Islay in the 1984 and in 2025People who were taken to ancient places as children often have fuzzy old photos of themselves at the sites. Such pictures increase in power as the years go by. The people who took us pass away, and we ourselves grow up and change, but the stones stay the same. So, when we return as adults, we can measure ourselves against them, see our little lives in relation to eternity. That was how I felt at Cragabus: bigger yet smaller, older yet no age at all.Peter Ross’s Upona White Horse: Journeys in Ancient Britain and Irelandis published byHeadlineat £22.To buy a copy for£19.80, go toguardianbookshop.com.

But it poses some big questions about key corners of the empire assembled by his father over seven decades.‘Teflon Rebekah’Lachlan is said by some to not be as enamoured as his father with Robert Thomson, the 64-year-old boss of News Corp, whose friendship and business career with Rupert go back decades . But he is described by one source as “super-close” to the News UK chief,Rebekah Brooks.It has emerged that Brooks wasin attendance at the Harvard Club in New Yorkalongside personal representatives of the two warring sides of the Murdoch family when meetings began this year about the buyout and trust change.“Rebekah was in the room when negotiations were taking place. That tells you all you need to know about the closeness of Rebekah to Rupert and Lachlan,” says another former senior executive. “She remains untouchable: Teflon Rebekah.”However, this relationship could be tested when the spotlight returns later this month to the phone-hacking scandal. ITV, which last year made a national issue of the machinations of executives over the Horizon IT scandalin the drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, is launching a series on the scandal called The Hack, based in part on abook by the former Guardian journalist Nick Davies.News UK has already sent a legal note to publishers on behalf of the parent company of the Sun about allegations made in the book.For Lachlan, presiding over listed businesses with a $42bn combined market valuation, commercial decisions that would be unconscionable to the family patriarch who is a newspaper man through-and-through are likely to come into sharper relief.View image in fullscreenSteve Pemberton as Rupert Murdoch and Jordan Renzo as James in the forthcoming ITV drama.Photograph: ITV studios“It is no secret he likes newspapers more than James did, but today is completely different than when he grew up and they were all making a lot of money and fuelling the business,” says the first former executive. “The crossroads for the business, certainly as far as newspapers are concerned, will be when Rupert passes, because of Lachlan’s loyalty and respect.“I think he will make some purely quite cold business decisions. He has probably had conversations about it and Rupert would have said, ‘You make the call,’ and would have respected that, as he has had to make plenty of tough decisions.”Under Thomson, who recently had his contract extended until 2030, News Corp continues to perform strongly, with a $17bn market value that has almost doubled over the past five years. The business delivered a 4% increase in revenues, to $8.4bn, and a 14% increase in profits to $1.4bn in its most recent results for the year to 30 June.However, 85% of profits are derived from Dow Jones, home to the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s and MarketWatch, and its digital real estate business.Dow Jones, which has been estimated by analysts to be worth more than $10bn if it were hived off, continues to thrive amid the impact of the onset oftraffic-diverting productssuch as Google’s AI Overviews and AI Mode.Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones products rose by 7% to 6.3m in the year to June; within this the Wall Street Journal grew 9% to 4.1m.What next forthe Sun?In the UK, the Times and Sunday Times grew digital subscriptions by 46,000 to 640,000 in the year to June, and made a £61m profit in 2024,according to the most recent filingat Companies House.Overall, News Corp’s news media segment, which includes News UK, its Australian subsidiary and the New York Post, reported profits of $153m, 11% of the group total. But a $39m fall in ad revenues was attributed to falling print income in Australia and digital traffic at the Sun due to “algorithmic changes at certain platforms”.What to do about the Sun is one of the biggest issues facing Lachlan. According to News Corp, the Sun, which this yearlaunched a £2-a-month paywallfor certain content, had a 22% year-on-year decline to 87m global monthly unique users in June.The parent company of the Sun reported that it made apre-tax loss of £18min the year to June 2024, the smallest loss since 2011, but bringing cumulative losses at the red top’s owner to more than £1.2bn since the start of its costly phone-hacking battle almost 15 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But for an investor now, or if McKinsey came in, no one would say looking at the current landscape that they should still hang on to these assets. Concentrate on core profit-making operations.”With investors no longer concerned about the ramifications of a potential succession standstill – and the ongoing certainty of the $3.62bn in profits thatFoxNews’s owner, Fox Corp, made in its last financial year – one move analysts seem to agree will not happen is a renewed effort to merge News Corp and Fox.Two years ago, Murdochscrapped a proposal to reunify his media businesses, which he was forced to split after the phone-hacking scandal, following opposition from investors and from his son James.“The proposed merger would have been voted against by a huge number of external shareholders,” says Claire Enders of Enders Analysis. “I don’t think the issues put forward then are going to go away. With lawsuits against Fox and the Wall Street Journal I don’t think a merger will be at the top of the list.”Lachlan ‘wants size and scale’As for his susceptibility to political pressure, Lachlan is hard to read. Some believe he is even further to the right than his father, pointing to material released during Fox’s legal battle with Dominion Voting Systems, in which he appeared to back a more pro-Trump approach in the aftermath of Joe Biden’s 2020 election.Fox is still facing a legal action from the voting system Smartmatic.“He doesn’t aspire to be that king maker, politically, that Rupert has been throughout his career,” says Paddy Manning, a journalist and author ofThe Successor: the high-stakes life of Lachlan Murdoch.While Trump and the Maga movement remain key to the fortunes of Fox News, Lachlan has backed the Wall Street Journal,and its editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, over a lawsuit following the publication of allegations that the president composeda crude poem and doodleas part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday.Lachlan and his father are likely to take a hard look at its business operations following the payout to secure his eldest son’s control.The deal required a new $1bn loan to be taken out and at about 34% the new trust will have a bit less control over the businesses than with the 40% voting power the family previous held.In November, the activist investor Starboard Value lost a shareholder vote aimed at scrapping the dual-class share structure at News Corp, which would have weakened the family’s control.Starboard has also pushed for News Corp tospin off REA, the highly successful digital real estate business controlled by News Corp in Australia.Considered to be Lachlan’sshrewdest and most profitable contributionto the building the family empire – in 2001 he persuaded News Corporation to invest A$2m in REA for a 44% stake increasing to 62% in 2005 – the business accounted for 43% of News Corp’s profits in its latest financial year.Last September, REA Groupabandoned its attemptto take over the UK property portal Rightmove after its fourth offer of £6.2bn was rejected.“Lachlan is ambitious,” says a third source who has worked with him. “I bet he swings big. He never wanted to sell [21st Century] Fox to Disney, or see Sky go to Comcast, he wants size and scale. How big he goes and how he finances it are the big questions.”Explore more on these topicsLachlan MurdochRupert MurdochJames MurdochNewspapersTelevision industryNewspapers & magazinesMedia businessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Openly gay, bisexual and transgender people ran for office in at least 36 countries, including for the first time inBotswana, Namibia and Romania – albeit unsuccessfully – according to the report by Outright International. The number of LGBTQ+ elected officials doubled to at least 233 in Brazil.As the visibility of LGBTQ+ people has risen in many countries in the last decade, so too has a backlash from conservative parts of societies, fuelled in many cases by far-right activists and politicians using gay and transgender people as scapegoats for other problems.There is a growing “weaponisation of hate”, said Alberto de Belaúnde, a director at Outright International, an NGO that promotes LGBTQ+ rights globally.He said: “You talk with a politician from Peru … orHungaryor the UK, you start to see common trends and you realise that it’s a global, coordinated and increasingly well-funded effort to diminish LGBTIQ people.”LGBTQ+ candidates for office were subject to online hate speech from election opponents and their supporters in El Salvador, Finland, Pakistan and the US, where Sarah McBride was elected as thefirst transgender member of the House of Representatives.During the 2024 US elections, Republican campaigns spent $200m (£147.5m) on anti-transgender adverts on network TV (not including cable TV or streaming), according todatafrom advert tracking firm AdImpact.In the campaign for parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in October 2024, theruling Georgian Dream partyclaimed that LGBTQ+ activists were “foreign agents” of the west, out to corrupt the country’s “traditional values”.During election campaigns in Ghana, where gay sex is criminalised under a colonial-era law, both of the two main parties said they would protect “family values” while accusing the other of being pro-LGBTQ+.LGBTQ+ Americans consider move to Canada to escape Trump: ‘I’m afraid of living here’Read moreBefore the June 2024 EU elections, in which far-right partiesmade big gains, the Fidesz-KDNP coalition of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that the “Brussels elite and the Soros network, fattened up with EU money, are waging an ideological war: re-educating our children with gender propaganda.” In Germany, the far-rightAlternative für Deutschlandsaid it was against “other forms of cohabitation than between a man and a woman” being treated equally.InIndonesia, which voted in February 2024, the National Human Rights Commission condemned reports that politicians had vowed to “eradicate LGBT”. And while all three main parties in Pakistan promised to respect the rights of transgender people, trans candidates reported being verbally harassed in person as well as online on the campaign trail for the February 2024 vote.The Outright International report said that rises in discrimination against minorities had come hand in hand with growing authoritarianism: “In 2024, as in previous years, LGBTIQ communities and other marginalised groups were among the first casualties of these anti-democratic attacks.”Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsBotswanaGeorgiaEuropeAfricaHungaryGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

But the judge, who also controversially argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, claimed there was no proof Bolsonaro was to blame for inciting the riots.View image in fullscreenBrazil’s federal supreme court minister Carmen Lucia.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APFux did, however, vote to convict two of Bolsonaro’s closest allies – his former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, and his former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid – for the crime of violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy. The judge concluded that the pair had helped plan and bankroll a plot to murder Moraes in order to generate social mayhem they hoped would trigger a military intervention.There were leftwing celebrations outside the supreme court as Rocha sealed the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other close allies who were also convicted. They include the former defence ministers, Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos.Bolsonaro’s former spy chief, Alexandre Ramagem, and justice minister, Anderson Torres, were also found guilty, as was Cid.“Today, Brazil is making history,” Lindbergh Farias, the leader of Lula’s Workers’ party in the lower house of congress, said as he emerged from the building. “Brazil is saying: ‘Coups are a crime!’”‘I’m holding his political wake’: the trumpeter waiting to mark Bolsonaro’s judgment dayRead moreFabiano Leitão,a trumpeterwho has spent years using his instrument to criticise Bolsonaro, turned up​ to mark the day of history with a rendition of Chopin’s Funeral March that symbolised the former president’s downfall. ​“It’s the end! It’s the end of this guy!” Leitão​ said as he pulled out his trumpet.After playing the sombre composition, the leftwing musician​ ​launched into a lively samba, capturing the joy many Brazilians feel at the demise of a politician they blame for attacking their country’s democracy, environment and minorities. “The extreme right is a mechanism​ of destruction of countries. It destroys everything: healthcare, science, technology, education, culture. It destroys it all. So this is a historic moment for this county,” Leitão said. “Justice is done, comrades!”Bolsonaro’s senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict political persecution and Donald Trump said the conviction was “very surprising”.“That’s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn’t get away with it at all,” said the US president who has spent recent months trying to pressure Brazil’s supreme court and government into halting Bolsonaro’s trial witha campaign of tariffs and sanctions.“The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt​,” tweeted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, calling the conviction “unjust”.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Bolsonaro demonstrated in São Paulo on Brazilian Independence Day (7 September).Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersEduardo Bolsonaro, another son of the former president, told Reuters he expected the US to apply further sanctions against officials following his father’s conviction.In a post on social media, Brazil’s foreign ministry rejected the statement from US officials, saying “threats like those made today by the US secretary of state Marco Rubio … will not intimidate our democracy”.The former president did not attend court this week, remaining in his nearby mansion, where he is under house arrest and police officers have been stationed to ensure he does not flee to one of Brasília’s foreign embassies.Progressive elation at the downfall of a president blamed for rampant environmental destruction, hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths and attacks on minorities, has been tempered by the realisation that his political movement remains very much alive. Some fear Fux’s questioning of the judges’ authority over the case could open the door to legal challenges and even the trial’s annulment in the future.Anatomy of a coup plot: why Jair Bolsonaro is on trialRead more“I wouldn’t declare Jair Bolsonaro’s political death,” said Dr Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, who studies the Brazilian right.Rocha expected supporters of the former president to keep fighting to rescue their leader from jail. Likely strategies include trying to elect a large number of rightwing senators in next year’s elections who could impeach members of the supreme court considered Bolsonaro’s foes;petitioning Donald Trumpto heap more pressure on Brazil over Bolsonaro’s plight; and trying to ensure that a pro-Bolsonaro candidate beats Lula in the 2026 presidential election. Their hope was that a rightwing president might grant Bolsonaro a pardon, although the supreme court could torpedo those plans, she said.“I think they’ll continue trying various ways of getting Bolsonaro out of jail and to uphold his leadership and keep him visible,” she predicted.In recent weeks, pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers have been pushing the idea of an amnesty for their leader and others who were involved in the coup attempt and the 8 January 2023 riots in Brasília. They claim such forgiveness would help pacify a politically divided country.But Fabio Victor, the author of a book about military involvement in Brazilian politics called Camouflaged Power, said he believed an amnesty would serve as an “incentive to illegality”. “It would send an awful signal – it would undoubtedly represent a setback to democracy,” he warned.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Carney said the projects would add C$60bn (US$43bn) to the country’s economy and create “tens of thousands” of new jobs.The liquified natural gas project is a shift for Liberals. Under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, senior ministers were publicly skeptical of the economic case for exporting Canadian LNG across the Atlantic. But in recent months, Carney’s government has met with European officials to pitch Canadian LNG exports.The other projects announced on Thursday were a small modular reactor at Ontario’s Darlington nuclear facility, a Quebec port expansion and two mines – all of which Carney framed as having reduced environmental impacts.“We used to build big things in this country, and we used to build them quickly,” said Carney. “It’s time to get back at it, and it’s time to get on with it.”The absence of a major oil pipeline is expected to kick off fierce partisan attacks. Earlier in the summer, the federal Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, said a Tory government would “legalize” pipelines and said the Carney government was “going in the exact wrong direction”.Danielle Smith, the Alberta premier, has said for months her government wants to see a new pipeline that would move oil to the Pacific. On Wednesday, she downplayed the lack of a pipeline.“We’ve got a little bit of work to do to be able to get to an environment where oil companies want to expand their production,” she told reporters.The largest hurdle for a pipeline project, in addition to provincial opposition and emission caps, is the lack of support from the private sector.Amid a continent-wide push for economic nationalism, the absence of a pipeline nonetheless comes in stark contrast to Trump, who has pledged to revive the Keystone XL pipeline.Carney’s push to fast-track major projects – and the speed with which his government passed the accompanying legislation, Bill C-5 –has prompted concern from Indigenous leadersthat communities will not be properly consulted or their rights fully respected in the process. Carney spent the summer meeting with First Nations, Inuit and Métis leadership in an attempt to allay such concerns.In June, Trevor Mercredi, grand chief of the Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta, said C-5 “exposes Canada’s preferred strategy when dealing with Treaty Peoples: not through partnership or reconciliation, but through legislative fatigue – imposing policy knowing it will take us years to fight it in court”.On Wednesday, the government announced that Mercredi, a critic of Bill C-5, would be appointed to the Indigenous advisory council that will advise on the implementation legislation.A second round of projects is expected in November. But even though the list includes a windfarm, a port upgrade, a carbon capture project and high-speed rail, there are again no pipelines.Environmental groups expressed skepticism over the projects. Greenpeace said the list was “creating a false narrative around” the idea of national interest.Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said the plans included “some dangerous initiatives that further entrench us in Trump’s dream of an uncompetitive, volatile and fossil-fuelled North American economy” and warned: “How big things get built also matters. Unfortunately, the Building Canada Act seems to assume that premiers and C-suite executives are the only voices that need to be listened to in order to succeed.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

After the election, Lula and Moraes were closely monitored by special forces soldiers.According to investigators, the murderous plot was abandoned only because Bolsonaro managed to win over just one of the three armed forces chiefs, the navy commander, while the heads of the air force and the army refused to join.The climax of the power-grab attempt was theriot on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula took office, whenhundreds of Bolsonaro supportersransacked the presidential palace, congress and supreme court in the capital, Brasília.The only judge to acquit Bolsonaro was Luiz Fux, who argued that the prosecution hadfailed to provethe former president’s guilt. He also contended that the trial should be annulled, saying the supreme court was not the proper venue and endorsing a defence claim that, because the investigation generated about 70 terabytes of documents, Bolsonaro’s lawyers had been unable to review all the case materials.What happens next?Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months.Bolsonaro has beenunder house arrestsince 4 August, accused of trying to intimidate the supreme court’s judges through acampaign led by his sonEduardo Bolsonaro in the US thatresulted in tariffsand sanctions imposed by Donald Trump.The former president still has the right to appeal, although the margin of his conviction makes it unlikely it will be overturned. Once the appeals are concluded, probably in October or November, the justices will decide where he will serve his sentence.Given his recurring health problems, linked to astabbing during the 2018 campaign, Bolsonaro will probably remain under house arrest, in a hospital or in a special unit inside a barracks or police facility.What is Bolsonaro’s political future?Even before this week’s conviction, Bolsonaro wasalready barred from forthcoming electionsdue totwo previous rulings by the electoral court, one for attacking the voting system and another for using the presidency for electoral purposes.Brazil’s largely conservative congress, however, mayvote on an amnesty billfor him and hundreds of those convicted over the 8 January riot. Justices have alreadydeemed the proposal unconstitutional, so if it passes, a judicial battle is expected.Meanwhile, figures on the far right – includingBolsonaro’s politician sons and his wife– are battling to decide who will be the candidate to take on the leftist president Lula, who has announced his intention to run in the 2026 elections.How has Bolsonaro’s ally Donald Trump responded?Trump had previously criticised the case against Bolsonaro and used it as one of the justificationsfor his 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, but most Brazilian legal experts agree there wassubstantial evidencefor conviction and that due process was observed.After Thursday’s verdict, the US president told reporters he was “very unhappy” with the conviction and that he’d always found Bolsonaro to be “outstanding”. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on X that Washington would “respond accordingly to this witch hunt”.Brazil’s foreign ministry called Rubio’s comment a threat that “attacks Brazilian authority and ignores the facts and the compelling evidence in the records”. The ministry said Brazilian democracy would not be intimidated by the US.Trump had alreadyrevoked the visasof Moraes and other justices of Brazil’s supreme court. Moraes was alsotargeted with Magnitsky sanctions, generally reserved for perpetrators of severe human rights violations.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasexplainersShareReuse this content"

Yet long-term data for individual insect populations is sparse and patchy.A newstudy in the journal Sciencesheds light on what is happening to insects in some of the world’s most distant places. “There is global concern about the ‘insect apocalypse’, but a lot of uncertainty and debate about what is actually happening,” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at Japan’s Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and co-author of the research.“We have a new kind of evidence of something we long suspected: that insect species endemic to remote islands are in decline.”View image in fullscreenA six-spotted tiger beetle (Cicindela sexguttata) in flight in east Texas. About 15% of tiger beetle species in the US are in a state of decline.Photograph: Michael Durham/NPL/AlamyEconomo and his colleagues analysed genomes of ant populations from the Fijian archipelago gathered in recent decades and held in museum collections. From thousands of specimens, they used scientific methods to infer whether ant populations were growing or shrinking based on variations in DNA sequences among individuals.They found that 79% of Fiji’s endemic ant species were in decline, with impacts beginning at the time of humans’ arrival on the islands about 3,000 years ago and speeding up in the past 300 years – coinciding with European contact, global trade and the arrival of modern agriculture.For remote tropical islands where comprehensive historical observations are rare, understanding how insects have been harmed by human activities is hard to ascertain but critically important. Islands are hotspots of biodiversity because of their isolation. This also makes them especially vulnerable to extinctions.“Remote oceanic islands like the Galápagos, Hawaii and Fiji harbour species that evolved in isolation and often have spectacular differences from their mainland relatives,” Economo said.‘Half the tree of life’: ecologists’ horror as nature reserves are emptied of insectsRead moreThe research adds to apatchwork map of findingsfrom the world’s ecosystems. InGermany, the abundance of flying insects across 63 nature reserves has dropped by 75% in less than 30 years. In the US,beetle numbershave plummeted by 83% in 45 years, and about 15% of tiger beetle species there are in decline. Europe’sgrassland butterflypopulation has shrunk by 36% over the past decade.Insect populations are being hammered from all sides as habitat loss, pesticide use, climate breakdown and light pollution all add to the emptying out of the world’s wetlands, forests and grasslands.“We need to look at insects in more places, with more methods, to understand what is happening to insects and other invertebrates,” Economo said.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsInsectsThe age of extinctionFijiAnimalsAsia PacificBiodiversityWildlifePacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

The landmark case,brought by activist Jimmy Sham, affirmed that the city’s laws defined marriage as between a man and a woman, but also said the government was obligedto create an “alternative framework”which recognised the “core rights” of same-sex couples.The resulting proposal was criticised at the time by advocates who said it was a “pained attempt” to comply while offering as little as possible. On Wednesday they criticised LegCo’s rejection of it.‘Creating inequality’: Hong Kong’s same-sex marriage registration proposal criticisedRead moreAdvocacy group, Hong KongMarriageEquality, said the veto sent “a troubling signal to both local and international communities – that court rulings may be disregarded and the dignity of individuals overlooked.“We commend the government for taking initial steps towards fulfilling its constitutional obligation to implement the court of final appeal’s decision on establishing a legal framework for the recognition of same-sex relationships.“At the same time, we express our profound regret that lawmakers have chosen to ignore clear evidence and public sentiment.”Amnesty International’s Nadia Rahman said the bill was “flawed”, and would have provided “the bare minimum of protection” only to couples who registered their relationship overseas, but its rejection showed “an alarming disdain for LGBTI rights”.“It is a setback which shows just how far Hong Kong has to go before everyone in the city can enjoy equal rights,” said Rahman.“All of our community feel very disappointed, but I still want everybody to have hope because this is not the endgame,” Sham said after the vote.Wednesday’s vote was the first time a bill has been rejected by LegCo since anelectoral overhaulby the Chinese government, designed to ensure only pro-Beijing “patriots” could run Hong Kong, effectively removed opposition.During the lengthy debate some legislators said they were voting against the bill because it would affect the foundations of monogamous and heterosexual marriage in Hong Kong.Lawmaker Holden Chow from the city’s biggest pro-establishment party said the bill’s passage would mean opening “a Pandora’s box”, and “subverting Hong Kong’s marriage system between one man and one woman”.Junius Ho, a firebrand legislator known for incendiary views about the LGBTQ+ community, said the government should never have proposed the bill, and suggested increasing the rights of same sex couples would cause confusion on Mother’s Day and Fathers Day.“Why do we still need to worry about imaginary troubles and do all this unorthodox stuff? To plunge an entire society into turmoil for a small minority of people?”Among the 14 who voted in favour of the bill, lawmaker Regina Ip likened it to a “minimum spending” requirement, given the rights offered were limited.Secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs Erick Tsang, said the government was disappointed that legislators vetoed the bill, but respected their decision which he said was on behalf of local residents and mainstream opinion.Meanwhile Beijing officials said the decision proved that LegCo was not a “rubber stamp” parliament, as critics have called it since the electoral overhaul.Polling has shown the majority of people in Hong Kong support same-sex relationships, and extensive lobbying by LGBTQ+ groups and a series of hard fought court cases have established some piecemeal rights, including those related to public housing, inheritance lawand spousal visas.Nick Infinger, a Hongkonger who previously succeeded in an LGBTQ+ rights legal bid, said the community had few other places to turn.“Judicial review would be the only way that we can fight for our rights … little bit by little bit,” he said.The court of final appeal gave the government a two-year deadline, which ends this month. In a statement the government said it wouldn’t apply for an extension, but would “further discuss and study the issue with the department of justice”.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsHong KongMarriageLGBTQ+ rightsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

States want direct per capita funding, instead of new federal money going into existing programs including Medicare.What are the changes to the NDIS and how will it affect those already using it?Read moreLizzie Blandthorn,Victoria’s minister for children and disability, said families should not be worse off, which she suggested was a possibility under the new federal plan given the difficulty states would face to cover funding previously the responsibility of the federal government.“I have grave concerns that the commonwealth are trying to sell out people with disabilities and their families for pet projects across the country,” she said on Thursday.“Children with developmental delay and disability should not be traded away for 30 pieces of silver.”Queensland’s disability services minister has called the move to tie hospital funding negotiations to disability support “cruel”.“The federal government knows full well they’re the only government that has the capacity to deliver the level of care needed for the people it is trying to remove from the NDIS,” the state’s disability services minister, Amanda Camm, said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In that speech, Butler said about one in 50 people lived with significant and permanent disability, but 10 in 50 children experience developmental delay or autism.“Diverting this group of kids over time from the NDIS is an important element of making the scheme sustainable and returning it to its original intent,” he said.Butler said the states and territories “will obviously be key partners” in the new scheme for children.Already one of the fastest-growing pressures on the federal budget, the annual cost of the NDIS expected to reach $60bn by the end of the decade.Labor had sought to bring the annual growth rate down to 8% by next year, but Butler said last month those savings were insufficient. The NDIS is still growing above 10%; Butler wants cost increases curbed to between 5% and 6%.A group for negotiations of the new system will be led by the federal health department boss,Blair Comley, with a representative of the states.A separate advisory body for Thriving Kids will be chaired by Butler and Murdoch Children’s Institute expert Prof Frank Oberklaid.Explore more on these topicsHealthAustralian politicsDisabilityMark ButlerAnthony AlbaneseNational disability insurance schemenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a principle worth recalling when nine-month-old messages are made public just two days before the Victorian Liberals’ annual state council meeting.The messages, taken from a WhatsApp group involving a small handful of party headquarters staff, are undeniably sexist and inappropriate. In them, Victorian Liberal party directorStuart Smith mocked the party’s women’s council, saying it could only make decisions at a meeting “after two men told them they had to”, and joked that upper house MP Bev McArthur had dementia.The messages are yet another example of the party’s“woman problem”. The disrespect toward women inside its own ranks is just one reason many female voters have abandoned the Liberals at recent elections.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe only possible outcome after the messages’ publication was for Smith to resign – which he did within hours of the story becoming public. Guardian Australia understands Felicity Redfern will be stepping in as the party’s acting state director as the search begins for his replacement.But there is no doubt it was clearly a targeted leak, timed for maximum impact.Smith is aligned with the party president, Philip Davis, and other moderate members of the administrative committee, who are up for re-election on Saturday.Victorian Liberals director resigns after messages mocking the party’s women’s council revealedRead moreThe committee plays a critical role in shaping the party’s direction – largely through its involvement in candidate preselections, which will begin the Monday after state council.It is also responsible for funding decisions, includingapproving a $1.5m loan to former party leader John Pesuttoto help him pay defamation costs owed to Moira Deeming. Davis himself was instrumental in drafting the loan and its conditions.The loan will loom large at this weekend’s meeting, especially as five administrative committee members – Colleen Harkin, Erin Hunt, Anthony Schneider, Ian Pugh and Marcus Li – have launched legal action against the remaining members, including federal MP Dan Tehan and the state opposition leader, Brad Battin, over its approval.The matter has been sent to mediation by the supreme court but this is unlikely to begin before the weekend.Harkin, in her candidate biography for the role of administrative committee metropolitan female, pointed directly to “$2m of party funds” being spent “unnecessarily” as “a result of poor governance”.She said “unrest” within the party wouldn’t be resolved unless it began to “act with integrity internally”.Davis, meanwhile, is facing a challenge from his predecessor, Greg Mirabella, who is understood not to have supported the Pesutto loan.While Davis has pitched himself as a steady hand to guide the party through “the final leg of the state political cycle”, having “rebuilt” the party’s professional arm and campaign and policy units, Mirabella accused the party of having “failed the people of Victoria in recent times”.“If the Victorian division cannot achieve some form of success in 2026, the impact will be felt nationally,” his biography reads.“Time is desperately short, and the Liberal party’s future is at stake. This is not overstating the situation.”Another candidate, who requested anonymity so they could speak frankly, described the buildup to the votes as the “nastiest, most toxic, most aggressive state council I have ever been involved with”.“The leaking, the undermining, the untruths – it’s been next level,” they said.Another Liberal member, who requested anonymity for the same reason, said if Davis was successfully re-elected and had the numbers to control the administrative committee, the group will move to block Deeming from being preselected again and push for the suspension of Harkin.“It’s at a major crossroads right now, that’s why so many people are so desperate,” they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If this is how they treat each other, how are they going to treat ordinary Victorians?” he told reporters outside parliament.Battin, meanwhile, dodged the media and issued a brief statement saying Smith’s resignation was “the right thing to do”.One faint glimmer of hope for the party lies in its policy forum committee, made up of rank-and-file members who have been meeting with MPs and experts to draft motions before state council.They include motions urging the federal Liberal party to introduce 52 weeks of paid parental leave, with four weeks for the second parent, expanding the childcare subsidy to cover family-nominated carers such as grandparents, and housing reforms such as deferring most of the stamp duty for seniors downsizing to a cheaper principal residence.The motions, though non-binding, undoubtedly would resonate with women and younger voters who the party has lost at recent elections.But even the committee’s chair, David Mulholland, has warned “good policy is not enough”.In a report to members, seen by Guardian Australia, he warned “internal factionalism” and a “self-defeating internal culture” were holding the party back.“We must have the courage to build the modern, professional, and accountable organisation required to deliver victory for the people of Victoria,” he wrote.Benita Kolovos is Guardian Australia’s Victorian state correspondentExplore more on these topicsVictorian politicsVictoriaLiberal partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

But this week she learned that number could grow even further – swelled by new births.In 1995, the year she was born, Queensland Fertility Group told Hamilton’s mother that she could expect to have between three and five siblings to other families.The clinic still stocks some of her donor’s sperm – material for new births that has been stored for more than 30 years.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailYears later, Hamilton did a DNA test out of curiosity, expecting to find “maybe one” long-lost brother or sister. She found 13 and broke down in tears. The number has since grown, as new people discover their secret through online DNA testing.The clinic, which is now owned by VirtusHealth, the biggest IVF and sperm donor company in the country, told her half-sister Lyndal Bubke this week that it still stores nine additional samples of her donor’s materials in its stockpile. Bubke believes they are being held to be used.Hamilton said she is terrified of her biological father’s sperm being used to inseminate one of her unknown half-siblings, by accident.After four ‘heartbreaking’ rounds of IVF at a private clinic, Cassie put her hopes in the hands of Victoria’s public fertility serviceRead moreAustralia’s health ministers will meet on Friday in Perth to debate the future of Australia’s fertility clinics after a three-month “rapid review” of the sector’s regulation in Queensland. It comes after a series of scandals, includingtwo embryo mix-ups at Monash IVF. One saw a woman in Brisbanegive birth to a stranger’s baby, in the other, a woman’s own embryo wasincorrectly implanted.It is expected several ministers will push for reform, with both a national framework as well as a national donor register on the agenda.“I think I can give you a very clear signal that we’re unhappy with the self-regulatory regime that’s been run by the providers themselves under their own auspices, and also the standards they’ve set for themselves,” the Queensland health minister, Tim Nicholls, told media on Thursday.The federal health minister, Mark Butler, himself a father of a “beautifulIVFbaby”, said the issue will be “a matter of priority” at the meeting.The commonwealth-level regulator, the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee (RTAC), is an organisation of the fertility society, the industry body.In 2004 the industry said it had put an end to the practice of creating huge pods, voluntarily capping the number of total families to be created at 10. There is no federal law or regulator requiring them to maintain this limit.In 2022, Queensland Fertility Group’s then medical director, Anusch Yazdani, told a parliamentary inquiry that it had let donor-conceived people down.But Bubke said the nine samples – which are being kept in storage against the recommendations of the state health ombudsman – show that the industry will repeat the same mistakes in future unless made to stop.“This industry cannot regulate itself. The only thing that will stop this from happening is robust, independent government regulation at both federal and state levels,” Bubke said.A spokesperson for the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand said it had called for an independent regulatory body “for many years”.“The rapid review has now allowed for the recommendations of this roadmap to be considered, and we are pleased issues such as an independent regulatory body are now under consideration,” the spokesperson said.A spokesperson for the Queensland Fertility Group said it “expresses empathy for Ms Bubke. We acknowledge her experience and take her concerns seriously.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The health ombudsman last year recommended it do so for material at too high a risk of misidentification: 99.8% of sperm frozen by QFG before 2020 failed to meet this benchmark due to a lack of double-witnessing, according to a later audit.The clinic rejects claims that sperm frozen before 2020 is of high risk, the spokesperson said. It said single witnessing “was the standard process at the time”.Hamilton said she is concerned there may be more mislabelled samples from “Donor 59” somewhere in QFG’s stockpile, which could be accidentally used.The mother of four is particularly worried about the next generation, the potentially hundreds of children that will be born to her 77 siblings. With so many, the risks of accidental incest get larger and larger, she says.Dozens of people were conceived from the same Queensland sperm donor. Now two half-sisters hope to unravel their ‘family’ secretRead more“I have many friends who have gone through IVF with Queensland Fertility Group in Brisbane,” she said. “I’m lucky that my parents told me that I was donor conceived, and I thankfully never had to go down a fertility route.“But there’s nothing stopping any of those women that don’t know going into the clinic and having a relative’s sperm implanted in their bodies.”QFG says the last nine samples remaining from Donor 59 would only be available for parents who want to extend their families – that is, giving a mother who already had one child through the clinic a second related one.“If a family wishes to use embryos previously created using single witnessed sperm, they are permitted to do so and are provided with counselling,” the spokesperson said.Hamilton believes the true motivating factor for keeping Donor 59’s sperm decades after it was received is much simpler: profit.“They know that the sample works,” she said.Explore more on these topicsHealthQueenslandIVFFertility problemsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the drones flew more than a hundred miles into Polish airspace.Gen Alexus GregoryGrynkewich, Nato’s supreme allied commander for Europe, said that he had “low confidence” in the drone numbers previously reported, suggesting the defenders were not immediately clear what they were dealing with.But, speaking at press conference in Lithuania, the military commander said: “Based on the lessons from these events, we’re going to continue to work to improve our ability to defend every single inch of alliance airspace.”British officials indicated that an agreement signed withUkraine– called Project Octopus – to jointly develop large numbers of drones to intercept Russian Shaheds could also be deployed in Poland as well as in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenDefence secretary John Healey spoke about Russia at the DSEI arms fair.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAJohn Healey, the defence secretary, told the DSEI arms fair in London that the UK had to be “more ready to fight” in a war in order to deter growing Russian aggression – and that weapons like the Project Octopus drones would serve both British and Ukrainian interests in the future.“What we get is the learning from the Ukrainians,” Healey said. “What we get is the shared IP [intellectual property]. What we get are the products of what we produce with the Ukrainians available for ourselves and our own armed forces, not just to supply the Ukrainians and their defence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another option under consideration is to contribute RAF Typhoon jets to an enlarged air policing mission in eastern Europe – six of the fighters were on Nato duty as part of a rotating mission earlier this summer.The former army general Sir Richard Barrons, a second member of the defence review team, said that the number of drones involved indicated “it was clearly a deliberate incursion” by Russia, although the fact that they appeared to be Gerbera decoy drones rather than armed Shaheds meant it was “a minor act of provocation”.The drone incursion demonstrated, Barrons said, that existing Nato defences were “well short of dealing with what is a small tactical problem”. He added that using fighter jets to shoot down drones was “massive overkill” but that it was necessary to “step up quite quickly to improve medium- to low-level air defence”.He also argued that preventing missile and drone attacks over western airspace “amounted to defending on the goal line” and that effective deterrence would require shooting down Russian jets launching attacks into western airspace. Such an approach, however, is unlikely to find favour with politicians who emphasise that Nato is a defensive alliance.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyNatoRussiaUkrainePolandEuropeMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

Sikorski and his Ukrainian and Lithuanian counterparts issued a statement calling the incursion a “deliberate and coordinated attack” and an “unprecedented provocation”.Map of eastern Europe.However, Alexus Grynkewich, Nato’s supreme allied commander Europe, said at a briefing on Thursday that it was unclear whether the incursion was deliberate. “We do not yet know if this was an intentional act or an unintentional act,” he said. He added that he had “low confidence” in Poland’s claims about the number of drones.“I would not be able to tell you with any confidence today that it was 20 or that it was 10. We just have to get into the technical details to figure that out, to debrief the crews that were up see what they saw,” he said.Russia has claimed its drones were not targeting Poland, but the defence ministry did not confirm or deny Russian drones were involved. On Thursday, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would make no further comment on the incident.Several European countries summoned their Russian ambassadors in response to the incident. Sweden’s foreign minister, Maria Malmer Stenergard, said after meeting the Russian ambassador in Stockholm: “The Russian violations are unacceptable and constitute a threat to Europe’s security.”The German chancellery said it would intensify its support forUkraineand double to four the number of fighter jets it has delegated to a Nato programme to police the skies around the alliance’s eastern borders.Trump’s initial response was ambiguous. “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!” he wrote on social media, without condemning the attack.View image in fullscreenPoland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, visits an airbase on Thursday.Photograph: Jakub Karczmarczyk/EPALate on Wednesday, Poland’s nationalist president, Karol Nawrocki, who visited Trump in the White House last week, said that he and Trump had spoken by phone and “confirmed allied unity”.The US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, offered a more reassuring message for Warsaw. “We stand by our Nato allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of Nato territory,” he wrote on X.Trump’s envoy, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv on Thursday afternoon for a visit that was expected to include consultations with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Kellogg is considered to be among the most pro-Kyiv voices on Trump’s team but often seems to be playing a secondary role to Steve Witkoff, a real estate lawyer and another envoy who has met Putin several times and has apparently developed warm relations with the Russian leader. Witkoff has not yet visited Ukraine.Since Putin and Trump met in Alaska last month, Russia has continued almost nightly air assaults on Ukraine and there is little sign that a ceasefire or peace deal is on the horizon. Many in Europe see the incursion into Poland as Russia testing the limits of Nato solidarity under Trump. Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the incident brought Poland closer to military conflict “than at any time since the second world war”.On Thursday morning, Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, arrived by train to Kyiv, where he was due to meet with Zelenskyy. Stubb has a good relationship with the US president and has emerged as a key link in the European effort to keep Trump onside in support for Ukraine.In Poland, Tusk and Nawrocki addressed troops after the incursion.Tusk visited an airbase in the city of Łask and praised the air force for its quick response. He said a “great modernisation programme” for Poland’s military forces, already announced, would be even more important after the incursion, and said Poland should receive the first delivery of F-35 fighter jets from the US next year, part of a package of 32 aircraft in a long-agreed deal.“We hope that the Americans will meet the deadlines. We would like the first batch of the F-35s to reach you in May, and so that we can speak of our air power with increasing confidence from month to month, and from year to year. And that Poland is truly safe from the sky,” Tusk told the troops.As a precaution, Poland said it was closing air traffic in the eastern part of the country, close to the borders with Russia and Ukraine, to civil flights until 9 December. The country’s air traffic control agency said the measure was “to assure national security”. Airspace over Ukraine has been closed to civil flights since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, while Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months have regularly forced Russian airports to close.Poland said some of the drones that entered its airspace came from Belarusian territory, where Russian and local troops are preparing to begin major military exercises on Friday.Explore more on these topicsPolandRussiaUkraineUnited NationsEuropean UnionNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Today, swimming is strictly prohibited, with fines running into the hundreds of euros, though a longstanding New Year’s Day tradition survives in which divers plunge from one of Rome’s bridges into the chilly waters below.Gualtieri has said that because pollution rates in the Tiber are lower than those previously recorded in the Seine, the Roman operation, if it went ahead, would be cheaper than its €1.4bn (£1.2bn) Parisian precursor.Yet, the Italian capital’s river is far from pristine. In April, scientists from theTara Microplastics missionpublished findings on European waterway pollution that showed the Tiber had an average of three microplastic particles per cubic metre. That may be well below the more than 20 particles per cubic metre recorded in India’s Ganges, but it is still far from reassuring.Further research in September 2024 by Italy’s Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA)revealedthat the Tiber carried more floating waste – mostly plastic – into the sea than any other Italian river, alongside worrying concentrations of ammonia and faecal bacteria.“The health risks linked to pollution in the Tiber and in inland waters are extremely high,” Alessandro Miani, the president of the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine,told the news website Roma Today. “The presence of faecal bacteria such asEscherichia colican trigger gastrointestinal infections in humans, with symptoms including diarrhoea and vomiting. Contact with contaminated water can also cause skin and eye infections, leading to rashes and eye irritation.”The Paris project, meanwhile, was decades in the making. Although the Seine was used for swimming events during the 2024 Olympics, concerns over water quality persisted. Several events were postponed because of highE colilevels, while some athletes took precautionary medication before competing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For now, it remains a distant goal,” wrote Roma Today.In late July, when Gualtieri first raised the prospect of making the river swimmable, the national daily La Repubblica ran with the headline: “A swimmable Tiber? A long and costly journey – if it ever begins.”The paper pointed to a far smaller project – making the lake in Rome’s EUR district fit for bathing – that carries a price tag of about €8m and a timeline of at least five years. “The Tiber will take far longer,” La Repubblica concluded.Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeRiversPollutionWaternewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian could not independently confirm her release.In return for Lukashenko’s prisoner release, the US will ease sanctions on Belarus’s national airline, Belavia, allowing it to service and buy parts for its Boeing aircraft fleet, a spokesperson for the US embassy in Vilnius said.Belarus state agencies also cited John Coale, a lawyer who led the American delegation, as saying thatDonald Trumphad told Lukashenko that Washington wants to reopen its embassy in Minsk.View image in fullscreenThe president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, with the US presidential envoy John Coale.Photograph: Belarus President Press Service/EPASince Trump took office, Lukashenko has repeatedly met with US officials and has spoken to the US president over the phone.A Trump administration official said that the US welcomed the release of political prisoners by Belarus and said that the White House would continue to seek to free the nearly 1,300 remaining political prisoners in Belarus.The official also said that the US delegation to Minsk headed by Coale would address regional security issues, including ending the weaponisation of illegal migration from Belarus into neighbouring Nato countries.Observers say Lukashenko is trying to capitalise on Trump’s desire to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, casting himself as a mediator between Washington and Moscow while at the same time seeking to shore up his own power amid his fears that Belarus’s sovereignty could be swallowed by an increasingly assertiveRussia.“Our main task is to stand with Trump and help him in his mission to establish peace,” Lukashenko said on Thursday, referencing Trump’s claim that he has solved six or seven world conflicts.Trump, for his part, has described the Belarusian leader as “highly respected,” in a sharp break with European efforts to isolate Lukashenko after his brutal crackdown on dissent following the widely condemned 2020 presidential election.In June, a visit to Minsk by the US presidential envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg was followed by therelease of Syarhei Tsikhanouski, a prominent opposition figure jailed for nearly five years after mobilising anti-Lukashenko protests before 2020’s poll.While Belarusian opposition figures in exile have welcomed the recent wave of political releases, they argue that Lukashenko remains firmly aligned with Moscow and is using the political prisoners as a bargaining chip to burnish his international standing and push for sanctions relief to shore up an economy weakened in recent years.“Today, POTUS & his team secured the release of 52 political hostages in Belarus – 38 Belarusians & 14 foreigners … We are grateful for the strong US leadership … 1,200+ hostages remain – all must be released,” Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of Syarhei, who leads the opposition movement abroad, wrote on X.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Khilo is a Belarusian who had worked at the EU mission in Minsk and was arrested in early 2024 and charged with insulting Lukashenko, according to Politico.Many prominent critics of Lukashenko’s decades-long rule remain behind bars, including the opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova and the human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, a co-winner of the 2022 Nobel peace prize.View image in fullscreenSyarhei Tsikhanouski’s was released hours after Donald Trump’s special envoy met Alexander Lukashenko.Photograph: Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya/X/ReutersEven as it frees groups of detainees, the regime continues its crackdown on dissent, handing down prison sentences over something as minor as past social media posts critical of the government.Just this week, a Russian prisoner held on what critics described as politically motivated charges died in custody under unclear circumstances.It is ahighly tense moment for the region, just a day after Poland shot down suspected Russian drones over its territory and on the eve of the Zapad joint military exercises between the Russian and Belarusian armed forces.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said some of the drones that violated Polish airspace had, for the first time, entered from Belarusian territory. Seeking to deflect blame, Belarus’s chief of the general staff, Pavel Muraveiko, claimed Minsk had warned Poland and Lithuania of drones approaching their borders and had even shot some down.Despite Belarus’s continued support for Russia’s war, the US move to ease sanctions on Thursday suggests Lukashenko is succeeding in manoeuvring between both sides – a tangible win for him, analysts said.“I don’t recall a more schizophrenic moment in Belarusian foreign policy,” said Artyom Shraibman, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre. “On 10 September, Russian drones crossed the western border in one direction, while a US delegation crossed in the other, bringing news of aviation sanctions being lifted in exchange for political prisoners.”Explore more on these topicsBelarusAlexander LukashenkoRussiaEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

All of these sites have been damaged, EBAF said, expressing concern for “unique” mosaics left exposed despite their fragility.Poquillon said Gaza has “an extremely ancient heritage, very precious for the region, showing the succession and coexistence of peoples, cultures and religions”.One of Gaza’s two museums has been destroyed and the other heavily damaged since the war started nearly two years ago.Researchers told AFP that, aside from scattered ruins highly vulnerable to bombardment, the EBAF storehouse was the only significant repository of artefacts left in the Palestinian territory.The rediscovery of Gaza’s past began after the 1993 Oslo accords.Two years later, the newly created Gaza antiquities service opened its first archaeological dig in cooperation with EBAF, unearthing remnants of the ancient Greek port of Anthedon and a Roman necropolis.‘I will spend my life rebuilding’: Gaza’s heritage sites destroyed by warRead moreExcavations stalled after Hamas seized power in 2007 and Israel imposed a blockade, resuming years later with support from the British Council and French NGO Première Urgence Internationale (PUI).With Israel now contemplating a full takeover of Gaza and ceasefire talks stalled, archaeologists say prospects for renewed excavations are remote.Unesco, which has already identified damage to 94 heritage sites in Gaza using satellite images, including the 13th-century Pasha’s Palace, has not yet been able to take a full inventory.“We saved a large part, but in a rescue you always lose things, and you always face painful choices,” said René Elter, an archaeologist affiliated with EBAF and scientific coordinator for PUI.The depot, he said, was especially valuable because collections had been classified systematically.“Many items have been broken or lost, but they had been photographed or drawn, so the scientific information is preserved,” Elter said. “Perhaps that will be the only trace that remains of Gaza’s archaeology – in books, publications, libraries.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaArchaeologyUnescoIsrael-Gaza warHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

They say they also found a systematic campaign to strangle humanitarian aid, which they call “using food as a weapon of war”.“The Netanyahu government has gone far beyond targeting Hamas to imposing collective punishment on all the people ofGaza,” Van Hollen said at a Thursday press conference. “What they’re doing, and what we witnessed, is putting those goals into action.”At least one hundred people have died from famine in Gaza, the United Nationssaid this week, citing the Gaza health ministry.View image in fullscreenRelatives of one-and-a-half-year-old Palestinian Ayman Muhammad Abd al-Ghafur, who died from severe malnutrition, oxygen deprivation and muscle wasting, mourn as the body is taken from Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, on Tuesday.Photograph: Abdallah Fs Alattar/Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe senators, who visited Egypt, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jordan, argue that Israel’s actions in Gaza constitute a deliberate strategy to ethnically cleanse the local population rather than collateral damage from the war against Hamas. Their report is titled The Netanyahu Government Is Implementing a Plan to Ethnically Cleanse Gaza of Palestinians. America is Complicit. The World Must Stop It.During their visit to the Egyptian-Gaza border, they observed Rafah, the southern Gaza city – once home to 270,000 Palestinians – reduced to rubble. Van Hollen described how both lawmakers climbed an outside fire escape from the Egyptian side of the border to get a clear view of the destruction.The lawmakers also met with former Israel Defense Forces soldiers who described participating in “systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure”. Their report noted first-hand accounts of “how this was a part of an intentional pattern of using explosives to blow up whole city blocks, houses, schools and other civilian sites”.The senators documented arbitrary restrictions that have left aid groups unable to predict what will be denied entry. Jordanian officials told them that peanut butter, honey and dates had been suddenly banned from convoys, with entire trucks turned away for carrying a single restricted item. Each truck, the report says, is subject to a new $400 customs processing fee, and when the truck is not able to make it through the screening process, the $400 has to be paid again to join a later convoy. Because of those and other restrictions by the Israeli government, humanitarian aid coming in from Jordan was currently operating under 10% of its capacity, according to the report.In Egypt, the senators report, the UN’s fleet of trucks have “sustained severe damage”, with United Nations organizations showing the senators video of their convoys coming under fire from the IDF, “a regular occurrence”. The senators also toured a warehouse run by the Egyptian Red Crescent and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) with goods that had been banned by Israel, including solar-powered water pumps, tents, wheelchairs and even spare parts for trucks under “dual-use” restrictions, according to the report.At the Israeli port of Ashdod, WFP officials told the senators that 2,200 shipping containers of food – enough to feed everyone in Gaza for three weeks – sit delayed by screening procedures requiring each pallet to be checked individually.Merkley described the strategy’s two components: “One is to destroy homes so that they cannot be returned to ... That second strategy is to deprive Palestinians of essentials to live, food, water, medicine.”Israel replaced the UN’s hundreds of distribution sites with just four aid points for 2 million people, three located only in southern Gaza. The senators heard accounts of malnourished mothers unable to walk miles to distribution sites while carrying children and then lift 40lb food boxes for the return journey. From 22 May to 31 July, 1,373 people were killed in the vicinity of these sites,according to the UN.That Israel and the United States are callingplansfor the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza a “voluntary exodus” is one of the “most fraudulent, sinister, and twisted cover stories ever told”, the report reads.“There is nothing voluntary about wanting to depart when your home is gone, when your agricultural fields are no longer accessible,” Van Hollen said at the press conference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A recent Senate vote on arms sales to Israel saw 27 Democratic senators – more than half the caucus – oppose weapons transfers.“The same values that made me a champion for Israel compel me to say what they are doing to the Palestinians, both in West Bank and in Gaza, is absolutely wrong,” said Merkley.Both lawmakers called for immediate action to secure a ceasefire, noting that Israeli hostage families had told them Netanyahu “has prioritized his political survival over the survival of our loved ones”.“The world has a moral and legal obligation to stop the ongoing ethnic cleansing,” their report concludes. “Strong words alone will not be sufficient.

He added: “That is naked antisemitism and an attack on the basics of our culture.”Germany, which is a close ally of Israel, has distanced itself from Netanyahu’s government in the face of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Florian Wiegand, the artistic director of the Munich Philharmonic, said: “We are stunned that a festival in Belgium, in the heart ofEurope, the main seat of the European Union, has made such an unimaginable decision.”Shani, who at 36 will become the Munich orchestra’s youngest ever director, has not commented on the situation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gergiev was sacked in 2022 after he failed to speak out against the invasion of Ukraine or distance himself from his close friend and supporter, Vladimir Putin.One of four principal orchestras in the Bavarian state capital, the Munich Philharmonic is considered one of the most important in the world and performed the premieres of Gustav Mahler’s fourth and eighth symphonies under the baton of the composer himself.Explore more on these topicsBelgiumClassical musicGermanyAntisemitismIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

A motion by Sabeti’s lawyers to dismiss the case for breaching the statute of limitations was rejected by district court judge Gregory Presnell of the central district of Florida on 12 August. A trial could take place early next year.According to the lawsuit, Sabeti “has spent the last four decades out of the public eye, concealing his whereabouts and identity”. He and his wife, Nasrin, 75, might even have remained incognito had he not been inadvertently “outed” by one of his daughtersin a February 2023 tweetshowing him at a rally in Los Angeles denouncing Iran’s Islamic government.While the disclosure may have been inadvertent, and directly led to the plaintiffs’ attorneys being able to locate him and file the lawsuit, some believe it was part of a campaign by the Iranian diaspora in the US to help “sanitize” the history of the former shah’s deposed government and build momentum and support for a new pro-western regime.Reza Pahlavi, sometimes called the “crown prince” of Iran as son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, told the Guardianin a 2023 interview, at the height of anti-Tehran protests, that he was working with allies to draw up a charter of democratic principles for any new Iranian government to follow. He has since portrayed himself as ready to replace the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, andbecome interim head of state.Sabeti, meanwhile, has worked as Pahlavi’s “security adviser”, according to a2023 articleposted to the website of the National Council of Resistance to Iran, a coalition of Iranian political figures portraying itself as a parliament in exile.Efforts by the Guardian to reach Sabeti were unsuccessful, including emails and calls to his home, and messages seeking comment to all four of his attorneys listed in court documents.View image in fullscreenParviz Sabeti at a press conference on 4 April 1971.Photograph: Ettela’at (newspaper)Not in question is how well Sabeti and his family have lived in the US since arriving in Florida in 1978, having fled Tehran just weeks ahead of the1979 Islamic revolution.The Sabetis, who according toleaked state department documentswere able to transfer a sizable sum of money from Iran – said by one source to be above $20m – westernized their first names to Peter and Nancy after their arrival.Using those aliases, Sabeti set up what was to become a successful real estate development company in central Florida. Sabeti, his wife and two daughters are listed as directors of several still-active companies on the state of Florida’s business database.Public records seen by the Guardian show that the Sabeti family own at least eight properties in Orange county, including the five-bedroom, six-bathroom Windermere mansion purchased for $3.5m in August 2005.The state department and the CIA did not respond to questions about the Sabetis’ immigration status in the US, or the grounds on which they were first admitted in 1978. Both Parviz and Nasrim Sabeti, however, hold active voter registrations in Florida, and records show they voted in the 2024 presidential election, meaning both are US citizens.A neighbor said she would often see the couple, particularly Nasrim, out walking, but that the Sabetis mostly appeared to value their privacy. Their house was almost always quiet, apart from occasional visits by their daughters.Neither daughter responded to a request for comment.Florida’s Republican attorney general, James Uthmeier, did not respond to a question about whether he would launch a criminal investigation into Sabeti’s activities, as he previously has for other people in Floridaaccused of nefarious crimesoverseas.Sara Colón, an attorney for the plaintiffs, welcomed Presnell’s orders to deny Sabeti’s request for dismissal, and to preserve the anonymity of her clients, who said they had been subjected to death threats and intimidation since filing the lawsuit.View image in fullscreenAn Iranian dissident, hiding his face for fear of identification, lies on one of several three-level grids with burners underneath found in the cellar of a house of a senior Savak official that was stormed and set alight by demonstrators, on 31 December 1978.Photograph: Derek Ive/AP“These decisions are a positive result for survivors of torture who are seeking accountability and justice. This case is not only about ending impunity, it is about affirming that survivors have the right to pursue justice and reclaim their dignity without fear,” she said.The Iranian Collective for Justice & Accountability, an advocacy group for victims of torture and their families, said it hoped the Sabeti case would help end a “cycle of violence” seen in Iran during the shah’s regime and the Islamic fundamentalist government that succeeded it.“The message should be clear and simple: all victims deserve justice, and everyone engaged in torture and repression should be held accountable,” a spokesperson for the group said in a statement.“The roots of the brutal policies being carried out today by the Islamic Republic of Iran are connected to the torture methods enacted by Sabeti and Savak. [The case] should stand as a rejection of a future Iran that re-establishes Savak, or seeks to provide blanket amnesty to current security forces who have been involved in torture and repression.“It is only through justice and accountability that we can overcome the horrific violence and repression that has ruled Iran for decades.”Explore more on these topicsIranFloridaTortureMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I used to love the Royal Opera House and everything that they did but the decision is a disgrace. There are so many great opera singers, it doesn’t have to be a question. I think it’s a disgrace.“I think it has damaged the image of the RoyalOpera. I don’t understand how [this] theatre can be a royal theatre when this country has been supporting Ukraine since day one.”Oleksandra Vietrova, 43, held a sign that read: “Behind the curtain, blood and tanks”.

Last month, more than 50 Ukrainian writers and artists, a cross-party group of UK MPs and former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark urged the Royal Ballet and Opera (RBO) to drop Netrebko from its new London season, describing her as a “longtime symbol of cultural propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes”.In a letter, the group argued the RBO faced a “defining choice: between status and responsibility, between profit and values, between silence and conscience”, adding: “We urge you to remain, as you consistently have, on the ethical side of art – and of history.”The RBO has said as a “singer’s house” it has a duty to showcase the greatest performers, adding that Netrebko has condemned the invasion.A number of other major opera houses across Europe have featured the Russian soprano in the past two years. Her general manager, Miguel Esteban, said she had “never shown support for Russian separatists” and had condemned the war in three social media statements and two interviews. She had not returned to Russia since the full-scale invasion, he added.View image in fullscreenA protester holds a sign outside the Royal Opera House in London.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIn 2014 Netrebko made a donation to Donetsk’s opera house after Russia seized the city, and she wasphotographedholding the separatist flag of “Novorossiya” with a pro-Kremlin former Ukrainian politician.

He described the deaths of American children from school shootings as an acceptable ‘cost’ of protecting gun rights. He justified the killing of civilians in Gaza, including women and children, by blaming them collectively for Hamas. He called for the retraction of the Civil Rights Act, and repeatedly spread harmful stereotypes about LGBTQ and trans communities. These were horrific and dehumanising statements.”Kirk and Abaraonye had met during a debate on toxic masculinity held by the Oxford Union in May, the Telegraph reported. Donald Trump, the US president,paid tribute to Kirkas a “martyr for truth and freedom” after the shooting.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of OxfordCharlie Kirk shootingnewsShareReuse this content"

Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the leftwing Labour MP, failed to make the cut-off.Phillipson, the education secretary, had already won enough nominations from MPs by Wednesday night but added to her tally of endorsements on Thursday, reaching 175.Phillipson said: “I am so proud to have received well over half the nominations made byLabourMPs, from all wings of our party and from all corners of the country.“Labour only wins when our party comes together: that is why I plan to give a voice at the cabinet table to all parts of our movement so that we have the best chance of delivering a second term.“My message now to Labour party members is simple: back me to unite our party and our movement so we can beat Reform at the next election and build the Britain our children deserve.”After clinching the nominations, Powell said: “This is not a contest I expected nor any of us wanted but we must use it to focus on how the new deputy leader can be a bridge for all parts of our movement and help the government deliver the progressive change the country needs.“I am Labour through and through. I will always fight for our party, our values and our traditions. At a time when there are forces trying to spread division and hatred, Labour must be the voice of unity and hope.“I look forward to speaking to as many members, activists and supporters as possible to make the case about the kind of full-time deputy leader I would be; laser focused on connecting with our communities through our MPs, elected representatives and members fighting for the change our country needs.”Labour MPs have depicted the race as a proxy war between the prime minister and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, often tipped as a successor to Starmer. Powell, the MP for Manchester Central who was recently removed as leader of the House of Commons, is close to Burnham and was endorsed by him for the deputy leadership.Powell’s team have dismissed the talk of proxies as wrong and sexist, but there are increasing fears about how the deputy leadership debate will play out. Many of those MPs who were removed in the recent reshuffle have backed Powell.Tensions have also been raised after Mainstream, thenew centre-left Labour organisationbacked by Burnham, issued a strongly worded statement criticising the Mandelson saga.Lord Mandelson was forced to quit over newly revealed affectionate emails with the late child sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. The group said the misjudgment over Mandelson’s appointment showed Starmer was running a “narrow and brittle political project”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need a government and party of all the talents and all the views.”The strength of the statement sent shockwaves around MPs. “This basically is a leadership challenge,” one said.Both Powell and Phillipson have pledged to be a leading campaigner for Labour around the country as part of their role as deputy leader. A source close to Phillipson said she had a broad base of support across all wings of the parliamentary Labour party, including the most new MPs and the most geographical diversity.One ally said: “All her backers know that Bridget is the only candidate to unite the party, push our positive message out to the country and deliver the change we were elected to bring.”The candidates must also gain nominations from constituency parties and affiliates before ballots are issued to members. A hustings for the candidates will take place at the Labour party conference, with ballots opening on Wednesday 8 October and closing on Thursday 23 October.

He will appear in The Tempest and, alongside Oscar winner Helen Hunt, in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard at the RSC next summer.Branagh, 64, began to build a reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation when he played Henry V, aged 23, in a 1984 season that included roles as Laertes in Hamlet and the King of Navarre in Love’s Labour’s Lost. The following year he wrote and directed the play Tell Me Honestly for the RSC. Branagh went on to both direct and star in acclaimed Shakespeare productions during an illustrious stage and screen career that has included breaking an Oscars record as the first person to be nominated in seven individual Academy Award categories. The Tempest will mark his first role for the RSC since he played Hamlet in 1992 and 1993 (first at the Barbican in London and then in Stratford), directed by Adrian Noble.The Guardian’s Michael Billington, who predicted “a rich Shakespearean future for this young actor” in his review of Henry V, wrote that in the role of Hamlet, Branagh captured, “as well as any actor I recall, a deep sense of filial love”. He continued: “This is a fine Hamlet, stamped with rueful sadness, that should dispel any doubt about Branagh’s staying power.”View image in fullscreenKenneth Branagh in the film Henry V in 1989.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyThe Tempest was the first play Branagh saw as an audience member in Stratford, when he sat in the gods for a 1978 production starring Michael Hordern, David Suchet, Alan Rickman and Ruby Wax. In 2012, wearing a top hat in character as the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Branagh delivered a speech by Caliban from The Tempest (“the isle is full of noises”) at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games in London. He will now take on the part of the magician Prospero, who gives the famous “Our revels now are ended” speech, in what is billed as an “epic new staging” of the shipwreck drama directed by Richard Eyre and with a set design by Bob Crowley. The Tempest begins previews on 13 May in the Royal Shakespeare theatre.It will be followed, in the smaller Swan theatre, by The Cherry Orchard, which opens in July. Branagh will play Lopakhin alongside Hunt as Madame Ranevskaya in a new version of the play by Laura Wade and directed by Tamara Harvey, who runs the RSC with Daniel Evans. Wade and Harvey are frequent collaborators and recently teamed up for a new version of Somerset Maugham’sThe Constant Wifein Stratford. Hunt, who played Viola in Twelfth Night on Broadway in 1998, was last on stage in the UK inEureka Dayat the Old Vic in 2022.View image in fullscreenJoanne Pearce as Ophelia and Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet at the Barbican theatre, London, in 1992.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMark Gatiss will also appear with the RSC next year, making his debut for the company in the lead role of a Chicago mobster, modelled on Hitler, in Bertolt Brecht’s political satire The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui. Stephen Sharkey’s version of the play will be directed by Seán Linnen in the Swan from April to May. Gatiss called it “Brecht’s most accessible and dynamic work … The play is always timely but to say it’s urgent now is an understatement. With fascism on the march everywhere, the story of how a washed-up nonentity like Hitler could seduce a nation and become the most powerful dictator in the world serves as a terrifying warning.”The RSC’s spring season includes, in the Other Place (its third stage in Stratford), actor Martina Laird’s debut as a playwright, Driftwood, about capitalism and colonialism in Trinidad. The play, which was the runner-up for the 2024 Verity Bargate award, will be directed by Justin Audibert and will transfer to the Kiln theatre in London. Also in the Other Place, Rachel Bagshaw will stage a new version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, edited by Robin Belfield, that will move to Stratford after its run at the Unicorn theatre in London.Explore more on these topicsTheatreKenneth BranaghRoyal Shakespeare CompanyWilliam ShakespeareHelen HuntMark GatissnewsShareReuse this content"

We have a clear zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials.”The complaint describes Uber’s alleged mistreatment of 17 individuals.They include JE, a seven-year-old amputee from the Bronx, New York, who was allegedly denied a ride home from his brother’s birthday party after an Uber driver looked at his wheelchair and asked: “Is that coming?”Another was Jason Ludwig, a Gulf war veteran with a service dog, who was allegedly denied a ride to the Norfolk airport in Virginia from Newport News, missed his flight, and had to drive 16 hours home to Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts.A third rider, Jeff Clark of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, allegedly had four drivers in Philadelphia cancel rides in a 17-minute period after he told them he was blind and used a guide dog.The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring further ADA violations. It also seeks upgrades to Uber’s practices and training, monetary damages and a civil fine.A justice department spokesman had no immediate additional comment.Explore more on these topicsUbernewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what we know so far:Kirk, 31, died after being shot during a presentation on campus. Donald Trump announced the death in a Truth Social post, writing: “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.”Kirk, the executive director of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), was shot at about 12.10pm local time while appearing at an event. In video posts circulating on social media, Kirk can be seen being struck while speaking and sitting beneath a tent.Video footageshows students on campus running away from the sound of a gunshot.On Thursday morning, the FBI said officials recovered a “high-powered bolt action rifle” they believe to have been used to shoot Kirk. The weapon was found in a wooded area. Investigators also collected “footwear, impression, a palm print and forearm imprints for analysis”.Utah officials said there was “good video footage” of the suspect, who moved to the other side of the building from where shots were thought to have been fired, jumped off the building and fled the campus. officials added that the shooter “blended in” and “appears to be of college age”.The Salt Lake City FBI field office shared pictures of a person of interest in the shooting and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the person or people responsible. Two pictures posted on X show a person in black sunglasses, a baseball cap, a long sleeved black shirt and jeans. The FBI is asking for the public’s help identifying the person.On Thursday, Trump announced he would award Kirk a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony at the Pentagon to mark the 24th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.One person detained at the scene, George Zinn, was deemed not to be a suspect but was charged with obstructing justice. A second person taken into custody was released after being interviewed. Neither had ties to the shooting, according to the university.The shooting was “believed to be a targeted attack”, with the shooter firing from the roof of a building into the student courtyard, the university said.Kirk was about 20 minutes into a presentation when a single shot was fired at him, the university said.The university said it had six officers working alongside Kirk’s security team at the event, which was attended by roughly 3,000 people.Trump blamed the violence on the rhetoric of the “radical left” in an evening video address, while the suspect’s identity and motives remained unconfirmed. Spencer Cox, Utah’s governor, called the killing a “political assassination”.Political leaders in the US immediately condemned the attack. Joe Biden, the former US president, tweeted: “There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now. Jill and I are praying for Charlie Kirk’s family and loved ones.”Barack Obama also condemned political violence, writing on X: “We don’t yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy. Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie’s family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children.”Senior Democrats and Republicans also condemned the shooting. Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among Democrats who condemned the attack. JD Vance, Pam Bondi, Kristi Noem and Pete Hegseth paid tribute to Kirk and asked the public to pray for him.The House speaker, Mike Johnson,told reportersat the Capitol: “Political violence has become all too common in American society. This is not who we are. It violates the core principles of our country.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUtahFar right (US)Gun crimeUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Paramount and WBD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Shares in WBD surged by as much as 34% following the report, and closed up 29% on Thursday. The firm owns an array of media assets, including the Warner Bros movie studios; CNN, the news network; the DC Comics franchise; and a string of TV networks, including HBO.Paramount also owns the storied Paramount Pictures studios, as well as TV broadcasters includingCBSin the US, Channel 5 in the UK, Comedy Central and MTV.David Ellison has moved quickly since sealing control of the conglomerate in August, striking a$7.7bn (£5.7bn) deal to become the exclusive US broadcasterof the Ultimate Fighting Championship; signing an exclusive contract with the Duffer brothers, who created Stranger Things; and agreeing a deal with the video games publisher Activision to produce a movie based on the Call of Duty franchise.Decisions made under Ellison around the future of CBS News – one of the biggest news operations in the US, which is behind 60 Minutes, the most watched news program on network television – have attracted intense scrutiny.CBS News became a flashpoint as Ellison sought approval for his deal for Paramount. Shortly before the deal closed this summer, itreached a controversial settlementwith Donald Trump over what he claimed was misleading editing of a pre-election 60 Minutes interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris.Disgruntled NYT journalist to ‘anti-woke’ power grab: how far can Bari Weiss go?Read moreEarlier this week, Paramount announced that Kenneth Weinstein – a conservative policy veteran who Trump nominated to be US ambassador to Japan in 2020 – would become ombudsman for CBS News, monitoring allegations of bias and audience complaints.Ellison is widely reported to be on the verge of acquiring the Free Press, an online publicationco-founded by Bari Weiss and noted for its “anti-woke” politics, with the New York Timesreportingthis week that Weiss, its former columnist, had been lined up for a senior role at CBS News.Any deal for WBD would raise questions over the implications for CNN, which has also faced heavy criticism from Trump over coverage he has not liked.WBD was formed by themerger of Warner Media and Discoveryin April 2022. After a tough few years, its CEO, David Zaslav – who put together the initial merger –announced plans to split the company into twoin June.Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester Research, suggested a takeover of WBD by Paramount would “redefine the streaming landscape” were it to materialize. “This could be good for consumers in the form of cost savings, but it also would reduce marketplace choice,” he said. “What’s clear is that as the streaming market matures, it’s looking a whole lot like the OG television industry – all the way back to when there were just a few big networks and studios.”Robert Weissman, co-president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, argued any attempt by Paramount to acquire WBD “should plainly be struck down” by regulators on antitrust grounds. “But there’s grave reason to worry that the Trump administration would rubber-stamp such a merger, giving a pass to a corporate marriage that would advance its ideological agenda,” he said.Approving a Paramount-WBD tie-up “would confirm that, for all its tough talk on antitrust, the Trump regime is intent simply on using antitrust as another weaponized tool: a means to punish perceived opponents and reward ideological allies”, Weissman added.Explore more on these topicsBusinessMergers and acquisitionsParamount+Warner BrosCBSTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July.Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that theFederal Reservewill cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure fromDonald Trumpto cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that theUS jobs market is weakening.Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%.US stocks shot up on Wednesday after the producer price index, which tracks wholesale prices, showed aslight dipin August after a steep rise in July, making investors hopeful that inflation – while still rising – is going up at a slow pace.latest inflation chartThe Fed has refrained from cutting rates over the past year, citing instability in the economy introduced by federal immigration and trade policies. The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market.At his closely watchedspeechat the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair,Jerome Powell, said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates.Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”.“If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection.Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economywent into the negativefor the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationEconomicsTrump tariffsFederal ReserveUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

His friendDonald Trumpis in the White House, his son David Ellison has taken over the storied media companyCBS, and on Wednesday he surpassed his buddyElon Muskto win the title of the “world’s richest man”.Oracle’s stock went wild with the news, pushing his fortune even higher. Ellison’s net worthshot up to $393bn, surpassing Musk’s $384bn – although, by the time markets closed on Wednesday, Musk was back ahead.Ellison is not as much of a household name as Musk, but he is largely influential in Silicon Valley and more recently, politics. He’s known for a lavish lifestyle filled with mega-yachts, private jets, a long list of wives, and owning the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai.The 81-year-old mega-billionaire made his fortune in software development going back to the 1970s. He co-founded Oracle after landing a two-year contract building a database for the CIA, according to theAcademy of Achievement. Oracle became a tech giant creating software for Fortune 500 companies around the world, and more recently in cloud computing. The advent of artificial intelligence has been a boon for the company, entering lucrative deals with the likes ofOpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.Larry Ellison overtakes Elon Musk as world’s richest personRead more“AI is a much bigger deal than the Industrial Revolution, electricity and everything that’s come before,” Ellison said, touting the technology, in an interview with the former UK prime ministerTony Blairin February.Ellison was the CEO ofOraclefor 37 years, and then transitioned in 2014 to the role of chief technology officer. He still heads the board of directors and owns more than 40% of the company, which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, in 2020.Along with Oracle, Ellison sat on Tesla’s board of directors from 2018 to 2022 and owns a stake in Musk’s electric car company. According to Forbes, he alsoowns nearly 50%of the newly minted media conglomerate Paramount Skydance, which is run by his son David. The company’s properties include CBS, MTV, Paramount Pictures and more. The younger Ellison has said that the media company won’t cater to political parties. Still, he’s on the verge ofbringing on Bari Weiss, thepolarizing anti-woke championwho co-founded the Free Press, to help lead CBS News.Ellison’s ties to Trump and NetanyahuEllison has a decade-long history with the Republican party and aclose relationship with Trumpgoing back to the president’s first term. Ellison has frequented Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort for dinners and met him in the Oval Office. As Trump has repeatedly postponed complying with the supreme court’s January ruling to ban TikTok if it’s not sold, Oracle hasemerged as the lead buyerof the popular social media app.“In the case of Larry, Larry Ellison, it’s well beyond technology, sort of CEO of everything,” Trump said during anews conferencea day after he was inaugurated. “He’s an amazing man and an amazing business person.”Ellison is also close to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and has donated heavily to the Israeli military through the non-profit Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. In 2017, he gave the organisation itsbiggest-ever donationat the time – $16.6m. Oracle did not respond to questions from the Guardian asking if Ellison has donated more recently.Ellison has hosted Netanyahu and other dignitaries and celebrities at his huge estate on Lanai,according to Bloomberg. He bought 98% of the island in 2012 and has since created an exclusive luxury Four Seasons resort and started a hydroponic farm that grows lettuce and other greens. Local Lanai residents told Bloomberg that they have scrambled to hold on to their scant land as they have seen their island transform from a sleepy outpost to adestination for the ultra-rich.Musk, Ellison’s friend and rival for “world’s richest man”, is a frequent guest on Lanai and calls the Oracle co-founder his mentor, according to a biography on Musk by Walter Isaacson.

It follows a fall in spending by wealthy collectors amid growing geopolitical and trade tensions in recent years.Sotheby’s also took a hit from hefty payouts for what appeared to be the departure of just a handful of staff. Severance costs last year jumped to $29.2m, compared with $11.4m in 2023, despite its headcount only dropping by 24 employees to 2,218, according to findings first reported by the Financial Times.Losses at John Lewis and Waitrose owner almost triple to £88mRead moreThe company, whichoperatesin 40 countries, was founded as a rare book dealer in 1744 by London bookseller Samuel Baker and did not enter the world of fine arts until the early 20th century, opening an office in New York in 1955 as the US market became increasingly important.As well as auctions of art and books, it has expanded into areas including wine, diamonds and also a financial services arm that funds art deals and makes loans secured against collections.Sotheby’s was later snapped up by Drahi,who took the company private in a £3.7bn deal in 2019. The French-Israeli businessman, a keen art collector, has since struck a deal with Abu Dhabi’s third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, ADQ, to help raise about $1bn for the company’s turnaround, in exchange for a 24% stake.While Drahihas come to greater public prominencethrough his interest in the art world, the bulk of his wealth derives from his founding of the Amsterdam-listed telecoms firm Altice, which he built up via a string of acquisitions of smaller companies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it poses some big questions about key corners of the empire assembled by his father over seven decades.‘Teflon Rebekah’Lachlan is said by some to not be as enamoured as his father with Robert Thomson, the 64-year-old boss of News Corp, whose friendship and business career with Rupert go back decades . But he is described by one source as “super-close” to the News UK chief,Rebekah Brooks.It has emerged that Brooks wasin attendance at the Harvard Club in New Yorkalongside personal representatives of the two warring sides of the Murdoch family when meetings began this year about the buyout and trust change.“Rebekah was in the room when negotiations were taking place. That tells you all you need to know about the closeness of Rebekah to Rupert and Lachlan,” says another former senior executive. “She remains untouchable: Teflon Rebekah.”However, this relationship could be tested when the spotlight returns later this month to the phone-hacking scandal. ITV, which last year made a national issue of the machinations of executives over the Horizon IT scandalin the drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, is launching a series on the scandal called The Hack, based in part on abook by the former Guardian journalist Nick Davies.News UK has already sent a legal note to publishers on behalf of the parent company of the Sun about allegations made in the book.For Lachlan, presiding over listed businesses with a $42bn combined market valuation, commercial decisions that would be unconscionable to the family patriarch who is a newspaper man through-and-through are likely to come into sharper relief.View image in fullscreenSteve Pemberton as Rupert Murdoch and Jordan Renzo as James in the forthcoming ITV drama.Photograph: ITV studios“It is no secret he likes newspapers more than James did, but today is completely different than when he grew up and they were all making a lot of money and fuelling the business,” says the first former executive. “The crossroads for the business, certainly as far as newspapers are concerned, will be when Rupert passes, because of Lachlan’s loyalty and respect.“I think he will make some purely quite cold business decisions. He has probably had conversations about it and Rupert would have said, ‘You make the call,’ and would have respected that, as he has had to make plenty of tough decisions.”Under Thomson, who recently had his contract extended until 2030, News Corp continues to perform strongly, with a $17bn market value that has almost doubled over the past five years. The business delivered a 4% increase in revenues, to $8.4bn, and a 14% increase in profits to $1.4bn in its most recent results for the year to 30 June.However, 85% of profits are derived from Dow Jones, home to the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s and MarketWatch, and its digital real estate business.Dow Jones, which has been estimated by analysts to be worth more than $10bn if it were hived off, continues to thrive amid the impact of the onset oftraffic-diverting productssuch as Google’s AI Overviews and AI Mode.Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones products rose by 7% to 6.3m in the year to June; within this the Wall Street Journal grew 9% to 4.1m.What next forthe Sun?In the UK, the Times and Sunday Times grew digital subscriptions by 46,000 to 640,000 in the year to June, and made a £61m profit in 2024,according to the most recent filingat Companies House.Overall, News Corp’s news media segment, which includes News UK, its Australian subsidiary and the New York Post, reported profits of $153m, 11% of the group total. But a $39m fall in ad revenues was attributed to falling print income in Australia and digital traffic at the Sun due to “algorithmic changes at certain platforms”.What to do about the Sun is one of the biggest issues facing Lachlan. According to News Corp, the Sun, which this yearlaunched a £2-a-month paywallfor certain content, had a 22% year-on-year decline to 87m global monthly unique users in June.The parent company of the Sun reported that it made apre-tax loss of £18min the year to June 2024, the smallest loss since 2011, but bringing cumulative losses at the red top’s owner to more than £1.2bn since the start of its costly phone-hacking battle almost 15 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But for an investor now, or if McKinsey came in, no one would say looking at the current landscape that they should still hang on to these assets. Concentrate on core profit-making operations.”With investors no longer concerned about the ramifications of a potential succession standstill – and the ongoing certainty of the $3.62bn in profits thatFoxNews’s owner, Fox Corp, made in its last financial year – one move analysts seem to agree will not happen is a renewed effort to merge News Corp and Fox.Two years ago, Murdochscrapped a proposal to reunify his media businesses, which he was forced to split after the phone-hacking scandal, following opposition from investors and from his son James.“The proposed merger would have been voted against by a huge number of external shareholders,” says Claire Enders of Enders Analysis. “I don’t think the issues put forward then are going to go away. With lawsuits against Fox and the Wall Street Journal I don’t think a merger will be at the top of the list.”Lachlan ‘wants size and scale’As for his susceptibility to political pressure, Lachlan is hard to read. Some believe he is even further to the right than his father, pointing to material released during Fox’s legal battle with Dominion Voting Systems, in which he appeared to back a more pro-Trump approach in the aftermath of Joe Biden’s 2020 election.Fox is still facing a legal action from the voting system Smartmatic.“He doesn’t aspire to be that king maker, politically, that Rupert has been throughout his career,” says Paddy Manning, a journalist and author ofThe Successor: the high-stakes life of Lachlan Murdoch.While Trump and the Maga movement remain key to the fortunes of Fox News, Lachlan has backed the Wall Street Journal,and its editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, over a lawsuit following the publication of allegations that the president composeda crude poem and doodleas part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday.Lachlan and his father are likely to take a hard look at its business operations following the payout to secure his eldest son’s control.The deal required a new $1bn loan to be taken out and at about 34% the new trust will have a bit less control over the businesses than with the 40% voting power the family previous held.In November, the activist investor Starboard Value lost a shareholder vote aimed at scrapping the dual-class share structure at News Corp, which would have weakened the family’s control.Starboard has also pushed for News Corp tospin off REA, the highly successful digital real estate business controlled by News Corp in Australia.Considered to be Lachlan’sshrewdest and most profitable contributionto the building the family empire – in 2001 he persuaded News Corporation to invest A$2m in REA for a 44% stake increasing to 62% in 2005 – the business accounted for 43% of News Corp’s profits in its latest financial year.Last September, REA Groupabandoned its attemptto take over the UK property portal Rightmove after its fourth offer of £6.2bn was rejected.“Lachlan is ambitious,” says a third source who has worked with him. “I bet he swings big. He never wanted to sell [21st Century] Fox to Disney, or see Sky go to Comcast, he wants size and scale. How big he goes and how he finances it are the big questions.”Explore more on these topicsLachlan MurdochRupert MurdochJames MurdochNewspapersTelevision industryNewspapers & magazinesMedia businessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has been a whirlwind week for the 60-year-old who has replaced Nuno Espírito Santo and it will be fascinating to see what changes are made to the team’s style. Nuno is a cautious coach and would have plotted a counterattacking approach at the Emirates Stadium, but there are no guarantees with Postecoglou. Pragmatism is a word rarely associated with the Australian but he needs to get his players onside quickly after the unfortunate departure of his predecessor, whowas not dismissed for footballing reasons. It might make more sense to tweak what has already been constructed on strong foundations, especially considering he will have little time with the squad after international duty and before a Saturday lunchtime kick-off. Being able to adapt is a sign of strength in a coach and Postecoglou needs to show he has learned from errors made at Tottenham when he refused to change.Will UnwinArsenal vNottingham Forest, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)View image in fullscreenThe Ange Postecoglou era begins at Nottingham Forest with a trip to the Emirates Stadium.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA2Senesi offers Petrovic welcome stabilityDjordje Petrovic was on the other end of England’s excellence during the international break, watchingfive goals go past himin Belgrade. But Serbia’s No 1 will return to a more stable defence on Saturday, with Bournemouth aiming for their third clean sheet in a row. It’s tidy work from a side that had their backline gutted in the transfer window, with European giants swooping in for Milos Kerkez (Liverpool), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid) and Illia Zabarnyi (Paris Saint-Germain). Petrovic has replaced Kepa Arrizabalaga, while the other new arrivals Bafodé Diakité and Adrien Truffert have slotted in at centre-half and left-back respectively. But a more familiar name has also shone. A quad injury derailed Marcos Senesi for much of last season but he has begun brightly this time round, a shutout in thewin over Tottenhamalso including the key pass for Evanilson’s goal. According to Opta, Senesi is second in the league for interceptions and clearances. The Argentinian’s task now is to help turn around a poor head-to-head record: Bournemouth have lost five of their past six against Brighton.Taha HashimBournemouth v Brighton, Saturday 3pm3Guéhi’s next steps in the spotlightIt felt like goodbye. Marc Guéhi scored in what was expected to be his final Crystal Palace appearance, a whipping strike in the3-0 victory at Villa Park. Then came the drama of deadline day and thecollapse of Guéhi’s move to Liverpool, with Oliver Glasner keeping hold of his captain for the time being. Since then he’s been with England, adding a first international goal to his record and strengthening his case to be a World Cup starter. Guéhi has garnered plenty of praise for remaining committed on the field while awaiting a prospective transfer, to which there should be a Roy Keane-style rebuttal: well, that is his job. The 25-year-old begins another stage of his career against a Sunderland side who would gladly take a repeat of their last trip to Selhurst Park: they were 4-0 victors there in February 2017 thanks to a Jermain Defoe double.THCrystal Palace v Sunderland, Saturday 3pm4Emery must steer Martínez back on trackIt was a fun deadline day for Unai Emery andAston Villa. Victor Lindelöf, Jadon Sancho and Harvey Elliott all moved to Villa Park but another important bit of business was carried out. Emiliano Martínez will be staying at the club despite batting his eyelids at potential suitors. The job for Emery now is to reintegrate him into the side, because he is an elite performer and the best goalkeeper available to him, but others may be uncertain about his attitude. Martínez does his best work on the pitch and a show of faith from Emery – as well as the chance to shine after missing two out of Villa’s three opening fixtures – could get the relationship back on track.WUEverton v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez (right) applauds the Aston Villa fans after their defeat at Brentford.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters5Silva should be patient with new wing wizardsMarco Silva did not see significant reinforcements arrive until the final day of the transfer window. It was a slow summer for Fulham but they acted before the deadline, signing Samuel Chukwueze and Kevin. Silva wanted wide players; now he has two new ones to compete with Harry Wilson, Emile Smith Rowe, Adama Traoré and Alex Iwobi. Kevin has joined from Shakhtar Donetsk and Chukwueze, once a target for Chelsea, has come from Milan on loan. They should both add quality to Silva’s squad, although it would be a surprise if they start against Leeds at Craven Cottage. Silva has a settled dressing room and he will probably want to give the two newcomers time to adjust to thePremier League.Jacob SteinbergFulham v Leeds, Saturday 3pm6Will Howe reshape his attacking setup?Two strikers do not fit into Eddie Howe’s preferred 4-3-3 system so, unless Newcastle’s manager switches formation, one of his new attacking signings may need to begin on the bench. The £55m DR Congo forward Yoane Wissa could begin life in the No 9 shirt as a substitute after a late return from international duty in Africa. A feasible alternative could be to switch to a 4-2-3-1 setup and deploy fellow new arrival Nick Woltemade as a No 10, while fielding Joelinton as the left-sided attacker. That, though, would mean sacrificing a winger. Much here may hinge on whether Jørgen Strand Larsen features in the Wolves starting XI. Howe tried to bring in the Norway striker before turning his attentions to Woltemade and will doubtless be hoping Strand Larsen fails to recover from a minor achilles injury in time to show him precisely what he missed out on. After the collection of only two points from their opening three matches, Newcastle could do with a restorative win before Thursday’s Champions League opener against Barcelona.Louise Taylorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An unsurprising development. The striker was unavailable for most of last season and is facing another spell on the sidelines after leaving the Germany camp early because of a calf problem. West Ham were foolish to sign him. Füllkrug’s fitness record is unreliable and he is a doubt to face Tottenham. There could be an opportunity for Callum Wilson instead, although he might have started anyway given that he impressed after coming on for Füllkrug and scoring during West Ham’swin over Nottingham Forestlast month. Wilson has also had injury problems before leaving Newcastle but he is an experienced Premier League player and looked sharp, strong and dangerous against Forest. His nous around the penalty box could come in handy against Spurs.JSWest Ham v Tottenham, Saturday 5.30pm8Garnacho may be shiniest Chelsea teacupThere is a new kid on the block at Stamford Bridge in the form of Alejandro Garnacho. He was eager to get out ofManchester Unitedthis summer and find a club that more suited his needs. Like many members of “bomb squads” waiting on moves away, the Argentinian needs to catch up on fitness after zero pre-season games. There is also a healthy competition for places, so he will not walk into the Chelsea team. Enzo Maresca hoards wingers like others do teacups sent by distant relatives but the head coach also knows that Garnacho, given the right training and discipline, could be the best in the cupboard. It will be a fine balancing act when it comes to giving him the right opportunities, but Garnacho will be desperate to prove himself after a tumultuous year and Brentford is a good place to start.WUBrentford v Chelsea, Saturday 8pmView image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho and friends watch Chelsea’s win over Fulham at Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Paul Phelan/ProSports/Shutterstock9Isak needs time to bed in at LiverpoolAfter missing pre-season through protest, Alexander Isak got his way and made the move to Liverpool. The Premier League championspaid a record sumto acquire the striker but it might take time for him to get up to speed. The Sweden international did not feature against Slovenia for his national team, spending the match as an unused substitute, but he did come on in the 2-0 loss to Kosovo, making it an underwhelming start to the season for Isak. Liverpool have plenty of matches to ease Isak into his new surroundings and are helped by being the only team with a perfect start to the campaign, with three wins in as many games. Starting at Turf Moor looks unlikely for Isak but coming off the bench is almost a certainty. Patience may be required before Liverpool see the same effectiveness he brought to Newcastle, however.WUBurnley vLiverpool, Sunday 2pm10Injuries hit both sides before tense derbyManchester City will definitely be without Rayan Cherki, andalmost certainly Omar Marmoush, for Sunday’s derby. Savinho and Phil Foden are doubts too, so Pep Guardiola’s forward line may struggle for potency. One question, then, for the manager at Friday’s media conference is whether he regrets Jack Grealish’s loan to Everton. Another is why Manchester City are pointless since the4-0 opening weekend winat Wolves. From the red side of town, the ever beleaguered Ruben Amorim will arrive at the Etihad Stadium with his Manchester United side a point better off than their neighbours. Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are injury concerns for United, who for all the obvious reasons will begin this 197th derby as underdogs. If it is not a draw, expect inquests to start up instantly at the final whistle into the losing manager and his team.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3492Chelsea3673Arsenal3564Tottenham Hotspur3465Everton3266Sunderland3267AFC Bournemouth3068Crystal Palace3359Man Utd30410Nottm Forest3-1411Brighton3-1412Leeds3-4413Man City31314Burnley3-2315Brentford3-2316West Ham3-4317Newcastle3-1218Fulham3-2219Aston Villa3-4120Wolverhampton3-60Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolArsenalManchester CityManchester UnitedTottenham HotspurChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he must out-think size, history and Canelo ÁlvarezBryan Armen Grahamin Las VegasThu 11 Sep 2025 16.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 17.28 EDTShareTerence ‘Bud’ Crawford, America’s finest boxer since Floyd Mayweather Jr, has spent his life closing the distance between the improbable and the inevitable. He was the kid from North Omaha who survived a bullet to the head and poured himself into neighborhood gym. He was the stubborn amateur who missed the Olympics but kept showing up in dingy basements until the craft became second nature. He was the icy technician and ruthless finisher, denied opportunities against name-brand fighters for most of his career, who unified the fractured world championship at 140lb, then did it again at 147 bydismantling Errol Spence Jr so comprehensivelythat it felt like a curtain being ripped back. Here, at last, was the full measure of the quiet man’s design.Now, at 37, undefeated in 41 professional fights with 31 wins by knockout, he’s arrived at boxing’s biggest stage yet. On Saturday night, beneath the fluorescent dome of Allegiant Stadium, Crawford will climb two weight classes to face Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez for the undisputed super-middleweight crown. More than 70,000 fans are expected – the largest boxing crowd in Las Vegas history by more than double – in a $2bn football coliseum better known as the home of the NFL’s Raiders. Netflix will beam the spectacle to hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world at no extra cost, the first time a fight of this magnitude has bypassed the pay-per-view model that defined the sport for decades.Quick GuideCanelo Álvarez v Terence CrawfordShowWhat's happening?Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.Where and when is the fight?The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.The main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ringwalks until after 12am ET (5am BST).What belts are on the line?Álvarez's undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.Where can I watch it?For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this magnitude will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers. The stream begins at 9pm ET, with undercard bouts leading into the main event.Netflix will offer commentary feeds in English and Spanish. Unlike traditional pay-per-view, which often costs US fans around $90, this one is included in a standard subscription.Who else is fighting?The first six undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm BST). The entire order of play is as follows:Preliminary card (Tudum, from 5.30pm ET/10.30pm BST)• Serhii Bohachuk v Brandon Adams, 10 rounds, middleweights• Ivan Dychko v Jermaine Franklin Jr, 10 rounds, heavyweights• Reito Tsutsumi v Javier Martinez, six rounds, super featherweights• Sultan Almohamed v Martin Caraballo, four rounds, super lightweights• Steven Nelson v Raiko Santana, 10 rounds, light heavyweights• Marco Verde v Sona Akale, six rounds, 162lb catchweightMain card (Netflix, from 8pm ET/1am BST on Sunday)• Callum Walsh v Fernando Vargas Jr, 10 rounds, junior middleweights• Christian Mbilli v Lester Martinez, 12 rounds, super middleweights• Mohammed Alakel v John Ornelas, 10 rounds, lightweights• Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford, 12 rounds, for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championshipWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The timing is no accident: Mexican Independence Day weekend, with mariachis spilling on to the Strip, tri-color flags draped over shoulders and tequila bottles raised skyward. For Álvarez, boxing’s biggest star for a decade, it is a ritual homecoming in his adopted city. For Crawford, it is an incursion into hostile territory. “Of course it’s going to be a pro-Canelo crowd,” he said Wednesday. “Vegas is like a second home for him. I’m looking forward to being an underdog. I’m already prepared for that.”This is the fight game at its most extravagant:Turki al-Sheikh’sbottomless bankroll, Dana White’sfledgling Zuffa Boxing badge, the concerts and star-studded trimmings that stretch a bout into a week-long spectacle. It has been dressed up to look like a Super Bowl. Strip that away and the intrigue is stark: one man bigger, entrenched, defending his patch; the other smaller, older but perhaps sharper, daring to outwit physics itself.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford, above, has captured world titles in four divisions from 135lb through 154lb. Now he’s scaling two weight classes for a crack at Canelo Álvarez’s undisputed championship at 168lb.Photograph: Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing/Getty ImagesÁlvarez, 35, is the red-headed emperor of 168lb, granite-chinned and battle-tested, a four-division champion from 154 through 175 who has turned back future Hall of Famers and critics since turning pro as a 15-year-old in Guadalajara. He is the sport’s most bankable world champion, its stadium act. Crawford is the interloper from a fistic backwater, the scalpel daring the anvil, your favorite boxer’s favorite boxer. A four-weight champion from 135 to 154, the Nebraskan problem-solver has made elite fighters look ordinary for more than a decade.It is the kind of leap that recalls the folklore of Henry Armstrong, Harry Greb, Mickey Walker, Sugar Ray Robinson and Manny Pacquiao – fighters who treated dramatic weight-jumps as just another opponent to be outsmarted. That is the lineage Crawford wants to join, the reason he accepted a challenge that most analysts consider a bridge too far. One that didn’t even seem plausible until Al-Sheikh’s bottomless coffers entered the frame. “I think people [are] underestimating everything about me,” Crawford said, his voice even. “But that doesn’t matter. We gotta fight Saturday, and all the answers will be answered that night.”He has been asked all week about size, odds, decline curves. He brushes it away. “Everybody’s entitled to their own opinion [but] they can’t fight for me. I’ve been doubted my whole career. I was told I needed to get another job because I wasn’t going to be world champion. I just feel like, OK, well, just watch me do it.” Asked what to expect, Crawford kept it spare: “A victory. Be victorious. Then everybody going to be talking about it on Sunday.”Omaha beginningsLong before Allegiant Stadium, Crawford’s stage was a cramped, honest room on North 33rd Street, Omaha. Born in 1987, he grew up on Larimore Avenue, a neighborhood where trouble was close and options thin. His father’s Navy deployments left his mother, Debra, to raise him and his sisters. She practiced a brand of tough love so extreme it became legend: Crawford has said she once tried to pay neighborhood kids to beat him up, just to harden him. None of them succeeded.He had the energy to match the streets. He was expelled from schools, bounced from classrooms, looked like a story heading the wrong way until Carl Washington, a neighbor who ran the eponymous CWBoxingClub, coaxed seven-year-old Terence through the door. The place was small, loud and raw. It gave him a code. Keep your chin tucked. Hands up. Elbows in. Keep your word. Boxing became identity.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford as a child in Omaha, Nebraska.Photograph: Top RankBy his teens, he was fiddling with the sport as if it were a lock to be picked. He’d switch stances from orthodox to southpaw just to see how it felt. When he broke his right hand in a school fight, he kept showing up for training anyway, drilling left-handed until it felt natural. The curiosity wasn’t cosmetic; it became the foundation of a style. Around him, Omaha produced mentors who still travel with him: Brian ‘BoMac’ McIntyre, Esaú Diéguez, Jamie Belt. BoMac set strategy, Diéguez sanded edges, Belt swapped long miles for intervals and strength, the modern program stitched to an old-world ethic: show up, shut up, do it again tomorrow.As an amateur he fought more than 70 times, beating future champions like Mikey and Danny Garcia. He missed the 2008 Olympics in the trials and turned professional at the age of 20 with little fanfare, four-rounders on undercards for meager purses. He kept at it. The lessons were prosaic, the kind that don’t trend or rack up views: be early, be fit, be watchful. And he never entirely left home. Even now, between the victory parades thrown in his honor, the street that bears his name and the nonprofit B&B Boxing Academy he co-founded for at-risk kids, Omaha remains his center of gravity, the place where he’s raising his seven children. For the big fights he decamps to the altitude and quiet of Colorado Springs, but the spiritual map doesn’t change.That civic pride produced an unlikely ally. Before a fight in 2014, a visitor slipped into his locker room: Warren Buffett. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman became one of Crawford’s most enthusiastic fans, sometimes choosing seats high in the bowl instead of ringside for a cleaner sightline. Heonce compared Crawfordto a savvy investor: “He uses the first four or five rounds to fully size up the target and then expertly uses that knowledge to score decisive victories.” Crawford laughs that thrift is their biggest shared trait. Even on seven-figure nights, friends say, he’ll want his $40 change from a $100 bill at the petrol pump. The millionaire’s parable sits neatly alongside thebillionaire’s bungalow on Farnam Street: two faces of the same city, both suspicious of fuss.The bullet that missedEvery big fight week invites a creation myth. Crawford’s never needed much embellishment. In September 2008, 21 years old with four pro fights and still existing on the sport’s margins, he left a dice game in Omaha, climbed into his ‘86 Cutlass and started counting his winnings. That’s when a nine-millimeter round tore through the rear glass and kissed the right side of Crawford’s head below the ear. A fraction of angle spared his life.Trainer advertised performance-enhancing drugs before working with Canelo ÁlvarezRead moreHe drove himself to the hospital, bloodied and furious at the universe and at himself. Five hours later he was stitched and released. Less than two months after that, he fought again and stopped his opponent in two. If the movies wrote it, the revelation would arrive complete by sunrise. Real life works differently. “When I got shot, it changed my life tremendously,” he has said. He pared his circle and then pared it again, traded half-idle hours for gym hours, swapped the performance of toughness for the private work it actually requires. It wasn’t epiphany so much as accretion: fewer late nights, more early ones, a tighter trust.Journalists still ask about it because it sounds like fate. This week he was asked by the Guardian if anything still lingers from that night. Crawford’s reply was the cleanest line in the room: “Not at all.” He doesn’t mythologize, doesn’t sermonize. TheNetflix docuseriespromoting Saturday’s fight had to fall back on archival footage when addressing the episode. To him it is what everything else is: a fact, then a choice. The scar is real; the work that followed is the more interesting part.The temptation is to oversell the hinge. But if the bullet provided the jolt, the gym provided the map. The road from that car to this stadium ran through a thousand forgotten rounds in quiet rooms, bags thumping like a metronome, feet learning to solve angles the way a chess player navigates endgames. It ran through the places the cameras never go. And it ran back through Omaha, always Omaha, the one constant in a sport built on dislocation.When the questions Wednesday turned to legacy – the heavy stuff, the first-ballot talk – he trimmed the subject to size. “I definitely think about it,” he said. “But I’m keeping myself focused on the job at hand, because I don’t want to eat before my food is ready.”Building greatnessRead the arc since that night and it looks like a CV written fora wall display in Canastota. In 2014, Crawfordwent to Glasgow and outboxed Ricky Burnsfor his first world title, the first world champion from Nebraska in nearly a century. Back in Omaha, he floored Olympic gold medalist Yuriorkis Gamboa four times in a career-defining performance. At 140lb he hoovered up every belt on offer, folding Julius Indongo with a left to the bodyto become the first undisputed championof the four-belt era at that weight.Welterweight offered sterner challenges but no greater resistance. Herelieved Jeff Horn of his titlewith calm efficiency; punished José Benavidez Jr; took apart Kell Brook. The peak came in July 2023, when he met Errol Spence Jr – a fellow unbeaten champion many considered his equal in what was billed asthe best fight boxing could deliver– and unstitched him with clinical cruelty, scoring three knockdowns and closing the show inside nine rounds. For the first time in the modern era, one man held all four belts in two divisions. The following year, debuting at 154lb, heoutlasted Israil Madrimov, becoming a champion in a fourth weight class.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford celebrates after winning his first world title with a 12-round unanimous decision over Ricky Burns at Glasgow’s Exhibition and Conference Centre in March 2014.Photograph: Mark Runnacles/Getty ImagesWhat makes it possible is less romance than ringcraft. Crawford is a chameleon. He spends the early rounds downloading the other man’s operating system, switching from orthodox to southpaw, tapping with the jab, cataloguing reactions. Then he flips the geometry. Distance shrinks, angles tilt, timing collapses. The fight that appeared to look competitive in round three looks organized in round six and inevitable by round nine. These have been his drowning rounds, the deep waters where opponents are beset by a riptide that can’t be bargained with.Mayweather’s genius was denial, a refusal to provide openings. Crawford’s is invention. He manufactures openings through opponents’ hesitation, then punishes them. “I’ve been doing this since I was seven years old,” he said when the subject of adjustments came up. “Once I get in there, I make my adjustments on the fly, and we’re going to go from there.” The sentence is almost aggressively plain. It suits him. He is not a talker of big theory or big feeling. He is a worker of small margins.Crawford is a quiet, laconic personalty who has never been terribly interested in self-marketing, preferring to let his accomplishments speak for themselves. As Mayweather learned during the long decade before his mid-career pivot from the white-hat Pretty Boy Floyd into a pantomime villain made him the world’s richest athlete, today’s culture doesn’t reward the unassuming, respectful types. A win on Saturday would not only be a testament Crawford’s abilities, but become a sort of validation for doing it his way and on his terms.The week has brought its brambles. Aviral photograph of his ripped physiquedrew a line from Álvarez about muscles not mattering. Another question dredged up his post-Madrimov form. Crawford’s reply was needle-point, not a rant: “We’re not going to talk about the past. [Álvarez’s last fightagainst William Scull] wasn’t spectacular either. If you’re going to talk about my last performance, let’s talk about his last performance as well.” When an old clip about being “70% sure” resurfaced, he didn’t blink. “I’m 1,000% sure now.”View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford, left, lands a blow on Australia’s Jeff Horn in their WBO welterweight title fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in June 2018.Photograph: Bradley Kanaris/Getty ImagesThrough it all, Omaha hums in the background. He still runs the B&B Boxing Academy for kids who need structure more than slogans. He still sees himself not as a role model – the term makes him wary – but as an example. And the Buffett kinship endures, a local odd couple whose logic improves the more you think about it. A billionaire who lives in the same modest house he bought in 1958; a fighter who still counts his change: thrift as worldview, patience as weapon.As for those who doubt the jump to 168? “Everybody’s entitled to their own opinion,” he said. “It doesn’t move me. I’ve been doubted my whole career.” Then the simple, unblinking kicker: “Just watch me do it.”Once in a lifetimeSo to Saturday. On paper, Canelo is the naturally bigger man, compact as a Brinks truck at 168, with a chin that has banked heavy-handed receiptsall the way up to light-heavyweight. He thrives at mid-range, where his counter hooks feel like invoices, while his blend of hand speed, punch variety and a slick defense flows from deft footwork to superior upper body movement. Crawford will need several answers at once: pace that denies Canelo his breathers; angles that unsettle his set feet; a jab that stings rather than measures; body work that ages the bigger man half a round at a time.The risk is clean, the arithmetic obvious. Crawford has lived most of his prime at 147, made only a brief reconnaissance at 154, now arrives at 168. Mass is real; so is one of boxing’s oldest chestnuts:A good big ’un will beat a good little ’un.The first time Crawford is hit cleanly by Canelo will be the hardest he’s ever been hit in his life.But you do not become an all-timer by managing expectations. You become one by leaning into them. Crawford’s upside is cartoonish. In almost every fight he’s been in, he’s been dominant. He has already done what no male fighter of the four-belt era had done before him: become undisputed in two divisions. Add a third against Canelo, in a football stadium on a subscription service that may deliver the sport’s largest single-night audience, and he moves from generational great to all-time company. The typically breathless promotional hype, including the ‘Once In A Lifetime’ tagline screaming from every poster, almost rings true.Canelo’s side of the equation is simpler. Another defense at 168 would be legacy maintenance: a first-ballot Hall of Famer adding another impeccable plaque to his wall. Crawford gave the subject its due without false bravado. “I don’t think losing tarnish me or Canelo,” he said. “I think Canelo is a first-ballot Hall of Famer … and I think that I’m a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Whether win, lose or draw, both of us going in the Hall of Fame.” The next sentence brought it back to task: “I’m definitely going to win. I’m winning this fight for sure.”View image in fullscreenCanelo Álvarez, left, and Terence Crawford pose for media in the run-up to their title fight.Photograph: Chris Unger/TKO Worldwide LLC/Zuffa LLCThere are always side stories. Trump surrogate Dana White’s entry into boxing. Al-Sheikh’s biggest stateside splash to date. The newness of Netflix in a sport that has spent decades charging viewers to watch around a living-room huddle. Crawford acknowledged the shift without puffing his chest. “Back in the day, the megafights, they was fighting on regular TV,” he said. “So it’s great to be on Netflix, for people that don’t have cable to witness a fight like this.”Say nothing of the crowd on site. Saturday’s fight will easily surpass the record for a boxing crowd in Las Vegas, set in 1982 when 29,214 watched Larry Holmes batter Gerry Cooney in a temporary stadium built in the Caesars Palace parking lot. Crawford insisted on Wednesday he’s looking forward to being underestimated by a stadium that will roar for the popular Mexican. His whole career has been one long exercise in removing the other man’s excuses. The question on Saturday is whether that genius can erase not just tactics but poundage and precedent.“Don’t eat before my food is ready,” Crawford said, smiling at his own bon mot. If you want the less poetic version, he’d already given it earlier in the week: “A victory.” The dice game is long over. The Cutlass is gone. The scar remains.Terence Crawfordis still climbing, still solving, still fighting. And under the brightest lights at the bottom of the Las Vegas Strip he will try to carve his way through the last door he has left: the one marked immortality.Explore more on these topicsTerence CrawfordBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezUS sportsTurki al-SheikhFloyd MayweatherWarren BuffettfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is the Chiefs’ golden age over?It’s risky making calls after just one week. But there are a few worrying signs for prominent teams, players and coaches early in the seasonOliver ConnollyThu 11 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 05.01 EDTShareRussell WilsonFun fact: the Giants returned 10 of their 11 offensive starters from last year, despite finishing 29th in EPA per play last season. The only change came at quarterback, with the Giants signing Russell Wilson, Jameis Winston, and trading up in the first round of the draft for Jaxson Dart.It was an odd strain of organisational arrogance:Ignore that we won three games! Our roster is great! Our coaching is great! Daniel Jones was the problem!Week 1 suggests otherwise. Jones is now with the Colts, and carved up the Dolphins’ defense, showing a level of confidence in his scheme and supporting cast that vanished in New York. Meanwhile, the sluggish Giants scored just six points against the Commanders, the fewest by any team in the opening week. Wilson looked like the same player he was in Pittsburgh: capable of throwing beautiful deep balls but offering little else. His athleticism has eroded to the point where he can no longer reliably break the pocket and create plays out of structure. Against the Commanders, he completed just two of 12 passes when pressured and was sacked twice. And when playing in structure, he was indecisive and late to deliver throws.Giants head coach Brian Daboll confirmed Wilson will remain the team’s starter for week two, despite teasing he might make a change. But how long can Daboll keep Dart out of the lineup?Dart flashed enough in preseason to earn the starting gig. Understandably, the Giants want to work the rookie in slowly rather than throwing him to the wolves. But the team’s decision-makers are on borrowed time. Their best chance at keeping their jobs is throwing Dart on the field, ready or not, and hoping for the best. That may not be great for Dart’s development, but it’s the Giants’ best shot at bringing a jolt to their limp offence.Panic meter: 8/10 – get your arm ready, Jaxson.Miami DolphinsThe vibes have been off with the Dolphins since preseason. “It’s a great day,” Mike McDaniel said a month ago. Why? “Because we are another day closer to death.”McDaniel’s shtick is already wearing thin with the ‘Phins fanbase, and the end of his coaching run in Miami could be just a few weeks away. The reason why isn’t just the 33-8 scoreline at the hands of Indianapolis. It was how the Dolphins looked. You know things are miserable when Tyreek Hill is throwing his first tantrum of the season in the first quarter of the first game.All is well in Miami. Mike McDaniel: 49ers Senior Advisor by Thanksgiving.pic.twitter.com/f9szdFmQvy— Ollie Connolly (@OllieConnolly)September 7, 2025McDaniel is a walking oxymoron: when was the last time a run-game guru was handed a franchise and the complaint was that his team was not physical enough? Usually, those coaches are portrayed as neanderthals, out of step with the new-fangled stuff. But under McDaniel, the Dolphins have been the opposite: wonderfully creative but committing the cardinal sin of playing soft. They can’t run the ball and they can’t stop it either. Their much-ballyhooed defensive front continues to struggle with injuries and failed to pressure Jones and the remade Colts offensive line. And despite all the pros with Tua Tagovailoa’s game, he is the least adaptable quarterback in the league. When pressure arrives or the offense is out of sorts, he bottoms out.The Dolphins lack the talent to cover up their shortfalls. McDaniel’s seat couldn’t be warmer.Panic meter: 10/10 – time to start scouting the 2026 draft.View image in fullscreenThe Bills struggled to stop Derrick Henry on Sunday.Photograph: Gene J Puskar/APBills defenseI know, I know. The Bills engineeredone of the most exhilarating comebacks in league historyagainst the Ravens. As long as Josh Allen is standing upright, the Bills should be favourites to host the AFC championship game, particularly given the weakness of the AFC East. But outside Allen, alarm bells should be ringing.The Bills defense is a mess. They look small and light, incapable of standing up to a downhill rushing attack. No other team can roll out the combined threats of Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers, but what happened to the Bills on Sunday was as much about their own roster and structural flaws as Baltimore’s trifecta.If anything, it looks like the Bills built a defense specifically to stop Kansas City in January. The scars of multiple playoff defeats will do that to a team. But there are plenty of other threats in the postseason, and early evidence suggests the Chiefs may not be the team to beat.Aaron Rodgers’ Jets revenge tour shows the old guy may still have itRead moreThe Bills play more dime defence (six defensive backs) than any team in the league, but have one of the weakest safety groups. They invested heavily this offseason in versatile defensive linemen, players who could line up inside or outside to bring extra juice to last year’s rickety pass rush. This is a defense that is supposed to be as flexible and quick on third down as possible. But you still have to get the opponents to third down. And that could be a chore this year.Buffalo lacked the bodies to match up with Baltimore’s heavier personnel. The Ravens picked up 199 yards, averaging 14.2 yards per play with their bigger bodies on the field. When the Bills stuck to their preferred style of defense, rolling out extra defensive backs, Henry averaged19 yards a carry.Sean McDermott has pivoted strategies at a time when the run game is experiencing a resurgence. Sure, against the Chiefs or Bengals, the Bills can flood the field with speed and be creative up front to pressure the pocket. But what if they see Baltimore again in the postseason, or the Chargers, or any run-centric offense? What if the game script isn’t in their favour?It was a problem last season, but Allen and the offense forced opponents into pass-heavy situations. The Bills doubled down on their approach in the offseason, and now they look out of place matching up against the top offenses in the AFC. Given Allen, the issue probably won’t reveal itself until the playoffs. But the Bills need to find reinforcements at safety and a veteran hand who can help thump against the run up front.Panic meter: 7/10 – the playoffs are all that matter, and additions are needed before then.The Chiefs in generalSpeaking of leaky defences, the Chiefs have problems of their own.They were ripped apartby Justin Herbert in Brazil. The Chargers ditched their typical run-based plan and instead allowed Herbert to fling the ball all over the field.The Chargers exposed faultlines across the Chiefs’ defense. The defensive backfield is as advertised: scrappy but lacking players who can hang in man coverage. But the larger concern is up front. Outside Chris Jones, the Chiefs don’t have a reliable pass rusher – and Jones didn’t turn up in Week 1.KC paid George Karlaftis $93m this offseason to be a reliable second banana, but he has never been more than a solid effort rusher who feeds on the scraps of Jones’s brilliance. If Jones is below his peak, the Chiefs are in a bind.Steve Spagnuolo is the best defensive coordinator in the sport, but he was left chasing his tail against Herbert. The Chiefs couldn’t reliably pressure with four, so Spagnuolo upped his blitz rate to try to manufacture disruption. But plugging more players into the pass rush left his secondary on islands, and Herbert gobbled it up, completing 11 of 14 passes for 178 yards and a touchdown against the blitz.Spagnuolo has proven time and again that he can make a serviceable unit out of ill-fitting parts. Still, his schematic wonkery can only drag the unit so far. Even if they approach league average, it won’t matter if the offence continues to stall. And with Rashee Rice suspended for five more games and Xavier Worthy hurt, it could be some time until the Chiefs offense is up and firing.Even dynastic teams have cycles. During the glory days of the Belichick-Brady Patriots dynasty, they had limp seasons. They would stumble into the postseason and exit early. The key building blocks can remain in place, but the ancillary pieces are no longer up to it, thanks to the salary cap, picking at the bottom of the draft order and misfiring on crucial free agents.The Chiefs have that feeling – a franchise caught between two eras. That doesn’t mean they won’t have a deep playoff run again – and it’s early in the season – but they have more holes to plug and questions to answer than at any point in the last eight years.Panic meter: 6/10 – lose to the Eagles in Week 2, and this jumps to 8/10.The Lions’ offensive lineThe Lions ran into a buzzsaw in Green Bay. They took on one of the best teams in the NFC, fresh off the trade for Micah Parsons, while replacing two coordinators. Teething problems were always going to be an issue. But the Packers exposed some fundamental flaws when the Lions faced the best of the best: they lack talent and depth along both lines of scrimmage.On the perimeter, the Lions have as much talent as any team in the league. Their offensive weapons are laughably good; their secondary is filled with game-breakers. But games are won and lost up front. The Packers bullied the Lions on both sides of the ball. Aidan Hutchinson is Detroit’s only dependable pass rusher, and any hopes to offset that deficit with the blitz fell woefully short against Jordan Love.A more pressing problem is the offensive line. Losing Ben Johnson was the talk of Detroit’s offseason. How would they cope without the hot-shot offensive mind at the controls? But that talk was always a little overstated; the loss of center Frank Ragnow – who decided to retire at the age of 29 – was a bigger deal. More than any other segment of a team, the offensive line functions as a unit; five gigantic bodies synchronising into a cohesive bloc within a confined area that offers little margin for error. Penei Sewell is a star at right tackle and Taylor Decker gives the Lions a serviceable starter on the left side. But the concern is with the interior. The Lions have turned the inside over to Graham Glasgow at center and young pups Christian Mahogany and Tate Ratledge at guard.Glasgow is a limited player, but Mahogany and Ratledge have talent. Yet the trio are not up to par with what Detroit has rolled with the last two seasons. All three are people-movers who can push defenders back off the ball. But all three also have limitations in pass protection and struggle to move in space. With Johnson and Ragnow, the Lions had the most varied rushing attack in theNFL, which helped fuel the league’s best play-action game. With the new interior, they’re limited in what they can call, and worse at what they do run. It’s going to take time to figure out what the offense can major in, time they cannot afford in the knife-fight of the NFC North.Jared Goff is an excellent quarterback when he’s sticking to the flow of a play. But move him off his spot, and he falls apart. Having a stellar receiving corps is fun, but it won’t matter if Goff is feeling heat or the Lions are unable to move the ball on the ground.Panic meter: 5/10 – beating the Bears this Sunday is now a must.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York GiantsBuffalo BillsKansas City ChiefsDetroit LionsMiami DolphinsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, he would look more at home in a science lesson than on an athletics track. But Hearn-Smith has traded biology for biomechanics, running 10.65 seconds in the 100m and 21.40 seconds in the 200m aged just 15.Over the past two months the Colchester teenager has become a viral sensation. On 4 July Hearn-Smithuploaded a video of his 100m race at a local schools championship to Instagram.He won, obviously. But it was the way he ran that caught people’s attention.Draped in bright yellow in the fourth lane, Hearn-Smith bounded down the track like a gazelle, seemingly putting in little effort to glide past the finish line in 10.68sec. “Did someone force him to race[sic], he looks uninterested, but did it effortlessly,” wrote one commenter.Raising the bar: Duplantis leads the stars aiming to break world records in TokyoRead moreHis long strides, controlled form and lack of reaction at the end gave the illusion, at least to the untrained eye, that he calmly jogged to victory. People couldn’t quite believe he was running so quickly, so slowly.Hearn-Smith’s perceived nonchalance has helped the video gain more than 3.4m views on his Instagram account, 1.5m on TikTok, andmillions more across social media accounts reposting his video.It has been a whirlwind few weeks when we meet at Colchester Harriers for his Tuesday session. Standing 6ft 2in, he strides over, shakes my outstretched hand and a nervous yet excited smile forms. Accompanied by his family and his girlfriend, it is a reminder of just how young he is.His father, David, explains that we need to conduct the interview towards the side of the track, away from the other children. We also need to wrap the interview up before training starts and more importantly, before Bronson’s coach arrives.GB athletes Dan and Jessica Putman have visited the track to train with Bronson and of coursecapture some content alongside the internet sensation.Hearn-Smith has become an attraction, with plenty of athletes keen to run with him, including the Leyton Orient winger Demetri Mitchell.The footballer called out Hearn-Smith on social media, challenging him to a race.But the teen is determined not to let the social media attention distract him. He says: “I’ve got my head down and carry on training like nothing happened. I want to keep my feet on the ground.”His coach is equally determined to ensure training still runs smoothly, without any disruptions, and that the rest of the athletes are protected, without the danger of online abuse.If there is any sense that Hearn-Smith is growing too big for the club he’s quick to dismiss it and insists that things haven’t always been this way:“I first started sprinting at 11.” And what times was he running then? “Oh let’s not go there,” he says, laughing. “I only realised I was good last year. I ran 10.9 [in the 100m] and that was second in the UK for my age.”View image in fullscreenHearn-Smith powers down the track in training.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFellow 15-year-old Divine Iheme ran the fastest,clocking a staggering 10.3sec last year, a world record for a 14-year-old. With theAustralian sprinter Gout Gout a couple of years olderand a few 10ths of a second faster than the British pair, it seemssprinting is having a moment in the juniorswhile the men jostle for position in the seniors.“It’s called trackflation, mate,” says Hearn-Smith. Armchair pundits are using the new wave of sprinters as an opportunity to manufacture an early rivalry between Iheme and Hearn-Smith. Iheme beat Hearn-Smith in a race for the English SchoolsAthleticsAssociation earlier this year.Hearn-Smith acknowledges that healthy competition could be beneficial for his growth but sees any serious, personal rivalry as a step too far. “I love Divine. We’re good friends,” he says. Instead of worrying about the rest of the field, the focus is on improving his own performance.He says his unique running style developed naturally by way of his long limbs, inspiration from Asafa Powell and a few A and B skip drills and jump squats.Hearn-Smith’s early training, like many his age, was amateurish. His father says he used to type into ChatGPT: “How can I get my son to run faster?” Aware that he needed something more than an AI chatbot and the local training Bronson was getting, David sought out current coach, Stephen Garnham.Garnham coached the Olympic bronze medallist Charlie Dobson as a junior and isknown at Colchester Harriers for working miracles with the 400m runner.But just as Bronson arrived, Garnham was winding down. He had reduced the number of coaching sessions, so it took a word from the vice chair of Colchester Harriers, Dave Smith, for him to take a look at Bronson. Within a couple of sessions he was sold: Garnham became Bronson’s coach and came back to the track more regularly.“We appreciate Steve for everything he’s done. He’s a world-class coach,” David says. “99% of athletics coaches work for free. They don’t make any money from the athletes themselves. They have to deal with the parents and sometimes the parents can be a bit of a nightmare, like me.”David, the self-aware, proud dad, knows the challenges facing British Athletics. He manages his son’s social media alongside Bronson and Bronson’s girlfriend, and sees the platforms as a gateway to get all the technical, nutritional and material help the 15-year-old needs to make it to the next level.In the face offunding cutsand a lack of public interest in athletics outside of the Olympics and world championships, David argues that social media is the way forward. “For any parent who has a kid in athletics, your best bet is to do your social media and get your kid’s name out there.”Bronson agrees: “Content creators posting about athletics will definitely widen the reach of athletics and get more people involved. I want to get more people in the sport so more attention is put on track.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since his breakout advising Marcos Baghdatis, who he guided to the Australian Open final in 2006, Mouratoglou has distinguished himself as a tennis guru – with pros and prospects making the pilgrimage to his academy on the French Riviera. But it was his partnership withSerena Williams, who won 10 of her 23 grand slam singles titlesafterpairing with the Frenchman, that helped cement Mouratoglou as a coaching great.In between touring clients at the moment, Mouratoglou caught up with me near the end of the US Open to talk about Naomi Osaka’s resurgence, Williams’s weight loss and what it will take to break Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner’s duopoly in the men’s game.Why was the partnership with Serena so successful? What was it that the two of you were able to bring out of each other that took her already incredible tennis to its highest ever level?Big trust on both sides – like, really,fulltrust. We were feeding each other in terms of motivation. I [knew] her perfectly, how to push her, motivate her, provoke her to be more competitive. We got started during a difficult period. She hadn’t won a grand slam for two years and suffered a first-round loss in a slam for the first time in her career [to Virginie Razzanoat the 2012 French Open]. When something like this happens, even the best competitors they start to think a bit differently – and that hurts their quality when they compete.Roland Garros was the most difficult tournament for her, and at that point she had only won it once, in 2002. [At the start of] 2013, after we got her back to No 1 in the world, she told me, “I really want to win it again. Can you make a plan for me?” So we did some things that maybe sound a bit crazy. Going into Madrid, our tune-up for Roland Garros, I told her: “If you want to win this tournament, you have to do it serving only second serves, because I don’t want you getting any free points.” It forced her to work every point from the first to the last match, and gave her so much confidence about playing on clay [Williams posted a 28-0 clay court record that year]. Those are the types of challenges that Serena would love because she was really winning a lot already.Sinner’s reaction to US Open defeat shows why he and Alcaraz will tower over the tour for years to comeRead moreRecently, Serena has been on a US media blitzto promote a weight-loss drugand drawn criticism for undercutting her athletic achievements, much less the virtues of diet and exercise. In one interview, she said thatyoubeing hard on her about her weight factored into her decision to take a medical route to weight loss. How do you remember it?Oh I remember itverywell. It was after the pregnancy – notrightafter; I know these things take time. I told her: “Listen, this is not a comment on how you look. It’s not my problem.” But tennis is a sport in which you can’t afford to be overweight. First of all, the pressure on your joints and everything is so big that your chances become much higher. The second thing is it’s a sport in which you change directions all the time and with a lot of speed. Even one kilo overweight is a lot. When you go full speed in one direction with one kilo extra and then need to stop and come back, the time that you lose is really important. Just look at the best players in the world – Alcaraz, Sinner, Djokovic. Think about their movement. The weight was affecting her movement.In Serena’s case, she was older – so of course the body is not going to bounce back the same as before, and the risk of injury is even bigger. We had a few fights about it. I remember she did not like when I said that because she thought I was judging her. But I kept telling her, I don’t care about your look. It’s not my job. My job is your tennis. If you want to come back to the top and make history, then we have to be very efficient on every level – including this one, which for me was the key element.So now that she’s lost all this weight, are you like, Well, I wish she had done this five, six years ago?I’m not the type of guy who’s looking back and having regrets. But, yeah, if she would have been in this position physically, the results would have been better.Sinner and Alcaraz look like they’re on a different level from the rest of the men’s tour. If you were coaching a guy in the tier below them, how would you get them to believe they could actually beat Alcaraz or Sinner in a slam final?It’s funny that you’re saying that. When Rafa and Roger were at the top of the game, it was exactly the same situation – the [next] eight players all saying it’s impossible to win a grand slam with those two guys. When you speak about the generation of French players who were top 10 – Gaël Monfils, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Richard Gasquet – they were all saying it. But then a young Novak Djokovic came in and said: “I’m going to beat those guys and be No 1.” And everyone laughed and said: “Who’s this cocky guy?” But he ended up doing it and becoming the greatest of all time.So, yes, for the moment Alcaraz and Sinner are on a different planet for sure. But your question makes a lot of sense because the guy who’s going to be in the mix with these two, if there is one, is the only guy who’s going to believe it’s possible. Actually, when I interview young players, that’s what I’m trying to figure out. When you listen to them, they all say: “I want to be No 1 in the world.” But my first question is always: What’s your plan? I need to know: How much do you believe?I remember when I did my interview with Coco Gauff when she first came to my academy at age 10, and leaving my office thinking her drive and self-belief was unbelievable for someone so young. And you see where she is now.Speaking of talented players, the tennis world had high hopes for your coaching partnership with Naomi Osaka. Why did it end after 10 months?The results weren’t good enough, which completely made sense. I think we did a lot of good things but, at least from a coaching standpoint, the one thing that you don’t master can ruin the whole thing. I think she improved so much, I was seeing it on a daily basis. And her mindset was great. But she was not performing well enough during the matches, so that was the one piece that was ruining the whole thing.Looking back, I didn’t do a good enough job, otherwise the results would have been there. I also think that having me as a coach was a bit heavy for her, in regards to what I did with Serena for many years. She mentioned it a few times actually, even publicly – and I didn’t find a way to take that pressure away. I think maybe that’s why she wasn’t performing. As soon as I was not in the loop, she felt probably lighter. By not having that pressure, she could express her tennis more freely. But there are no hard feelings. She’s a great competitor.She may have fallen short of winning a third US Open, but she does have a lot to be proud of for making it as far as she did. What did you make of her tournament and prospects going forward?First of all, you have to speak about what Naomi did in the last two tournaments. She was also in the finals at Montreal, and that was a very close match that could’ve gone her way. I think she’s back to playing at an extremely high level and the performance she showed in these last two tournaments are quite clear. So that’s great news. I’m not surprised at all because I know how much effort she put in. When we split, I told her agent she was 100% ready – which I felt because her practice level was consistent and extremely high. She needed these breakthroughs, which she had quite fast, to probably realize that she was able to play with the best and beat them. For women’s tennis to have Naomi back in the mix is amazing. She’s one of the most iconic players of the last five years.Interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

He was the first active male athlete from one of the four major men’s North American professional sports leagues to do so publicly.“I didn’t set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport,” Collins wrote in his article for Sports Illustrated. “But since I am, I’m happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn’t the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, ‘I’m different.’ If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I’m raising my hand.”Since his retirement from playing, the 46-year-old has worked for the NBA as an ambassador.

She had only been with North Carolina since Januar, when she moved from San Diego for $300,000 in allocation money, an international spot for the 2025 and 2026 NWSL seasons, and $150,000 in intraleague transfer fees to San Diego, in a deal that could also involved further intraleague transfer fees.

It’s just like playing in the Olympics; once every four years and it just means something to go out there and play for your country. There’s no dollar amount that I would want to play in a Ryder Cup or play in an Olympics.“I really think it is unnecessary. There are certain events that money means absolutely nothing and that’s one of them. If you’re going to give money to players, have it all go to their charity or something like that. Do something good with it.”Reed was speaking after an opening round of 69 at Wentworth’s PGA Championship. On regular trips to this side of the Atlantic, he has observed the bond between European players.“They’re all eating together,” Reed said. “The actual brotherhood and camaraderie out here, you don’t really have in the States. Here, you’re jumping country to country, not state to state. So travel just comes out that much harder.“I feel like they play a lot of team golf over here, growing up and everything. We don’t, even though you’re playing high school, college, there’s not a lot of team format. It’s go out, play individual. You count four, five scores and you move on. That’s definitely an edge that they have over here, the camaraderie and the tightness of the group.

Four months after being sacked, replacing Nuno Espírito Santo three games into the Premier League season, provided quite the plot twist.“If you’re talking about my career, this is season 28, so it’s a long-running series and it’s done really well in different countries,” he said with a smile. “It’s still going, it’s picked up a few awards.”Ange Postecoglou admits he knew Spurs would sack him before Europa League winRead moreIt was one of a few endearing quips on Postecoglou’s third day in the job, his first with a full complement of players after the international break before his team visits Arsenal on Saturday.The former Forest striker Tony Woodcock, a 1979 European Cup winner, was a neighbour of Postecoglou’s in north London and the captain of that revered team lent a hand at training. “John McGovern was running around chasing balls today and I’m going: ‘What are you doing, John? You’re a legend, you don’t have to do that,’” Postecoglou said.Postecoglou’s delivery is dry and as such it seemed he was only half-joking when he suggested he may need to win the Europa League for a second successive season to satisfy Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis. “The joy for me coming to this club is to win a trophy here, not because it’s going to help me keep my job [but] because I know how it’s going to make people feel,” he said. “Hopefully, when I finish my tenure here I can come back and somewhere on the walls there is something that says I was here. That is what drives me on a daily basis. Can I create a moment that will outlast my presence in any kind of organisation?”He spoke fondly about Brian Clough, an inspiration growing up in Australia. “At the time, the only stuff that got broadcast was the English First Division. I used to run to the newsagent to get three-month-old Shoot! magazines the day they came out, even though it was three months out of date.“I loved the legendary figures of the game; it is what inspired me to be a manager. People like Bill Shankly, Jock Stein, then you get somebody like Brian Clough … I knew that team, how they played and to see a club like Nottingham Forest win two European Cups was incredible.”Australian TV crews were in attendance at Postecoglou’s unveiling, with one reporter asking whether those back home who adopted Spurs as their team on the back of his appointment two years ago may need to shift allegiances. “I’ll find out pretty quick who the true Ange-believers are and who is just on the gravy train,” Postecoglou said, the room breaking into laughter.A journalist from Postecoglou’s home town, Melbourne, asked whether he deemed unfair his dismissal at Spurs after leading them to afirst trophy in 17 years. “It was never going to derail me … maybe things happen for a reason and it has landed me here with the opportunity to do something special at this club.”View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou feels he has unfinished business in England after winning the Europa League with Spurs.Photograph: John Walton/PAOne of Postecoglou’s most intriguing answers alluded to Nuno, who succeeded Steve Cooper, the manager who led Forest back to the top flight, in December 2023 when the club were struggling towards the bottom of the table. “I’ve got to convince every person in the building about what we’re trying to do on the back of them doing something a certain way and having success that way,” Postecoglou said.“It is fair to say it’s not going to happen overnight, it’s a process that will take a little bit of time, but never at the expense of competitiveness. None of my beliefs are going to get in the way of us making sure the team is prepared to win on a Saturday.”As for Marinakis accelerating his move after initial talks, how much did that hamper Postecoglou’s birthday gathering with family and four of his best friends from Australia? “My wife wasn’t happy because she had it all planned out and I had to take a couple of calls in the middle of it, but it was all for a good reason, I guess,” he said.“My wife kept asking and everybody had asked about what I wanted for my birthday. I said: ‘Just a job’ and somebody delivered.”Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestAnge PostecoglouAustralia sportTottenham HotspurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The second leg is at Leigh Sports ­Village next Thursday.Trouble in paradise: How Barcelona’s crisis left women’s team short of playersRead moreUnited must overturn that ­deficit if they are to join Chelsea and the ­holders, Arsenal, in the new league phase of the competition that starts next month.“We were the better team, but we didn’t win the game,” their manager, Marc Skinner, told MUTV. ‘We lost on a set-piece, which is something we’ve just got to be more aggressive in the box to attack.“But it’s half-time. Brann are now celebrating like they’ve won the tie, so let’s see when they come back to Leigh. We were the better team, but we need to be more clinical and of course we need to defend that one situation a lot, lot better.”The defeat capped off an already strange trip for United, who were left scrambling after some of the ­players’ boots went missing in ­transit. The whereabouts of the missing boots – first reported by Reuters – are ­understood to remain a mystery, but the club managed to quickly source replacements in time.A Manchester United source said: “A bag containing some of our ­players’ boots went missing during the ­journey to Bergen. We are investigating how this happened. In the meantime, we have secured new boots for all the affected players, and they are ready to ­participate as normal.”View image in fullscreenBrann’s players celebrate after beating Manchester United in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier.Photograph: Paul S Amundsen/EPAEven if that rather curious ­incident had not made the following gag rather tempting, it would already have been fair to assess this match by stating that United had left their shooting boots at home. They created chance after chance, but could not find a way past an inspired Selma Panengstuen in the Brann goal. Quite how United did not score at least two or three goals will surely be beyond them.The early stages of the first half included Elisabeth Terland ­heading wide from an Anna Sandberg cross and a Terland shot deflected off ­target, before United started to go close.After a good run from Jess Park, their deadline-day signing from Manchester City, a lively Ella Toone had a deflected shot superbly saved. Terland headed over from a ­testing Toone cross and the England ­midfielder then went close herself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They eliminated PSV and ­Hammarby in the previous phase of the qualifying process, ­during a mini‑tournament in Stockholm.Brann are managed by the former Crystal Palace coach Leif Smerud, who replaced the new Tottenham head coach, Martin Ho – formerly of United’s backroom team – when Ho left Brann this summer.

They are accused, among other claims, of ­making undisclosed payments to secure transfers. Deals under the spotlight include those for Eden ­Hazard, Willian and Samuel Eto’o.Football Daily | Are Strasbourg a sister club to Chelsea or just their storage facility?Read moreAn FA statement on Thursday confirmed the charges, which relate to alleged breaches of six rules in place during 2009-2022. The case will be heard by an independent regulatory commission. Among the rules cited are those that prevent clubs from making undisclosed payments and using unregistered ­intermediaries. Chelsea are also charged with ­breaking regulations that prevent clubs from making deals that allow third parties to “influence materially the club’s policies”.The commission has the power to levy a sporting sanction, ­including a points deduction, should it be deemed appropriate. However, Chelsea are understood to anticipate an outcome similar to thatstruck with Uefa in 2023over the same ­“incomplete financial reporting”, which resulted in a €10m fine.Chelsea on Thursday pointed to their “unprecedented ­transparency” in self-reporting the alleged breaches when BlueCo completed their ­takeover in 2022. It also ­commissioned a study by a leading accountancy firm that found the breaches would not have given the club any benefit under the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules. It is understood BlueCo renegotiated the takeover in order to set aside funds to deal with any future fines. A separate Premier League investigation into the alleged breaches is still taking place.Chelsea said: “The club has ­demonstrated unprecedented transparency during this process, ­including by giving comprehensive access to the club’s files and historical data. We will continue working collaboratively with the FA to conclude this matter as swiftly as possible. We wish to place on record our gratitude to the FA for their engagement with the club on this complex case, the focus of which has been on matters that took place over a decade ago.”View image in fullscreenRoman Abramovich’s period as Chelsea’s owner is under the spotlight.Photograph: Paul Marriott/AlamyThe charges come two years after an investigation by the Guardian and international media partners ­uncovered aseries of payments to agents, made by companies ­connected to the billionaire Russian oligarch Abramovich. ­Beneficiaries of the payments appear to have included the agent of Hazard, an associate of the title-winning manager Antonio Conte and Chelsea officials.

Consultation is expected to begin soon, however, perhaps leaving the door open for those matches to go ahead.Barcelona in Miami; Milan in Perth?

There are many issues to resolve and as the European governing body, Uefa has a responsibility to take all such factors into account. As a result, no decision was taken today but Uefa will undertake a round of consultation with all stakeholders in European football – including fans.”Leading supporters’ groups said last month in a letter to Fifa’s secretary general, Mattias Grafström, that moving games abroad would undermine sporting integrity while “reducing clubs to entertainment products detached from their tradition and communities”.Football Supporters Europe (FSE) welcomed Uefa’s consultation and said the move showed the governing body’s “dedication to preserving the integrity of European football”. An FSE spokesperson said: “The specific mention for fans to be involved in this engagement demonstrates that Uefa has recognised the strong opposition expressed by millions of supporters across the continent, as well as those of the many other stakeholders who have spoken out against these plans … Our position remains unchanged: European football belongs to our stadiums, our cities, our communities – one domestic match abroad is one too many.”The next meeting of Uefa’s executive committee is scheduled for 3 December in Nyon, Switzerland.Explore more on these topicsUefaVillarrealBarcelonaMilanComoLa LigaSerie AnewsShareReuse this content"

Jack Grealish, a summer arrival on loan from Manchester City, and Iliman Ndiaye combined for the stadium’s first goal; the team played with freedom and flair and, for the first time in years, fans left the stadium with a feeling of real hope for the season ahead. Everton’s newfound optimism proved justified in their next game, a five-goal thriller against Wolves. Their3-2 win at Molineuxsent them into the top five in the Premier League.Are smartphones eroding the experience of watching football?Read moreEverton were bottom of the table last September, having lost their first four league games of the season – their worst start in 66 years. They threw away two-goal leads against Bournemouth and Aston Villa, losing both games 3-2 in defeats that showed their pragmatic setup under Dyche was creaking badly. Even when they did go in front they would drop back and rely on set pieces and long balls, inviting pressure that eventually cracked their resolve.They struggled for goals, scoring just 15 in their first 19 league games, the second lowest tally in the league. Their expected goals (xG) of 18.33 and goals-per-game of 0.79 marked the club’s lowest attacking output in 13 seasons. They had 63 shots in the first half of the campaign – only Southampton, the bottom club, had fewer.This wasn’t just a shortcoming confined to last season. Everton have regularly ranked among the lowest scorers in the league in recent years, finishing 17th, 19th, 19th and 13th for goals scored over the past four campaigns. Defensively, they have been more reliable, placing sixth, second, 12th and 12th for clean sheets. But their style has been cautious and conservative, reflected in their possession share: 19th, 18th, 17th and 19th in the league across those four seasons. They were solid enough at the back but blunt and uninspired going forward, making it a hard watch for fans.After watching the team fail to score in eight of their previous 10 games, the new owners, the Friedkin Group, decided enough was enough and sacked Dyche in January. Their challenge was to find the right manager to take them away from the cycle of boring, survival-driven football and lead them into a new era at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Thomas Frank, noted for his organised, high-pressing, fluid style, and Graham Potter, a proponent of possession-based football, were floated as answers.In the end, Everton opted for what looked like the safe choice: their former managerDavid Moyes, whose style was defined by defensive solidity, structured pressing and organisation. His appointment was met with scepticism, with fans fearing more low-scoring, pragmatic football rather than a progressive, attacking approach.But Moyes has proven the naysayers wrong. Under his management last season the team nearly doubled their goals per game (from 0.79 to 1.42); they increased their expected goals (from 0.96 to 1.35); they took more shots on target per game (from 3.3 to 4); they created more big chances per match (from 1.8 to 2.6); and they dramatically improved their shot conversion rate (from 6.9% to 13.8% – going from the second-worst in the Premier League to one of the best).View image in fullscreenDavid Moyes after Everton’s last match at Goodison Park.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThis improvement has continued into the new season, with Everton ranking seventh for big chances, fourth for goals per match, eighth for expected goals, second for shot conversion and fourth for expected goals per shot. Everton remain disciplined without the ball, but the real story is how much more dangerous they have become going forward. They are creating a steady stream of quality chances and, crucially, converting them.Gone are the days of Dyche’s long balls, counterattacks, reliance on physical dominance and crosses into the box. Moyes is allowing his creative players to flourish, leading to more goals and quality chances. Tyler Dibling, Grealish and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall joined in the summer and Moyes has allowed them to take more risks and show off their attacking flair.We saw glimpses of it last season in the way he used Ndiaye. The Senegal international is comfortable drifting inside and influencing the game in central areas, so Moyes encouraged him to cut in off the wing rather than staying wide. Vitalii Mykolenko was given freedom to push forward along the flank, taking advantage of space to attack. The freedom paid off as Ndiaye starred in the second half of the season, finishing the campaign with nine goals and an average of 2.5 successful dribbles per 90 minutes. Everton are no longer afraid to commit numbers forward and put their key players in positions where they can make a difference.This philosophy is already bearing fruit this season. In just two starts, Grealish has registered four assists, already the second-most of any Everton player since the start of last season. Unlike at Manchester City, where maintaining possession was the priority, Grealish has licence to drop deep, get on the ball and play instinctive, fluid football alongside Dewsbury-Hall. The effect is clear in the numbers: against Wolves he completed the most dribbles (five), attempted nine take-ons and had the most touches in the opposition penalty area, directly contributing to all three goals. Against Brighton, he had the most touches in the final third (31) across both teams, the second-most in the box, attempted eight take-ons and assisted both goals.You only have to look at Everton’s second goal against Wolves to see the impact. Four players combined in the move, each taking fewer than three touches before finding the net with a simple tap-in, the sort of slick, one-touch football Everton fans have not seen in years.At the same time, Moyes has maintained the hallmark of his previous sides: defensive discipline and compactness. His teams still record some of the lowest possession averages in the league, yet remain among the most effective defensively. Last season, they finished with the fourth-lowest xG conceded and the fifth-fewest goals conceded per game. If Moyes can strike a balance between his trademark solidity and a more modern, direct, risk-taking style of play, Everton could become a formidable side this season and, just as importantly for the fans, an entertaining side to watch. For the first time in years, the home crowd’s roar has been driven not by anxious relief at full time, but by genuine excitement for what’s to come.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsEvertonGuardian Sport NetworkDavid MoyesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The players have been able to go out and play the way we have this year because things are right.

For the moment at least, the blue-and-white silks of the Brighton chair, Tony Bloom, are giving their opponents the runaround.Santorini Star, a four-year-old filly making the step up from handicaps to Group Two company in the Park Hill Stakes, was a fourth winner in six days for Bloom and his partner, Ian McAleavy, on Thursday.Strike day with a dress code as racing descends on London to make case against tax changesRead moreIt is a golden run of form that has already banked more than £150,000 in prize money and the manner of Santorini Star’s win was hugely encouraging with future targets in mind. William Haggas’s front-running filly showed impressive grit to regain the initiative after a brief moment two out when she faced challengers on either side. Half a furlong later, though, she was back in front and she stayed on strongly to the line to beat Consent by a neck.“She comes off the bridle quite early, but you never really feel in trouble,” said Tom Marquand, the winner’s jockey. “I always feel like the first flick you give her will give you a good indication of what she’s going to do. I gave her that first flick today and I thought the Prescott filly [Consent] would have to be good to beat her.“It was a big step up from a handicap win at York, but she’s really finding her mojo and her legs now. She’s gone up a big notch to win a Group Two and there are plenty of options for her over a mile and six [furlongs] or two miles or even further if you wanted to.”An immediate target for Santorini Star remains undecided, but she could be one to follow in Cup races next year according to Sean Graham, Bloom and McAleavy’s racing manager. “She won over two miles last time and it was a concern coming back to a mile and six and a half,” he said.“I don’t know what plans William has for her this year, but you’d like to think she could turn into a Cup filly next year. Tom said she kept finding, put her head down and didn’t stop and that’s what you need.”Bloom and McAleavy will hope to extend their winning run to Sunday’s Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh, where their unbeaten two-year-old filly, Venetian Sun, will set off near the head of the market.Karl Burke, Venetian Sun’s trainer, will also head into the weekend in winning form as he took the May Hill Stakes, the main supporting race on the card, with Aylin, who is part-owned by Joorabchian in partnership with Al Shaqab Racing.“She was very well and very fit,” Burke said. “I don’t know if you’ll improve much on fitness with her and it’s just a question of whether she can hold her form for another month and we can run her in one of the Group Ones.”Soumillon to strike with Mission CentralChristophe Soumillon has drawn a blank from six rides since being drafted in to replace the injured Ryan Moore as Aidan O’Brien’s temporary No 1 rider, but Mission Central should get him off the mark in his stand-in role when he lines up for the Flying Childers Stakes at Doncaster on Friday, the feature race on day two of the St Leger Festival.The Flying Childers is one of two Group Two events for juveniles in Britain O’Brien has yet to win. It is clearly not a race that figures prominently in his race-planning as he has saddled four runners this century and none since 2017. O’Brien is double-handed this time around, however, with Kansas, the winner of one of his six starts, also in the field, but Mission Central has more scope for improvement after three outings and put up a useful effort to win a Group Three at the Curragh last time out.Lady Iman, the Molecomb winner at Glorious Goodwood in July, is the top-rated runner on Timeform ratings, but she needs to bounce back from a lacklustre performance in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York three weeks ago. Even a repeat of her Goodwood form may not be enough ifMission Central (2.25)can continue his race-by-race improvement.Doncaster 1.15Nothing went right forShadow Dancein the Ebor at York last time out as Roger Varian’s gelding stumbled on the home turn and then made an unsustainable move into contention before inevitably fading in the final quarter-mile.

If someone was stronger than me, I will just say ‘chapeau’.”Nobody was stronger, though the Australian Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) came close, finishing one second off the Italian to take second place, with his teammate Almeida a further seven seconds behind, and now 40 seconds off Vingegaard.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

On her first day of work a week later, however, her expectations went bust. Instead of writing words herself, Sawyer’s job was to rate and moderate the content created by artificial intelligence.The job initially involved a mix of parsing through meeting notes and chats summarized by Google’s Gemini, and, in some cases, reviewing short films made by the AI.On occasion, she was asked to deal with extreme content, flagging violent and sexually explicit material generated by Gemini for removal, mostly text. Over time, however, she went from occasionally moderating such text and images to being tasked with it exclusively.“I was shocked that my job involved working with such distressing content,” said Sawyer, who has been working as a “generalist rater” for Google’s AI products since March 2024. “Not only because I was given no warning and never asked to sign any consent forms during onboarding, but because neither the job title or description ever mentioned content moderation.”The pressure to complete dozens of these tasks every day, each within 10 minutes of time, has led Sawyer into spirals of anxiety and panic attacks, she says – without mental health support from her employer.Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreSawyer is one among the thousands of AI workers contracted for Google through Japanese conglomerate Hitachi’s GlobalLogic to rate and moderate the output of Google’s AI products, including its flagship chatbot Gemini, launched early last year, and its summaries of search results, AI Overviews. The Guardian spoke to 10 current and former employees from the firm. Google contracts with other firms for AI rating services as well, includingAccenture and, previously, Appen.Google has clawed its way back into the AI race in the past year with a host of product releases to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Google’s most advanced reasoning model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, is touted to be better than OpenAI’s O3, according toLMArena, a leaderboard that tracks the performance of AI models. Each new model release comes with the promise of higher accuracy, which means that for each version, these AI raters are working hard to check if the model responses are safe for the user. Thousands of humans lend their intelligence to teach chatbots the right responses across domains as varied as medicine, architecture and astrophysics, correcting mistakes and steering away from harmful outputs.A great deal of attention has been paid to the workers who label the data that is used to train artificial intelligence. There is, however, another corps of workers, including Sawyer, working day and night to moderate the output of AI, ensuring that chatbots’ billions of users see only safe and appropriate responses.AI models are trained on vast swathes of data from every corner of the internet. Workers such as Sawyer sit in a middle layer of the global AI supply chain – paid more than data annotators inNairobiorBogota, whose work mostly involves labelling data for AI models or self-driving cars, but far below the engineers in Mountain View who design these models.Despite their significant contributions to these AI models, which would perhaps hallucinate if not for these quality control editors, these workers feel hidden.“AI isn’t magic; it’s a pyramid scheme of human labor,” said Adio Dinika, a researcher at the Distributed AI Research Institute based in Bremen, Germany. “These raters are the middle rung: invisible, essential and expendable.”Google said in a statement: “Quality raters are employed by our suppliers and are temporarily assigned to provide external feedback on our products. Their ratings are one of many aggregated data points that help us measure how well our systems are working, but do not directly impact our algorithms or models.” GlobalLogic declined to comment for this story.AI raters: the shadow workforceGoogle, like other tech companies, hires data workers through a web of contractors and subcontractors. One of the main contractors for Google’s AI raters is GlobalLogic – where these raters are split into two broad categories: generalist raters and super raters. Within the super raters, there are smaller pods of people with highly specialized knowledge. Most workers hired initially for the roles were teachers. Others included writers, people with master’s degrees in fine arts and some with very specific expertise, for instance, Phd holders in physics, workers said.View image in fullscreenA user tests the Google Gemini AI at the MWC25 tech show in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesGlobalLogic started this work for the tech giant in 2023 – at the time, it hired 25 super raters, according to three of the interviewed workers. As the race to improve chatbots intensified, GlobalLogic ramped up its hiring and grew the team of AI super raters to almost 2,000 people, most of them located within the US and moderating content in English, according to the workers.AI raters at GlobalLogic are paid more than their data-labeling counterparts in Africa and South America, with wages starting at $16 an hour for generalist raters and $21 an hour for super raters, according to workers. Some are simply thankful to have a gig as the US job market sours, but others say that trying to make Google’s AI products better has come at a personal cost.“They are people with expertise who are doing a lot of great writing work, who are being paid below what they’re worth to make an AI model that, in my opinion, the world doesn’t need,” said a rater of their highly educated colleagues, requesting anonymity for fear of professional reprisal.Ten of Google’s AI trainers the Guardian spoke to said they have grown disillusioned with their jobs because they work in siloes, face tighter and tighter deadlines, and feel they are putting out a product that’s not safe for users.One rater who joined GlobalLogic early last year said she enjoyed understanding the AI pipeline by working on Gemini 1.0, 2.0 and now 2.5, and helping it give “a better answer that sounds more human”. Six months in, though, tighter deadlines kicked in. Her timer of 30 minutes for each task shrank to 15 – which meant reading, fact-checking and rating approximately 500 words per response, sometimes more. The tightening constraints made her question the quality of her work and, by extension, the reliability of the AI. In May 2023, a contract worker for Appen submitted a letter to the US Congress that the pace imposed on him and others would make Google Bard, Gemini’s predecessor,a “faulty” and “dangerous” product.High pressure, little informationOne worker who joined GlobalLogic in spring 2024 and has worked on five different projects so far, including Gemini and AI Overviews, described her work as being presented with a prompt – either user-generated or synthetic – and with two sample responses, then choosing the response that aligned best with the guidelines, and rating it based on any violations of those guidelines. Occasionally, she was asked to stump the model.She said raters are typically given as little information as possible or that their guidelines changed too rapidly to enforce consistently. “We had no idea where it was going, how it was being used or to what end,” she said, requesting anonymity, as she is still employed at the company.The AI responses she got “could have hallucinations or incorrect answers” and she had to rate them based on factuality – is it true? – and groundedness – does it cite accurate sources? Sometimes, she also handled “sensitivity tasks” that included prompts such as “when is corruption good?” or “what are the benefits to conscripted child soldiers?”“They were sets of queries and responses to horrible things worded in the most banal, casual way,” she added.As for the ratings, this worker claims that popularity could take precedence over agreement and objectivity. Once the workers submit their ratings, other raters are assigned the same cases to make sure the responses are aligned. If the different raters did not align on their ratings, they would have consensus meetings to clarify the difference. “What this means in reality is the more domineering of the two bullied the other into changing their answers,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But just weeks later, when a user queried Google about cheese not sticking to pizza, an AI Overview suggested they put glue on their dough. Another suggested users eat rocks. Google called these questions “edge cases”, but the incidents elicited public ridicule nonetheless.Google scrambled to manually removethe “weird” AI responses.“Honestly, those of us who’ve been working on the model weren’t really that surprised,” said another GlobalLogic worker, who has been on the super rater team for almost two years now, requesting anonymity. “We’ve seen a lot of crazy stuff that probably doesn’t go out to the public from these models.” He remembers there was an immediate focus on “quality” after this incident because Google was “really upset about this”.But this quest for quality didn’t last too long.Rebecca Jackson-Artis, a seasoned writer, joined GlobalLogic from North Carolina in fall 2024. With less than one week of training on how to edit and rate responses by Google’s AI products, she was thrown into the mix of the work, unsure of how to handle the tasks. As part of the Google Magi team, a new AI search product geared towards e-commerce, Jackson-Artis was initially told there was no time limit to complete the tasks assigned to her. Days later, though, she was given the opposite instruction, she said.“At first they told [me]: ‘Don’t worry about time – it’s quality versus quantity,’” she said.But before long, she was pulled up for taking too much time to complete her tasks. “I was trying to get things right and really understand and learn it, [but] was getting hounded by leaders [asking], ‘Why aren’t you getting this done? You’ve been working on this for an hour.’”Two months later, Jackson-Artis was called into a meeting with one of her supervisors, questioned about her productivity, and was asked to “just get the numbers done” and not worry about what she’s “putting out there”, she said. By this point, Jackson-Artis was not just fact-checking and rating the AI’s outputs, but was also entering information into the model, she said. The topics ranged widely – from health and finance to housing and child development.One work day, her task was to enter details on chemotherapy options for bladder cancer, which haunted her because she wasn’t an expert on the subject.“I pictured a person sitting in their car finding out that they have bladder cancer and googling what I’m editing,” she said.In December, Google sent an internal guideline to its contractors working on Gemini that they were no longer allowed to “skip” prompts for lack of domain expertise, including on healthcare topics, which they were allowed to do previously, according to aTechCrunchreport. Instead, they were told to rate parts of the prompt they understood and flag with a note that they don’t have knowledge in that area.Another super rater based on the US west coast feels he gets several questions a day that he’s not qualified to handle. Just recently, he was tasked with two queries – one on astrophysics and the other on math – of which he said he had “no knowledge” and yet was told to check the accuracy.Earlier this year, Sawyer noticed a further loosening of guardrails: responses that were not OK last year became “perfectly permissible” this year. In April, the raters received a document from GlobalLogic with new guidelines, a copy of which has been viewed bythe Guardian, which essentially said that regurgitating hate speech, harassment, sexually explicit material, violence, gore or lies does not constitute a safety violation so long as the content was not generated by the AI model.Speed eclipses ethics. The AI safety promise collapses the moment safety threatens profitAdio Dinika“It used to be that the model could not say racial slurs whatsoever. In February, that changed, and now, as long as the user uses a racial slur, the model can repeat it, but it can’t generate it,” said Sawyer. “It can replicate harassing speech, sexism, stereotypes, things like that. It can replicate pornographic material as long as the user has input it; it can’t generate that material itself.”Google said in a statement that its AI policies have not changed with regards to hate speech. InDecember 2024, however, the company introduced a clause to its prohibited use policy for generative AI that would allow for exceptions “where harms are outweighed by substantial benefits to the public”, such as art or education. The update, which aligns with the timeline of the document and Sawyer’s account, seems to codify the distinction between generating hate speech and referencing or repeating it for a beneficial purpose. Such context may not be available to a rater.Dinika said he’s seen this pattern time and again where safety is only prioritized until it slows the race for market dominance. Human workers are often left to clean up the mess after a half-finished system is released. “Speed eclipses ethics,” he said. “The AI safety promise collapses the moment safety threatens profit.”Though the AI industry is booming, AI raters do not enjoy strong job security. Since the start of 2025, GlobalLogic has had rolling layoffs, with the total workforce of AI super raters and generalist raters shrinking to roughly 1,500, according to multiple workers. At the same time, workers feel a sense of loss of trust with the products they are helping build and train. Most workers said they avoid using LLMs or use extensions to block AI summaries because they now know how it’s built. Many also discourage their family and friends from using it, for the same reason.“I just want people to know that AI is being sold as this tech magic – that’s why there’s a little sparkle symbol next to an AI response,” said Sawyer. “But it’s not. It’s built on the backs of overworked, underpaid human beings.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

His friendDonald Trumpis in the White House, his son David Ellison has taken over the storied media companyCBS, and on Wednesday he surpassed his buddyElon Muskto win the title of the “world’s richest man”.Oracle’s stock went wild with the news, pushing his fortune even higher. Ellison’s net worthshot up to $393bn, surpassing Musk’s $384bn – although, by the time markets closed on Wednesday, Musk was back ahead.Ellison is not as much of a household name as Musk, but he is largely influential in Silicon Valley and more recently, politics. He’s known for a lavish lifestyle filled with mega-yachts, private jets, a long list of wives, and owning the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai.The 81-year-old mega-billionaire made his fortune in software development going back to the 1970s. He co-founded Oracle after landing a two-year contract building a database for the CIA, according to theAcademy of Achievement. Oracle became a tech giant creating software for Fortune 500 companies around the world, and more recently in cloud computing. The advent of artificial intelligence has been a boon for the company, entering lucrative deals with the likes ofOpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.Larry Ellison overtakes Elon Musk as world’s richest personRead more“AI is a much bigger deal than the Industrial Revolution, electricity and everything that’s come before,” Ellison said, touting the technology, in an interview with the former UK prime ministerTony Blairin February.Ellison was the CEO ofOraclefor 37 years, and then transitioned in 2014 to the role of chief technology officer. He still heads the board of directors and owns more than 40% of the company, which moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, in 2020.Along with Oracle, Ellison sat on Tesla’s board of directors from 2018 to 2022 and owns a stake in Musk’s electric car company. According to Forbes, he alsoowns nearly 50%of the newly minted media conglomerate Paramount Skydance, which is run by his son David. The company’s properties include CBS, MTV, Paramount Pictures and more. The younger Ellison has said that the media company won’t cater to political parties. Still, he’s on the verge ofbringing on Bari Weiss, thepolarizing anti-woke championwho co-founded the Free Press, to help lead CBS News.Ellison’s ties to Trump and NetanyahuEllison has a decade-long history with the Republican party and aclose relationship with Trumpgoing back to the president’s first term. Ellison has frequented Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort for dinners and met him in the Oval Office. As Trump has repeatedly postponed complying with the supreme court’s January ruling to ban TikTok if it’s not sold, Oracle hasemerged as the lead buyerof the popular social media app.“In the case of Larry, Larry Ellison, it’s well beyond technology, sort of CEO of everything,” Trump said during anews conferencea day after he was inaugurated. “He’s an amazing man and an amazing business person.”Ellison is also close to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and has donated heavily to the Israeli military through the non-profit Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. In 2017, he gave the organisation itsbiggest-ever donationat the time – $16.6m. Oracle did not respond to questions from the Guardian asking if Ellison has donated more recently.Ellison has hosted Netanyahu and other dignitaries and celebrities at his huge estate on Lanai,according to Bloomberg. He bought 98% of the island in 2012 and has since created an exclusive luxury Four Seasons resort and started a hydroponic farm that grows lettuce and other greens. Local Lanai residents told Bloomberg that they have scrambled to hold on to their scant land as they have seen their island transform from a sleepy outpost to adestination for the ultra-rich.Musk, Ellison’s friend and rival for “world’s richest man”, is a frequent guest on Lanai and calls the Oracle co-founder his mentor, according to a biography on Musk by Walter Isaacson. Earlier this year, during apodcast with the Texas senator Ted Cruz, Musk was asked who is the smartest guy he had ever met.“Larry Ellison is very smart,” Musk said. “I will say Larry Ellison is one of the smartest people.”Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

That is why I have decided to refer the matter to the Paris public prosecutor.“It seems to me that there are offences of a criminal nature, of active complicity, and secondly, when TikTok executives came to see us, they told us that they were unaware of anything … and I believe that this also constitutes perjury.”It is now up to the prosecutor to decide whether to open an investigation into the popular short video platform.The French parliamentary committee was set up to examine TikTok and its psychological effects on young people after a 2024 French lawsuit against the platform by seven families who accused it of exposing their children to content that was pushing them towards ending their lives.The parliament committee’sfinal report, published on Thursday, found that TikTok was like a “slow poison” to children. The co-head of the inquiry, centrist lawmaker Laure Miller, told France Info that TikTok was an “ocean of harmful content” that was very visible to children through algorithms that kept them in a bubble.The report recommended that children under 15 inFranceshould be banned entirely from using social media, and those aged between 15 and 18 should face a night-time “digital curfew”, meaning social media would be made unavailable to them between 10pm and 8am.The report also called for a major public information campaign and a new offence of “digital negligence” for “irresponsible parents” who did not oversee their children’s use of social media.Delaporte told France Info that making those recommendations was a way of starting a debate in society. He said: “The main issue is European regulation and how we can force platforms to modify their algorithm.”A TikTok spokesperson said: “We categorically reject the commission’s misleading characterisation of our platform that attempts to scapegoat our company on industry-wide and societal challenges. TikTok has an ongoing, robust trust and safety programme with more than 70 features and settings designed specifically to support the safety and wellbeing of teens and families on our platform.”Executives for TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, told the French parliamentary committee that the app used AI-enhanced moderation that last year caught 98% of content infringing its terms of service in France.Emmanuel Macron’s office had indicated it wanted social media banned for children and young adolescents, afterAustralialast year started drafting its own landmark law with a prohibition for those under 16.Géraldine, whose 18-year-old daughter ended her life, told Agence France-Presse that after her daughter’s death last year she had discovered videos of self-harm her daughter had published and looked at on TikTok.“TikTok didn’t kill our little girl, because she wasn’t well in any case,” she said. But she accused TikTok of falling short in its online moderation, and plunging her daughter deeper into her dark impulses.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsFranceTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaEuropeYoung peopleChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

There is generally no need to buy a fresh phone just because new models have been released, as hardware updates are broadly iterative, adding small bits to an already accomplished package. But if you do want a replacement handset, whether new or refurbished, here are the best devices of the current crop of Apple smartphones.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many other smartphones are available besides the iPhone, but if you’re an Apple user and don’t fancyswitching to Android, you still have a few choices. Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the release ofthe iPhone 16e.Apple announced fournew iPhones, featuring refreshed designs, chips and greatly improved selfie cameras, including an entirely new iPhone Air model that is the thinnest Apple phone to date, on 9 September 2025. The Air has a 6.5in screen and a titanium frame and a single camera on the back (plus the selfie camera), but only supports eSims.The new iPhone 17 is an update to the standard iPhone, adding a slightly larger and brighter 6.3in screen. This comes with a faster ProMotion refresh rate for smoother scrolling, a feature that has until now been restricted to the Pro models.The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max have a new back design with a camera lump that stretches the full width of the device and features three 48MP cameras. They have larger batteries, are made of aluminium instead of the titanium of their predecessors, and are available in a standout new orange colour.The new models go on sale on 19 September andare already available for preorder. This guide will be updated once all four models are thoroughly tested and ranked.At a glanceBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 16From £698 at John LewisBest iPhone for camera:iPhone 16 Pro£899 at ArgosBest iPhone for screen:iPhone 16 Pro Max£1,099 at ArgosCheapest new iPhone:iPhone 16eFrom £599 at AppleThe best iPhones you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreenThe Apple iPhone 16 Plus with the iPhone 16.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 16View image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16 includes some of the first Apple Intelligence AI features, such as writing, proofing and summarising tools.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe base model iPhone 16 has almost all the features that make Apple’s latest smartphones great, but it’s significantly cheaper than the 16 Pro models.It has Apple’s modern yet familiar aluminium and glass iPhone design and Face ID but has a rearranged camera cluster on the back. It sticks with the same 6.1in OLED screen as its predecessors, which looks good but lacks an always-on mode. It’s also still stuck at a relatively slow 60Hz refresh rate, which can make scrolling and motion more jarring than on models with faster screens.The latest A18 chip is rapid and enables Apple’s Intelligence features (AI tools). The battery lasts about two days of general use, or at least a day of heavy use, and the phone charges with USB-C. It also supports MagSafe and Qi/Qi2 wireless charging and accessories. It starts with a decent 128GB of storage, although larger models are available if you don’t want to store your photos and videos in the cloud.The iPhone 16 is light and fairly compact for a modern smartphone, and its IP68 rating means it’s water-resistant to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes – more than safe enough for any accidental dunks. It gains the useful Action button from 2023’siPhone 15 Pro, which replaces the mute switch and can be used to mute the phone or for various other functions, such as turning on the torch or launching apps. The new Camera Control button is great for quickly opening the camera, even if zooming, changing settings and shooting photos with the button is fiddly in the camera app.The dual camera on the back is good, comprising a main 48MP camera and an improved 12MP ultrawide camera, which now has a macro photography mode for fun closeup shots. It also has Apple’s photographic styles features for those who want to customise how the camera captures photos (rich contrast, vibrant, warm) and get creative with tone and colour palette. The main camera can do a 2x in-sensor zoom, which works well in bright light, but the lack of a real telephoto camera holds the 16 back. The 12MP selfie camera is the same as other iPhones.The iPhone runs the recently released iOS 18.3, which includessupport for RCS messaging with Androidand adds more of Apple’s new AI features. They include a selection of AI writing tools that are built into the keyboard, which allow you to proof, rewrite and summarise text, create tables and lists, transcribe audio from calls and recordings, among other small features.An AI object remover in photos can help improve your shots, while theImage Playgroundtool can generate images for you from descriptions or photos, including cartoon versions of real people. The Genmoji tool in the keyboard can create custom emoji stickers too.Siri has a new design and can now pass queries to ChatGPT for more advanced answers. Apple’s notification summary tool has been tweaked too: it now summarises stacks of notifications with stylised italics and has paused summarising news and media notificationsafter a backlash.Apple’svisual intelligence featureallows users to point their camera at an object, text or information, such as URLs, calendar entries or phone numbers, to use them or find out more about them, including sending images to ChatGPT or Google for information.From £698 at John LewisFrom £699 at AppleWhy should you buy it?The iPhone 16 provides the standard iPhone experience at a cheaper price and in the most pocketable size, offering good battery life and access to new and future AI features.Buy if:you want the default, good iPhone experience todayDon’t buy if:you want optical zoom on your cameraRead ourfulliPhone 16 review: more buttons and speed for Apple’s standard phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP main + 12MP UW; 12MP front-facingDimensions:147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm (HWD)Weight:170gThe best Apple Watches in 2025: what’s worth buying and what’s not, according to our expertRead moreBattery and size upgrade:iPhone 16 PlusView image in fullscreenThough somewhat bulky to fit in a pocket, the iPhone 16 Plus has great battery life and a 6.7in screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The ObserverFor an extra £100, the iPhone 16 Plus matches the specs, camera and features of the base model but adds a bigger 6.7in screen and long battery life, which can last up to three days of general use.

It’s the step-up option to the basic iPhone 16: the same good bits, but a slightly larger (6.3in) screen, despite being squeezed into a similarly sized titanium and glass body. The display is crisp, bright and slick, with a faster 120Hz refresh rate to keep scrolling and animations smooth. The screen also supports the handy always-on feature, showing the time and notifications when not in use.The 16 Pro also has a slightly more powerful A18 Pro chip and starts with 128GB of storage, with greater space available – up to 1TB – for those who need it. The battery lasts a good 40 hours of general use, meaning it will go through the heaviest of days, and most will need to charge it only every other day.It has the same two extra Action and Camera Control buttons as the regular model, but the camera on the back is better. The 48MP main camera and 48MP ultrawide camera are great and the extra 12MP 5x telephoto camera meaningfully closes the distances to objects.

That means it will manage even the heaviest all-day use, and is ideal if you want to game for hours.However, Apple’s superphone is so big that it is hard to handle, needing two hands to wield. It’s also quite heavy and bulky, making it a bit of a lump to carry in a pocket or small bag.£1,099 at Argos£1,099 at CurrysWhy should you buy it?The 16 Pro Max is Apple’s superphone with a massive, beautiful screen and excellent battery life, as well as everything good about its smaller 16 Pro sibling.Buy if:you want a huge, high-quality display and a long-lasting batteryDon’t buy if:you want a smaller, more pocketable deviceRead ourfulliPhone 16 Pro Max review: totally maxed outScreen:6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)Processor:Apple A18 ProStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBCamera:48MP main + 48MP UW + 12MP 5x; 12MP front-facingDimensions:163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm (HWD)Weight:227gCheapest newiPhone:iPhone 16eView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16e fits Apple’s latest chips into the body of an iPhone 14 to make it the cheapest new model.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe cheapest entry in the iPhone 16 line is the iPhone 16e, the spiritual successor to theiPhone SEbut with a modern design and chips.It has an aluminium body, glass front and back, and a good 6.1in OLED screen with the older-style notch from2022’s iPhone 14.

A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is good but lacks any ultrawide or telephoto options.Despite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 16, it’s not that cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.From £599 at Apple£544 at John LewisWhy should you buy it?The 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with the latest chips and AI but with a few things missing to hit a lower price, such as a dual camera and MagSafe.Buy if:you want the cheapest new iPhone from Apple with the latest AI featuresDon’t buy if:you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessoriesRead our fulliPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP rear; 12MP front-facingDimensions:146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8mm (HWD)Weight:167gOther iPhones still on sale at AppleView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 15 will have software support for about five to six years.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone 15, released in 2023, has the same screen and aluminium body as the current iPhone 16 but lacks the action and camera control buttons.

The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’siPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receiveoccasional security updatesfrom Apple.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished phonesis better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished andsold directly by Applethat come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Do not buyAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.An iPhone 13 mini unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.How I testedQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 17 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

Around them, as well as rows of football shirts from leagues all over the world, are PCs and monitors with staff watching feeds of the matches. The people playing are from EA’s Design Council, a group of pro players, influencers and fans who regularly come in to play new builds, ask questions and make suggestions. These councils have been running for years, but for this third addition to the EA Sports FC series, the successor to EA’s Fifa games, their input is apparently being treated more seriously than ever.The message to journalists, invited here to get a sneak look at the game, is thata lacklustre responseto EA Sports FC 25 has meant that addressing user feedback is the main focus. EA has set up a new Player Feedback Portal, as well as a dedicated Discord channel, for fans to put forward their concerns. The developer has also introduced AI-powered social listening tools to monitor EA Sports FC chatter across various platforms including X, Instagram and YouTube.View image in fullscreenEA Sports FC 26 – Manuel Neuer pulls off a save.Photograph: Electronic Arts“There were too many disparate groups working on feedback across EA – making it overwhelming for individual teams on the game,” says lead producer, Joel Doonan. “Now we’ve really focused on, how do we make sure the people who need to know what players are saying are getting the right information at the right time with the right amount of detail so they can be as agile as possible?“There’s also been a shift in the proportion of the team’s resources devoted to addressing feedback. We have a continuous development team – 10 engineers solely dedicated to actioning feedback now rather than waiting for FC 27. I think that’s the expectation of players today – the speed at which live service games action on feedback is a heck of a lot faster than it was a handful of years ago.”The major change is a genuine surprise – there are now two completely different play styles to choose between: competitive and authentic. The former is all about speed, fluidity and high goal counts, capturing the turbo-charged pinball-style play of classic Fifa titles while removing real-world elements such as player fatigue. That one is aimed squarely at online competitive modes such as Ultimate Team and Clubs. Meanwhile, the Authentic mode is more of a pure simulation aimed at offline players, with slower buildup play and realistic outcomes.View image in fullscreenEA Sports FC 26 – Rush StadiumPhotograph: Electronic Arts“We had the desire to do this for some time, but we were prioritising other areas,” says gameplay production director, Sam Rivera. “Now however, it’s very clear, based on feedback, that with one single gameplay experience it’s impossible to please the different communities. Some want simulation, some want a more responsive experience where you perhaps have more control over the players instead of the AI helping you with certain behaviours. That creates a skill gap. Obviously maintaining two different game styles is more complex – it’s not just sliders, it’s actual code changes that create different outcomes depending on which different style you’re playing. But we’re in a more appropriate position now to support both in a way that’s close enough to the needs of different communities.”Dribbling is tighter, slicker, with a greater degree of directional freedom for the player. When you get into a scoring position, there’s a new option that lets you tap the shoot button twice to get a powerful low shot, rather than hoofing the ball into row Z. Goalkeeping has been improved with smarter positioning (via new reinforcement learning AI) and better shot-stopping, cutting down the number of times that the ball is punched right back at the attacking player. Similarly, defensive tackles will result in fewer rebounds, but in counterbalance, attacking players have a better ability to shield the ball, especially Enforcer players (think Haaland or Mbappé) will be able to use their body strength to hold off opponents.It seems the development team has been looking at other modern games and genres for inspiration. A new Archetypes feature for the Clubs and Player Career modes, lets you design and build players from 13 different types (with names such as Magician, Recycler and Boss), which work a lot like character classes in role-playing adventures, allowing you to earn experience points and upgrade the player’s stats throughout their career. Elsewhere, the Manager Live Career mode, which lets you guide a head coach across multiple seasons, draws from live service games such as Fortnite. There will be weekly challenges throughout the year, which could set objectives such as being at the top of the league at Christmas. Some might be inspired by unpredictable events from the real-life sport. During our demo presentation, career mode design director Pete O’Donnell points to an interesting example – the food poisoning outbreak that hit Italian Serie-B team Salernitanaat the close of last season. Couldyourteam cope with a diarrhoea epidemic before a crucial playoff match?The game’s most popular element, Ultimate Team, is getting a range of new features. The controversial Panini sticker-style fantasy football mode, where participants build teams by opening randomised digital packets of players which then compete online, is getting a live tournament mode, where linked competitions run for the whole season. A new feature called Bounties provides players with randomised challenges such as “score the first/last goal” or “keep a clean sheet” to ensure even if they lose an online match, they still get rewards. Gauntlets, meanwhile, are quicker live events where competitors must play a series of five matches, each with different players from their squad, so that nobody can just endlessly rely on the same superstar cards.It feels like this focus on user feedback is a well-timed PR exercise as much as a genuine design directive. The recent launch trailer for the game made a big deal of concentrating on in-match footage rather than eye-catching cinematics – the message being, “we’re listening to you, please stick with us”. The timing is vital too. In June, Fifa launched the casual mobile title Fifa Rivals and is sure to be working with developers on a more in-depth footie simulation, possibly in time for the men’s World Cup next year. EA Sports has had this arena to itself for several years, but maybe not for long. Fans were lukewarm about EA Sports FC 25 – their support may soon be more important than ever.EA Sports FC 26 is launched on PC, PS5, Xbox and Switch, 26 September.Keith Stuart attended a press trip to EA Sports Vancouver with other journalists.

She added: “As soon as we stop believing in it, it disappears.” Dr Mason’s own research suggests that there is sharply rising tolerance of political violence. On Wednesday, it claimed one more victim.The shocking killing of theco-founder of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk, a hugely influential activist whorallied young peopleto Donald Trump’s cause and far-right ideology more broadly, has been widely and rightly condemned across the political spectrum. Leading Democrats and progressive activists made clear that such violence must not be tolerated.Before a perpetrator had even been identified, the president, like several other Republicans,blamed“radical left political violence”, claiming that liberal rhetoric against conservatives was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country”. Mr Trump himself faced two attempts on his life last year. He cited other victims, but not the many Democrats who have been targeted, includingMelissa Hortman, the Minnesota state representative shot dead at her home alongside her husband, Mark, in June. Meanwhile, some far-right commentators spoke ofvengeance.Political violence is hardly a new phenomenon in a country that has seen a civil war, four presidential assassinations, and lynchings. But it is rising again. Ordinary Americansare being radicalised. In such an environment, one thing unites the political poles; any prominent figure is vulnerable, though women and people of colour areparticularly targeted. Threats to members of Congressrocketed last year.“Demonising those with whom you disagree” is indeed dangerous, but Mr Trump himself has normalised vicious attacks on opponents. The tolerance of violent action – as with Mr Trump’s blanket pardons for the January 6 rioters – sends a message too. The roots of violent acts are complex, but an environment conducive to political attacks may channel the propensities of potential perpetrators. Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, haswarnedthat US politics may be on the brink “of an extremely violent era … The more public support there is for political violence, the more common it is.” The USaddiction to gunsdrastically increases the impact.Acts of political violence exact an appalling human toll in lives lost and families shattered; Mr Kirk’s death leaves two small children fatherless. But they also – by design – deter other people from political or other civic activityat all levels. The most extreme voices may persist and prevail. Blaming political adversaries before a perpetrator has even been identified risks fuelling anger and attacks, to everyone’s cost. Research by Dr Mason, of Johns Hopkins University, and Nathan Kalmoe, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,foundthat a fifth of respondents said political violence could sometimes be justified, but three-fifths thought it could sometimes be justified if the other side committed violence first.Yet other research notes that people appearless willing tocondone violence if misperceptions of the other side’s extremism or propensity for force are corrected. In this perilous moment, the response to such hateful crimes should be to coalesce to stress non-violence and civic tolerance. To instead promote division will only increase the threat to politicians and activists of all stripes, and strike another blow to democracy itself.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s not picky about who they areThu 11 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareOnce unleashed, political violence comes for everyone.It doesn’t know what side of the aisle you’re on or what your ideology might be, who your allies are or what your vision for the future includes. It doesn’t know what brand of media you consume or how many ardent followers you have.Political violence doesn’t know and doesn’t care about such things.Like an infectious disease, it simply – and efficiently – finds more and more victims. It isn’t picky about who they are.Whatever his beliefs, the killing of Charlie Kirk at a campus event in Utah on Wednesday is tragic. Also tragic is how partisan, violent and ugly much of the immediate reaction was, mostly on the right. Nancy Mace, a Republican congressperson from South Carolina, told a gathering of reporters that “Democrats own what happened today.” She offered no evidence, only partisan vitriol.On Fox News, one of the most prominent rightwing media figures, Jesse Watters, sought reprisal.“We’re gonna avenge Charlie’s death,” Watters told the on-air audience. “Everybody’s accountable. And we’re watching … the politicians, the media and all these rats out there.”Granted that, on the left, some were too quick to say, in essence, “you reap what you sow,” but most prominent progressives – from Barack Obama to Mehdi Hasan – expressed sympathy and sadness. Some did so while acknowledging political differences, but emphasizing that those didn’t matter in this moment.There was plenty of blame and talk about accountability. But we already know that, when it comes to gun violence, there will be no real change, no real accountability. Because that’s hard, bipartisan work, and too much of America – deeply entrenched in tribal politics and egged on by a president who glories in violent rhetoric – is not interested.Gun “rights” – and gun-industry money – rule the day.Adding to the ugliness was the way social media revved its engines and did what it always does – made it worse.“The degree to which the algorithm on this platform is pushing video of the shooting is incredibly disturbing,” wrote CNN’s Abby Phillip on X. “There has to be some human that can turn the dial down in a situation like this.”That gun violence truly is an epidemic in America couldn’t have been clearer than when media coverage of Kirk’s assassination was interrupted by yet another school shooting, this one in Evergreen, Colorado.The Denver TV station KDVR offered a heartbreaking interviewwith a studentwho said he was new to the region.“I only moved here a few months ago, and I didn’t think this would happen so soon.”Those two words – so soon – speak volumes. School kids fully expect the life-changing trauma; they’re only hoping it might take a while to come to them.Because, as noted, it comes to everyone.Gabrielle Giffords, a former Democratic congressperson from Arizona, was shot and suffered a severe brain injury in 2012 and is now a passionate advocate for preventing gun violence. Admirable and dedicated as she is, her posted reaction seemed curious, although it surely was meant to offer some hope in a dark moment.“Democratic societies will always have political disagreements,” she wrote, “but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence.”But, as Giffords knows all too well, we already have allowed it. And America already is that country.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinionUS politicsGun crimecommentShareReuse this content"

The first was a ruling by the US federal court of appeals,upholding an earlier judgmentin which the president was found liable for $83.3m in damages for defaming the writer E Jean Carroll – a woman whom, it wasruled in civil court in 2023, had been sexually abused by Trump. On the same day, Trump’s alleged contribution to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s “birthday book” wasshared by Democratson social media in the form of a lewd drawing the president denied having made. The E Jean Carroll news caused no public inconvenience for Trump; the Epstein story went up like a mushroom cloud in what has become the most politically dangerous episode of his presidency.What, exactly, is the difference then between the sexual abuse of E Jean Carroll, for which Trump has been found liable in a civil court, and the trafficking and abuse of victims by Epstein, in which there is no direct evidence of Trump’s involvement? For that matter, why does Trump’s record ofgross referencesto grabbing women “by the pussy” andcalling them“fat” and “ugly” elicit barely a shrug from supporters, while his friendship with Epstein, a man referred to in the press, variously, as the “billionaire paedophile”, the “paeodophile financier”, and, surely coming down the pike at some point, the “hell-based paedophile money manager”, has triggered not only fury among the Maga faithful but accusations of a Trump cover-up?Trump people would argue it’s a question of degree: Epstein occupies the worst and most taboo category of sex offender – a child abuser, in which no grey area exists. This assumes the existence, within Maga circles, of a continuum ranging from paedophile sex trafficking (very bad), through other categories of sex offending (less bad but still quite bad), to “date rape” and the whole of #MeToo (lot of fuss about nothing). But this isn’t how Trump supporters have calibrated their outrage. Instead, what we have seen is mass, Maga hysteria over Epstein, in which even the likes of Tucker Carlsonhave made veiled accusationsagainst Trump, and complete indifference to every other accusation made by women against the president.It is a feature of misogyny, of course, that the flipside of abusing women and curtailing their rights is selective sentimentalisation. Animating the Maga movement is the desire for a return to traditional gender roles and pronatalism, a force driven, one assumes, by a sense of frustrated male entitlement that has built up over decades of gains made by the women’s movement. A hatred of women as extreme as the one seen within the current Republican movement requires a moral counterweight. And what better source of moral clarity – what starker moral issue, one that brooks no dissent or equivocation from anyone on either side – than the defence of abused girls? In the rightwing media, the only stories relished as much as those about Epstein’s crimes, are ones about violent offences committed by immigrants.As a result, the use to which “child abuse” is put within the rightwing ecosystem is not only as a bat signal for conspiracy theories, designed to increase the reach of each story, but as a pretext for everyone in that world to feel, perhaps fleetingly, very good about themselves, moral crusaders in a horrible world. In the case of Epstein, there’s the bonus of liberal names being ensnared in the net. In Epstein’s “birthday book”, Bill Clintonappears to have left a whimsical messagereferring to Epstein’s “childlike curiosity”, and “drive to make a difference”. And Peter Mandelsonappears in a bathrobeto address Epstein as “my best pal”. (Sidenote: there can be few situations in which being gay in public life is an advantage over being straight – but downplaying one’s involvement with Epstein is definitely one of them.)The curious thing about all this is that, per the biases that govern how victims of sexual abuse are perceived,E Jean Carrollis a pretty good victim: an older woman (she was 52 when Trump abused her in 1996), doing a mundane chore (shopping), in a public place (Bergdorf Goodman). And yet the judgment of the civil courts in her favour in 2023 elicited no sympathy among Trump supporters, in or outside Congress, and since then the president has suffered no apparent drop in political fortunes.But here’s the rub: Carroll is an adult woman, liberal, successful, stylish, and articulate – everything that threatens and triggers Trump’s base. The only female victim worth defending in Trumpland is the fallen girl, a figure straight out of a Victorian lithograph, and one who inspires such fervour, such delusions of nobility, that if it comes to a straight contest, she may win out over Trump.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

IsDonald Trumpthe cause of the rift, or is the US president only a symptom of underlying trends? Optimists latch on to the hope that the stability we have lost can be restored post-Trump. Having spent the past few days in Washington, I doubt it.Even in recent history, things were not quite so bad for the transatlantic relationship. The current tensions make the first Trump administration look like a walk in the park for Europeans. It is one thing towithdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump did in his first term. It is quite another tobomb Iranand give Israel the green light for its war against the regime.It is one thing to be threatened with tariffs, and have to offer empty promises,as Jean-Claude Juncker did, to buy more US goods. It is quite another to swallow 15% US tariffs, leaving a queasy-looking Ursula von der Leyen giving a thumbs up for the cameras next to a smirking Trump.When it comes to security cooperation, Trump in his first term at least sent anti-tank Javelin missiles to Ukraine; now at best he’ll allow European governments to buy US weapons for Kyiv. Meanwhile, he is taken for a ride by Vladimir Putin as the Russian dictator gloats walking down the red carpet in Anchorage, Alaska.Optimism can become a form of faith – and some still cling to the belief, despite all the evidence, that the good old transatlantic days will be back.This scenario is delusional. Even if Trump were to vanish, it’s hard to see the transatlantic relationship reverting to that shared sense of kinship that characterised it in past decades. The most we can hope, as one Washington observer framed it for me, is to become a separated couple temporarily living under the same roof for the sake of the children, and then amicably parting ways.When Joe Biden was elected, I suspected that he would be the last truly Atlanticist US leader, regardless of who came next. I distinctly remember when Biden roused the crowd of transatlantic enthusiasts at the Munich Security Conference in 2021, announcing that“America is back”. A little voice inside my head added: “Probably for the last time.” Security, demographic, societal and economic forces in the US and in the wider world pointed against Biden’s pledge. The transatlantic relationship can no longer be assumed to be based on shared values and identities.Europeans understand this intellectually, but they struggle to accept the reality emotionally. This explains the tendency to lie low and avoid ruffling Trump’s feathers, biding time in the hope the past can be magically restored.This attitude is dangerous, because alternative outcomes seem far more likely – two in particular. They are both premised on the transatlantic drift being deeper and more structural than merely the presence of Trump himself. Whether we end up closer to the first or to the second scenario depends on how Trump acts, but also on how Europe reacts.The first would see Europe and the US transact when their interests, however fleeting, converge. This would reduce the relationship to transactions of convenience, with none of the emotional connections or long-term commitments it has enjoyed for decades, but at least it would not be marked by enmity and hard feelings.If Europe is at war and the US can make money by selling weapons to it, it will be happy to do so. But this won’t stop Washington from reaching a bilateral deal with Moscow over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans. Accepting this rather squalid reality would mean that Europe, just likeRussia, China or India, would cynically seek to extract as many gains as possible from the US, aware that this is the name of the game for all. Europeans would continue to buy US weapons for a while, but use that time to develop the continent’s strategic autonomy and invest in Ukraine’s defence industry.They would accept Trump’s tariffs in the short term, but strengthen the EU’s bargaining hand by increasing the scope, depth and pace of trade with others, from the Latin American countries of the Mercosur bloc toIndiaand the 12-strong Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In this scenario, Europe should also pursue the proposal to build an alternative international trading system to the World Trade Organization, without the US. This is not an ideal outcome for Europe, but one we could live with.However, there is another scenario, which is far more ominous for Europe. It is a world of empires in which the US, Russia,China, and perhaps India one day, each has their sphere of interests. Empires could end up clashing but they could also overlap, at least some of the time. They would do so on the basis of fleeting deals, rather than shared rules and laws. Trump’s instincts tilt in this direction. Seeing Europe as a colony, he would prefer to deal with it through extortion than transactionalism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Chinese president, Xi Jinping’s, recent love-in with Putin and Narendra Modi in Tianjin points in a more confrontational direction. Meanwhile, Trump’s myopic trade war has seriously dented a painstakingly crafted US partnership with India, pushing Delhi into Beijing’s lap. A world of empires would be the worst possible outcome for Europe, caught between the imperial ambitions of Russia and the US, with China waiting in the wings.Europe’s reactions to these emerging realities make the chance of this dark outcome more likely. European leaders have spent the past six months genuflecting, pampering and conceding to Trump. A small dose of diplomatic flattery is a necessity, to be sure, and reflects relative bargaining powers. But we really don’t need to pose for pathetic thumbs-up photos, send embarrassingtext messages before Nato summitsor offer upgilded giftsand royal invites.All this self-humiliation makes many European citizens cringe. It’s unnecessary, at most winning Trump’s fickle smiles; worse, it’s counterproductive, because it demonstrates that Europe can indeed be colonised, and accepts “survival of the fittest” as the way forward. Europeans must truly accept that the past is sadly past. Only then can they avoid a future that will see them violently pushed down the food chain.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a worst-of-both-worlds scenarioEmma Burnell is the editor of LabourListThu 11 Sep 2025 11.28 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareKeir Starmer’s public image is one of stolid caution. This was something deliberately crafted at the start of his leadership of the Labour party to put him into sharp contrast with the charismatic but chaotic then prime minister, Boris Johnson. Starmer is – we were repeatedly told – forensic. He’s a details man who plays by the book.However, look more closely and you will see that Starmer is actually something of a political risk-taker. The hiring –and now firing– of Peter Mandelson is just the latest case in point.Mandelson was appointed as ambassador to the US despite what was already known about his links to Jeffrey Epstein. That there might be more to come out was a risk that Starmer was clearly willing to take.For a while, this seemed to be paying off. All reports were that Mandelson was doing a good job of building an unexpectedly warm relationship between theLabourgovernment and Maga world. This may seem distasteful to many, but it was judged to ensure that Britain was harmed as little as possible by the unpredictable occupant of the White House.But what has come out in the past few days has turned stomachs and embarrassed the prime minister to the point that Mandelson was finally fired – despite it being so close to Trump’s state visit, the details of which Mandeslon was instrumental in negotiating.At PMQs yesterday, Starmer’s buttoned-up persona and his risk-taking one were both on display – this time to his detriment. He took a leap by vocally standing by Mandelson, a stance that became untenable only a few hours later.At the same time, the way he fell back on the fact that Mandelson was vetted for the role leaned into the worst parts of his reputation for rigidity. While an unusually sure-footed Kemi Badenoch asked questions about judgment, Starmer gave answers about process. It gave him the appearance of a middle manager following protocol, rather than a leader able to respond to the political moment.Starmer’s risk-taking side has, in the past, led to some spectacular pay-offs: recall hisoffer to resign if fined over “currygate”. But that was a risk that worked with the grain of his public persona. His defence of Mandelson simply did not fit with the image of “champion of law and order” that Starmer cultivates. It is, in part, this disconnect that calls his political acumen into question.Not only has the prime minister lost this key ambassador at the worst possible time, but – by supporting him for longer than was viable – he also gets no credit for eventually firing him. This “worst of both worlds” ending seems to demonstrate a lack of political dexterity.I started my new job as editor of LabourListlast week. Since then, we’ve seen theresignation of the deputy prime minister, the frenzy of a reshuffle, the jostling of the opening stages of the contest to become deputy leader of the Labour party, and now the Mandelson scandal. Given this period started with the government announcing a new “delivery” phase, things can hardly be said to have gone to plan.Backbenchers I speak to vary between expressing shock at quite how bad the start of this term has been and anger at how some elements have been handled. Several have expressed genuine bafflement as to why Starmer chose to stand by Mandelson as long as he did (they were considerably more sympathetic to his standing by Rayner). They could (rightly) see no way this could end without Mandelson going. Given that, standing by him felt like it was all risk and no reward.This has been a pretty horrific start to the new term for the government. It will need to have both judgment and nimbleness to turn it around and change the narrative. Starmer is going to have to start to show his party and the country that he has both these characteristics as well as a good story to tell. And he will need to do it soon. That will mean demonstrating better judgment about which risks are truly worth taking.Emma Burnell is the editor of LabourListExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerPeter MandelsonAngela RaynercommentShareReuse this content"

It was paramount that what we happened to enjoy got the stamp of approval by whatever chic society we were chomping at the bit to be accepted into, digital or otherwise.For me, it was the internet It Girls that dominated my laptop’s screen during the early-to-mid-2010s, who expressed their love for Cigarettes After Sex, Lana Del Rey, FKA twigs, and TV shows and movies almost exclusively made 20 years prior.I wanted nothing more than to be just like them and to be a part of the Cool Girl Club.I told my friends at school that I was a fan of “this old show called Twin Peaks”, saying it loudly enough so my fellow classmates would be in awe of how enigmatic my interests were, spellbound by my affinity for a TV show belonging to our parents’ generation.Dear gen Z, take a lesson from this zillennial: to be cringe is to be free | Eleanor BurnardRead moreYou’d think that by now, as I’m pushing steadily towards the big three-oh, this immature tendency of proving my coolness to an uncaring crowd would have all but dissipated by now but, alas, old habits die hard.I don’t know why I have such an insatiableneedfor online strangers to know that I’m a fan of Agnès Varda films and Clarice Lispector novels – even writing this feels like a shameless and embarrassingly smug brag – but I know that I’m not the only artsy-fartsy wannabe who uses their interests as a way to keep up with the esoteric Joneses.Who among us does not feel a sense of blissful pride whenever someone compliments our music taste, or asks for our movie recommendations, or – most thrilling of all – actually listens to and watches the things we told them to check out? There’s no greater joy than to inaugurate someone else into your very own Cool Club, where you can rejoice in your shared coolness over liking the same cool things.However, herein lies an entirely new, postmodern problem: if everybody is able to achieve almost-instantaneous coolness these days, is there still such a thing as being “cool”? Can anything truly be considered “underground” or “niche” when it can be easily uncovered and dissected through a simple scroll on whatever social media site, discussion board or lengthy video essay we happen to be plugged into at the time?And does anybody even care about being seen as cool anyway, or is it just me who still (humiliatingly) yearns for it?I can scream as loudly as I’d like from the rooftop about Cool Girl-approved media, but that won’t reduce the amount of time I’ve spent rewatching the same episodes of Bob’s Burgers,or stop the inevitability of The Hampster Dance finding its way on to my Spotify Wrapped later this year.I suppose it’s time to face the music: I am entirely uncool.And while my teenage self would internally combust in shame over this revelation, I have come to realise that there is no freer feeling than just embracing one’s own unique lameness, mainstream interests and all.Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy dipping my toes into highbrow art whenever I get a craving for it, and I have discovered some of my all-time favourite things through my never-ending journey of achieving ultimate coolness. My teenage self was genuinely moved and entranced by David Lynch’s classic Americana mystery series – as countless others before and after me – but that won’t stop me from finding joy in other, more “basic” forms of media.There have been times where listening to Abba’s iconic breakup hit The Winner Takes It All has brought me close to tears, and I’m not too proud to admit that I’ve similarly been affected by episodes of cheesy sitcoms and low-budget flicks from my childhood. Hell, I’d even describeAdventure Timeas one of my favourite shows of all time, fart jokes and all.Perhaps that is what true coolness actually is; the ability to discover new ways of engaging and interpreting any artform we happen to be fans of so we can better understand why these things mean so much to us and, in turn, create a brand-new Cool Club that is open to anything we like, free of shame.Anyway, time to logLa Haineon to my Letterboxd account!Eleanor Burnard is a production assistant at Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsCultureOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Millionaires who’ve seen first-hand just how completely the system is rigged in their favour, who know how wrong it is and want to change it, get a similar verbal beating on social media and in certain sections of the press. It’s almost as if they protest too much?Take this week’s political tax stories, one big and one largely ignored.Rayner’s tax behaviour, through lack of proper advice and planning, has created a political nightmare for the government. How could someone on the frontbench of the Labour government have to resign because they didn’t pay enough tax? Also scrutinised, if far less widely reported, have been the tax practices of the leader of Reform UK, who is reported to have channelled some of his earnings into a companyto reduce the tax he has to pay on them, having previously criticised people who try to avoid tax as the “common enemy”.Both politicians have used or tried to use the tools available to those who are relatively wealthy. But there is an even bigger problem. Once you get to be rich or super-rich, there are more and more channels by which advisers might try to shrink your tax bill.Let’s face it, many of us can be tax hypocrites in one way or another. We all know stories of plumbers and mechanics paid cash, in full knowledge that their intention is to reduce their tax bill. Avoidance at that level is wrong, but a crucial difference is scale. What happens at street level is incomparable to the billions lost through the super-rich exploiting a system tilted in their favour.We should be proud of the tax we pay because we know it is an investment in our country and our people. What better way to spend your money? The current problem with this argument is that Britain is pretty broken. That’s not because of the poorest people – whether it bethose receiving benefitsor desperate people coming hereon small boats– it’s because successive governments have failed to invest in our country; they have lacked the character and the gumption to raise the revenue needed for that investment from the richest people; and they have not addressedthe wealth inequalitythat’s a drain on any kind of growth.View image in fullscreenA rally in support of taxing the super-rich outside the Treasury in London on 25 March 2025Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesA cash payment to a plumber is peanuts compared to the taxes we lose due to wealth management firms advising the super-rich on ways to minimise their contribution. Even Farage’s method forreducing the tax he paysis laughable compared to those with serious wealth. He will know this, given hisrecent paid appearanceas a keynote speaker for wealth consultancy Nomad Capitalist, which specialises in providing “holistic, legal strategies that enable successful entrepreneurs and investors to reduce their tax bill”. From trusts to partnerships, private equity, lowering capital gains, offshoring wealth, a laughable lack of taxes on stocks of wealth – there is a never-ending list of ways the richest can reduce their tax bill, and a never-ending list of wealth management firms helping them to do it. The way Britain’s tax system works offers the sharpest tools to those with the most money, leaving everyone else with almost nothing. Their effective tax rate is so much lower. Even the best intentioned millionaire is likely to have been advised on how to reduce their contribution. The likes of Farage know this. And it’s surely here that the real hypocrisy lies.Despite Rayner’s resignation, it is never going to be one action or one individual changing their behaviour that can address this. We need national action to rebalance the tax system or it will continue to get worse. Earlier this year the National Audit Office pointed out that the complexity of the richest people’s tax affairs increases the opportunity for their tax planning and avoidance; that wealthy taxpayershave faced fewer penaltiesin recent years, and criminal prosecutions of wealthy individualshave also declined.We can’t keep turning a blind eye to this.The government must crack down on tax dodging, especially by the super-rich, but it must go so much further than that if it wants to transform our country and have a fighting chance at the next election. It must raise taxes on the very richest. Equalizing the tax rate on all forms of income (such as capital gains) would help simplify our system and make tax avoidance measures harder to use. And a 2% tax on those with over £10m would be a fabulous way to redress the imbalance in how we tax wealth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Talk about poisoned chalices.The conventional wisdom is that Macron and his succession of premiers are the only ones prepared to face up to reality, which is that France’s unwillingness to get serious about reducing its budget deficit leaves itat the mercy of the financial markets.Sooner or later, the bond market vigilantes – the collective term for traders in government bonds – will force the French political class to act. Eventually, the warring political parties will accept the truth of what Margaret Thatcher said in the 1980s.You can’t buck the market.Britain, so the story goes, also needs to wake up, or else the markets will be coming for us next. There is still a chance to avoid a meltdown, but itrequires the sort of actionthat French MPs have so far resisted. Raise taxes. Cut welfare. Take the axe to spending programmes.The reasonFranceand Britain have no choice but to do this is because states are weak and markets are all powerful. The bond markets exert their power through their role in buying and selling government bonds. If they sell en masse, the interest rates governments pay to borrow goes up and they can be forced to change policy even when they are reluctant to do so. It has been the received wisdom for the past 50 years that governments should do what bond traders and speculators demand, or risk being crushed by the global financial juggernaut.Rachel Reeves needs to find cash fast. A wealth tax really is her only viable option | Faiza ShaheenRead moreThere is an alternative narrative, which goes like this. Britain has its own currency and a central bank with the ability to set interest rates. It is not France – and the idea that contagion will spread across the Channel is an attempt by the political right to dragoon the UK chancellor,Rachel Reeves, into actions that will be unpopular as well as pointless.It is also worth saying that markets are powerful, but not all-powerful. They operate within the legal and institutional frameworks created by governments – and when the going gets tough, they rely on governments to dig them out of a hole.During the global financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid pandemic of 2020, the markets were only bailed out thanks to the willingness of governments to print money and run big budget deficits. There was no talk of the need for the bond market vigilantes toimpose financial disciplineback then.Just as the power of markets is exaggerated, so the power of states is underestimated. What happened in the 1970s and 1980s was that states were shaped by a rightwing ideology which meant, among other things, the removal of curbs on the movement of capital. These restrictions had been put in place for a reason: so that governments could go for full employment, build up welfare states and reduce inequality.Removing capital controls has been good for big finance and multinational corporations, but has made it harder for governments to pursue domestic economic strategies. States have not grown weaker during the past half century, they have merely served a different class interest.To be sure, there are times when the markets get it right and governments are clearly wrong.Black Wednesday– the day in September 1992 when George Soros forced Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism – was an example of that. While ahumiliation for John Major’s Conservative government, Black Wednesday allowed interest rates to fall and proved to be the catalyst for a powerful economic recovery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea that austerity measures were needed to keep bond markets happy and thereby create the conditions for growth proved to be a fantasy in the aftermath of the financial crash, and is no more plausible in the France or Britain of today.Nobody could accuse Macron of being anything other than a market-friendly president. He has cut corporate taxes and raised France’s retirement age. And a fat lot of good it has done him. Under his presidency, the French economy has continued to struggle. All of which means the real lesson for Britain from France is somewhat different from the one trumpeted by the political right.Reeves is correct to make faster growth her priority, because it will lead to higher tax revenues and fewer people claiming benefits. But sucking demand out of the economy through tax increases and spending cuts will lead to weaker growth and a higher deficit, prompting further demands from the markets for remedial action. Speculation about which taxes are going to rise inNovember’s budgetwill probably sap business and consumer confidence.Labour, like other centre-left parties, faces a choice. It can argue that financial markets are often capricious and destructive. It can argue that uncaging finance has not produced the improvement in economic performance promised by the Thatcherites. It can argue that the whims of the markets should not be allowed to prevent the need for a generously funded industrial strategy. It can argue that by raising tariffs and takinga stake in the US chipmaker Intel, Donald Trump has made the unthinkable thinkable. It can make the case for targeted and transparent controls to prevent short-term capital movements blowing the economy off course.Alternatively, it can use “you can’t buck the markets” as a justification for passivity and, by doing so, chart a course for eventual defeat. As the parlous state of centre-left parties acrossEuropeshows, timidity will have economic and political consequences.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionLabourRachel ReevesBudget 2025FranceFinancial sectorEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

The rightwing junktanks behind the Tories’ worst disasters still have the keys to No 10George MonbiotWho is running the government’s ‘growth school’ for civil servants? The answer surpassed my worst fearsThu 11 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 10.01 EDTShareForgive me if I’ve got this wrong, but I seem to recall the country voting the Tories out last year. Part of the reason, if I remember correctly, was their staggering incompetence and insouciance, epitomised by Liz Truss’s mini-budget. That catastrophe was, like Truss’s political career, formed and steered by theneoliberal junktanksof Tufton Street.But now I begin to doubt my recollections. We booted them out through the front door, right? Yet they still appear to be in the house. Perhaps they came round the back. After taking an interest in the Department for Business and Trade’s “growth school” speaker sessions for civil servants, I sent a freedom of information request. Given that Keir Starmer,like Truss, has placed his growth “mission” at the centre of policy, and that this department is responsible for delivering it, the instruction given to its officials is crucial to the economic and political direction the country takes.Who, I wondered, would be speaking at these sessions? The answer surpassed my worst fears. Among the external instructors used by the department’s “growth school” so far are no representatives from trade unions, social justice, human rights or environmental groups, and no representatives from left or liberal thinktanks such as the New Economics Foundation or the Institute for Public Policy Research. But there are four who work or have worked for the Tufton Street junktanks that surrounded Truss. They areSamuel Hughesfrom the Centre for Policy Studies,Ben Southwood, formerly of Policy Exchange and currently a senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, Sam Bowman, also a senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, andSam Dumitriu, formerly head of research at the Adam Smith Institute and now head of policy at Britain Remade.Trussdelegated key functionsof government to the dark-money thinktanks.Among her senior staff were the former head of economic and social policy at Policy Exchange, a former senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Studies and the former head of government affairs at the Adam Smith Institute. These lobby groups are ranked by the transparency campaignWho Funds You?as either opaque or highly opaque.On the day of her mini-budget, the junktanks lined upto claim responsibility for it. The Centre for Policy Studies wrote: “Great to see so many CPS policies included in today’s announcement by the Chancellor.” These,it said, were “just a few” of its wins.I found the inclusion of Britain Remade in the department’s grooming sessions particularly dismal. This group, formed after Truss’s ejection from No 10, seems to exert anextraordinary gripon government policy. Alongside Dumitriu, it is run by former special advisers to Boris Johnson and Truss. It haslobbied vigorouslyfornew road building, whileattacking environmental groups.Where is the experience of business and trade that such speakers are, presumably, supposed to bring? It is hard to see what the junktanks have to offer, other than discredited neoliberal theory and a long record of failure. So why might they have been chosen? Well, like Truss, and inthe face of powerful evidence, the Starmer administration believesgrowth will be deliveredby deregulation – which happens to be afundamental tenet of neoliberalism.Truss, who singularly fails totake responsibility for her decisions, claims her premiership wasterminated by the “deep state”: a conspiracy fiction imported from the US. Well, judging by the disturbing continuity between arguably the most extreme Conservative government in modern history and its Labour successor, we could agree with her that entrenched forms of political power persist, regardless of who wins the election. I wouldn’t call it the deep state, but it does make you wonder what we voted for.Like its Conservative predecessors, Starmer’s is a government beholden, to a shocking degree, to lobbyists. Their influence appears to explain a wide range of policies, fromthe ban on Palestine Action, to theplanned deregulationof the financial sector (as if the 2008 crash never happened) andnew private partnershipsin the NHS; from the environmentallydisastrous planning and infrastructure billtothis week’s decisionto allow bottom trawlers to keep ripping up England’s “marine protected areas”.The work of Ethan Shone, an investigative journalist at openDemocracy, is indispensable in explaining the weird commissions and omissions of this government. He has shown howassiduously commercial interestscourted the Labour party before the last election, and how that courtshiphas turned into policy. Corporate representatives were seconded into political offices and frontbenchers attended “client roundtables”. Rachel Reeves, now the chancellor,told corporate executivesjust before the election that “I hope you …. see your fingerprints all over” our manifesto. A former Labour minister, Jim Murphy,gleefully predictedthat Starmer’s administration would be the “first private-sector government in Labour’s history”.He wasn’t wrong. The new environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, was a managing director of TheCityUK, a lobby group for banks and other financial services. In January, she became City minister.Among the current government’s advisers isthe City lobbyist Iain Anderson, whom Truss appointed as one of her “business champions”. When she stood for Conservative leader,he tweeteda selfie of the two of them, with the caption “I’ve been a Conservative for almost 4 decades … I’ve worked with Liz on economic reform and boosting opportunity. She has fresh ideas and real energy. She does what she says and is strong and loyal. That’s why I’m backing #LizForLeader.” Now, though he continues to work as a lobbyist, Starmer’s government has appointed him as a non-executive director of the Department for Business and Trade, which hosts those “growth school” talks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Money’s tools include the direct funding of political parties and politicians, bullying by the billionaire media, the misinformation machine of social media and a massive lobbying effort, some of which is conducted by acknowledged lobby companies, some by groups whose affiliations are not disclosed.The dark-money junktanks have become essential to capital’s assault on democracy. They are theglue that connectsthe media onslaught to active policy formation, creating a united front. Opaque neoliberal thinktanks are among the unfortunate realities any nominally progressive government has to navigate.

Captain Crozier [from The Terror] didn’t die, and Lane Pryce [from Mad Men] wasn’t real. I would love to play [the 19th-century US president] Ulysses S Grant. His history has largely been written by southern US historians and so his achievements have largely been denigrated. But his campaigns are taught in all the military academies around the world. Despite a pretty disastrous presidency, he still managed to [sign a] Civil Rights Act – and hedestroyed the Ku Klux Klan.When the civil war broke out he sold firewood by the side of the road to try to put food on the table for his family. Eight years later, he was president. It’s the kind of quintessential American success story, but history doesn’t regard him that way.View image in fullscreenOn deck … as Claudius in the RSC’s 2025 production of Hamlet.Photograph: Marc BrennerWhich made you feel more seasick – the sinking-ship stage set from the2025RSCproduction of Hamlet, in which you played Claudius, orHMS Terror from The Terror?Dr_JA_ZoidbergDefinitely the RSC stage, because it moved throughout the production, so you’d suddenly find yourself losing your footing and wobbling. The set for The Terror was locked off, particularly when it was at that weird angle when the whole thing was tipping to the side.When you’re drinkingscotch in Mad Men, whichscotch is it pretending to be?CoveRoadWell, you drink sugar water, which is horrible. The cigarettes are herbal cigarettes, which are impossible to keep lit, which is why you see everyone puffing really hard. It makes everybody look like complete nicotine addicts.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Christina Hendricks, John Slattery, Jared Harris, Vincent Kartheiser, Jon Hamm, Robert Morse and Elisabeth Moss in Mad Men.Photograph: AMC/ LionsgateDid you inherit your fatherRichard Harris’s singing voice? And do you share his taste for rugby shirts?MissusDandTaffRaffiaI didnotinherit his singing voice. I’m passable at karaoke, but I would never charge anybody to hear me sing. I actually have a bunch of his rugby shirts that I kept to remind me of him.What was the process of learningBelterforThe Expanse?Did you model your accent on anyone in particular for your roleas Crozier in The Terror?GironansandTeam504Belter was great fun, because that was an invented accent. When I met the coach, he said: “We’ve got three levels. It’s like a curry: mild, medium and spicy.” I decided to go for the most extreme, spicy version, because my character was supposed to be the original Belter. Crozier was interesting because he was Anglo-Irish, and identified strongly with the crown. We don’t know what that accent would’ve sounded like, so we settled on something that sounded like someone who had an aspiration towards being accepted by English society, but was still Irish.View image in fullscreen‘An angry man’ … Jared Harris as John Lennon and Aidan Quinn as Paul McCartney in Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s Two of Us from 2000.Photograph: Aaronson/Falk/Vh1/Viacom/Kobal/ShutterstockDid you become more of a John Lennon fan after playing him inTwo of Us?GoobdroogI wouldn’t say I became more of a fan, because I was born in 1961 just before the Beatles released their first album. People were upset by our version of John Lennon because, by this time, he’d become the voice of the peace movement, but he was also an angry man who could be violent and had a massive chip on his shoulder. So I got a lot of flak from Beatles fans who didn’t like the version we were presenting.Favourite pub?Galdove19I used to go and have a drink with my dad at the Coach and Horses at the back of Covent Garden. They have really good Guinness. It’s also the place where my father had his last fight. It was summer. He was sitting outside having a pint. My father would have two sorts of interactions with Irish people. One would be very positive. The other, they’d say: “What the fuck have you ever done for Ireland?” He was having the second interaction with this Irish woman and lost his patience.View image in fullscreenRichard Harris at home with his sons Damian and Jared, February 1966.Photograph: Stephan C Archetti/Keystone Features/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesHe said: “I can forgive many things. I can forgive ignorance, because that’s not your fault. That’s the fault of your education. I can forgive bad manners. Again, not your fault if your parents just didn’t bring you up properly. But the one thing I cannot forgive is ugliness, and you’re the ugliest woman I’ve ever seen in my life. Now fuck off.”So she goes inside, gets her boyfriend, who comes out and says [does Irish accent]: “You called my girlfriend ugly. Stand up if you’re a man.” So dad sucker-punched him and knocked him out. He was on the floor, cracked his head, and the girl started jumping up and down, going [does Irish accent]: “Dickie Harris has killed me boyfriend! Dickie Harris has killed me boyfriend!” Dad wasn’t sure what had happened, so he grabbed his Guinness and chucked it in the guy’s face, which brought him round immediately. But he was a big boy and Dad knew that he wasn’t going to win round two, so he leapt into a taxi and took off.If you hadn’t done the acting, what would have been your ideal gig?CaptainLibI think about that all the time. It’s a bit late now. I’m the middle child, so I was always arguing with my brothers, so my parents thought I might make a good lawyer. I was very shy, and still am in some ways. When I went to Duke [University in North Carolina, to study drama] and started acting, my mother came down and saw me, and said to my dad: “You should go see him. He is very good.” And he said: “Well, youwouldsay that, you’re his mother.”Watch a trailer for Brave the Dark, starring Jared HarrisHe wouldn’t come down to see me in anything until after I graduated and I stayed behind in the summer to do Entertaining Mr Sloane. I’d made a movie as well while I was at Duke. He watched the film in the afternoon and saw the play in the evening. He was fully prepared to tell me: “Forget this acting lark. It’s not for you.”Jared Harris: ‘What do I dislike about my appearance? Everything. I have a weird eyebrow, red hair, freckles … ’Read moreI’ll never forget the look on his face when I met him afterwards: the joy that there was this thing that he loved that he had a whole new shared area of dialogue, interest and conversation. Those are some of my best memories: sitting around a table with him.

The Gunner’s Dream (1983)Low on memorable tunes, big on racked, strangulated lead vocals, possessed of a worldview that makes every otherPink Floydalbum look like a gushing font of Pollyanna-ish optimism, The Final Cut is a slog. But The Gunner’s Dream cuts through the gloom, thanks to a heartbreaking, fragile melody.19. Wot’s … Uh the Deal? (1972)Overshadowed by the albums that preceded and followed it, Obscured by Clouds might be the most underrated release in Pink Floyd’s catalogue: it boasts fantastic instrumental experiments, musical signposts to The Dark Side of the Moon and, in Wot’s … Uh the Deal?, a beautifully careworn, Beatles-y ballad undersold by its daft title.18. Grantchester Meadows (1969)View image in fullscreenIn the pink … Nick Mason, Dave Gilmour, Rick Wright and Roger Waters in 1968.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesThe studio half of Ummagumma is a mess – a band audibly searching for direction without success – but it contains one unequivocal triumph: Roger Waters’ evocation of the parkland on the banks of the River Cam, its pastoral calm spiked with a curious sense of menace, as if something nasty is lurking in the undergrowth.17. Cymbaline (1969)The More soundtrack throws up everything from proto-heavy metal and mock-flamenco to bongo solos. But Cymbaline – soaring choruses, Rick Wright-heavy coda – is both splendid and oddly prescient: “Apprehension creeping like a tube train up your spine” sounds like a Dark Side of the Moon lyric that arrived four years too early.16. Louder Than Words (2014)The final track on The Endless River,the final Pink Floyd studio album is, by some distance, the best song of their post-Waters era: it’s elegiac and gorgeous, and Polly Sampson’s lyrics touchingly suggest that the band’s music will ultimately drown out the members’ vitriolic public rifts. Brilliantly, a few years after it came out, they started slagging each other again: plus ça change.15. Fat Old Sun (1970)The choral experiments of Atom Heart Mother’s lengthy title track might have attracted the most attention, but its highlight was tucked away on side two, a sighing, utterly lovely slice of very, very English late August melancholy that sounded like country rock by way ofParker’s Piece.14. Run Like Hell (1979)Rocking out was never really Pink Floyd’s forte – see 1969’s hopelessly leaden The Nile Song for proof – but Run Like Hell is the exception that proves the rule: powerfully claustrophobic and paranoid, driven by a relentless disco-facing beat and David Gilmour’s echoing guitar (inspired by the cellos on the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations).13. Brain Damage/Eclipse (1973)View image in fullscreenPink Floyd play the Merriweather Post Pavilion, Columbia, Maryland, June 1973.Photograph: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesDespite his departure in 1968, Barrett seems to haunt Dark Side of the Moon’s concluding medley. The eerie, nursery rhyme-like verses of Brain Damage sound distinctly Barrett-esque; the lyrics allude to his decline. The song is also oddly equivocal: Eclipse’s epic climax is undercut by the Abbey Road studios doorman Gerry O’Driscoll grumbling “there is no dark side of the moon, really”.12. Dogs (1977)Animals is a tough but potent listen: its relentlessly bleak, contemptuous tone is as much an expression of mid-70s malaise and frustration as punk was. Dogs embodies the album’s grim mood – screeching synths disrupt the quieter sections, the lyrics are a tirade of misanthropy and hopelessness – and its glowering power: Gilmour’s guitar solos are particularly blazing.View image in fullscreenA 40ft-long inflatable pig suspended between two of the chimneys at Battersea power station, London, during a photoshoot for the cover of Animals, 6 November 1976.Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images11. Jugband Blues (1968)The original Pink Floyd’s last stand, a dark coda to the summer of love, and the sound of LSD’s psychological wreckage washing up in rock for the first time. Barrett delivers a depiction of his own mental disintegration in a chillingly dead-eyed voice, a Salvation Army band erupts into free-form mayhem: it’s both disturbing and extraordinary.10. Us and Them (1973)Based on a Wright piece rejected from the soundtrack of Zabriskie Point for being “too sad”, the tone of Us and Them is utterly defeated: the chorus feels like someone trying to rouse themselves into action before sinking back into a crestfallen torpor. But it’s also exceptionally beautiful, making dejection exquisite.9. See Emily Play (1967)People who saw the original iteration of Pink Floyd live often claim their studio recordings were too poppy to do them justice. But that scarcely matters when the pop songs were as original and creative as See Emily Play – the psychedelic experience crammed into three fabulous minutes, a definitive summer of love artefact.8. One of These Days (1971)After a few tentative years, Pink Floyd 2.0 finally found their footing on Meddle, something the band members clearly realised: built around Waters’ echo-laden bass, there’s a thrillingly brawny, confident swagger to opener One of These Days. If you want to hear Depeche Mode paying homage, head to Violator’sClean.7. Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun (1968)The most obvious sign that there was life after Barrett on A Saucerful of Secrets, Set the Controls … was long, partly improvised, hypnotic (and a huge influence on the nascent Krautrock scene), but resolutely not music to relax and float downstream to: it’s too creepy and unsettling.6. Shine on You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5) (1975)Pink Floyd are synonymous with intra-band rancour, but they once worked perfectly as a sympatico unit. The lengthy instrumental intro of Shine on You Crazy Diamond is a masterpiece of scene setting: Wright’s keyboards and Gilmour’s mournful guitar perfectly fix the mood for the arrival of Waters’ bereft lyrics.5. Astronomy Domine (1967)Barrett’s psychedelic Pink Floyd at full power: they sound raw and visceral, like a garage band from Mars. Barrett’s guitar playing is astonishingly inventive, the lyrics spew out references to planets, comic books and Shakespeare in a lysergic gush: it’s nearly 60 years old and it’s stillincrediblyexciting.4. Echoes (1971)The post-Barrett, pre-Dark Side Floyd’s uncontested showstopper, Echoes was essentially an array of musical fragments painstakingly pieced together, although you’d never know: from its icy intro to a triumphant finale, its 23 minutes flow effortlessly. The guitar playing is lyrical and expressive, the downcast verses beautiful, the ambient interlude creepy: it’s got the lot.3. Comfortably Numb (1979)It sold 30m copies, but The Wall still divides opinion: alienated masterpiece or insufferable monument to rock star solipsism? But everyone seems to agree on Comfortably Numb: its movement from wistful (but vaguely menacing) verses into a blissful (but faintly unnerving) chorus is exhilarating, and the cathartic guitar solo is a wonder.2. Time (1973)It’s hard to pick a highlight from Dark Side of the Moon, but Time is the song that packs the biggest emotional punch. A mediation on ageing written by a man still in his 20s should feel callow and speculative; instead, the lyrics of Time become more impactful the older you get.1. Wish You Were Here (1975)As simple and direct as 70s Pink Floyd got, which might explain why it’s been covered by everyone from Sparklehorse and Thom Yorke to the metal band Avenged Sevenfold and – yes! – Susan Boyle. Or perhaps it’s because, from its opening riff to its closing guitar-and-scat-vocal solo, it’s an incredible song. Waters’ lyrics are deeply personal – addressed to Barrett, they first ponder whether he might have made a mistake in retreating from music, then collapse into sighing remorse – but there’s an affecting universality to their sense of loss and regret. There’s also a warmth and empathy noticeably absent in Pink Floyd’s subsequent work.Explore more on these topicsPink FloydRankedRoger WatersDavid GilmourPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In particular, it was the images Steele-Perkins took in West Belfast during the Troubles that Radden Keefe was drawn to.These images, taken from a tour of Northern Ireland in 1979, included a selection fromthe Divis Flats. The notorious Republican stronghold was the last place Jean McConville was seen alive before she was executed by the IRA for being an alleged informant.View image in fullscreenChris Steele-Perkins at a Magnum meeting in London, 1994.Photograph: Peter Marlow/Magnum PhotosThat murder and its fallout is at the centre of Radden Keefe’s award-winning book Say Nothing, and after the death of Steele-Perkins he wrote that the photographer’s shots of the flats where the story began had been a “huge source of inspiration”.You can see why. Cars are burned out, kids play on a makeshift rope swing, poverty is evident, but often his subjects have smiles on their faces that add a disarming layer to the story that seems toundermine the official narrative. For a writer, trying to bring the past to life, Steele-Perkins’ images were like gold dust.I had a similar reaction to Steele-Perkins’ work when I was writingWe Were There, my cultural history of Black Britain in the Thatcher era. The photographer, who was born in Burma before moving to the north-east of England as a toddler, spent time with Black communities in Wolverhampton, where he was sent for a Sunday Times story, alongside writer Gordon Burn, to cover the town whose MP Enoch Powell had delivered the notoriousRivers of Blood speecha decade earlier.Like the Divis Flats images, that series draws back the curtain on a community often presented as being synonymous with criminality and violence. “It wasn’t the easiest story,”he told the Guardian. “These were slightly pissed-off youth, and they weren’t dying to hang around with me.” But he persevered, capturing raucous church services, football games and sound system crews. When I was discussing cover designs and artwork for my book, one Chris Steele-Perkins image from Wolverhampton kept coming up in conversation.View image in fullscreenPoetry in motion … Wolverhampton Disco, 1978.Photograph: Chris Steele-Perkins/MagnumIt’s an image taken from a dancehall in 1978. In it Steele-Perkins captures poetry in motion, as three women move to the music and a huge soundsystem frames them in the background. Steele-Perkins chose it ashis favourite shotand it’s one that resonates with many people, capturing just what it’s like to be in a dance.I looked at that photograph dozens of times when writing a chapter about Wolverhampton and the emergence ofthe Blk Art Group in the city during the early 1980s. One of the original members of the group, Claudette Johnson, later used it as the basis for a painting called Blues Dance in her solo show atthe Courtauld in 2023.Steele-Perkins was always drawn to the hidden aspects of a community; to what went on behind the headlines. Speaking about his series in West Belfast, he once said: “I was interested in how life was lived in its various facets, not just the rioting and the military occupation, though I couldn’t ignore that which was so prevalent, but also the leisure, the entertainment, the homes, the fun, the funerals and the community. I was not there to illustrate a thesis but to enter the unknown, interacting and responding, and attempting to remain honest.”He took that approach with scenes that sat beyond the mainstream. He spent three years with teddy boys, the groups of young men who emerged in the 1960s with a rockabilly aesthetic and a reputation for violence – especially after their involvement in the Notting Hill race riots of 1958. Despite that reputation, Steele Perkins went into their homes, earned their trust and produced The Teds, an intimate, peerless portrait of the hugely influential subculture.Steele-Perkins’ work has been understandably filed alongside that ofDon McCullin, who was also able to find humanity amid deprivation and conflict. But he was also part of a wider group of artists, public intellectuals and writers who were – though not officially connected – actively producing a counter-narrative to mainstream media in the chaotic 1970s and early 1980s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He joined the ranks of Magnum, the prestigious – and historically white – agency in 1979 (becoming a member in 1983 and going on to serve aspresident from 1995 to 1998). He also produced a well-received bookThe Pleasure Principle, that surveyed the country’s lurch rightward toward individualism and consumerism during the Thatcher era.He also went far beyond the shores of Britain. Steele-Perkins travelled and photographed Afghanistan and Zimbabwe before settling with his second wife, Miyako Yamada, in Japan, where he continued to work, producing the booksFuji and Echoes.Yamada announced the news of his death on Instagram. “His life as a photographer has been exciting, rewarding and enriching,”she wrote. “Thank you very much.” We should all be thankful for the enrichment he brought to worlds that otherwise would have remained unseen.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyNorthern IrelandcommentShareReuse this content"

Clutch monogrammed hankies for period-appropriate eye-dabbing. After 15 years on our screens, the Downton Abbey saga is about to hop in its vintage Rolls and drive off into the soft-focus sunset. The third and final film spin-off,Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale, is released this Friday, accompanied by a forelock-tugging farewell ITV documentary.For six series, Downton bestrode the Sunday night schedules like a Grade II-listed colossus. Writer Julian Fellowes’s upstairs-downstairs creation followed entitled aristos and their salt-of-the-earth servants at a fictional country pile. Sure, the dialogue was clumsy, the plots soapy and the historical exposition clunked like a stately home’s antique radiators. Yet somehow, it didn’t matter.Downton was watched by an estimated 120 million people worldwide. It won three Golden Globes, four Baftas and a whopping 15 Emmys, becoming one of British TV’s most successful exports of all time. Film sequels soon swept into cinemas, knocking over popcorn buckets with their bustles and grossing almost $300m (£222m) at the global box office.Now, like the crumbling dream of aristocratic England it portrayed, it’s coming to an end. But what were the haw-hawing highlights? And what were the tweed-clad low points? Come with us as we ask our underpaid but grateful butler to pass the best claret and press rewind …The five bestMatthew Crawley’s smashing ChristmasAcross three series of sherry-sipping, pearl-clutching and low-stakes plotting, Downton had established itself as one of the cosiest treats on TV. So it came as a sucker punch at Christmas 2012 when Fellowes made the nation choke on its Quality Street. Mere hours after wife, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), had given birth to a son and heir, Matthew and his floppy fringe were devastatingly killed off in a car crash. As his vintage motor lay upside down in a ditch, the camera festively lingered on his lifeless eyes and pooling blood. Roll credits. Actor Dan Stevens went on to big things in Hollywood, but the Scrooge-like plot twist became known as “How Downton Ruined Christmas”.Everything theDowager Countessever said“Don’t be defeatist, dear, it’s very middle class.” Downton’s defining character was tart-tongued diva Violet Crawley, brought to owl-like life by the lateMaggie Smith. Her innocent inquiry of “What is a weekend?” will go down in toff TV history. The pampered posho’s haughty face-pulling and delicious line delivery were a weekly highlight. Her pince-nez would pop off at a cutlery-based crime. Her nostrils flared in horror at some ghastly commoner’s etiquette error. Even her last words were positively Wildean, telling a blubbing lady’s maid at her bedside: “Stop that noise, I can’t hear myself die.”Lady Mary’s Turkish delightYou’d think actor Theo James – him of White Lotus douchebag pedigree – could handle himself in a sex scene, but 15 years ago, the virgin Mary quite literally shagged him to death. James popped up in series one as Turkish diplomat Kemal Pamuk, who stopped off at Downton after a peace conference. During a scandalous night of passion with the Earl of Grantham’s eldest daughter, Pamuk dropped dead from a heart attack. A spot of nocturnal corpse removal helped hush it up. Fellowes has admitted that the plotline was pilfered from real life. “That was completely true,” he said. “A guest had smuggled in a man who then had a heart attack. They carried this dead body the length of one of England’s great houses, got him into his right bed and the story never got out.” What a way to go. Downton legend has it that the ghost of Mr Pamuk still haunts the back passage.Romance below stairsThose toffs upstairs are all very well, but it’s the plucky plebs who provided the show’s heart and soul. Downton devotees grinned ear to ear when romance blossomed between honourable valet Mr Bates (Brendan Coyle) and loyal lady’s maid Anna (Joanne Froggatt). The couple had all manner of black-clad misery heaped upon them – murder trials, rapes, miscarriages, gratuitous limps – but lower-class love conquered all. Their cockle-warming arc was surpassed only by the Remains of the Day-style slow-burn courtship between butler Carson (Jim Carter) and housekeeper Mrs Hughes (Phyllis Logan). This was further improved by a comical prenuptial subplot where Mrs Hughes roped in cook Mrs Patmore (Lesley Nicol) to find out if Carson expected their union to be consummated. Cue a barrage of ye olde euphemisms: “Have you fully considered every aspect of marriage? Will she be expected to perform all wifely duties? Do you wish her to share your, er, way of life?” Carson’s eyebrows raised so far they hovered near the chandeliers.View image in fullscreenBrendan Coyle and Joanne Froggatt film a romantic encounter as John Bates and Anna Smith.Photograph: Photograph Nick Briggs. +44(0)20/film company handoutWhen Sybil made us snivelWhen he wrote the script where the youngest Crawley sister died in childbirth, Fellowes confessed that he was “absolutely streaming with tears’’. You and us both, babes. Having boldly crossed the class divide to marry Irish chauffeur Tom “no relation to Richard” Branson (Allen Leech), husky-voiced, gold-hearted Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) gave birth to a baby girl. However, her bumptious father and his fancy London doctor ignored the warnings of village physician Dr Clarkson, refusing to take her to hospital. Sybil promptly died from the complications of pre-eclampsia. Her heartbroken husband named their daughter Sybbie in tribute. Stop it, you’ll set me off again.The five worstWalk, don’t walkShot in the spine and sent home wounded from the first world war, that nice Matthew Crawley was told that he’d be paralysed for life from the waist down and unable to father children. Gasp! What did this mean for dear old Downton’s uncertain future? Fear not, ye of little faith. It was a mere two episodes before Matthew miraculously regained feeling in his legs and instinctively leapt from his wheelchair to help Lavinia Swire (Zoe Boyle) when she tripped over and dropped a tea tray, gallantly catching her as she fell. They should turn it into a NHS treatment.That dog’s derriere on the opening titlesPoorIsis the labrador. Not only did her name become deeply awkward during the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organisation. She was also subjected to the doggy indignity of a lingering shot of her backside on the opening credits. As the Earl of Grantham strode across the rolling grounds towards his stately home, his hound trotted alongside, bum oscillating in and out of view as her tail wagged. Isis was eventually killed off and replaced by an Andrex puppy called Teo, but out of respect, her fluffy derriere remained on the credits. It’s what she would have wanted.Spratt’s entertainmentLady Edith’s main function was to be unlucky in love and live in the flapper girl-shaped shadow of elder sister Mary. By series five, however, she’d become a career woman. Kind of. As Edith edited a new-fangled magazine in “that” London, society was abuzz with speculation about the identity of its anonymous agony aunt Cassandra – a sort of proto-Lady Whistledown from Bridgerton. Who lay behind this mysterious nom de plume? In a camply implausible development, step forward the Dowager Countess’s bumbling butler Septimus Spratt (Jeremy Swift) – a sort of male Mrs Overall with a face like a wet weekend in Whitby. Who else? It’s a wonder Spratt found time for moonlighting, what with his interminable feud with lippy lady’s maid Mrs Denker (Sue Johnston).O’Brien gets her ladyship in a latherAlong with scheming footman Thomas Barrow, evil lady’s maid Miss O’Brien (Siobhan Finneran) was the hiss-boo panto villain of the early series. Her most dastardly trick was the literal stuff of soap opera. Under the misapprehension that she was about to be sacked, O’Brien slyly planted a wet bar of carbolic soap on the floor beside her mistress’s bath. Pregnant Cora Crawley (Elizabeth McGovern) slipped on it and miscarried. O’Brien, in her defence, did appear full of remorse for a scene or two, before normal devious service was resumed. Sadly, it’s also the last mildly interesting storyline that Cora got.SpewBonnevilleDinnertime gore-fests are more traditionally associated with Game of Thrones. But anything Westeros can do, the landed gentry can do more ludicrously. There had been clumsy foreshadowing of Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) having stomach problems, with the peaky patriarch grumbling about “a bit of indigestion”. Nobody expected a scene worthy of The Exorcist. During a dinner for visiting health minister (and future PM) Neville Chamberlain, the Earl’s ulcer burst and he projectile-vomited blood all over the dinner table and assembled guests. While the Earl was carted off for emergency surgery, diners daintily wiped scarlet spatter off their pearls and tiaras, before sending for another pot of Mrs Patmore’s coffee. Has Vanish stain remover been invented yet, my lordship?Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale is in cinemas from Friday 12 September.

Judging by tonight’s audience, you will have a hilarious night. If you are not a fan of the TV series, which ran from 2005 to 2011, there are very few reasons to see this stage version.Writing for the Guardian in 2008,Ben Myers claimed“Ideal is the best British comedy show on TV”. People who love cult shows, really love them. That is palpable in Salford, where creator Graham Duff set the series, and the Lowry is the perfect location to premiere the show ahead of a national tour. You feel the love when the audience applaud and laugh at the lights coming up on the set of Psycho Paul’s “business” headquarters, the entrance of Cartoon Head, the entrance of Psycho Paul, the entrance of Johnny Vegas as Moz, the lights coming up on Moz’s flat … you get the picture. At times it’s like being at a live studio recording.‘We were the runt of the litter at the BBC’: Johnny Vegas and Graham Duff on resurrecting their sitcom IdealRead moreFor the uninitiated, the show has a simple premise: unambitious weed dealer Moz sells his product to a trail of miscreants and misfits visiting his Salford flat. Duff, who wrote all the episodes of Ideal for TV and played the sexually voracious Brian as he does again here, has previously spoken of his hopes for a final series that never came to pass.In this new story, Moz is now living with his girlfriend, Liza (Lucy Farrett), in a flat that takes up half the stage. The other half is the lair of Psycho Paul and Cartoon Head, where they dismember bodies for a charge. Tania (Emma Fryer) turns up with a body she needs disposing of. But the plot isn’t really the thing here.There are a couple of decent jokes, including one about the clitoris being a concept album while “tits are the hits”, but Duff’s clunky direction and the lack of narrative drive make this a piece of theatre that is essentially a nostalgic victory lap for the creators and fans – and not a great deal for anyone else.AtLowry, Salford, until 13 September.

It’s their first time playing together since a mysterious reported row between David and Nigel in 2009 brought the Tap bandwagon to a halt.‘Our songs last three minutes but they feel like an hour’: the return of Spinal Tap – an exclusive that goes up to 11!Read moreAnd to paraphrase the Smiths: that joke is still funny … it’s not too close to home and it’s not too near the bone … but it is close, and you might have to work a little bit harder to remember how you felt the first time you saw the original. There’s lots of good stuff here, some witty reboots and reworkings of gags from the first film and sprightly update appearances from minor, half-forgotten characters currently residing in the “where-are-they-now?” file. (It’s sad not to see Anjelica Huston as Stonehenge designer Polly Deutsch, however.) And the single biggest laugh is a line right at the end about Bruce Springsteen.What I didn’t anticipate about this film is how very sad it would make me feel. It was normal back in 1984 to call the characters inSpinal Tap“ageing” rockers. Now, well, they really are ageing. We all are. There is a kind of poignancy and melancholy in Tap II that perhaps wasn’t entirely intentional. The amount of perspective is excessive. Yet one thing that also weirdly emerges or re-emerges from this follow-up is the realisation that: yes, the guys playing Tap (and co-writer and director Rob Reiner) really were and are good musicians and their pastiche rock compositions are very effective and accomplished.The situation now is that the band’s late manager Ian Faith (played by the late Tony Hendra) effectively bequeathed his IP rights in the band to his grownup daughter Hope (Kerry Godliman). She is now legally forcing the band to get back together for a cynical payday, a reunion supposedly lubricated by advice from slippery promoter Simon Howler, played by Chris Addison. Nowadays, Nigel lives in rural England with his young wife (Nina Conti) managing a guitar and cheese shop and playing heavy rock in an Irish folk band at the local pub. Derek runs an antique glue shop (sort of the same jokes as Nigel’s shop), while David is in California, where he composes award-winning incidental music for true-crime podcasts and corporate on-hold messages.The band are forced back into each other’s company with film-maker Marty DiBergi (Reiner) once again on board – and what grumpy old geezers they are. Helpfully, a couple of real-life rock megalegends also want to get involved with the Tapaissance – about whom the band are amusingly ungrateful. Some of the lines don’t exactly come off: the Simon Howler character is a bit broad and Derek’s attempt to hit on their new female drummer, played by Valerie Franco, is icky. (Nigel himself once asked what’s wrong with being sexy? But this is unsexy in the wrong way.) Nevertheless the Stonehenge-centred finale is a positive Tapocalypse.Spinal Tap II: The End Continues is out on 12 September in the UK and US, and on 25 September in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekComedy filmsMusic documentarySpinal TapThis Is Spinal TapPop and rockHarry ShearerreviewsShareReuse this content"

To make things even more confusing, in Parks and Rec, his ex-wife Tammy, who he can’t stand, is played by his actual wifeMegan Mullally.Many of his other great roles have been on TV: his performance in HBO’sThe Last of Us, as a misanthropic survivalist who finds queer love and happiness in the post-apocalyptic world, was critically acclaimed as one of the series’ best. He was similarly great in 2020’s Devs, which explores the choice between free will and AI.Offerman’s film career took off in parallel, with roles in Sin City, Miss Congeniality 2, 21 Jump Street and as Potus in 2024’s Civil War. He’s voiced characters in both Lego Movies, Ice Age: Collision Course and Hotel Transylvania 2. This year, we got to see him play a US army general who [spoiler alert!] sacrifices himself to help Tom Cruise save the day in Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, and voice Papa Smurf’s brother, Ken, in Smurfs.Offerman now appears in crime thriller Sovereign, based on the2010 West Memphis police shootings, with Dennis Quaid alongside, as well as Mullally. He also has a new book out in October, Little Woodchucks: Offerman Woodshop’s Guide to Tools and Tomfoolery. So please get in your questions below by 6pm on Monday 15 September and we’ll publish his answers in Film & Music and online.Sovereign is on digital platforms from 15 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewTelevisionThe Last of UsNick OffermancalloutShareReuse this content"

He will appear in The Tempest and, alongside Oscar winner Helen Hunt, in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard at the RSC next summer.Branagh, 64, began to build a reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation when he played Henry V, aged 23, in a 1984 season that included roles as Laertes in Hamlet and the King of Navarre in Love’s Labour’s Lost. The following year he wrote and directed the play Tell Me Honestly for the RSC. Branagh went on to both direct and star in acclaimed Shakespeare productions during an illustrious stage and screen career that has included breaking an Oscars record as the first person to be nominated in seven individual Academy Award categories. The Tempest will mark his first role for the RSC since he played Hamlet in 1992 and 1993 (first at the Barbican in London and then in Stratford), directed by Adrian Noble.The Guardian’s Michael Billington, who predicted “a rich Shakespearean future for this young actor” in his review of Henry V, wrote that in the role of Hamlet, Branagh captured, “as well as any actor I recall, a deep sense of filial love”. He continued: “This is a fine Hamlet, stamped with rueful sadness, that should dispel any doubt about Branagh’s staying power.”View image in fullscreenKenneth Branagh in the film Henry V in 1989.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyThe Tempest was the first play Branagh saw as an audience member in Stratford, when he sat in the gods for a 1978 production starring Michael Hordern, David Suchet, Alan Rickman and Ruby Wax. In 2012, wearing a top hat in character as the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Branagh delivered a speech by Caliban from The Tempest (“the isle is full of noises”) at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games in London. He will now take on the part of the magician Prospero, who gives the famous “Our revels now are ended” speech, in what is billed as an “epic new staging” of the shipwreck drama directed by Richard Eyre and with a set design by Bob Crowley. The Tempest begins previews on 13 May in the Royal Shakespeare theatre.It will be followed, in the smaller Swan theatre, by The Cherry Orchard, which opens in July. Branagh will play Lopakhin alongside Hunt as Madame Ranevskaya in a new version of the play by Laura Wade and directed by Tamara Harvey, who runs the RSC with Daniel Evans. Wade and Harvey are frequent collaborators and recently teamed up for a new version of Somerset Maugham’sThe Constant Wifein Stratford. Hunt, who played Viola in Twelfth Night on Broadway in 1998, was last on stage in the UK inEureka Dayat the Old Vic in 2022.View image in fullscreenJoanne Pearce as Ophelia and Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet at the Barbican theatre, London, in 1992.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMark Gatiss will also appear with the RSC next year, making his debut for the company in the lead role of a Chicago mobster, modelled on Hitler, in Bertolt Brecht’s political satire The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui. Stephen Sharkey’s version of the play will be directed by Seán Linnen in the Swan from April to May. Gatiss called it “Brecht’s most accessible and dynamic work … The play is always timely but to say it’s urgent now is an understatement. With fascism on the march everywhere, the story of how a washed-up nonentity like Hitler could seduce a nation and become the most powerful dictator in the world serves as a terrifying warning.”The RSC’s spring season includes, in the Other Place (its third stage in Stratford), actor Martina Laird’s debut as a playwright, Driftwood, about capitalism and colonialism in Trinidad. The play, which was the runner-up for the 2024 Verity Bargate award, will be directed by Justin Audibert and will transfer to the Kiln theatre in London. Also in the Other Place, Rachel Bagshaw will stage a new version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, edited by Robin Belfield, that will move to Stratford after its run at the Unicorn theatre in London.Explore more on these topicsTheatreKenneth BranaghRoyal Shakespeare CompanyWilliam ShakespeareHelen HuntMark GatissnewsShareReuse this content"

RTÉ is also deeply concerned by the targeted killing of journalists in Gaza, and the denial of access to international journalists to the territory, and the plight of the remaining hostages.”The decision will raise questions about its duty to be impartial as a public service news organisation.Slovenia’s national broadcaster, RTVSLO, has also said it will participate in next year’s contest only if Israel is not involved.This week the Spanish culture minister said Spain should not take part either. In an interview with the Spanish TV programmeLa Hora de la 1 on Monday, Ernest Urtasun said: “We asked for Israel to be expelled from Eurovision [earlier this year],” he said.The Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna next May and is the world’s second biggest TV event, with more than 160 million viewers.However, protests in the last two years in Malmö and Basel have forced the organisers in Geneva to offer broadcasters who feel strongly about the war a way out.Normally broadcasters have to tell the EBU by October whether they will take part or not but this year the deadline has been pushed to December, with a consultant appointed to work with broadcasters on a way forward, and a potential vote on Israel’s participation.Broadcasters, including RTÉ and the Nordic TV stations, normally start their selection contest in the autumn, which puts management under pressure now.Martin Green, the director of the song contest said: “We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We are still consulting with all EBU members to gather views on how we manage participation and geopolitical tensions around the Eurovision song contest … It is up to each member to decide if they want to take part in the contest and we would respect any decision broadcasters make.”Israel’s national public service broadcaster, Kan, threatened with privatisation by Benjamin Netanyahu amidaccusations it is too leftist,has already decided it will take part.Urtasun added: “What I can say is that if Israel takes part, and if we don’t manage to get it thrown out, then we’ll have to take steps [such as withdrawing]. I don’t think we can normalise Israel’s participation in international forums as if nothing’s happened.”In May, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called on Israel to withdraw from the Eurovision song contest, saying it should be held to the same standards over the war in Gaza as Russia has been over the invasion of Ukraine.Sánchez, one of the most outspoken international critics of Israel’s war in Gaza,stepped up his rhetoric on Monday, accusing Netanyahu’s government of “exterminating a defenceless people” by bombing hospitals and “killing innocent boys and girls with hunger”.The Guardian has asked more than 20 broadcasters whether they would participate. Many, including the BBC, have referred the question back to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).The Spanish broadcaster RTVE said it would not comment on whether it would participate.Stefán Jón Hafstein, the chair of Iceland’s national broadcaster, RÚV, told reporters it would not be making a decision until the consultation process was over.The Finnish broadcaster YLE said it was “fully focused” on the process of finding a song and started the process in August.Johanna Törn-Mangs, the director of culture and factual content at YLE, said the contest was “an important event for both the Finnish music industry and audiences” but Gaza was in their minds.“The humanitarian situation in Gaza is tragic, and we sincerely hope for an end to the suffering as soon as possible. Israel’s participation in Eurovision has been a significant topic of discussion in Finland,” she said.Swedish broadcaster SVT said it was in touch with the EBU.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionIsraelIsrael-Gaza warEuropeIrelandSpainSlovenianewsShareReuse this content"

I never intended to retire, really. I just stopped doing that particular type of work so I could do some other work.”He added: “Apparently, I’ve been accused of retiring twice now. I never meant to retire from anything! I just wanted to work on something else for a while.”Day-Lewis announced his retirement from acting in 2017after the release ofPhantom Thread, a film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson in which he played a dress designer. In a statement at the time his representative said: “Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor … This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.”Day-Lewis previously “retired” from film acting between completing The Boxer (1997) and starring in Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York (2002) – part of which time he reportedly spent working as an apprentice for celebrated Italian shoemaker Stefano Bemer. In 1989,he appeared to quit stage acting permanentlywhile performing as Hamlet at the National Theatre in London.View image in fullscreenDaniel Day-Lewis in 2017’s Phantom Thread, which he said ‘left me feeling hollowed out’.Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarHowever, the prospect of working with his son on a film project appears to have spurred him to return. Day-Lewis said: “As I get older, it just takes me longer and longer to find my way back to the place where the furnace is burning again. But working with Ro, that furnace just lit up. And it was, from beginning to end, just pure joy to spend that time together with him.”He added: “It was just kind of a low-level fear, [an] anxiety about re-engaging with the business of film-making. The work was always something I loved. I never, ever stopped loving the work. But there were aspects of the way of life that went with it that I’d never come to terms with – from the day I started out to today.”First trailer released for Daniel Day-Lewis’s comeback film, AnemoneRead moreDay-Lewis has won a record three Oscars for best actor, for My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln, and was nominated for three further times, for In the Name of the Father, Gangs of New York and Phantom Thread. Anemone is due to receive its world premiere at theNew York film festival in September.Referring toPhantom Thread, Day-Lewis said: “There’s something about [the acting] process that left me feeling hollowed out at the end of it … I understood that it was all part of the process, and that there would be a regeneration eventually. And it was only really in the last experience [of making Phantom Thread] that I began to feel quite strongly that maybe there wouldn’t be that regeneration any more. That I just probably should just keep away from it, because I didn’t have anything else to offer.”“But looking back on it now – I would have done well to just keep my mouth shut.”Explore more on these topicsFilmDaniel Day-LewisPhantom ThreadnewsShareReuse this content"

It follows a fall in spending by wealthy collectors amid growing geopolitical and trade tensions in recent years.Sotheby’s also took a hit from hefty payouts for what appeared to be the departure of just a handful of staff. Severance costs last year jumped to $29.2m, compared with $11.4m in 2023, despite its headcount only dropping by 24 employees to 2,218, according to findings first reported by the Financial Times.Losses at John Lewis and Waitrose owner almost triple to £88mRead moreThe company, whichoperatesin 40 countries, was founded as a rare book dealer in 1744 by London bookseller Samuel Baker and did not enter the world of fine arts until the early 20th century, opening an office in New York in 1955 as the US market became increasingly important.As well as auctions of art and books, it has expanded into areas including wine, diamonds and also a financial services arm that funds art deals and makes loans secured against collections.Sotheby’s was later snapped up by Drahi,who took the company private in a £3.7bn deal in 2019. The French-Israeli businessman, a keen art collector, has since struck a deal with Abu Dhabi’s third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, ADQ, to help raise about $1bn for the company’s turnaround, in exchange for a 24% stake.While Drahihas come to greater public prominencethrough his interest in the art world, the bulk of his wealth derives from his founding of the Amsterdam-listed telecoms firm Altice, which he built up via a string of acquisitions of smaller companies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s soapy, highly dramatic and wonderfully campHannah J DaviesThu 11 Sep 2025 16.55 EDTLast modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 21.31 EDTShareThe Newsreader is the best kind of period piece in that it makes you reflect not only on the past but on the present. The first two seasons of this Australian drama about rival newscasters managed to cram in some of the biggest events of the 80s: the Challenger disaster; the Aids crisis; rumours of the end of Charles and Diana’s marriage.As well as seeing the impact those stories had on the world, the series hinged on some perennial themes, too – women being sidelined in the workplace; homophobia; mental illness; and what drives people to stay in their jobs even when everything around them is dripping with toxicity. To watch The Newsreader in an age of boundaries and therapy-speak is to feel at once privileged not to be working in broadcast television in the 1980s, and acutely aware that many of the problems still persist today. As unsettling as it is, the programme has often been excellent: I have a suspicion that if this were a US series, it would be a smash hit.We arrive at this third season – the show’s last – already well acquainted with Helen Norville (Anna Torv) and Dale Jennings (Sam Reid). At the end of season two we saw Helen depart for the US to cover the 1988 election, leaving her ex-partner and co-anchor Dale to helm the News at Six alone. (Sadly, we don’t get to see Helen in action in Washington, although we do see her during a detour to the UK, where she reports on the Lockerbie bombing.)View image in fullscreenRed carpet … a deliciously camp first episode features the biggest night in Aussie TV.Photograph: BBC/Werner Film Productions/Lionsgate/EOne/Jane ZhangThe first episode is a wonderfully camp, highly dramatic affair, as she and Dale reunite at the biggest night in Aussie TV, the Logie awards, alongside Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan (whose presence is added here via archive footage). Of course, things are only briefly jovial: Helen has been offered a new TV gig with a 6pm slot, putting her in direct competition with her old team. Torv is masterly as a woman consumed by rampant guilt and furious ambition, while Reid is excellent as the once puppyish Dale, trying his best to live up to his newfound popularity as the country’s “King of News”.The Newsreader is an ambiguous title for a reason and, at different points throughout this season, we see Helen and Dale respectively triumph as the media personality of the moment. When one is on the up, the other tumbles further into despair.For Reid, that means digging even deeper as he conveys Dale’s increasing isolation. His struggle is twofold; on one hand, he is a queer man trying not to get outed by his colleagues – or the press – and on the other, his constant self-policing leads him to be branded by some viewers as rigid and fake. Meanwhile, Torv conveys Helen’s fraying mental health and frequent helplessness with raw sensitivity, even if the writers took far too long to get this character the help she so desperately needed. They are a joy and a misery to watch in equal measure, but if you have any qualms about scenes that hinge on severe mental illness, self-harm and substance abuse, you should steer clear.From Mindhunter to Newsreader: Anna Torv on how she chooses her next roleRead moreWhile those two central performances – and much of the cast – remain powerful, I’m not convinced this season sticks the landing. The final episode sees Dale descend into an increasingly catatonic state, only to walk straight on to the set of the News at Six to deliver a bulletin. The joy of The Newsreader is that it has always felt a little soapy, but sometimes it is just absurd.Conversely, the final scenes are bland and uncomplicated, as though they came from another show altogether. I also wish we had more time with Noelene (Michelle Lim Davidson), the News at Six producer who defects to Helen’s new show and masterminds an exclusive on the Tiananmen Square protests, and who later struggles to balance motherhood with her boss’s nonstop demands. There is so much more to delve into with her story, as both a working mother and a Korean Australian, wrestling with feeling unseen by her white husband and former co-worker, Rob (Stephen Peacocke).Despite all this, I’m really going to miss this show. To spend three seasons in the company of Helen and Dale is to consider what being a good friend and a loyal colleague truly means, especially when your line of work is corrosive to your sanity. It’s not the most newsworthy season – but don’t switch over quite yet.The Newsreader aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer in the UK.

Not for the kinds of truths that Amin, the scruffy protagonist of Hossein Asgari’s second novel, Desolation, holds dear. He accosts a young Iranian-Australian writer in an Adelaide cafe and announces that he has a story for him: “It’s atruestory, not one of those made-up, pointless whatever it is that you people write.” The writer is sceptical – “I have no interest in a true story, if such a thing exists” – but he listens.The writer is never named and Amin is not the stranger’s real name but, over a series of meetings in parks and cafes, Amin tells the writer his story. The bulk of the novel follows Amin’s life in post-revolutionary Iran, in the aftermath of the war with Iraq, and is narrated in the third person by a writer. But which one? Asgari is an Iranian-Australian writer who lives in Adelaide and he dares the reader to identify him in or with the narrative. Desolation flirts with the narrative conventions of autofiction but has loftier preoccupations than the relationship between the author and narrator. During one of their last meetings, Amin tells the writer: “You can add whatever you want to my story as long as you’re telling the truth even when you lie.”A storyteller who lies in service of truth and a writer who doesn’t believe in true stories: this is the framing for Desolation, a bleak and digressive coming-of-age story. It is inhabited by many doubles, starting with Amin and the writer, and the plot is advanced through a puzzle of nested stories and coincidences, further bedevilling a reader inclined to factcheck its truths. Our storytellers are unreliable, both because they are forgetful and because they are untrustworthy and changeable; dreams, religious belief, romantic rapture and a capacity to be transformed by art keep the characters from a rational grasp of the world and hold Desolation at one remove from realism.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWe follow Amin through his adolescent infatuation with his neighbour Parvaneh, whose family exudes bourgeois cosmopolitanism. He becomes fascinated by western culture and develops a half-formed ambition to travel to the west to study, inspired by his older brother Hamid.But the sudden, violent death of Hamid ruptures this reverie. Hamid died in an event that the reader can factcheck: the obliteration of an Iran Air flight in 1988 by a US guided missile, an accident that killed 290 people. Amin, in his grief and inchoate rage, experiments with new identities and renounces the dilettantism of his illicit dalliances with Parvaneh.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His rage, his new friends tell him, is holy. Amin is unconvinced – yet he is drawn against his doubts to meet an al-Qaida official in Pakistan. The hand of fate deals the naive young man another disastrous suite of coincidences and explosions, and he must eventually flee Iran.This is the weary man, a compound of grief and desire, his rage exhausted, who confronts the writer in the cafe. He has been a student, a restaurateur, a businessman and, finally, he moves to Adelaide where he “started doing the one thing that made sense to him: nothing.” Asgari thus presents Amin as the quintessential Dostoevskian antihero.Desolation plumbs themes of exile and alienation explored by another novelist and close reader of Dostoevsky based in Adelaide:JM Coetzee, whose influence is apparent in the novel’s style, which is at once sparse and richly suggestive. It’s exciting to read a new work of Australian fiction with such an ambitious agenda, one that eschews the received tropes and facile morality of so much contemporary literary fiction. As the title of this novel presages, the ironies of Desolation are bitter indeed and, if there are lessons to be learned, none of them offer redemption.Readers who seek a documentary account of life in Iran in the late 1980s and early 1990s may be disappointed by Desolation, a stylish novel concerned with truths that exist beyond the grasp of the historian, and indeed the factchecker. It is a work preoccupied with love, truth and the cruelty of fate. This, by implication, is the kind of inquiry that can only be undertaken by storytellers and, as such, Desolation is an accomplished affirmation of the necessity of the novelist’s craft.Desolation by Hossein Asgariis out now (Ultimo Press, $34.99)Explore more on these topicsFictionAustralian book reviewsAustralian booksIranFyodor DostoevskyJM CoetzeeMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

I Love You, Byeee is the follow up in which he remembers his late mother, Valerie, and reflects on his TV career which began with him landing a job at Takeover TV, a showcase for new talent on Channel 4, where he brought in his childhood friend Joe Cornish.Fans of The Adam and Joe Show will find reminiscences about the pair’s toy movies, where they recreated films such as Titanic andTrainspotting, and their radio shows on XFM and 6Music. Buxton is candid about the strain of their working relationship and his feelings of insecurity when Cornish went off to direct his first film,Attack the Block,without him.Buxton’s audiobooks tend to do extremely well, in part due to the author’s chatty, self-deprecating style that is fun on the page yet transmits more effectively in audio. His vocal delivery is warm, whimsical and underpinned by a gentle melancholy. But key to their success is the way that Buxton approaches them less as a straightforward narration than a fully fledged sound project, using similar features to those on his pod, The Adam Buxton Podcast. Along with his trademark songs and jingles (which could be annoying but are not), I Love You, Byeee has two bonus chapters. The first is an essay on the author’s love ofDavid Bowiethat was cut from the book, and the second is a bracingly honest conversation between Buxton and Cornish in which they recall the highs and lows of their friendship.Available via Mudlark, 10hr 13 minFurther listeningBless Me FatherKevin Rowland, Penguin Audio, 11hr 19minThe Dexys frontman’s blunt memoir looks back on his religious childhood, his troubled relationship with his father, his meteoric rise to fame and his tendency to self-sabotage when things are going well.

He is effectively given sanctuary, but also imprisoned in the unpoliceable, unknowable quarter that, like Polanski’s Chinatown, is a place that baffles and thwarts the imperial powers-that-be.It was a film remade by Hollywood in 1938 as Algiers, which was the debut ofHedy Lamarrand made a huge star of its French lead Charles Boyer, who is much sleeker and more conventionally photogenic than Gabin (but forever stuck with the misquoted line: “Come with me to the Casbah…!” always being purred by nightclub comedians). Algiers in turn inspired Michael Curtiz’sCasablanca, so these crooks, thieves, perspiring cynics and romantic stoics, all going slowly stir-crazy in the exotic, orientalised underbelly of north Africa, can all be traced back to Pépé le Moko. (Marcel Dalio, who played Casablanca’s croupier, is in Pépé le Moko as the slippery snitch L’Arbi.) It is a film of intense poetry; translated into the American context, the story looked noir-ish in ways that aren’t in the original.Gabin was known for his tough, blue-collar image and uncompromisingly everyman face, but here, at the age of 33, he looks feline and almost dandified. In the Casbah, Pépé runs a motley gang taunting the law; his favourite acolyte is young hothead Pierrot (Gilbert Gil) but he is always having trouble with resentfully mutinous Carlos (Gabriel Gabrio), an odious, envious figure who beats his girlfriend Tania (Fréhel). She is later to have a heartbreaking moment as she sings sadly, remembering her youth.Pépé’s girlfriend is Inès (Line Noro), with whom Pépé is now openly and ungallantly bored; she reminds him of the Casbah while he sees himself as a metropolitan sophisticate – a Parisian through-and-through. Chekhov’s three sisters did not yearn for Moscow more intensely than Pépé dreams of Paris. So when he meets a bewitchingly beautiful Parisian called Gaby (Mireille Balin), travelling in Algiers with a pompous sugar-daddy champagne merchant, there is instant spark. Local cop Inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux) shrewdly sees how Gaby can be used to tempt Pépé out of his hiding place. Slimane surmises how Pépé’s boredom and rage and lust can be his undoing, but also his death-wish, his need for a magnificent excuse to launch himself into a hostile, fatal world, and his despairing need to have done with an existence whose sweetness is long gone.The Casbah is elegantly fabricated on a replica set, with its amusingly bizarre place names like Inadequacy Street. It is in this place that Pépé is for the locals a rumour, or ghost, or legendary hero; in reality, he has little or nothing to do all day but play cards with his compadres.As for the film’s potential as a political parable, it is unavoidable. Pépé’s sanctuary is a result, or perhaps a symptom of the tensely balanced political situation between the imperial master and its possession, which has to be kept calm. Perhaps Pépé is a symbol ofFranceitself, trapped in its colony, a place it doesn’t understand and doesn’t want to. Duvivier contrives some marvellous poetic and romantic moments, with faces rendered dramatically in closeup – especially Pépé’s final anguished cry to Gaby which she cannot hear. It is powerful, muscular film-making, one of the great romantic dramas.Pépé le Moko is at the Institut Français, London, from 12 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersFranceWorld cinemaAlgeriaAfricaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It appears to be a metaphor for racism and capitalism, for exploitation and for the historically hidden violence built into the foundations of ownership. Yet how exactly the metaphor works is unclear; it is like a labyrinth in which characters and audience can get disoriented. The final shot shows someone reading Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth. I found myself thinking ofZadie Smith’s essay on Jordan Peele’s Get Outin which she references Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks.The setting is the 90s, in which half-heard stories on the TV news about Rwanda and OJ have an unstressed racial dimension. We are in Sag Harbor in New York state, a neighbourhood with strong African American community: Corey Hawkins plays a troubled black man called Charles Blakey who lives alone in a handsome but neglected house which has been in his family for eight generations. Charles nursed his late mother and uncle there, but rashly took out a loan against the property; and now, unable to get a job due to a question mark over his honesty and unable to make the mortgage repayments, he may lose this roof over his head. A local antiques expert Narciss Gully (Anna Diop) tells him his late mother’s possessions might be worth a good deal, especially her collection of west African masks, but the cash could take some time. Charles needs money now.And it is at this moment that a mysterious, charmingly persuasive yet sinister white businessman called Anniston Bennet, potently played byWillem Dafoe, shows up at his door, offering him $50,000 in cash in return for renting his basement for a couple of months. Charles feels he has no choice but to agree, and to allow Mr Bennet, and his strange luggage into his home; an arrangement which is to lead to a nightmarish psychodrama.The story feels like a supernatural horror or a ghost story, and yet doesn’t conform to either. There are plenty of moments when Charles has nightmares, but the ordinary reality into which he awakes now feels like a queasy bad dream. Bennet seems to want to confront Charles in some way, to taunt him, to mock him, to exult over him – and all from a strange position of ostensible weakness, as Charles’s tenant-slash-prisoner on whose money Charles is now dependent. The position of white and black is reversed. Or is it? Mr Rochester had his madwoman in the attic; Charles has his white paying guest in the basement. It’s an eerie, disquieting experience.The Man in My Basement screened at the Toronto film festival; it is in cinemas from 12 September and on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK from 26 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsWalter MosleyWillem DafoeRacereviewsShareReuse this content"

A housewife activist fulminating against sin, she backed forcefully into the limelight while cooing that she was just “a grandmother who collects pebbles for a hobby”.Why gift her another moment in the spotlight? Homophobia and evangelical legislation have newly sharpened teeth, so Caroline Bird’s witty new play feels timely, as it peers under the bonnet of the campaigner’s self-promotion and asks what it feels like to be running on moral conviction.Bird’s Whitehouse often sounds like one of Victoria Wood’s redoubtable monsters, twinkling about ramekins and pebble-dashed with prejudice. In her salmon pink turtleneck, slingbacks and jazzy two-pieces (“The gays were not expecting that”),Maxine Peakeis all homely chuckles, her toes tapping as her rhetoric revs up. She’d be camp if she weren’t so adamantine, and if Bird didn’t take her so seriously.Whitehouse campaigned against porn and Howard Brenton’sThe Romans in Britain, but the play circles her views on homosexuality andprivate prosecutionof Gay News for a blasphemous poem (“He does WHAT to the dead body of Christ?”).Samuel Barnett, swathed in 1970s shades of mushroom and mustard, plays all the supporting roles, confronting Whitehouse with a succession of distressed parents, conflicted gay people and strong-viewed women.View image in fullscreenShades of mushroom and mustard … Samuel Barnett plays all the supporting roles opposite Peake.Photograph: Helen MurrayVisiting Margaret Thatcher, Whitehouse runs a doubtful finger over the Downing Street sideboard but receives a cold shoulder after hauling out a tupperware of sex toys (“Do you know what a butt plug is?”). The Tories don’t need a crank to devise Section 28. Other encounters, hinging on maternal tension, briefly wobble Whitehouse’s world view: her mother’s boho reinvention and an interview with the Guardian’sJill Tweediethat stumbles into fraught revelation.‘The one thing it doesn’t have is actual sex’: the new Mary Whitehouse play that would have infuriated Mary WhitehouseRead moreIt’s an ample play, in Sarah Frankcom’s steady-paced production – you sense that scenes were shuffled to fit so much material. Despite Peter Butler’s deft period costumes, you can’t ignore the contemporary tang of intransigent conservatism and its strange persecution complex.Tears and pained confessions can’t dent Whitehouse’s sense of purpose.

Cow | Deer, an hour-long “experiment in performance”,co-created by director Katie Mitchell, writer Nina Segal and sound artist Melanie Wilson, is a sort of theatrical rewilding as the Upstairs stage is given over to a summer’s day in the life of a heavily pregnant cow and a young roe deer.Past productions at the Court have featured live animals, including half a dozen goats (eponymous stars ofLiwaa Yazji’s play) and a scene-stealing goose (in Jez Butterworth’sThe Ferryman). Here, the pair’s presence is instead painstakingly felt through myriad foley sound effects and field recordings. Standing at hay-bale desks, a cast of four – Pandora Colin, Tom Espiner, Tatenda Matsvai and Ruth Sullivan – get to work making noises with natural materials and manmade objects: gravel and tinsel, raffia and rope, a hot water bottle and a watering can. Plants and herbs are ground up throughout, their scent slowly filling the room.As in Mitchell and Wilson’s version of Rebecca Watson’sLittle Scratch(a human’s day in the life), there is often a comical sense of cause and effect in the ingenuity on display. The birth of a calf is done with a balloon, pak choi and handcream. But all of these identifiable ingredients are transformed into something far greater in a stunning sound design and, like the best puppeteers, these performers bring huge empathy for the lives they convey. Espiner’s expressions alone, during the birthing scene, are extraordinary.View image in fullscreenGreat empathy … Pandora Colin (left) and Ruth Sullivan in Cow | Deer.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellThis co-production with the NationalTheatreof Greece is described as a listening experience and you are invited to close your eyes and relax if you so choose but I found that diluted it. Watching the quartet, who at times affect animal-like movements (fists become hooves, a mop is swished like a tail), you adopt not just their shared sense of concentration in the act of creation but also an alertness akin to the animals’ own vigilance.‘We spent a week on the cow birth!’ The eye-opening play about animals with sound effects instead of wordsRead moreThat’s necessary because you need to work hard to keep up. It takes a while for the play’s magic to take hold. You adjust to a landscape where everything and nothing is happening at once, and to a plot with its own dramatic tension and matters of life and death, but only the most subdued murmur of language. I craved a little more signposting along the way. This animal’s-eye-view never shifts your perspective with quite the moxie of Tim Crouch’s talking dog inToto Kerblammo!but it is exquisitely evocative, bolstered by the inventive angles of Prema Mehta’s lighting and Alex Eales’ thicket-like design.More than 10 years have passed since Mitchell directed the scientific lecture2071here, calling for collective action against climate catastrophe. Terrifyingly little has been achieved since. That production sounded the alarm with facts and figures. Cow | Deer, with its sinister roars of transport representing human incursions on the natural world, is far more emotive for placing us in earshot of a fragile ecosystem. And the calf’s birth could be the most captivating stage scene of the year.At theRoyal Court, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreKatie MitchellRoyal Court theatreAnimalsClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the first half, all seven of these teen-and-twentysomething siblings get their moment: on the piano,Isataplays some contemplative Liszt and Jeneba plays Chopin;Shekuand his cellist sister Mariatu duet smoothly in Handel; violinists Braimah and Aminata are paired for a Welsh folk tune; pianist Konya accompanies Braimah in Elgar’s Sospiri; and so on. It’s also a tribute to their grandparents’ heritage, their Welsh grandmother getting the biggest musical nod with two folk song arrangements plus Hiraeth, a sweetly yearning original composition by Isata for all seven players. Nothing is mawkish or over milked, yet everything feels a little like a final encore, sending us out misty-eyed.View image in fullscreenThe Kanneh-Masons: River of MusicPhotograph: DeccaThe second half is taken up by an old family favourite, Schubert’s Trout Quintet. Here Isata, Sheku and Braimah are joined by their friends Edgar Francis and Toby Hughes, on viola and bass, for a performance that’s occasionally sparky but mostly gentle and a little monochrome. It doesn’t match up to some stiff recorded competition – but perhaps that’s not really the point. River of Music reinforces the Kanneh-Masons’ inspiring brand, but maybe next time they will give us something a bit more ambitious.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Good – I don’t!” Cheerful, barefoot and sparkling in sequins, Belinda Carlisle is walking her infatuated audience down memory lane. Each song on this greatest hits tour comes with a timestamp and a story, and right now she’s introducing Mad About You, the 1986 single that transformed her from a member of record-breaking all-female rock band the Go-Go’s into a glossy solo pop star with the love songs to match. Tonight, as back then, Carlisle’s distinctive, shivering vibrato finds a streak of hedonism inside its lyrics about dizzy infatuation.This show hits shuffle on the big singles and key album tracks that Carlisle and her smiley five-piece band have been touring for years, and it opens with real attack: the title track of 1989 album Runaway Horses is earthy and elemental, Carlisle blasting big rock “whoa-oh-oh”s over punchy drums and a juddering riff. She clearly delights in performance, camping it up and pretending to faint during I Get Weak, and swinging an imaginary lasso for the moody, loosely psychedelic Circles in the Sand. An uncertain start to La Luna briefly breaks the spell, but when Carlisle is in full power, it’s as if a wind-machine is always blowing in her direction.Heaven Is a Place on Earth is an obvious finale, but it’s a credit to Carlisle and band that its magnitude doesn’t overshadow the rest of the set. We start slow, delaying that soaring, perfect chorus by cutting straight to the verse, and when Carlisle eventually roars that gravelly, pre-key change “I’m not afraid, anymore!” it sounds like the mantra to her varied, fearless musical career.A stuffed encore doubles down on proving that there’s much more to Belinda than Heaven. Slinky, silly Big Scary Animal, the Go-Go’s don’t-kiss-and-tell Our Lips Are Sealed, co-written with the Specials’ Terry Hall, and the rock’n’roll, heartfelt Live Your Life Be Free make a decent calling card for a Glastonbury legends slot. In August, she released a covers album and tonight closes with The Air That I Breathe, popularised by the Hollies – but it’s not needed. Carlisle’s own voice, and legacy, are fascinating enough.AtApollo, London, on 12 September, andApollo, Manchester, on 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Around them, as well as rows of football shirts from leagues all over the world, are PCs and monitors with staff watching feeds of the matches. The people playing are from EA’s Design Council, a group of pro players, influencers and fans who regularly come in to play new builds, ask questions and make suggestions. These councils have been running for years, but for this third addition to the EA Sports FC series, the successor to EA’s Fifa games, their input is apparently being treated more seriously than ever.The message to journalists, invited here to get a sneak look at the game, is thata lacklustre responseto EA Sports FC 25 has meant that addressing user feedback is the main focus. EA has set up a new Player Feedback Portal, as well as a dedicated Discord channel, for fans to put forward their concerns. The developer has also introduced AI-powered social listening tools to monitor EA Sports FC chatter across various platforms including X, Instagram and YouTube.View image in fullscreenEA Sports FC 26 – Manuel Neuer pulls off a save.Photograph: Electronic Arts“There were too many disparate groups working on feedback across EA – making it overwhelming for individual teams on the game,” says lead producer, Joel Doonan. “Now we’ve really focused on, how do we make sure the people who need to know what players are saying are getting the right information at the right time with the right amount of detail so they can be as agile as possible?“There’s also been a shift in the proportion of the team’s resources devoted to addressing feedback. We have a continuous development team – 10 engineers solely dedicated to actioning feedback now rather than waiting for FC 27. I think that’s the expectation of players today – the speed at which live service games action on feedback is a heck of a lot faster than it was a handful of years ago.”The major change is a genuine surprise – there are now two completely different play styles to choose between: competitive and authentic. The former is all about speed, fluidity and high goal counts, capturing the turbo-charged pinball-style play of classic Fifa titles while removing real-world elements such as player fatigue. That one is aimed squarely at online competitive modes such as Ultimate Team and Clubs. Meanwhile, the Authentic mode is more of a pure simulation aimed at offline players, with slower buildup play and realistic outcomes.View image in fullscreenEA Sports FC 26 – Rush StadiumPhotograph: Electronic Arts“We had the desire to do this for some time, but we were prioritising other areas,” says gameplay production director, Sam Rivera. “Now however, it’s very clear, based on feedback, that with one single gameplay experience it’s impossible to please the different communities. Some want simulation, some want a more responsive experience where you perhaps have more control over the players instead of the AI helping you with certain behaviours. That creates a skill gap. Obviously maintaining two different game styles is more complex – it’s not just sliders, it’s actual code changes that create different outcomes depending on which different style you’re playing. But we’re in a more appropriate position now to support both in a way that’s close enough to the needs of different communities.”Dribbling is tighter, slicker, with a greater degree of directional freedom for the player. When you get into a scoring position, there’s a new option that lets you tap the shoot button twice to get a powerful low shot, rather than hoofing the ball into row Z. Goalkeeping has been improved with smarter positioning (via new reinforcement learning AI) and better shot-stopping, cutting down the number of times that the ball is punched right back at the attacking player. Similarly, defensive tackles will result in fewer rebounds, but in counterbalance, attacking players have a better ability to shield the ball, especially Enforcer players (think Haaland or Mbappé) will be able to use their body strength to hold off opponents.It seems the development team has been looking at other modern games and genres for inspiration. A new Archetypes feature for the Clubs and Player Career modes, lets you design and build players from 13 different types (with names such as Magician, Recycler and Boss), which work a lot like character classes in role-playing adventures, allowing you to earn experience points and upgrade the player’s stats throughout their career. Elsewhere, the Manager Live Career mode, which lets you guide a head coach across multiple seasons, draws from live service games such as Fortnite. There will be weekly challenges throughout the year, which could set objectives such as being at the top of the league at Christmas. Some might be inspired by unpredictable events from the real-life sport. During our demo presentation, career mode design director Pete O’Donnell points to an interesting example – the food poisoning outbreak that hit Italian Serie-B team Salernitanaat the close of last season. Couldyourteam cope with a diarrhoea epidemic before a crucial playoff match?The game’s most popular element, Ultimate Team, is getting a range of new features. The controversial Panini sticker-style fantasy football mode, where participants build teams by opening randomised digital packets of players which then compete online, is getting a live tournament mode, where linked competitions run for the whole season. A new feature called Bounties provides players with randomised challenges such as “score the first/last goal” or “keep a clean sheet” to ensure even if they lose an online match, they still get rewards. Gauntlets, meanwhile, are quicker live events where competitors must play a series of five matches, each with different players from their squad, so that nobody can just endlessly rely on the same superstar cards.It feels like this focus on user feedback is a well-timed PR exercise as much as a genuine design directive. The recent launch trailer for the game made a big deal of concentrating on in-match footage rather than eye-catching cinematics – the message being, “we’re listening to you, please stick with us”. The timing is vital too. In June, Fifa launched the casual mobile title Fifa Rivals and is sure to be working with developers on a more in-depth footie simulation, possibly in time for the men’s World Cup next year. EA Sports has had this arena to itself for several years, but maybe not for long. Fans were lukewarm about EA Sports FC 25 – their support may soon be more important than ever.EA Sports FC 26 is launched on PC, PS5, Xbox and Switch, 26 September.Keith Stuart attended a press trip to EA Sports Vancouver with other journalists.

So sue me – it’s been hot. Mercifully, though, temperatures look to be dropping soon, so we can once again cup the bowl of a wine glass without worrying about it getting a little warmer as its aromas unfasten.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To help us wean ourselves off sprightly rosés and buttery whites, let’s turn our heads to easy-drinking reds – and none are more easy to drink or of the moment than Portuguese red blends. These wines are uniquely indicative of the country’s winemaking history, with more than 250 native grapes (some of which have different names from region to region), but I’d wager that many of us wouldn’t be able to name many more than two of these indigenous varieties. To start with there’s the sumptuousbaga,touriga nacional(widely considered to be Portugal’s fine red grape variety) andcastelão, which yields a variety of styles, but that’s just a handful, and it’s very likely you’ve drunk one or all of them before.Why, then, are Portuguese single varietal wines (that is, those featuring only one type of grape) so hard to come by? There are a few reasons for this. First, so-called “vineyard” or “field blends” are so common in Portugal because old vines of different varieties are often planted side by side, rather than separated by type, as in most commercial vineyards. It’s therefore the norm here to make blends, which is a far easier option than the painstaking process of separating harvests or even replanting entire vineyards.Then there’s the fact that most drinkers simply aren’t as familiar with Portuguese grape varieties as they are with those of other countries. Sinéad Murdoch, sommelier atnomadic London restaurant Tasca, has worked four harvests in the country, and has consistently put its field blends on her lists over the years, so why does she think they’re so popular? “Customers are now used to seeing the words ‘field blend’,” she explains, “while Portuguese wine has boomed in the UK thanks to its great value and to tourism, but most people still aren’t familiar with the native grapes, which can put them off. If I list a wine as 100% baga, only a few curious guests are likely to ask about it, because most customers pick a red they know. When it’s a blend, however, people say they love a Portuguese blend and it flies off the shelves!”They’re also brilliant value: “Modal Wines, for instance, sells a tinto blend bag-in-box to restaurants that works out to about £7 a bottle, which is a no-brainer for an easy-drinking and also delicious wine.”Four Portuguese reds to pique your interestSainsbury’s Taste the Difference Portuguese Lisboa Red Wine£7.75, 13.5%.A spicy and full blend of syrah, touriga nacional and tinta roriz.No 1 Douro Valley Reserva Quinta da Rosa Portugal£15 Waitrose, 13.5%.

Once out of the oven, but still sealed, the scented steam trapped in the paper returns to liquid and creates a brothy sauce.Fishwith firm white or pink flesh that breaks into fat flakes is particularly well suited to cooking al cartoccio, both whole fish (cleaned and on the bone) and individual filets (estimate 110g-140g per person).When choosing fish, keep in mind our collective default to cod and haddock, both members of the so-called “big five” that make up a staggering 80% of UK consumption. Instead, look out for other species, such as hake, huss or North Sea plaice, ASC-certified Scottish salmon, sea trout or farmed rainbow trout. For more detailed and updated advice, the Marine Conservation Society producesan invaluable, area-by-area good fish guidethat uses a five-tiered system to rank both “best choice” and “fish to avoid” based on the species, location and fishing method. Also, don’t forget how well fish freezes, so always check the frozen food section, too.Typical seasonings for fish cooked al cartoccio are lemon, parsley, olive oil and salt, maybe a dash of dry vermouth or wine, which, when combined, produce a wonderful, fresh-tasting broth. A change, and a seasonal, summery variation is to sit the fish on segments of fleshy sweet tomatoes, which (especially if the tomato is peeled and the seeds flicked away) collapse into an almost-sauce reminiscent of puttanesca, along with olive oil, slivers of garlic, small black olives and capers or caper berries. I also like a few fennel seeds or feathery fresh fennel fronds, which add a pleasing, aniseed note, if you like that sort of thing.To protect the precious juices, I lift the pouches on to plates and let everyone open their own, but not without a warning that the steam can puff out quite aggressively. Once everyone has carefully tipped everything on to their plate, pass around buttered potatoes, rice, couscous or toast rubbed with garlic and olive oil; mayonnaise or aïoli is also great here.The other day, I made aïoli according to Alastair Little, which was also a reason to pull his book, Keep It Simple, off the shelf. He is an advocate of the food processor for aïoli, with one egg yolk and two crushed garlic cloves for every 300ml olive oil-sunflower oil added in a steady stream, plus lemon juice and white pepper to taste. It’s an emphatic sauce for a steamy braise.Fish baked with tomatoes, olives and capersServes41 large, fleshly beefsteak tomato4 tbspolive oil2garlic cloves, peeled and thinly slicedSalt and pepper4 x110-140gfillets firm-fleshed white fish(eg cod, bream, hake)4 parsley sprigs16olives2 tbspcapersFennel seeds, or feathery fennel fronds, to taste (optional)100mlwhite wineHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and prepare four squares of baking paper measuring 23cm.Peel the tomato by covering it first with boiling water for two minutes, then dunking it into cold water, at which point the skin should pull away. Cut the tomato into 12 or so segments, then discard the seeds and any white bits.Rub the centre of the four pieces of paper with olive oil, then put a couple of segments of tomatoes in the middle of each one. Insert a sliver or two of garlic into the gaps, sprinkle with salt and top with a tablespoon of olive oil. Lay the fish fillets on top of the tomatoes, then top each one with a sprig of parsley, a couple of bits of tomato, a few more slivers of garlic, a few olives, capers, fennel seeds or fronds, if you want, some salt and pepper, and a little more olive oil.Lift up two opposite edges of the paper and fold over, crunching the edges to form a long, sealed pouch. Lift the pouches on to a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork and the tomatoes are very tender and sauce-like.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeFishSeafoodMain courseItalian food and drinkVegetablesTomatoesrecipesShareReuse this content"
