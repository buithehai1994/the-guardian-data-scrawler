We attached it to the side of our fence with a handful of peanuts on top. Few sights are guaranteed to lift my day more than watching a “dining in” Nutkin parking its rump on the tiny wooden seat, occasionally glancing towards the house as if he’s waiting for you to bring the drinks. If you don’t have as much time on your hands as my husband did during lockdown, you can buy one on Etsy.Watching news bloopersMaybe it’s the moment BBC reporter Gemma Dawson signs off the evening bulletin with an affectionate “good boy” instead of “good night”. Or the time Texas news anchor Cynthia Izaguirre trails the next item with these immortal words: “Right after the break, we’re going to interview Erik Weihenmayer, who climbed the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, but … he’s gay … I mean, excuse me, he’s blind.” It’s hard to pick a favourite, but watching reels of news bloopers is virtually guaranteed to have you in stitches in a matter of seconds, whatever the day’s thrown at you. There’s something about the total breakdown of strait-laced formality that feels particularly hilarious, like getting the giggles in school assembly. A tonic I’d recommend for everyone – with the possible exception of Jeremy Hunt.A shared playlistLike most people, I’m in more WhatsApp groups than I care to count. Staying on top of the flood of banal banter and mediocre memes can feel like a full-time job. But one set of messages I actively look forward to: my Add to Playlist group. Based on the BBC Radio 4 show of the same name, the concept is simple: each morning, someone adds a song to our shared Spotify playlist that in some way follows on from the previous day’s track. Then, they take to WhatsApp to explain the link. There are 20-odd people in the group and most of them I don’t know that well. Our musical tastes are diverse, and as a result in the past few months I have been exposed to dozens of songs by artists I’d never heard of. Some brilliant, some horrendous, but that’s not even really the point. The excitement of a new track appearing on the playlist, and the subsequent discussion on the group chat, is the highlight of my day.Joining a choirIn 2012, I saw a poster in my village about a women’s choir, no necessity to be able to read music. I pitched up a little nervously on the first night – along with 41 others – and have been going every Thursday since. To start with, it was a fun, social evening with a number of people I knew and a lot I didn’t. However, when my partner became terminally ill, Thursday evenings became a lifeline for me, a chance for time for myself. I could chat to my singing friends if I wanted to, but mainly I could lose myself in the music. For a few pounds a week, I have an evening of fun, friendship and a good old vocal workout.A regular run with friendsI had done Couch to 5k several times, but never seemed to keep it up. Once I made it to the end of the programme I invariably stopped and had to start again some months later. I am not a natural runner and needed something to keep me going, so I enlisted a few of my oldest friends to join me for our localParkrunevery Saturday. Over time, this little ritual has morphed into something else entirely, so that the running is almost a sideshow. These days, we run and talk, and retreat afterwards to someone’s house for fresh coffee and breakfast, and chat about the week that has passed. We have talked through illnesses, grief and work crises. One of our number was suddenly made redundant after 25 years. Several parents have passed away. The world seems to be in perpetual meltdown. But somehow this routine cheers me every week. I still don’t particularly like running, and plod around the circuit at my own snail’s pace, but doing this every Saturday at 9am never fails to lift my mood.An adult swimming classI took swimming classes as a child in Italy and hated them. I was also terrible. Last summer, I injured my achilles and had to take a break from running, so I decided to give swimming another go– and I love it. I go swimming on Wednesday evenings and look forward to it the whole week. It is fun, a good way to socialise with fellow adult learners and is fantastic for mental health. Somehow there is nothing as calming and satisfying as having your head underwater. And surprise, surprise, I don’t suck at it any more.Taking my dog to visit people in hospitalThe small actions that have brought me joy and continue to do so are the loving interactions with Scout, my beautiful, kind and gentle four-year-old golden retriever. Since she passed all the assessments to become a pet therapy dog, we visit a dementia care unit, a hospital and a rest home where she brings much joy – to those we visit and to me, too.View image in fullscreen‘A spontaeous call is more warm and heartening than a text message.’Photograph: Ilka & Franz/The GuardianA random phone call with a palI’ll sometimes find myself staring down the barrel of a long Friday evening alone, too tired from a long week to make plans but also fearful of getting lost in my own anxious thoughts. I’ve found a useful solution: I pick up the phone. Phone etiquette can be fraught and messy – being called out of the blue can feel terrifying, making you panic about what awful news awaits. But I’ve established an understanding with a few friends: we’ll try calling each other randomly, and if the other person is free to chat, we just simply catch up about our lives. This feels much more spontaneous, warm and heartening than text messaging – typing on a screen reminds me too much of my day job, anyway – and diving into another person’s world helps break free from my own.Karaoke with strangersI was feeling exhausted and fed up after long school holidays juggling kids, work and life at 100mph, when someone I’ve met only a couple of times invited me to do karaoke with a bunch of local fellow tired mums. Everyone knew someone, but mostly we were strangers. After two hours of singing pop bangers together on a Sunday evening we all felt invigorated, buoyed up, bonded and determined to do it again. As one woman said: “It’s cheaper than therapy and five times as fun!”Urban walkingWalking costs nothing, gets your heart pumping and muscles moving, and lifts your spirits in no time at all. I remember how calming a hike up the canal was after a day at work that had left me in tears. It doesn’t matter where you are or how beautiful (or not!) the scenery is – even on a daily commute, there are always new sights and sounds, different routes to try, things that catch your eye you never noticed before, stories to tell later. Add headphones and a good book or podcast, and what more could you want?Becoming an IT helpdesk for a dayWhenever I get to see my nana at her house, 300 miles from where I live, I always ask if she’s been having any internet issues. There’s usually something to sort: on a recent visit, I streamlined her Apple ID, showed her how to use Wallet, taught her about malware and convinced her to spend £2 on the paid version of her favourite word games app to avoid the infernal ads (they did my head in after two minutes – she listens to them every day). You get the pleasure of being regarded like Einstein and forgetting your own silly problems for half an hour as you untangle their online knots. And if they’re anything like my nana, you might get cake, too.A trip to the theatreFor me, theatre is pure escapism. There’s something so magical about being in that place, in that moment, with these people: a unique experience that can never be repeated. I felt that most keenly the day my dad died. I was in the foyer when I got the call, but instead of heading straight home, I went on in. I knew I’d feel buoyed up by the brief respite (and that he’d approve – we used to go to that particular theatre together). It doesn’t have to cost a fortune, either: I’m lucky enough to live in London which means I get to see amazing Shakespeare at the Globe for a fiver. Book for previews or first nights, go for tiny theatres that often punch well above their weight, get yourself on mailing lists and investigate ways to save (such as the National Theatre’s Friday Rush tickets). Don’t wait for reviews to come out; trust your gut and if it turns out to be a stinker, well, you can laugh about it later.A cheese toastieOn more than one occasion, I have experienced the mood-boosting powers of a piping hot cheese toastie – preferably bought from an outdoor shack, ideally on the coast. My mindset is often influenced by the weather – I don’t do well in the cold and damp – but a good cheese-pull paired with garlicky, buttery bread turns my temperament around in no time.Smooth out your sheetsIt’s a small thing, but during low periods, forcing myself to wash and iron my bedsheets means that I go to bed feeling as if I have everything together and that things might just turn out OK. On wash days, I’ll have an early night, and the combination of feeling rested and having enjoyed crisp, clean sheets always means that I wake up feeling brighter.Growing anavocado plantI have spent many months at home on sick leave. I walk, read and sometimes write, but I have always been bad at taking care of plants. Last January, I decided to take on the challenge of growing avocados at home from the seed. It took at least five months to see effects. Every day, I looked at them with hope, until one broke and started growing. It is now 80cm tall. After that, I started sprouting mangoes, bought a small kiwi plant, fig and a banana plant, too. The joy of seeing them daily is priceless.View image in fullscreen‘At a dance class, we are moving our bodies, having a laugh and our phones are nowhere to be seen. That’s not just joy, that’s wellness!’Photograph: Ilka & Franz/The GuardianDance classesWhen I signed my six-year-old up to a street dance class last year, I noticed a line towards the bottom of the flyer: “Adult class, 8.30-9.30pm, Thursdays”, at a high school 20 minutes’ drive away. I’ve always been partial to dancing, but I hadn’t attended a class since my school days. I decided to give it a whirl. By 8.10pm on a Thursday, having completed the second shift of the day (kids’ bath and bed battle, after a day’s work) I resist the deep urge to crawl on to the couch and lose myself in a screen … and I never regret it. How can you not feel lifted after an hour’s thrusting to a Five megamix? Plus, the class is full of lovely northern working mums equally delighted to carve an hour out of their weeks for themselves by strutting to a Janet Jackson banger or, my personal favourite, Dirty Cash. We are moving our bodies, having a laugh and our phones are nowhere to be seen. That’s not just joy, that’s wellness! (Even if we occasionally end up in the pub afterwards.)Crochet hats for people in needEver since I learned how to crochet during lockdown, making beanies and blankets has given me great pleasure: it’s creative, mindful and low-stress. But there was a downside: the bags full of half-used yarn cluttering my house. I found myself running out of things to make, or friends to foist crocheted hats on to. Then I found out about a scheme where my local hospital accepted donated crocheted hats and blankets for premature babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. Now the yarn stash is depleted and my hobby has a purpose – and I have the perfect excuse to buy more wool.Watching dog rescuesI’m not a dog person, but I love watching videos by Niall Harbison, who rescues mistreated or neglected dogs in Thailand. Some of the animals are very tough cases, who are understandably terrified and mistrustful of humans – but he always manages to patiently rehabilitate them, often sharing almost unrecognisable footage of them in their new homes (one, Buttons, was adopted by Liam Gallagher). Something about their resilience and softness after unimaginable hardship feels very life-affirming and always puts my own problems in perspective.Cribbage with friendsI know it’s a card game that had its heyday in around 1694, but hear me out. I grew up playing this wonderful game with my Grandpa Len, and however badly my day might have been going, it always turned it around. It is full of archaic rules and turns of phrase: one for his nob if you turn over a Jack!; 15 four and the rest don’t score; and, of course, level pegging – but we spent so many beautiful hours playing it, me moving the pegs on our board as his fingers became arthritic, eventually holding his cards up for him. Then three years ago, I was at a children’s music class when one of the mums happened to mention she was hungover because she’d been playing cribbage the night before. My face must have lit up enough to power the whole electricity grid, because the following week she told me she’d bought a special three-player board (a rarity, to be sure) and asked me to join her and her mate Jen for a game. Now I get to play again every month for a few drinks, way more laughs and a lot of totting numbers up to 15. We even have our own personalised pegs. One of these days I’ll teach my daughter, Lennie, to play, too.Write it all downWhen I’m feeling low I don’t look for a miracle – I lean on rituals. It starts with lists. What began as a way to avoid forgetting groceries slowly became a way to unload thoughts and emotions when anxiety crowds my head. Writing things down on paper feels physically relieving; my narrow, rectangular notepads (I’ve lost count) are like tiny confidants where I store worries to revisit later, calmly – alone, with a trusted friend, or, more recently, with GPTs.Washing my hairYou know how when your phone is playing up, the best thing to do is turn it off and on again? When I wish I could turn myself off and on again, I wash my hair. It’s like a reset button: the shampoo scent, the blast of the shower, the roar of the hairdryer. It’s not really about making my hair look better, it’s about refreshing my mood. It works particularly well in the evening when I’m feeling a bit flat-battery; afterwards, I have more energy and feel more cheerful. Anya Hindmarch wrote a book of life advice called If In Doubt, Wash Your Hair and she is absolutely right. It’s a mantra to live by.Giving brilliant books to othersI cannot make much change in the current political and social state of the US, beyond voting with my conscience and supporting various peaceful causes. However, I help my fellow citizens understand ideas of equity and justice via books that I leave in the Little Free Libraries around my home. If just one person is inspired by a book to be more caring and just, I have done something good.Observing my catsI share my home with two cats that I adore. Amid work and other daily pressures, however, it’s all too easy for them to recede into the background and register as part of the furniture. When I’m feeling frazzled, low or otherwise need a lift, now I make a point of seeking them out and checking in. These moments ground me in the present and wake me up to tiny, rewarding detail. I’m left feeling a renewed appreciation for the life I’ve created and the weird little guys I share it with. They seem to like the attention, too.NightclubbingI know the secret to long-term mental wellbeing is eating well, regular exercise and a rigid bedtime but, in the short term, nothing gets me out of a miserable rut like doing a half-decent attempt at winged eyeliner and spending from two to eight hours on a crowded club dancefloor. And don’t just trust my opinion – they serve a proven biological and psychological need. Studies have shown dancing in unison is so powerful that afterwards people report liking each other more, and if you remove creative movement (ie dancing) from people’s lives their mood drops.A writing groupThere’s an inherent loneliness to writing, particularly when it’s your first book. My writing group was thrown together on a course last spring, and now meet monthly-ish to share how we’re getting on and where we’re stuck. In the past 18 months, I’ve turned up unmotivated, floundering in the weeds, or even ready to jack the whole thing in. And I’ve always left – a couple of wines heavier – reinvigorated, inspired and unstuck, thanks to the clarity that comes from fresh perspectives.Watching clumsy clipsI’ve always loved watching clips of people being injured … but in a fun way. When I was younger my dad once hung up the phone on me because I was simultaneously watching You’ve Been Framed! on the TV and couldn’t stop laughing. I still draw on this secondhand sadism whenever I feel anxious or overwhelmed. I use it to smooth out my jagged brain, staring blankly at my Instagram “for you” page and gorging on compilations of doorbell camera footage showing people falling down their porch steps laden with shopping, for example. Or dogs dragging their owners across their front lawn while chasing a cat. Or men banging their heads on garage doors, or low-hanging flower baskets. What can I say, it soothes me! And yes, before you ask, I do also go to therapy.Watching live animal camsLast year, I lost my six-year-old boxer to cancer. Losing a loyal pet is a specific kind of grief, and not one completely understood by friends and colleagues who aren’t animal lovers. One thing I found helpful was watching live animal cams on YouTube, where you can observe all kinds of creatures going about their daily business, from sea otters to beluga whales to snow leopards. Katmai national park in Alaska even has an annual fat bear week, where the public can vote for their favourite fat bear. How could you not be cheered?Starting a vegetable gardenI’ve never been interested in growing vegetables, because having to learn something new seemed like too much work. I decided to give it a try. The world was on fire and Donald Trump had just gotten elected. I found some tomato, strawberry and lemon cucumber plants locally and bought romaine lettuce and kale seeds at the grocery store. I watched YouTube videos on how to plant. It was surprisingly easy and my garden has been abundant. I’ve been able to meet my neighbours – they love and appreciate the produce and I like connecting with people I may not have otherwise met.View image in fullscreen‘Not only is painting my nails relaxing, but seeing a pop of colour gives my day some fun.’Photograph: Ilka & Franz/The GuardianJazzy nailsI like to paint my nails fun, sparkly colours. Not only is the act of sitting and painting them relaxing, but I work a lot on my computer, so I often catch sight of them out of the corner of my eye. Every time, it’s a little pop of colour and fun in my day. It’s a small thing, but I find these little boosts can add up to something significant.TidyingIt sounds like something guaranteed to make the heart sink, but housework really lifts my spirits. Not the actual doing of it, but the feeling when it’s done. One weekend recently when I felt overwhelmed – desperate to finish a project I’d been struggling with; anxious about a friend’s health; surrounded by mess I’d been too busy to attend to – I thought, right: just get up and get on with it. Headphones on, I set to, catching up on all the cleaning and clearing that had been hanging over me. Only afterwards did I realise just how much it had been dragging me down. Looking around my newly tidy rooms, I felt re-energised and joyful. And all it took was a bit of time and elbow grease.Comfort TV in the bathWhen I need to spark joy I rewatch Grey’s Anatomy in the bath. I like to lie flat with just my eyes peeping out of the water, like a crocodile; I’ve developed a system where I prop my laptop on the toilet seat and angle the screen to 45 degrees, so I can drink in the show without ever having to move my neck. Grey’s Anatomy is a medical drama and it’s intensely action-packed, but it is so melodramatic that it is never truly disturbing: patients die, but they also come back to life, a lot. The characters are constantly curing rare diseases and making paralysed patients walk again, but they also squeeze in lots of hot sex with each other on hospital premises. There is something intensely satisfying about watching all this drama play out while eyeballs-deep in hot water. Technically, I am doing absolutely nothing. But emotionally, I am curing brain cancer with McDreamy, and kissing McSteamy in the rain. I’m about to start my fourth re-watch.Acknowledge a strangerDriving into town during the school rush hour, full of anxiety and dread due to an upcoming meeting, my heart was lifted by a young boy cycling to school. In Ireland we have a culture of “gestures of acknowledgment” that is becoming less common in busy urban areas. However, as I stopped to let this boy cross the road he raised his hand in thanks and nodded briefly as he passed and went on his way. It really cheered me to see this simple but powerful tool of connection being continued in the new generation. I lifted my hand from the steering wheel to acknowledge him in return. And on we went with our respective days, unknown to each other but somehow mattering all the same.TrampoliningIf I’m feeling stressed and lethargic after a long day of working at home, when my kids get home from school I’ll join them on the trampoline for a quick jumping session. It gets my blood pumping and wakes me up again, but more noticeably it lifts my mood. There’s something very freeing about flying through the air and we always end up laughing, playing a silly game and generally having fun together, which is an instant boost.Sowing wildflowersYears ago, when my children were young, we haphazardly strew native wildflower seeds along a rough patch behind our house. Every spring, I delight in watching the mostly annual plants sprout up – each year’s batch is slightly different from the last, and I can easily lose myself looking for insects and butterflies, or counting how many species of native bees I can find. When I’m feeling overwhelmed with the state of the world, a brief stroll through this small spot reminds me of the possibilities of hope and renewal, and lends me strength to continue loving and caring for this beautiful world in which we live.A circuit-breaking poemI get so sick of doomscrolling and have found a way to break the cycle. I go to poetry.org and look at the poem of the day. I’m not a great poetry reader, but having one poem to read a day has been a circuit-breaker that gives me either a bigger or smaller view of life and the world. I am less inclined to go back to news sites and more inclined to get out of my chair. I don’t like all the poems but some have rocked my world. It’s a very happy way to spend 10 minutes a day (even if I cry sometimes).Hits from the 80sFrom Come on Eileen to Cameo’s Word Up – either listening to a playlist or watching a rerun of Top of the Pops – it’s the best tonic on a grey day that transports me back to my youth, and even better if you have some likeminded friends to dance with.A big sandwichIn periods of listlessness, I always turn to a big sandwich: two large obelisks of bread, dangerous amounts of butter, fillings piled high. There’s something about the process of slowly working through a big sandwich, one chew at a time, that brings me back to life. Either make your own (pro tip: a potato rosti or hash brown elevates the thing) or, if you’re feeling particularly devoid of spirit, head to a professional: I’d recommend Cardiff’s longrunning New York Deli, with its giant hoagies and Philly cheesesteaks; or the much-loved Max’s Sandwich Shop in London, whose magnificent Ham, Egg ’n’ Chips sarnie will bring you back to life in a few bites.Sniffing suncreamI’ve pinched this hack from my brother, who keeps a bottle of sun lotion in his work van. On miserable cold winter mornings (usually while he is waiting for the windscreen to defrost), the smell of a little squirt takes him right back to happy memories of the summer.Joining a gymAt age 73, I joined a gym. I’ve been exercising regularly for a year and it has not only made me physically fit, it has significantly reduced my lifelong problems with anxiety and depression. After a workout, the remainder of my day is filled with beauty.Open UniversityEarly in my career, I was feeling very unfulfilled at work and as though I was losing brain cells by the day, so I signed up to an Open University entry to creative writing course. It was all done over email – in the days before Zoom classes became the norm – but the discipline of writing and submitting work, and being marked on it, gave an amazing boost to my confidence, and made me feel as though I was using my brain again, helping me think more creatively in other areas of my life.PenpalsI have a long list of “penpals” who don’t live any great distance from me but whom I regularly write to, which makes me feel connected when sharing the everyday stuff. I love pretty stationery (Cath Kidston writing sets being a particular fave) and have a great collection of stickers and washi tape. I live in rural Lincolnshire so have to go across three fields to post my letters – an added bonus, as the walk makes me feel as if I’m in a Jane Austen novel.Randomchats withstrangers (other than about the weather)Recently in a bookshop I noticed the person in the queue in front of me holding one of my favourite books. Without hesitating I told him what a great read it was. The conversation quickly turned to other books that we each loved and including one that I had just finished, which happened to be by an author he knew personally. It was a lovely spontaneous chat that left us both smiling.Kitchen discosMy husband and I started a new tradition to overcome our empty nest syndrome. One Sunday when I was feeling glum about our (newly) quiet house, he put on Abba’s greatest hits and started disco dancing along to cheer me up. Before long I was in hysterics and now we regularly make time to dance together at home – even if it’s only for the length of a song. One benefit of not having the children at home is that we spare them their embarrassment!Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHealth & wellbeingFriendshipTelevisionFoodWildlifeDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump talks peace but he is a man of warSimon TisdallThe world will be anxious, and rightly so. For a man so bent on a peace prize, Trump appears to revel in conflictSat 3 Jan 2026 09.40 ESTFirst published on Sat 3 Jan 2026 09.07 ESTShareThe overthrow andreported captureby invading US forces of Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s hardline socialist president, will send a shiver of fear and consternation around the world. The coup is illegal, unprovoked and regionally and globally destabilising. It upends international norms, ignores sovereign territorial rights, and potentially creates an anarchic situation inside Venezuela itself.It is chaos made policy. But this is the world we now live in – the world according toDonald Trump.The direct attack on Venezuela marks an extraordinary, dangerous assertion of unfettered US power and comes in the same week that Trump threatened military strikes against another unpopular anti-western regime:that of Iran. It followsmonthsof escalating US military, economic and political pressure on Maduro, including lethal maritime attacks on the boats of alleged drug traffickers.Trump claims to be acting to prevent illegal narcotics flowing into the US viaVenezuelaand to halt an alleged influx of “criminal” migrants. In an echo of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, he is also accused of coveting Venezuela’s huge oil and gas resources – suspicions reinforced by repeated, illegal US seizures of Venezuelan oil tankers.But Trump’s primary motives appear to be personal animosity directed at Maduro, and a desire to revive the 19th-century Monroe doctrine bycreating a US sphere of influenceand dominance throughout the west.Regional leaders, including Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, who has clashed with Trump in recent months, greeted the coup with outrage and alarm; not least, perhaps, because they fear they too could become victims of Washington’s aggressive new hegemony. Cuba’s leftwing government has particular cause for concern. It relies heavily on Venezuela’s regime for cheap energy and political and economic support.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state,has made no secretof his wish to see regime change in Havana. In Panama, too, anxiety levels will be running high. Trump has previously threatened military action there, over control of the Panama canal. Indeed, the reported capture of Maduro recalls the 1989 US invasion of Panama and the toppling and arrest of its then dictator, Manuel Noriega.Authoritarian, anti-democratic regimes around the world will be carefully watching Trump’s next steps, as will Washington’s democratic allies. Iran condemned the coup. It has good reason to be fearful. ButVladimir Putin, Russia’s president, may not be totally displeased by the defenestration of his Venezuelan ally.Trump’s unprovoked resort to violence is not so very different from Putin’s actions in invading Ukraine. Both have illegally attacked a neighbouring country and sought to remove its leadership. For China’s Xi Jinping, whose forces werelast weekpractising military action against the “separatists” of Taiwan, Trump has just set a precedent he may one day gladly follow.Trump’s coup is of great concern to Britain, the EU and western democracies. They should, and must, unequivocally condemn it. It directly challenges the rules and principles of the international order they hold dear. The US has once again ignored the UN and traditional methods of addressing inter-state grievances. And it is acting with apparently scant regard or thought for what happens next in Venezuela.The Caracas government has been decapitated, but other senior members of the regime appear still to be in place. They are urging resistance and, potentially, retaliation against the US. There are unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties. If a power vacuum develops, public ordercould collapse, sparking civil war or a possible military coup. And it is unclear whether the latest US military action has ended, or may escalate further.The idea that exiled opposition leaders, such as the 2025 Nobel peace prizewinnerMaría Corina Machado, will swiftly return and that full democracy will now be restored is naive. The coming days will be critical. And it’s all down to Trump.Trump’s reckless action should finally lay to rest his always misleading characterisation of himself as a “global peacemaker”. It’s high time Keir Starmer and other European leaders publicly recognise him for what he is – a global warmaker, a universal menace.Each time he blunders noisily into conflict zones, such as Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Palestine, setting deadlines, issuing ultimatums, picking favourites and monetising misery, the quest for just and lasting peace is set back.Little wonder peace is elusive. And bizarrely, even while posing as a disinterested peacemaker and non-interventionist, Trump simultaneously wages war on the world. The US conductedrecord numbers of air strikesin the Middle East and Africa last year, surveys show.Since returning to office a year ago, peace-loving Trump has bombed Yemen, carelessly killing numerous civilians after loosening rules of engagement; bombed Nigeria, to counter-productive effect; bombed Somalia, Iraq and Syria; and bombedIran, where he mendaciously exaggerated the success of US strikes on nuclear facilities. He even refuses to rule out bombing Greenland, a sovereign territory of Nato ally Denmark.What’s going on inside Trump’s head? A benign interpretation is that in matters of war and peace, he has no idea what he is doing – no strategy, no clue – and makes up policy as he goes, depending on how he feels.The sinister interpretation says he knows exactly what he’s at, that more and worse is to come. Like previous second-term presidents who ran out of road domestically, Trump finds the world stage offers greater possibilities for the exercise of power and ego. He is building a legacy in blood.Trump’s irresponsible, dangerously erratic behaviour is getting measurably worse. His Venezuela “success” may encourage him to attempt more and bigger, unhinged outrages. Like Mark Antony minus the toga and brains, he struts and preens, cries havoc! and lets slip the dogs of war.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS foreign policyVenezuelaVladimir PutinBenjamin NetanyahuVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

I was a volunteer through an Australian government program, and a new intake of Australians was arriving in Port Vila one afternoon in February, so I went to the Australian High Commission to meet them.I got chatting with this gorgeous and bubbly girl called Kath, who’d been volunteering in Indonesia. I thought we were meeting for the first time, but as I introduced myself, Kath explained that we had in fact met before, walking across Pyrmont Bridge in Sydney during our training weekend.I’m still not sure how I didn’t remember her, as she was very attractive. She was also witty and easy-going. We chatted about volunteering and how we were both keen on the outdoors and keeping fit. At another event the following day, we exchanged numbers.The moment I knew: as he opened the Uber door, he opened my eyes to a love beyond workRead moreWaking up to a message from Kath asking if I wanted to go for a run made me feel very excited, to say the least. I asked her to take a bus to Pango, where I was living, and we ran together to the beach.Sweaty and enjoying each other’s company, we borrowed a paddleboard from my neighbour and took it out on the water in the secluded bay. We spent a good chunk of the morning paddleboarding, chatting away about our families, what we wanted to do after volunteering and things like refugee rights and social justice. We both had adventurous spirits, and our worldviews were very similar. We could both sense the chemistry between us.View image in fullscreenIn Port Vila in 2015 on the night Andrew and Kath said they loved each other.Photograph: Guardian Design/Andrew NgehLater that night – at yet another social barbecue – I remember wanting to be by Kath’s side the whole time. I sensed she wanted to be with me too. The Australian Open men’s final between Djokovic and Murray was on the screen, and I sat next to Kath near the back of the room. I started gently rubbing her back, and suddenly we were holding hands.The next afternoon, we met again for another paddle out in the bay. As the sun was setting over the clear, calm waters, we sat on the board facing each other. It felt like the perfect setting for a romantic first kiss, but then Kath started explaining she didn’t want to get involved with anyone while she was in Vanuatu. I was disappointed, but respected her decision. Then, as I was preparing to paddle us back to shore, she leaned in to kiss me. I was taken aback, but very, very happy.Back on dry land, I cooked us dinner and Kath stayed the night.Kath’s assignment was on an island called Malekula and I was based in Port Vila, so we knew any relationship we may be starting would have to be long-distance. A few days later, in Kath’s hotel room, she told me she loved me. I said it back, with no hesitation. It was the first time I’d said those three words to anybody.View image in fullscreenAndrew and Kath at Efate’s Havannah Harbour  in 2016.Photograph: Andrew NgehWe parted, but I visited her as often as I could. On weekends, we’d trek to remote waterfalls, swim at deserted beaches and cook local recipes. I felt so lucky.Then, in March 2015, news came of a huge cyclone approaching. Kath was evacuated from Malekula to Port Vila, and all the volunteers were moved to the same hotel for safety. The winds were intense that night, reaching more than 300km/h. We crammed together under the stairwell as the roof of the hotel creaked and groaned. No one slept.When it was deemed safe to leave, we spent two days helping to clean up and deliver food and water. Even though we were doing as much as we could, it was frustrating not to be able to do more. Kath and I bonded on a deeper level during those days. One evening, she held my hand, looked at me and said: “We’re doing our best.” It really helped, and it was true. We continued helping until the bigger organisations ramped up their relief efforts.View image in fullscreenAndrew and Kath on their wedding day in 2019.Photograph: Guardian Design/Andrew NgehKath moved in with me shortly after that. Her assignment on the island was shut down after the cyclone, and she volunteered in Port Vila instead. It was blissful for a while, but Kath struggled with anxiety after the cyclone, and in August she returned to Australia for three weeks. I flew over to visit, and we returned to Vanuatu together – she wanted me to complete my assignment, and I was determined to support her recovery. When my role finished in May 2016, we decided to move to Lismore, Australia, permanently.We’ve been together for a decade now. I proposed to Kath in Ubud, Bali, and we married in 2019 in Lismore – where Kath grew up. She has a beautiful soul, and is thoughtful, caring and kind. We have three children: a four-year-old boy and twin girls who are five months old.View image in fullscreenIn Lismore in 2025: ‘Parenthood has brought out the best in both of us.’Photograph: Andrew NgehParenthood has brought out the best in both of us, and it has helped us reflect more deeply on how we want to live our lives. We’ve been back to Port Vila three times since we left, and we plan on moving back in a few years so our children can experience island life too – and the magic of Vanuatu that brought us all together in the first place.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.During a golden sunset in Memphis in May, Sharon Wilson pointed a thermal imaging camera at Elon Musk’s flagship datacentre to reveal a planetary threat her eyes could not. Free from pollution controls, the gas-fired turbines that power the world’s biggest AI supercomputer were pumping invisible fumes into the Tennessee sky.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“It was jaw-dropping,” said Wilson, a former oil and gas worker from Texas who has documented methane releases for more than a decade and estimates xAI’s Colossus datacentre was spewing more of the planet-heating gas than a large power plant. “Just an unbelievable amount of pollution.”That same week, the facility’s core product was running riot on news feeds. Musk’s maverick chatbot, Grok,repeated a conspiracy theorythat “white genocide” was taking place in South Africa when asked about topics as unrelated as baseball and scaffolding. The posts were quickly deleted but Grok has gone on topraise Hitler,push far-right ideologiesand make false claims.View image in fullscreenGrok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, has previously praised Hitler and repeated conspiracy theories about ‘white genocide’.Photograph: Algi Febri Sugita/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“It’s a horrible, horrible waste,” said Wilson, the director of campaign group Oilfield Witness, pointing to Grok-generated images ofNazi Mickey Mouseas an example of what fossil gas was being burned to produce. “What useful purpose does this serve?”Wilson is not alone in asking this question. Scientists are watching the AI boom with unease as it pollutes the natural world with carbon and the digital world with dangers ranging fromdodgy health mythstodeepfake pornography targeting children.Some experts fear datacentres may derail the shift to a clean economy, adding an unnecessary hurdle to the quixotic task of keeping the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F). Others are sanguine about the energy costs, arguing they pale in comparison not just to polluting industries, but also to the technology’s power to reshape society.How big a threat is AI to the climate? And could it help more than it harms?When Hannah Daly ran models for the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris and then became a professor of sustainable energy at University College Cork in Ireland, she spent little time worrying about the carbon cost of computers. Cars, cows and home heating were among the knotty problems draining the carbon budget; emissions from digital services were small and relatively flat.But in Ireland, the computational hunger for energy has reached levels that are impossible to ignore. Datacentres guzzle one-fifth of the country’s electricity and are projected to devour nearly one-third of it within a few years. The rapid expansion of chip-filled warehouses, which have sprung up faster than the electricity grid can handle, led to them being effectively banned from grid connections in 2021.The trajectory of “enormous, exponential growth” is what is so worrying, said Daly. “I’m not sure whether Ireland is a real outlier or a harbinger of what’s to come. But it’s definitely a cautionary tale.”Datacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but may soon demand much more. Their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF, while the IEA projects datacentres will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.Some of the demand is being met through long-term agreements to buy renewable power – supporting the expansion of clean energy even when the electricity powering the facility is dirty – while some tech firms have signed deals to use nuclear energy.But for the near future, fossil fuels are set to dominate supply. China’s datacentres are clustered in its coal-heavy east. In the US, where natural gas is expected to generate most of the electricity in datacentres over the next decade, the Trump administration used them to justify burning more coal. “Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to … winning the AI race,” energy secretary Chris Wright said in September when announcing a $625m (£467m) investment package.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon datacentre in Didcot, Oxfordshire.Photograph: Horst Friedrichs/AlamyIn Ireland, which is building terminals to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and power plants to burn it, the datacentre boom has offset climate gains from renewable expansion in the power sector, according to ananalysisDaly conducted for Friends of the Earth Ireland last year. Poorer countries may not be immune, either. Cheap solar has begun to displace coal at a remarkable rate in Pakistan, but datacentres are poised to pick up the spare capacity of idling power plants after the government announced it would devote 2GW of power to AI and bitcoin.“This idea that the lower cost of renewables alone will drive decarbonisation – it’s not enough,” said Daly. “Because if there’s a huge source of energy demand that wants to grow, it will land on these stranded fossil fuel assets.”Does this mean using chatbots to draft emails, write essays and plan holidays endangers the planet? Tech companies have resisted pressure to provide detailed data on their AI energy footprints, but popular guesstimates hover about 0.2 to 3 Watt-hours (Wh) for a simple text query and rise considerably for “deep research” and video production. In a blogpost in July, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, claimed a ChatGPT query uses as little energy as running a lightbulb for a couple of minutes, in line with a recent report from Google on the median text prompt to its AI assistant, Gemini.The figures are negligible compared to activities such as flying, eating meat, or driving a car. Still, sceptics worry about the sheer scale of the technology – ChatGPT claims to have several hundred million weekly users just three years after its release – and the fervour with which companies have shoved it into every aspect of digital life. Google controls an estimated 90% of the global search engine market and has forced generative AI on to its results page. The rise of AI agents and behind-the-scenes services is expected to add to the background hum.“What I’m worried about is that we’re deploying AI in such a way that we don’t have a good idea of the energy use,” said Sasha Luccioni, climate lead at AI company Hugging Face, who has grown frustrated by “selective disclosures” from big companies that obscure the real climate impact of their products. “We’re essentially operating on the hypothesis that it’s not a problem – or that if it is a problem it will somehow be solved – instead of getting ahead of it.”What if AI could pay off its energy debts by saving carbon in other parts of the economy? That is the thesis put forward in an IEA report in April, which argued existing AI applications could cut emissions by far more than datacentres produced. Apaperby researchers at the London School of Economics and Systemiq came to a similar conclusion in June after modelling scenarios in which AI would help to integrate solar and wind into the electricity grid, identify alternative proteins that mimic meat, improve battery composition in electric cars and nudge people to make climate-friendly choices.“AI can accelerate the deployment of those clean technologies by basically accelerating their position along the curve of innovation and adoption,” said co-author Roberta Pierfederici, a policy fellow at the LSE’s Grantham Institute.The projected carbon savings carry large uncertainties – greater efficiency can lead to more use, the IEA warns, and rebound effects may undercut the gains, such as self-driving cars undermining public transport – butexamplesalready exist. Google says AI has helped it cut cooling in datacentres by 40%. Spain’s Iberdrola says AI has optimised wind turbine maintenance and performance, increasing operational efficiency by 25%. France’s Engie says it has reduced downtime on solar farms by using AI to detect faults.Because other sectors are so polluting, the researchers say, AI would only need to cut their emissions by a small fraction to cover the carbon cost of its computing, which a recentstudyestimated to be 0.1-0.2% of global emissions, and rising. “In the power sector we are already seeing the results,” said Pierfederici. “Whereas the meat sector is not there yet.”Clean tech advocates are not the only ones to have noticed AI’s transformative potential.When Holly and Will Alpine decided to quit their jobs at Microsoft last year, they knew they were throwing away a good deal. The married millennial couple enjoyed US tech salaries through their positions in the company’s responsible AI and sustainability teams, with close colleagues and work that gave them a sense of purpose. Will had been among the early voices pushing to tackle the energy cost of datacentres.But Microsoft’s work for oil and gas clients troubled the pair, and they started to grow more concerned about the emissions it enabled than the ones it produced. In 2019, the company announced a partnership with ExxonMobil with the potential to expand production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day. That same year, it began a digital project with Chevron that the oil company says has cut 30 days off its deepwater well planning process. As more deals emerged, the Alpines began to push their employer for answers.“The response from the company was often pointing back to their own operational footprint, which is not relevant,” said Holly Alpine, who left the company with Will to campaign for the tech industry to tackle its enabled emissions. “After a four-year internal advocacy campaign, where we got a lot of promises but most were unfulfilled, we realised that internal pressure was not enough.”View image in fullscreenThe chief executive of oil company Saudi Aramco recently said the company had embedded AI ‘in everything’.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe IEA estimates that AI could boost technically recoverable oil and gas reserves by 5% and cut the cost of a deepwater offshore project by 10%. Big oil is even more bullish. “Artificial intelligence is, ultimately, within the industry, going to be the next fracking boom,” Mike Sommers, head of the American Petroleum Institute,told Axios. Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said the company had embedded AI “in everything” inan interview with Bloomberg Televisionearlier this year. The world’s biggest oil company doubled its technology spending from 2023 to 2024, according to Nasser, and the widespread adoption of AI has “increased productivity, and with that, the number of wells”.At the same time, the oil and gas industry says AI can cut its carbon intensity, for instance by analysing satellite data to spot methane leaks. But even here, critics say there is a gap between digital insights and corporate actions. Wilson, who saw “giant clouds of gas escaping everywhere” during a recent field trip to the Permian Basin, said the industry’s sophisticated network of satellites have achieved little because leaks are only a small problem compared to intentional releases of methane.“They are using this as an excuse to delay action,” said Wilson. “Watching methane from space is not stopping methane.”Perhaps even more concerning than the expansion of fossil fuel supply is the effect on consumption. Generative AI adverts outperform human ones, astudyfound in October, and the ease with which they can be made slashes the cost of encouraging consumption. The marketing industry, already familiar with hyperpersonalised adverts and streamlined shopping, is preparing for AI agents that could buy presents and book flights on a customer’s behalf. Tui, Europe’s biggest travel operator, says it isinvesting heavilyin AI as people turn to ChatGPT to book their holidays.“The narrative is really focused on this false comparison between the energy used to run the technology and the positive use cases,” said Alpine. “But it is dangerous to omit the negative use cases.”Some voices are calling to hit pause, at least until better rules are in place. In October, the UN’s special rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking watercalled for a moratoriumon the development of new datacentres, citing the damaging environmental impacts. In December, a coalition of more than 230 environmental groups in the USdemanded a national moratoriumuntil they were regulated. Ireland’s utility commission has lifted its de facto ban on grid connections, but said 80% of a datacentre’s annual electricity consumption must eventually come from new renewable projects.Others have called to push the sector to do good. Spain, which is the only country to mention AI in a piece of climate legislation, obliges the government to promote digitalisation that can help decarbonise the economy. Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the Paris climate agreement, has suggestedtaxing AIto generate funds needed to stop the planet from heating.The Alpines, who say they are not anti-AI but just want “reasonable guardrails” on the technology, are pushing for the EU’s upcoming AI bill to classify fossil fuels as a high-risk application of the technology. They also want to get investors to consider enabled emissions in a company’s ratings on environment, social and governance metrics.Google and xAI did not respond to a request for comment. OpenAI said it gives considerable thought to the best use of its computing power, supports efforts with partners to meet sustainability goals and believes AI will be instrumental in tackling climate change.Microsoft said the energy transition is complex and requires moving forward in a principled manner, with technology having an important role to play in helping the industry decarbonise. “That requires balancing the energy needs and industry practices of today, while inventing and deploying those of tomorrow,” a spokesperson said.Luccioni said that, rather than panic about AI, people should pressure companies to make tools that are frugal by design.“Maybe I’m a little naive, but I still believe that AI can do good in terms of fighting the climate crisis – designing the next generation of batteries, tracking deforestation, predicting hurricanes,” she said. “There are so many good things for which we can be using it – and instead we’re creating social media websites filled with AI slop while datacentres are getting powered by diesel generators.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are thehours-long, hundred-person lineswrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.On a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot forTeslacar charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.The novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsiteanti-Musk protests,noise complaints from neighborsand customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.We still don’t really know what Elon Musk’s Doge actually didRead moreGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month thathe was leaving the Tesla Dinerto focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chefremoved his previous Instagram postsreferencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.Greenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.Greenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Dinerfaced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Muskmade what rights groupshave described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.‘Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging’Musk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA sinceat least 2018as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”The diner received immense media coverage upon opening butpoor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.A display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.Tesla postedon X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.On social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.The diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.As the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTeslaElon MuskLos AngelesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you have promised to tackle your finances this year, there are lots of tools and apps that can help you achieve your goal. Here are 26 to help you in 2026.Scottish Widows Pension MirrorFeeling brave? This AI-powered tool will tell you how old you look and how much people of the same age typically have saved in their pension – it could make you very happy, or be doubly troubling.It looks at your face, guesses how old you are and shows you the average pension savings for people of that age. When one Guardian Money writer gave it a go, he was pleased to have his age estimated at 47 – a decade younger than his actual years. The app said He was told that the typical pension savings for a 47-year-old were worth £75,500, while for a 57-year-old the figure was £124,800. The Scottish Widows app will then let you use your own figures to show you how much you are on track to retire on and how to boost that.Rupert JonesHMRC appThere are only a few weeks until the 31 January deadline to file self-assessment tax returns for the 2024-25 tax year, but millions of Britons still haven’t done theirs. It won’t take away all of the pain, but the HM Revenue and Customs app could help you get the job done faster. You can use it to access vital information, from your self-assessment tax reference number to details of your employment income. It has lots of other useful features – for example, you can set a reminder to make a self-assessment payment. HMRC’s website has details of what you will need to access the app.RJYuka appThis “100% independent” app helps you make healthier choices about where you spend your money. You scan the barcodes of food and cosmetic products and it gives each item a score based on nutritional quality or ingredient safety and, where possible, suggests healthier alternatives. The app is free to download but there is a paid-for version with extra features such as offline scanning and dietary preference alerts. Similar apps includeOpen Food Facts, which provides detailed nutrition and allergen data using a community-run database.Fooducatefocuses more on nutrition education and diet tracking.Sarah MarshTurn2us benefits calculatorThe charity Turn2us offers a free and confidential benefits calculator that helps you find out if you are entitled to any financial support. It asks questions about your income and savings, housing costs and household circumstances, then provides a tailored list of possible entitlements, along with links to the official sites where you can begin a claim. Turn2us also has a “grants search” tool where you can find out if you might be able to get financial help from a charity or organisation. These funds are sometimes available to people who have worked in certain occupations or have particular health conditions.RJView image in fullscreenOnline tools can help you predict your chances of winning premium bonds.Illustration: Michael Driver/The GuardianMoneySavingExpert’sPremium bonds odds calculatorThis whizzy tool on the MoneySavingExpert website lets you enter how many premium bonds you have and a time frame, and it will predict your winnings. When we tried it, it said that with average luck someone with £5,000 of premium bonds (roughly the average holding) could expect to win roughly £775 over a five-year period. The odds in the calculator are based on the prize distribution for the most recent draw, which changes slightly each month, so the site says this should only be seen as “a very good estimate”. You can compare your predicted returns with the interest you would earn on a savings account and with inflation and see if you are making the best of your savings – currently it shows taxpayers would be better off in a top-paying cash Isa.RJPremium bonds prize checkerA total of £111m in premium bond prizes is sitting unclaimed, which means it is more than 18 months since the numbers came up and a cheque was sent out to the winner. The 2,677,306 unclaimed prizes include 11 worth £100,000 each. You can check if you have an unclaimed win usingNS&I’s online prize checkeror itsprize checker app. These will show you any prizes you have won this month and any older prizes that you haven’t claimed. There is no time limit for claiming a premium bond win. To check online you will need your holder’s number (it has either nine or 10 digits, or eight digits followed by a letter), while if you have the app, you can also use your NS&I number. To make sure you do not miss out on future prizes, opt for a direct payment into your bank account or into more bonds.RJPension credit calculatorA benefit many eligible retirees miss out on is pension credit. This is extra money to help with living costs if you are over state pension age and on a low income and tops up your weekly income to £227.10 if you are single, or your joint weekly income to £346.60 if you have a partner. You may be entitled to additional payments on top and help with housing costs. This government calculator asks you a series of questions about your circumstances and finances. It then gives you an estimate of what, if any, pension credit you could be entitled to. You will need to make a full claim to get the money.RJTravel Money MaxIf you are heading abroad soon and plan to buy some holiday spending money, this online tool run by MoneySavingExpert.com is a good first port of call. It lets you compare exchange rates and make sure you are getting the best deal on a long list of currencies that will cater for many holiday destinations. The rates available will typically be much better than those offered on the high street or at the airport. Key in just a few details including how much you want to spend or buy, when you need the currency and how you want to receive it – delivery or collection – and it will give you several options. You will need to order online to get the deals it lists.RJCredit KarmaYour credit score is a number anywhere between 0 and 1,250, and your position on this scale is a measure of your creditworthiness. Before you can get into any kind of debt, and for other purposes too, companies will check your score with any of the three big credit reference agencies. These are Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. They all use slightly different models but rely on similar data, such as your history of paying bills, to calculate your score. Checking your score can help you see if there are any problems with the information held on you, or give you advance warning of any difficulties you might encounter taking on new borrowing. The personal finance platform Credit Karma partners with TransUnion and lets you check your score and report for free – it runs offers for credit cards and loans and earns a commission if you take one out.ZoeWoodView image in fullscreenAre Amazon’s prices on Black Friday and other dates really a good deal? Camelcamelcamel will help you find out.Photograph: Stephen Frost/AlamyCamelcamelcamelIf you download its browser extension,the Camelizer, you can see the price history charts while you are still on Amazon’s website. Camelcamelcamel generates revenue through affiliate links, so if you click on a link and buy something, it gets a commission.ZWTrend Micro ScamCheckThe cybersecurity company Trend Micro has an app designed to detect and prevent scam calls, texts and websites. Download it on your phone and it can block unsafe websites, and it will tell you if uploaded images, texts or links look suspicious. ScamCheck claims to be different from anti-virus software as it focuses on fraud rather than preventing your phone being infected with malware. You can trial it for free for 30 days, and after that it costs £19.99 a year.Shane HickeyView image in fullscreenTesco’s Clubcard app lets you access the lower prices available to cardholders.Photograph: Reuters/AlamyTesco Clubcard appThis app is very useful if you are a regular Tesco shopper (otherwise check what your go-to supermarket offers as most have similar). You can carry around your Clubcard virtually, meaning you never miss out on the lower prices available to cardholders, and check for new offers and select personalised coupons. You can also use it to keep track of your Clubcard vouchers (you earn one point for every £1 spent on shopping at Tesco, and it is worth 1p when converted into vouchers), and get QR codes to redeem them in store. Vouchers can be spent at Tesco or exchanged for twice their face value, with more than 100 “reward” partners. This is less than in the past, but the good news for dough ball fans is that vouchers are now worth triple at Pizza Express – meaning £10 of vouchers gets you a £30 reward code for the restaurant.ZWHMRC tax code checkerEver wondered what the numbers and letters in your tax code mean for your finances? HMRC’s tool will tell you exactly how much you should be paying in tax and how much you can earn tax-free based on your code – take a look on your payslip to find it. If it’s any different from the standard personal allowance of £12,570 a year and you do not know why, check your personal tax account online, or ask your employer. For employees, it has another calculator that will estimatehow much income tax and national insuranceyou should pay for the current tax year. There’s also a calculator tocheck if you need to pay the high income child benefit tax charge.RJMy Lost AccountThere are millions of bank and building society accounts in the UK, and inevitably, some end up getting lost. This is defined as where an account has been inactive for a long time – often 15 years – and the bank, building society or NS&I has written to the customer but heard nothing back. My Lost Account can help you find missing funds even if you do not know where an account is held now. You need to fill in any details you have, including the names of any providers with which you believe you saved money – these can be brands that do not exist any more. The tool generates a search request which it sends to each of those organisations. Within 12 weeks you should hear if any accounts have been found. You can then get on with reclaiming your cash.RJView image in fullscreenApps can help shoppers compare the prices of grocery and other items.Illustration: Michael Driver/The GuardianThe Share Foundation child trust fund finderChild trust funds (CTFs) were huge: more than 6.3m were opened between their launch in 2005 and 2011 when they were scrapped, and there is still £7.5bn locked up in them. But a lot of these accounts have been forgotten about. The Share Foundation, a charity, runs a free-to-use search service for over-16s who may not know there is money with their name on it.The online tool asks for the holder’s name, date of birth and past and present addresses. The charity uses this information to track down the account and the account holder should get an email from either the provider or HMRC telling them where it is.RJFree childcare calculatorThe government has been rolling out funded childcare in England, and now lots of working families with children under the age of five are entitled to 30 hours free each week. This handy calculator lets you check your entitlement, wherever you live in the UK. You need to know your household’s working hours and income, and will also be asked for your child’s date of birth and your likely weekly or monthly childcare costs.RJHotukdealsGet a heads up on the latest sales with this app (or use the website at hotukdeals.com). A community of bargain hunters posts deals every day and then the community votes on whether they are hot or not. The ones with the most votes go to the top of the feed. It could be a cut-price TV subscription, a particular supermarket selling heavily discounted chocolates or cheap Lego. You can also search for offers on particular brands or items. It is free and registered users get tailored alerts to things they may be interested in.SHView image in fullscreenYou can manage kids’ money with the HyperJar app.HyperJarThisfree money management app – which comes with a physical or virtual prepaid debit card – can help you with budgeting and managing spending. Users can load money from their bank into their HyperJar account and then divide it into different digital “jars” depending on how they spend. You can add payment controls if you are worried you may be tempted to buy things you do not really need, and the app also offers prepaid cards for children. Money held with HyperJar is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), but it is held in a safeguarded account under Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules. Other popular apps of this type includeEmmaandPlum. They are both free for the basic version, with more features available if you stump up a monthly fee.SHCompare the Market’s Meerkat appBuying insurance on Compare the Market gives you access to rewards, some of which you can only take advantage of via this app. There are savings on takeaway pizzas and restaurant bills and savings at Caffè Nero which you can only get this way, as well as two-for-one cinema tickets on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which you do not need the app for. For customers of O2, the phone provider’s Priority app has cheap Vue cinema tickets, money off magazine subscriptions and cheap drinks from Greggs, among other offers.SHHold AssistWe all know how hard it is to get through to companies, and sorting out your finances could mean spending a lot of the time waiting for your calls to be answered. Some now offer a callback service so you don’t have to stay on hold for ages, but if they don’t, this iPhone feature might help. As long as your phone is an iPhone 12 or later model, when you are placed on hold you can choose to get a notification when a live agent is available. You don’t have to stay on the line and can get on with what you are doing, safe in the knowledge that you won’t miss your turn in the queue.ZWToo Good To GoThis free app has been around for a few years now, and claims to be “the world’s largest marketplace for surplus food”. It enables restaurants, cafes and shops to sell food they might otherwise have to throw away, while offering you the chance to grab something cheap to eat – often at half the normal price or less – and help the environment by reducing food waste. To find deals near where you live you can browse a map of your local area, set filters based on your individual preferences and view personalised recommendations. A running total on the app shows you how much money you have saved and your positive impact on the environment.RJView image in fullscreenThe Olio mobile app was originally designed for people to give away surplus food, but now offers giveaways from big retailers.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty ImagesOlioAnother free app designed to reduce waste – both food and otherwise. Originally used by individuals to give away food when they had bought or made too much, it now has giveaways from big retailers, reduced food from the frozen food store Iceland, and a section for giving away or selling other goods. Food Waste Heroes collect items from supermarkets and redistribute them via the app – it is all within its use-by date, and may have come from the clearance section. Other people will sometimes explain why they are giving food away in the listing. To get the best out of it you need to live somewhere fairly densely populated – or have neighbours who over-buy.HOTrolley.co.ukThis free app lets people compare the prices of grocery and other items across supermarkets and other retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Ocado and Amazon. It claims users can save up to 30% on groceries by making sure they are getting the best deal. Handily, it includes discounts for loyalty cards such as Tesco Clubcard and the Sainsbury’s Nectar scheme although these are listed below the headline prices. You can create shopping lists, and it will tell you the prices across different retailers, you can track an item’s price history and you can check prices while in the supermarket aisle using the app’s barcode scanner. At a time when grocery shopping is pricey, it is a useful tool for cutting those bills.RJEmergency fund calculatorWe all know we should have some money set aside for a rainy day, but how much should you be aiming for, and when can you stop saving for that and start working towards a different goal? The Post Office’s calculator will give you an idea. Put in a figure for your non-negotiable expenses each month – your housing costs, food and energy bills, etc – and another for how much you have already saved and it will give you a target figure. It will also show you how far along the way you are, which can make it feel a little less insurmountable.HOHome energy efficiency toolvia Halifax, Nationwide and other banks’ and building societies’ websitesRun by the Energy Saving Trust – an organisation that helps businesses and homeowners reduce their energy use – this tool will give you a tailored action plan to improve your home. It begins with questions about where you live, including the type of property and its age, and goes on to ask about your current bills. The version on Halifax’s website also asks you about your heating, shower and so on, before the initial calculations. The tool then tells you how much you would need to spend to reduce your energy use and outlines a range of measures, how much they will cost and what the potential annual saving on your bills will be. You can choose a maximum budget for it to take into account, and also whether to prioritise lower bills, a better rating on your property’s EPC (the energy performance certificate landlords and sellers need to provide) or reducing your environmental impact. You can remove any measures from the list and, once done, download an action plan. It will not take into account all of the small things you might be doing to keep your bills down, but it will give you an idea of the work you could consider and how much it will cost.HOMoney Midlife MOTAimed at those aged between 45 and 65, this tool from the government-backed MoneyHelper website is a great place to take stock of your finances. There are questions about all the major things you need to think about as you hurtle into middle age – from making sure your pension provider knows who to pay out when you die, to where you will live in retirement. You do not need numbers or account details to use it, just to have a broad idea of what is happening with your money. For example, are you keeping up with debt repayments? And do you pay regularly into a pension? Once you have answered the questions you get a personalised downloadable report making suggestions about the areas of your finances that you should focus on. Under sections on budgeting, estate planning and so on you will get a list of next steps, and links to useful articles and calculators.HOExplore more on these topicsMoneyBanks and building societiesSavingsPensionsIncome taxInheritance taxTaxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that is not even the most concerning thing about it.Venezuela attack: what we know so far as Trump claims Maduro capturedRead moreDonald Trump has been driving convoys of bulldozers through that increasingly fragile edifice since taking office nearly a year ago, and now it is mostly wreckage. The events overnight were preceded by airstrikes on small boats in the seas off Central America and the killing of their crews based on unproven allegations of drug trafficking, and the armed seizure of Venezuelan oil tankers on the high seas. It is not yet known how many people were killed in the capture of Maduro in the early hours of Saturday.In terms of global stability, the worst thing about the Maduro rendition is that it worked.Trump’s belief in his own global omnipotence, and his desire to grab the territory and natural resources of other countries has been held in check until now by his fear of entanglement in foreign wars. He claimed (falsely) to have ended eight wars, and his greatest ambition in 2025 seemed to be winning the Nobel peace prize. Less than a month ago he was brandishing a hastily confected substitute, the Fifa peace prize. That act of self-abasement by world football’s governing body looks even more absurd now than it did whenTrump grabbed the gold medal and put it around his own neck.Trump’s apprehension over foreign wars seems to be waning. He was clearly thrilled by the drama of the Maduro operation, and the efficiency of the American soldiers who carried it out, declaring on Saturday he was “not afraid” of deploying ground forces inVenezuelato pursue his interests. For an ageing president, growing more petulant, irascible and incoherent with every day in office – facing diminishing popularity and desperate to distract attention from the Epstein child-trafficking scandal – a tightening embrace of military power is an ominous development.View image in fullscreenMaduro is a dictator who has run an authoritarian state since 2013 with the help of elections widely regarded as rigged.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersOn Saturday morning, Trump seemed giddy with military success. “A lot of good planning and a lot of great, great troops and great people,” Trump told the New York Times. “It was a brilliant operation, actually.”The attack on Venezuela suggests the allure of foreign lands, oil and minerals is now glimmering brighter than the Nobel prize.It was mostly left to others in theTrump administrationto cast the attack in legal language and suggest that Maduro was being “brought to justice”. The Venezuelan leader was indicted in the US at the end of the first Trump term on corruption, drug trafficking and other offences.Maduro is a dictator who has run an authoritarian state since 2013 with the help of elections widely regarded as rigged. But thespecific drug allegations made against him by the USare seen by most experts as flimsy, and would not represent convincing grounds under international or US law for the attack on Venezuela and Maduro’s abduction. In repeated statements, Trump has made clearhe is more covetous of Venezuela’s oilthan motivated by a desire to bring Maduro before a court, or deliver democracy to the people of Venezuela.Hours after ousting Maduro, Trump said US were ready to move in to fix Venezuela’s decrepit, sanctions-ravaged oil industry. “We’ll be selling large amounts of oil,” he said.The international laws and norms Trump has barged through had already been loosened by previous US administrations. The operation most closely resemblesthe 1990 invasion of Panamaand forced surrender of its strongman, by the first Bush administration.Today an illegal coup in Venezuela, but where next? Donald Trump talks peace but he is a man of war | Simon TisdallRead moreThat was followed by the younger George Bush with the invasion of Iraq on false grounds, and his administration’s broad use of rendition of torture. Barack Obama failed to hold his predecessor’s administration to account and pursued his own legally questionable drone assassination campaign against suspected terrorists.These are arguably discrete acts of hypocrisy by earlier presidents, who claimed exceptions from international laws in the pursuit of US interests, but mostly embraced global norms in the knowledge that the “rules-based system” overwhelmingly favoured America.Trump has complete disdain for that system. He looks at the world through the eyes of a 19th-century imperialist, but with 21st-century weapons.2:18Venezuela in state of emergency after US strikes and capture of Maduro – video reportIt is unclear how far Trump intends to go in Venezuela to advance his aims, but he made clear on Saturday that the “American armada” would remain poised in the region “until United States demands have been fully met and fully satisfied” – demands that are likely to include a takeover of Venezuela’s oil industry.Trump said Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, was ready to cooperate with Washington and that he had other people in mind to put in place. It is unclear whether Maduro’s supporters have the capacity or will to resist a US takeover, or whether any rebel groups will take the opportunity to make a move. Atranquil outcome seems a remote prospect.What unfolded overnight in Venezuela will cause immediate anxiety to governments like Iran and Denmark, against which Trump has expressed enthusiasm for taking radical action.In recent days, Trump has said theUS would come to the defence of Iranian anti-government protesters, and his officials have kept up a drumbeat of threats to take control of Greenland by any necessary means. Last month, the Danish Defence Intelligence Servicelabelled the US as a security risk, a declaration that would have been unthinkable just a short time ago for a Nato ally.In his press conference on Saturday, Trump added Cuba to the list of countries in his sights, suggesting it was “very similar” to Venezuela “in the sense that we want to help the people in Cuba”. His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, added that Havana should feel “concerned” in the wake of the events in Venezuela.It accelerates the slide from a mostly rules-based world to one of competing spheres of influence, to be determined by armed might and the readiness to use it. One US commentator, David Rothkopf, called it the “Putinization of US foreign policy”.Russian commentators have frequently suggested that Latin America lies in America’s domain just as Ukraine was under the Russian shadow. Vladimir Putin thinks the same of much of eastern Europe. Xi Jinping will draw his own conclusions.The peril made brutally clear in the first few days of 2026 is one that will ultimately be faced by everyone.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpInternational lawAmericasTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS militaryanalysisShareReuse this content"

US oil firms will invest heavily to reconstruct “rotted” infrastructure, ramp up production and sell “large amounts … to other countries”, he told reporters, adding: “We’re in the oil business.”“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies – the biggest anywhere in the world – go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country,” the president said. The firms would be “reimbursed”, he added, without providing more detail.ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil company, did not respond to a request for comment. ConocoPhillips, another major player, said it was monitoring developments, and added: “It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.”A spokesperson for Chevron said: “Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.”Venezuela​ moved to nationalize its oil industry some 50 years ago, and​ later ​seized control of operations still run under private arrangements​ in 2007. While Chevron agreed to remain, others including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips​ refused to accept new terms.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips engaged in a years-long legal battle with Venezuela after exiting, and were ultimately awarded billions of dollars by the World Bank’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. But Venezuela, with an economy battered by sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, has yet to pay all the money.For now, a US embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect, according to Trump, whose administration has repeatedly accused the country of stealing American wealth and property by seizing control of the reserves. As the US moves to take them back, its next steps will be closely scrutinized amid questions over the legality of Trump’s vision.Trump’s suggestion that US oil majors would play a key role in Venezuela prompted analysts to conclude their executives had likely been consulted ahead of time.“My hunch is that, if President Trump said this publicly, probably there was already an agreement with the US companies,” Jorge León, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, an industry consultancy, said. Tina Fordham, a geopolitical strategist and consultant, said: “One assumes that they have been part of the conversation.”The White House did not comment on whether it consulted US oil giants before the strike.Administration officials have in recent weeks told US oil executives that, if they want compensation for rigs, pipelines and other seized property in Venezuela, they must return and invest heavily,according to Politico, which cited two unnamed sources familiar with the conversations.Venezuela holds some 17% of global oil reserves, according to the Energy Institute. But its output, as high as 3.5m barrels per day in the 1970s, fell dramatically due to decades of mismanagement, corruption and underinvestment. Production from Venezuela was around 1.m barrels per day, around 1% of the world’s output, last year.Taking production in the country back to anywhere near its previous levels is widely expected to require huge investment. Returning to 2m barrels per day by the early 2030s would require an estimated $110bn, according to Rystad.“I don’t think companies will rush back into the country,” said León, who suggested it would be “very, very tricky” for Venezuela to attract the private investment required to dramatically increase oil production.He added: “Companies, before rushing back into the country, will want to see the country is stable enough. The fact this industry was nationalized by [Hugo] Chávez a few years ago, that remains in the back of their minds. They will really want to see things improving.”The global oil market is “entering into a period of oversupply”, said León. “Prices will come down and will continue to come down … That means that oil companies will be very, very selective of where they invest, in a period of lower prices. Given the choice, they will probably want to go investing in places they already know.”But other industry observers expect oil majors to jostle for a chance to operate in Venezuela. The country now amounts to “a huge opportunity” for big firms, said Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight. “There will be immense competition between them for the best opportunities.”On Saturday morning, Trump hailed “one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military, might and competence” in history.But in corporate boardrooms and beyond, memories of other toppled dictators – including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya – where the aftermath proved complicated, loom large.“The history of post-authoritarian transitions, whether they are organic or externally brought about, is long and non-linear,” said Fordham. “Trump appears to have complete faith that, under him, things will be different.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpOil and gas companiesUS politicsUS foreign policyNicolás MaduroShareReuse this content"

Shortly afterwards, Donald Trump announced that US forces had captured the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them out of the country.The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said they would face trial in New York on charges of involvement in narco-terrorism. A fresh indictment was issued on Saturday.Trump laterposted a pictureon his Truth Social platform with the caption “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima”.View image in fullscreenTrump on Truth Social: ‘Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima’.Photograph: US President Donald Trump’s TRUTH Social account/AFP/Getty ImagesThe stunning attack and unprecedented capture of a sitting president follow months of an intense US pressure campaign againstVenezuela. Since September, the US navy has amassed a huge fleet off the Venezuelan coast and carried out airstrikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific and seized Venezuelan oil tankers. At least 110 people have been killed in the strikes on boats, which human rights groups say could amount to war crimes.It was the largest, most direct US action in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion. The lightning operationstunned the international community, allies and adversaries of the US alike, which were taken aback by the brazen interference in a foreign country.Global outcry after US launches strikes on Venezuela and captures presidentRead moreAt a Mar-a-Lago news conference, Trump said that the US would “run the country” until a leadership transition can take place, and that US oil companies would go into Venezuela, bragging that “no nation in the world could achieve what America achieved”.The bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of Maduro is a serious and dramatic escalation of the US campaign. The future of Venezuela’s ruling regime remains uncertain. Despite Trump’s statements that the US will decide the fate of the country, the Venezuelan military appears to remain in control of the country and its military assets.View image in fullscreenCaracas is bombarded by the US in the early hours.Photograph: AFP/GettyHow did we get here?Since Trump took office for his second term, he has put Maduro squarely in his sights, pursuing a maximum pressure campaign against the Venezuelan regime. He accused Maduro of being behind destabilising activity in the Americas, including drug trafficking and illegal immigration to the US. In July, the US announced a $50m (£37m) bounty on Maduro’s head, accusing him of being one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.Trump’s administration declared Venezuelan gangs such as Tren de Aragua as terrorist organisations and began carrying out airstrikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea. Soon, the US began to seize Venezuelan tankers and build up its military presence in the waters surrounding the South American country.Trump has openly flirted with the idea of regime change in Venezuela. In late November, Trump gave Maduro an ultimatum to relinquish power, offering him safe passage out of the country. Maduro refused the offer, telling supporters in Venezuela that he did not want “a slave’s peace” and accusing the US of wanting control of his country’s oil reserves.As the Trump administration ratcheted up the pressure, the government in Caracas at times seemed bewildered. Maduro repeatedly said Venezuela did not want war with the US, at one point dancing in front of Venezuelan students to the lyrics, “no war, yes peace” and mimicking Trump’s double-fist pumping dance move. On Thursday, two days before his capture, Maduro said in a televised interview he would welcome US investment in the country’s oil sector.View image in fullscreenPeople ride on a motorbike next to military vehicles at the border between Venezuela and Colombia after the US strikes.Photograph: Luisa González/ReutersWhy are the US and Venezuela at odds?Relations between the US and Venezuela have been strained since Hugo Chávez became the president in 1999. A self-professed socialist and anti-imperialist, Chávez angered the US in his opposition to its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as his alliances with countries such as Cuba and Iran. Relations further spiralled after Chávez accused the US of backing a 2002 coup attempt.To many in the US, particularly in the more hawkish wing of the Republican party, the socialist ideological orientation of Venezuela’s government has made it a natural adversary of the US, alongside its ally Cuba.As Chávez consolidated power, punished political opponents and expropriated much of the country’s private sector, the US condemned Venezuela for its poor human rights record. Despite occasional minor thaws in relations between the two countries over the years, the relationship has continued to deteriorate, especially after Maduro took power in 2013.Under the Trump administration, the US has portrayed the Maduro government as illegitimate, recognising Juan Guaidó, the speaker of the parliament, as Venezuela’s president in 2019.In July 2024, Maduro appeared to suffer a landslide defeat in the presidential election, amid widespread anger at his increasingly authoritarian rule and Venezuela’s economic collapse. The Biden administration recognised the opposition candidate Edmundo González as the victor. Detailed voting data released by the opposition and verified by independent experts indicated that González had won the vote, but Maduro clung to power after launching a ferocious crackdown.In early December, the Trump administration published what it calledthe “Trump corollary”, which said that the western hemisphere must be controlled by the US politically, economically, commercially and militarily. As part of the new Trump doctrine, the US military can be used to gain access to energy and mineral resources in the area.During a press conference hours after the capture of Maduro, Trump invoked the 19th-century Monroe doctrine, which was used to assert US military power in Latin America. Dubbing it the “Don-Roe doctrine”, he said: “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again.”View image in fullscreenA supporter of Nicolás Maduro holds a Venezuelan flag near Miraflores palace.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersWho is Nicolás Maduro and why did Trump capture him?Maduro has been the president of Venezuela since 2013. Theformer bus driverrose to prominence under Chávez, working as his minister of foreign affairs before becoming the country’s president after Chávez’s death.Maduro’s rule is considered dictatorial, with the UN estimating in 2019 that more than 20,000 Venezuelans were killed in extrajudicial executions. Key institutions, such as the judiciary, have been eroded under Maduro and the rule of law has deteriorated. Relations with the US have also suffered under his rule.Over recent months, Trump has repeatedly called for the ousting of Maduro, accusing him of sending drugs and criminals into the US – a claim experts have said lacks evidence. He also claimed that Maduro was stealing US oil.Despite months of escalating rhetoric, Saturday’s capture of the sitting president arrived without warning and Venezuelan authorities seemed to have been caught off guard by the brazen operation.View image in fullscreenDestroyed vehicles at La Carlota military airbase in Caracas.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersWhat happens next?The future is uncertain. Venezuela’s defence minister has vowed to fight on and has called on citizens to unite to resist the foreign “invasion”, calling resistance to the US a “fight for freedom”.Though Maduro has been captured, Venezuela’s institutions and military appear to be intact. It is unclear if Saturday’s attack on Venezuela was the beginning of a wider conflict or a one-off operation, as Trump said the US retains the right for further military operations in the country. Venezuelan opposition leaders, chief among them the Nobel peace prize winner María Corina Machado, have called for Trump to help support an uprising in the country.What is clear is that the US is determined to play a large role in Venezuela, through the use of military force or otherwise. Trump said on Saturday it will be the US that will be making decisions on what is next for Venezuela.“We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left, or left off,” Trump said. He added that the US is thinking over whether Machado will take over, but said for now, the Venezuelan vice-president is in charge.It was unclear what exactly Trump meant when he said the US would run Venezuela, as there were no signs that the US had taken over the capital and the Venezuelan soldiers remained at their posts at military bases across the country. Trump did not rule out US military boots on the ground, but said that Venezuelan officials were agreeable to his demands – a sharp contrast to the defiant statements of officials in the hours after Maduro’s capture.The US has in the past carried outwar gamesto simulate a scenario where Venezuelan leadership was “decapitated”. The simulations predicted prolonged chaos, with refugees pouring out of Venezuela and rival groups fighting one another for control of the country.“You’d have prolonged chaos … with no clear way out,” Douglas Farah, a Latin America expert who helped run the war games, said.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS foreign policyHugo ChávezexplainersShareReuse this content"

Or perhaps a festive display of pyrotechnics over Venezuela’s mountain-flanked capital.“I thought it might be fireworks,” Carlos Hurtado, a resident of the 23 de Enero housing estate on the city’s west side, recalled of the moment he was woken by a mysterious sequence of rumblings and explosions.But as plumes of smoke rose over the country’s largest city, air raid sirens rang out, and WhatsApp groups lit up with shaky mobile-phone videos of tangerine-coloured explosions, it became clear that the pre-dawn detonations were not the result of a natural disaster or defective appliance.After five months of intensifying US military pressure,Venezuela was under attack, with missiles raining down on army bases, airfields and key infrastructure across the capital and the surrounding region.Map of reported targets of US strikes on Caracas and the surrounding region“They are bombing La Carlota and they’re bombing Fuerte Tiuna,” one resident of a middle-class area called Sebucán warned neighbours in a six-second voice message, referring to two of the city’s most important military installations. La Carlota is an airbase in the heart of Caracas; Fuerte Tiuna is a heavily fortified military complex, long believed to have been the home of Venezuela’s president,Nicolás Maduro.Video footage captured by a group of hikers who were reportedly camping on the mountains overlooking Caracas was reminiscent of images of the “shock and awe” air campaign against Baghdad in March 2003.2:18Venezuela in state of emergency after US strikes and capture of Maduro – video report“You couldn’t see the planes, but you could hear them soaring through the sky,” said Ligia Uribe de Torres, 74, whose apartment overlooks La Carlota’s runway.Ricardo Sans, 69, an engineer who lives in the mountains around Caracas, recalled leaping out of bed and throwing himself to the ground after hearing a loud “vibration” at about 2am.Looking out his window, Sans saw between four and six helicopters flying directly over his house in the darkness, and smoke billowing out from a defensive position near another of Caracas’s most symbolic addresses: the Cuartel de la Montaña barracks where the remains of Maduro’s mentor, Hugo Chávez, were put on display after his death in 2013.Unlike other bleary-eyed residents, Sans had no doubt what he was witnessing and began calling friends and relatives. “I immediately thought it was what most of Venezuela had been waiting for – and it was indeed so,” he said.View image in fullscreenPeople running along a street in Caracas after explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APThe precise details of the US aerial assault on Venezuela, later confirmed by Donald Trump and Venezuelan authorities, remain unclear.But as day broke over Caracas, its residents – and the world – received more sensational news. Trump announced that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been “captured” during the raid and flown to a naval warship in the Caribbean Sea.“They got taken out in a matter of seconds. I’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump told Fox News.Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, accused the couple of being “international narco traffickers”, saying on social media: “They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”Citing US officials, CBS News reported that Maduro had been seized by members of the elite army unit Delta Force, which was responsible for the 2019 killing of the Islamic State leaderAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi. There was speculation the raid had been conducted with help from an elite army helicopter unit calledthe Night Stalkers, whose pilots were involved in the 2011 killing of the al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.Speaking on Saturday afternoon, Trump and top military officials offered further details of how Maduro and Flores had been tracked to a “very highly guarded … fortress” during what the president called Operation Absolute Resolve.“They got taken out in a matter of seconds,” Trump said of the couple, claiming Maduro had unsuccessfully tried to flee into a safe room. “He was trying to get into it, but he got bum rushed so fast that he didn’t get into that,” the US president said, adding that while some US forces had been hit, none had been killed. Troops carried a blowtorch to cut their way through steel doors.The chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Dan Caine, said the special forces team had reached Maduro’s residence at about 2am. Troops engaged in “multiple self-defence engagements” as they made their escape from Venezuelan territory.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Nicolás Maduro, his wife, Celia Flores, and the minister of defence, Vladimir Padrino López.Photograph: Ronald Pena R/EPAMaduro’s allies, including the defence minister, Gen Vladimir Padrino López, and the interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, denounced the US “invasion” and urged citizens to take up arms against the foreign aggressors. “We forcefully reject this criminal, vile and fascist Yankee imperialist attack on our homeland,” Carmen Meléndez, the mayor of Caracas, told state-run TV, calling on citizens to rally around Venezuela’s “valiant … great helmsman”.Speaking by telephone to the same network, the vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, demand​ed immediate proof from the White House that Maduro and Flores were alive. She also called on citizens to resist, although Reuters reported that Rodríguez was herself in Moscow.Apart from the squawk of the yellow and blue “guacamaya” macaws for which Caracas is famed, many of the city’s streets were eerily silent on Saturday morning as people braced for an uncertain future. “Right now it seems like a pandemic morning … You can’t hear a single car,” said one resident. “It’s like waking up in the middle of lockdown.”Trump officials celebrated the supposed start of a new era for the oil-rich country after Maduro’s 12-year grip on power was seemingly broken, 18 months after he was accused of stealing the 2024 election. “A new dawn for Venezuela! The tyrant is gone,” tweeted Christopher Landau, the US deputy secretary of state.2:27What we know about the US attack on Venezuela – video analysisBut in Caracas many doubted democratic change was nigh. There was no immediate sign that the apparent winner of the 2024 election, Edmundo González, would be able to return from exile with his main ally, the Nobel peace prize winner María Corina Machado. In a statement, Machado said she was preparing to take power and that Venezuela was entering “decisive hours”.Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, said: “It seems, from what I’m seeing so far, that this was an operation to remove Maduro from power – but it’s not regime change. The regime remains in power.”View image in fullscreenMilitary personnel guarding the perimeter of the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas after the attacks.Photograph: Miguel Gutiérrez/EPAGunson said he believed it was possible the US blitz would precipitate an armed uprising against what was left of Maduro’s nominally leftist regime. But it seemed more likely that another hardliner from Maduro’s political movement would simply fill his shoes, plunging the country even deeper into dictatorship.“Venezuelans could end up being worse off, ironically, after the departure of Maduro. It’s very early days … but this is certainly not a moment to be hanging out the bunting and opening the champagne,” Gunson said. “This is just the beginning.”Hurtado said that after the attack, members of pro-regime paramilitary gangs known as “colectivos” had taken to the streets of his neighbourhood in commando gear.“We don’t know whether they will allow us to go out and buy food, or whether there will be free movement. Normally at this time of year there’s always a party, but right now there’s no one – [it’s] like there’s been a blackout, everything is silent.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaUS foreign policyTrump administrationNicolás MaduroAmericasUS politicsUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

And how do we actually begin to do something and address that?”One of the biggest issues was the levels of shame and stigma associated with porn use that creates “a sense of growing isolation because you’re not talking about it”, said Hall.Because of this, she set up the not-for-profit servicePivotal Recovery, an online self-help resource that can act as a starting point for people struggling with problematic porn use.Hall, who has written several books on the subject, founded theLaurel Centre, which specialises in treating sex and porn addiction. It also trains therapists in helping their clients with the problem, a service that is getting “busier and busier”.It is common for people not to initially recognise they have a problem, she said, and to first seek treatment for something else. Clients are often referred from couples counselling or through therapy for anxiety or depression, or other addictions.Hall described porn addiction as a spectrum disorder that can start out a something recreational but “builds into more problematic use, it becomes more and more habitual, becomes a way of escaping uncomfortable emotions”.She wanted to challenge the stigma about seeking help and called for more awareness and early intervention before people became dependent on it as their main coping strategy.Hall said: “The average person struggling with their usage, this being a problem, is a narrative that’s not really come out much to date. And the more we talk about that, I think the more people are going to start coming forward for help.”Andrew Harvey, a BACP-accredited therapist in Nottingham who works with clients with addiction, said porn addiction often causes serious personal issues.“They’re neglecting maybe their studies, work, or often the intimacy with their partner is suffering.“Online porn can deliver huge amounts of novelty or difference. And that, from a stimulation perspective, for some folks, can be more so than their partner, and once they feel compelled and out of control around that, then their intimacy with their partner suffers and [porn] becomes their only intimacy, so there’s an escalation.”On top of that, many sufferers also expressed concern over seeking out more extreme content over time to satisfy their compulsion, he said. Sometimes this would cause confusion, especially when they felt it did not align with their sexual preferences.While there is a debate about whether pornography can be addictive in the truest sense, many sufferers find it encroaches enormously into their day-to-day activities, with some users watching porn for hours on end and unable to complete daily tasks as a result.Harvey said: “Anecdotally, for many of us who work in the field, it certainly looks and feels a lot like addiction. And I think clients come with what they describe as addiction because that’s what’s in that discourse, and certainly their experience is very addictive-like.”He said treatment was not about banning or abstaining from anything sexual, and that there were ways in which people felt they benefited from porn, for example, in understanding their sexuality.“I hope the outcome is that people find joy within their sexual being rather than something that feels out of control and is hurting them,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPornographySexHealthHealth policyRelationshipsMennewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities planned to look into whether the sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar.The process of identifying the dead and injured continued on Saturday as relatives waited, desperate for news.Officials said they would also look at other safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes. The region’s senior prosecutor has warned of possible prosecutions if any criminal liability is found.The Valais region’s top security official, Stéphane Ganzer, told SRF public radio on Saturday that “such a huge accident with a fire inSwitzerlandmeans that something didn’t work – maybe the material, maybe the organisation on the spot”. He added: “Something didn’t work and someone made a mistake, I am sure of that.”Nicolas Féraud, who heads the Crans-Montana municipality, told RTS radio he was convinced checks on the bar had not been lax, the broadcaster reported.Explore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

These figures relate to the number of convictions rather than the number of people convicted.Life sentences can be given to child rapists at a judge’s discretion under existing rules, with an offence range of six to 19 years for offences against children under 13.Reform said the policy had been “factored in” to itsplans to free up prison capacityby deporting foreign criminals to their country of origin and building “Nightingale prisons”.Yusuf said: “For too long, Conservative and Labour governments have failed to protect our children.“A Reform government will introduce mandatory minimum life sentences for those who rape children. It is shameful that this is not already the law.“It is a stain on our national conscience that grooming gangs were allowed to operate for years with impunity, and in many cases still do. Under Conservative governments, the average sentence for the rape of a child under 13 fell to as little as nine years.“Some grooming gang child rapists have received sentences as low as four years. Under Labour, violent offenders are now being released early from prison.”Number of people who say Britons must be ‘born British’ is rising, study showsRead moreWhole-life orders differ from standard life sentences, whereby a minimum term is served before parole, and are given in cases where the crime was deemed so serious that the offender should never be released from prison.According to the Sentencing Council, there were 70 whole-life prisoners as of March 2025 with recent examples including child serial killer Lucy Letby in 2023, Sarah Everard’s murderer Wayne Couzens in 2021, and Ali Harbi Ali, who murdered MP Sir David Amess in Southend in 2021.A government spokesperson said: “While sentencing sits with the independent judiciary, judges can and do hand down long terms, including life sentences, for these sickening criminals.“Recognising the national emergency violence against women and girls has become, this government is delivering the biggest overhaul of child protection measures in decades.“We are creating a clear legal duty to treat grooming as an explicit aggravating factor in sentencing for child sexual offences whenever it plays a part.“The Independent Inquiry into Grooming Gangs is now under way, with a chair appointed and progress being made toward securing answers for victims and survivors.”In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

Speaking to broadcasters, the PM said: “It’s obviously a fast-moving situation and we need to establish all of the facts.“The UK was not involved in any way in this operation, and as you would expect we are focusing on British nationals in Venezuela and working very closely with our embassy, and so we want to talk to the president, I will want to talk to allies, but at the moment we need to establish the facts.”View image in fullscreenVenezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who have been captured by US forces and flown out of the country.Photograph: Rayner Peña R/EPAHe added that he was waiting for more details to emerge from a press conference to be held by Trump later on Saturday.Starmer said: “I always say and believe we should all uphold international law, but I think at this stage, a fast-moving situation, let’s establish the facts and take it from there.”The prime minister has been urged to denounce the operation by US forces. The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, said the action was “illegal” and could embolden other world leaders.In a post on X, he said: “Keir Starmer should condemn Trump’s illegal action in Venezuela.“Maduro is a brutal and illegitimate dictator, but unlawful attacks like this make us all less safe. Trump is giving a green light to the likes of Putin and Xi to attack other countries with impunity.”The Green party leader, Zack Polanski, agreed, posting on the same platform that Starmer and Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, should oppose it.Polanski said: “After years of arming a genocide and worshipping the ‘special relationship’, Trump now believes he can act with impunity.”Trump says US will be ‘very strongly involved’ in Venezuela’s oil industry after military attackRead morePolanski later responded to Starmer’s comments and said: “Starmer says he wants to establish facts by watching Donald Trump’s press conference. People said giving [Trump] a second state visit was a genius move of strategy – really seems to have paid off.“Special relationship – alive and kicking.”The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, called the operation “unorthodox” and acknowledged it had broken international law. However, he added: “If [it] makes China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing.“I hope the Venezuelan people can now turn a new leaf without Maduro.”The shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, said “nobody will shed tears” that Maduro has been “removed”.The Conservative frontbencher said: “We have always strongly condemned Maduro’s brutal and repressive regime and the Conservative government did not consider Maduro’s administration as legitimate.“Nobody will shed tears for him being removed.“We await the full facts about the US operation which has removed Maduro and we want to see the Venezuelan people enjoy democratic norms and freedoms.

Power should be restored to other homes by early Sunday.“We are dealing with a particularly serious power outage affecting tens of thousands of households and businesses, including care facilities, hospitals, numerous social institutions and companies,” said Franziska Giffey, Berlin’s senator for economic affairs.The local district heating system, which transports heat around a pipe network in the area, is affected as it is powered by electricity.Stromnetz Berlin warned that repair work would “take a very long time”, with media reports saying that cold weather was hindering efforts to lay new underground cables.Police deployed about 160 officers to the site of the incident in the Lichterfelde area and said they were “investigating on suspicion of arson”.They drove vans equipped with loudspeakers through the affected areas, urging residents to stay with friends or relatives elsewhere if possible, use mobile phones sparingly and ensure they had torches to hand.Local train stations were affected, with electronic information signs and ticket machines not working – although the trains were still running.Giffey said Saturday’s outage was worse than one in September, when tens of thousands were also left without power in Berlin after a fire hit electricity pylons. Police also suspected arson in that case, and an unnamed anarchist group claimed responsibility online for starting the blaze.Germany has been on high alert for sabotage activities directed at its infrastructure, including from foreign actors such as Russia.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He leaned against the drinks table and let it take all his weight, clasped his face in his hands, cried a little. As if only just feeling the shape and hue of the unspeakable thing he had just done. As if some act of great violence had just left his hands. Perhaps it had.And before the double world champion, before the social media phenomenon, before the commercial giant, before the global icon, there wasLuke Littlerthe darts obsessive. A kid steeped and stewed in the heritage of the game, fully aware of the landmarks he is now chasing, the tapestry of greatness into which he is now indelibly woven.‘I’m here to win’: champion Luke Littler has ominous words for his rivalsRead morePerhaps in hindsight there was an element of wish fulfilment in the way we – the pundits, the public, the punters – had tried to will this final into a contest. Gian van Veen came into game on the back of the greatest season of his life, as the only player on tour with a winning head-to-head record against Littler in 2025. But in dismantling the Dutchman 7-1 in a little over 40 minutes, the 18-year-old again demonstrated that over the longest format and under the highest pressure, he remains untouchable.There was blood on the board and a wasp on the oche, but nothing could throw him off balance. And perhaps the unique genius of Littler is the ability to locate the effortless flow state that produces great darts and to live in it, breathe in it, turn those seven feet of pure windless air into his home and his castle. To whisk sets away from you in the space of two or three minutes of pure magic, and do it again and again. He doesn’t get in the zone. He is the zone. The zone is Littler-shaped.He nails the relentless consistency that creates opportunities, and the big moments that seize them. He can speed it up and slow it down. His averages this tournament: 102, 97, 107, 107, 100, 105, 106. And above all he masters the visceral quality of combat darts, aware that this sport is essentially an act of showmanship. You create a character, project an aura, burnish a brand. Throw the right darts at the right time, ride the energy, harness the noise, and you can suck the very essence out of your opponent.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler holds the trophy aloft after winning his second world title.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnd this was essentially what happened to Van Veen. He didn’t play a bad game – average 100.0, 38% on his doubles – but both were down on his best, a measure of the sheer stress he was under. He won the first set, missed darts for the second, and “that was probably the game”, as he put it brutally afterwards. “Luke Humphries and Gary Anderson always put you under pressure. But this is different pressure.”Stung into action after going behind, Littler put together the sort of surge no player on the planet can cope with: a terrifying blend of anger and calmness, a man in utter command of his emotions. There was a big fish to take the third set. There were crucial double-fives. There were 16 180s. Almost a fifth of his visits ended with three trebles. “On stage at times,” he said immodestly but truthfully, “I’m unstoppable.”And before long, he stood a leg away, 327 to get. Hit a maximum. Hit a treble-20. Hit a treble-19. Hit the double-15 to unleash chaos, a millionaire’s finish to claim a million-pound prize. He didn’t throw a nine-darter in the end, but at least he got a 147.View image in fullscreenGian van Veen won the first set but it was all downhill from there.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe first ever £1m cheque in darts is a once-unthinkable windfall that owes itself not entirely but largely to the Littler effect: an electrifying ripple of attention and interest that has drawn in the younger audiences other sports spend decades trying to chase down. Quite apart from his brilliance, Littler gets the intensely visual appeal of darts, celebrating memorably, interacting with the crowd, albeit not always in the most cordial way.The boy is now a man, and how the paying public respond to this era of sublime dominance remains to be seen. The sport has broadened and deepened immeasurably since the dominance Phil Taylor enjoyed in the 1990s and 2000s. Taylor’s 16 titles still feels impossibly remote, but there are other records and milestones to chase in the meantime. The World Masters later this month is one of the two remaining majors he is yet to win, along with the European Championship in October, which will require him to conquer the hostile German crowds.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But set aside the numbers and the monuments, and perhaps Littler’s greatest gift to us is the sheer joy of brilliance: the haptic rush of seeing a skill perfected, of talent in its fullest expression, of an athlete and an audience in perfect harmony.Sir Chris Hoy was on stage to present the trophy. Terminally ill with cancer, the great man doesn’t have many nights left, but he wanted to spend one of them at the darts. To be where life is, a place where the humdrum everyday can be inflected with fun and flamboyance and colour. And on nights like this, where the genius of the individual and the genius of the collective collide, there is no better place on earth to be.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipLuke LittlerDartsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both agreed, the adviser said, that there should be a deliberate strategy to undermine the government on all its legislation, to slow down debate, and to push the new Lords leader, Angela Smith, to ask No 10 for concessions.Another recalled a Tory peer gleefully telling the newLabourLords appointees: “We are going to grind you down.”Even with an enormous majority in the Commons, Labour has seemed to struggle to pass much of its programme. But by far the hardest slog has been in the Lords.Labour may yet be on course for a record number of defeats for any governing party, although the parliamentary session has been longer than normal.Already Labour has faced 111 defeats, with at least four more months to go. The record is 128 defeats for theConservatives, under Boris Johnson during the 2021-22 session.Labour peers said virtually every bill had been slowed down, from key manifesto pledges on water regulation to rail nationalisation, Great British Energy and the football regulator. The employment rights bill was repeatedly rejected, even after a major concession.Amendments are being “de-grouped” at late stages into smaller groups of one or two, meaning debates last hours longer. “Each time it is more or less the same people,” one Labour peer said. “Former Tory MPs, making the same kind of speeches over and over again.”“The usual channels are not operating,” another Labour peer said. “The conventions do not apply. It’s essentially a particular group of former Tory MPs who act like they are still in the Commons but actually have more power to cause disruption, because they can intervene, they can try to adjourn, they can push anything to a vote, they basically don’t give a fuck about how the Lords normally operates.”Alice Lilly, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government, said the figures did show a House of Lords that was inflicting more and more defeats on the government, but that that was a growing trend, including when the Tories were in power.“The figures do create this picture of the Lords as being a bit more assertive, and that doesn’t necessarily mean that governments aren’t getting their way,” she said. “The government made concessions on the day-one rights for the employment rights bill, but also, that was a choice.”In reality – apart from the employment rights bill wherethe government conceded on day-one rightsin order to get the bill passed faster – there have been few bills where the Lords have directly forced concessions.Still, the disruption has convinced some to think more radically about what reforms might be needed.Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said that although he expected peers to fight the employment rights bill, “it felt to me absolutely untenable that you had unelected peers holding up what was a clear manifesto commitment from a government that won a majority of 170 seats.“I do think it raises real questions. I think it speaks to the arrogance on those benches, to be honest with you.”Whips have noticed that the numbers they would expect for a vote are now far higher. The Conservatives can turn out about 180 peers for votes, with Labour able to muster about 140.Among the Labour whips, peers are now running a rota to keep far larger numbers in the house because of the risk of Conservatives calling for adjournment. “It erodes good will because you have to keep people hanging around,” one said.Another peer said they had noticed a decisive shift in the way parliament operated since Labour won its majority.“I think we had a rose-tinted view. We usually played ball in opposition, especially on manifesto stuff,” they said. “It will make a difference to our numbers for sure when the hereditaries go in May. But it won’t be enough.”Most peers who spoke to the Guardian said the manifesto pledge to abolish hereditary peers, which will see all remaining 92 hereditary members leave at the end of the parliament, had been the moment the Conservatives decided to no longer abide by conventions.Half of those due to be expelled sit on the Tory benches. Most of the others are crossbench and just four are Labour.Every stage of the bill to abolish hereditary peers Lords has resulted in considerable disruption in the Lords, as well as demands in private meetings for compensation for removed peers.‘We have to go’: longest-serving lord reflects on looming Labour evictionRead moreDuring the first vote on hereditary peers, a sponsor spent £20,000 to hire the Lords’ Cholmondeley Room for dinner and drinks to keep peers on the estate to vote it down.“There is something quite perverse about claiming that you are defending the hereditary peers because you care just so much about the sanctity of the Lords and then doing all these kind of dirty tricks,” one peer said.But several pointed out that the Conservatives had done little to protect the departing peers. “If Kemi Badenoch really cared about the hereditary peers then she would have used her own slots to convert some of them into life peers but she did not,” one Lords source said.Because of the multiple revolts, Labour has done what it criticised the Conservatives for doing: giving peerages to close allies, from former advisers to union officials, and staff members, some of whom needed cover for an awkward departure.They includeStarmer’s ousted chief of staff Sue Gray,his former spokesperson Matthew Doyle, Rachel Reeves’s senior staffer Katie Martin, and Liz Lloyd, who worked under Starmer and Tony Blair in the No 10 policy unit.“We could be giving them to much better people,” one senior Labour source grumbled. “I’m not sure why we are handing them out as consolation prizes to former advisers.”But in No 10, there was recognition that the peerages list had to match the vigour of the new Tory peers – many of them recently departed MPs – who wanted to be fulltime legislators. “We need the political people in there who can make it their job,” one senior source said.Oncethe latest additions to the Lordsare counted, the Conservatives will still have significantly more peers – 285 to Labour’s 234. But there are others who the Tories can often count on, including some crossbenchers. Whips say the Tories can bolster their numbers by another 15-20 on crunch votes.The Liberal Democrats, who will have 78 peers, have often voted against the government, including on employment rights. But the Tories will lose 44 hereditary peers at the end of the session in May.“The Tories went ballistic when we only offered them three,” one government source said. “But the idea is try to build towards parity.”Some peers argue that a more activist House of Lords has been necessary because of the sheer number of bills that arrive from the Commons in an imperfect condition, with new MPs seemingly less concerned with their job as legislators and more with directly representing their constituents or campaigning on their own interests.“The Commons bills have been rushed through,” one peer said. “They are not fit for purpose.”On the assisted dying bill, one of the most controversial bills of the parliament which has faced significant disruption in the Lords, opponents have made the case that because it is a private member’s bill, it has not had the kind of consultative process it needs. More than 1,000 amendments have been submitted.But its supporters believe there is a core group of hardline peers who oppose the principle and are using procedural tactics to talk out the bill, which will fall if it is not passed at the end of the session. Seven of the most vocal opponents to the bill have put forward more than 600 amendments between them.In the new year, the campaign group Unlock Democracy will turn its focus to Lords reform and says it will put the spotlight on a small number of influential peers who it believes are blocking the bill’s progress. While the group does not take a position on the issue of assisted dying, it says it is fundamentally a democratic issue.Its chief executive, Tom Brake, a former Lib Dem MP, said the “glacial progress” of both the assisted dying bill and the hereditary peers bill “make an incontrovertible case for radical reform of the House of Lords. This must go far beyond a retirement age and participation test and tightening up appointments.”Things are unlikely to get easier for Labour as it pursues those further changes. Last week Lady Smith announced that a committee will consider the next stage of reform promised by Labour in its manifesto: a retirement age of 80 plus potentially mandating how often peers must be present and engage in parliament.The committee, featuring four Labour and four Tory peers, plus two Liberal Democrats and two crossbenchers, will consider the plans over the next six months.Lilly said the new generation of peers might arguably be making a case for reform “in the way they don’t intend to”. But she said that ultimately the elected government was getting its way, and that the disruption should raise questions for governments about the state of legislation arriving from the Commons.“We’ve seen the government using framework bills, where they’re basically introducing a bill to parliament before they’ve properly figured out the actual details of it, and they’re asking parliament to pass it and then fill in the details later with secondary legislation.“I think there’s always a question now for governments: if we’re seeing the Lords being more assertive, have you got the plans in place to deal with that?”"

We did a very small help because we had no working ability with the governor. The governor was a disaster and the mayor was a disaster.”Then Trump pivoted to fires and “riots” in Los Angeles, lamenting: “We did a great job. Got no credit for it whatsoever, but that’s OK, it doesn’t matter. We don’t need the credit.”Standing to Trump’s right, Marco Rubio, secretary of state, remained inscrutable.The president continues to settle scores. While praising the current military leadership involved in the Venezuela raid, he complained about generals he worked with previously. He said: “I worked with some I didn’t like. I worked with some I didn’t respect.” This was in contrast with Gen Dan “Raizin” Caine, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, whose name is a source of childlike fascination for Trump.Trump was grilled about why, yet again, he had failed to tell members of Congress what he was up to. He shot back with gripes about their trustworthiness, stating: “Congress has a tendency to leak ... Congress will leak and we don’t want leakers.”Later, he was asked about his pardoning of Juan Orlando Hernández,the former president of Honduras, who had been convicted of drug trafficking. How could he square this with the purported crackdown on narco-terrorist Maduro?When in doubt, blame former president Joe Biden. Trump asserted that Hernández “was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump”, using the third person as a rhetorical flourish: “That didn’t work out too well for them. This was a man who was persecuted very unfairly.”Indeed, Trump mentioned his predecessor half a dozen times. “What Joe Biden administration’s did to our country should never be forgotten,” he said. If Trump had lost the 2024 election, he claimed, the US would have become “Venezuela on steroids”.After nearly an hour, the final question was about Russia’s war in Ukraine. Another chance to bash Biden:“Look, that’s Biden’s war. That’s not my war … If I were president, it would have never happened. Putin says it, everybody says it.”Love it or loathe it, Trump had just done something big and historic that made the whole world sit up and take notice. He had shaken the kaleidoscope of the rules-based order and tried to make American interventionism great again despite the reservations of his support base. Yet here he was still getting peevish about perceived slights, ingratitudes and injustices.Trump is a man who is comfortable in his skin. But as a recent media report on the 79-year-old’s state of health noted, his hand has become so delicate that it started bleeding when Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring while giving the president a high-five. The world’s most powerful man is also its most thin-skinned.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS militaryUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now in the custody of US authorities, he will face indictment on narcotics charges and a potentially long prison sentence.Venezuelans will judge him too. Maduro’s rule shattered Venezuela’s economy, leading millions of his countrymen and women to flee overseas to escape an incompetent, corrupt, repressive and often brutal government.Born on 23 November 1962, Maduro began his political career as president of the student union at José Ávalos high school in El Valle, a working-class neighbourhood on the outskirts of the capital, Caracas.View image in fullscreenNicolás Maduro addresses the National Assembly in Caracas in March 2015.Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/ReutersRecords show he never graduated, but he was remembered as an imposing and conciliatory figure. In 1986 he travelled to Cuba where he received his only formal education after high school. He worked as a bus driver for the Caracas subway system on his return and quickly became a union leader, like his father before him, and an enthusiastic follower of Chávez.In the mid-1990s, he joined the political movement that Chávez organised after receiving a presidential pardon for leading a failed and bloody military coup. When Chávez eventually took office in 1998, the younger man’s loyalty, political skill and ideological commitment led to a rapid rise through the ranks of Venezuela’s ruling party. After six years in the national assembly, Maduro was made foreign minister, before being appointed vice-president six years later.View image in fullscreenGovernment supporters display posters of Nicolás Maduro, right, and Hugo Chávez in Caracas, Venezuela, on 3 January.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APWhen Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he named the burly, moustachioed Maduro as his successor. Many mocked Maduro’s working-class roots and portrayed him as a loud-mouthed clown who did little more than slavishly repeat Chávez’s bombastic rhetoric. It was true that Maduro had little of his mentor’s charisma, but he won a narrow victory that year and his first six-year term.Almost immediately, Maduro’s presidency was plunged into crisis. The political opposition, including the now-Nobel peace prize winnerMaría Corina Machado, called for street protests in Caracas and other cities. Security forces did not hold back as they crushed the demonstrations, which ended with 43 deaths and dozens of arrests.The ruling United Socialist party of Venezuela would go on to lose control of the national assembly for the first time in 16 years in the 2015 election. This prompted Maduro to neutralise the opposition-controlled legislature by establishing a pro-governmentconstituent assemblyin 2017, leading to new rounds of protest that were also violently suppressed.Why has US attacked Caracas and captured Venezuela’s president?Read moreHundreds were arrested, causing the international criminal court to open an investigation against Maduro and members of his government for crimes against humanity. More than 100 people were killed and thousands injured in the demonstrations.Then, in 2018, Maduro survived an assassination attempt when drones rigged with explosives detonated near him as he delivered a speech during a nationally televised military parade in Caracas.By now, the economy was in freefall, racked by hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials. Oil production dropped to less than 400,000 barrels a day, a figure once unthinkable.View image in fullscreenPro-government armed civilians block streets in Caracas, Venezuela, on 3 January.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APIn the 2018 presidential election, Maduro ran virtually unopposed and was declared winner, but dozens of countries did not recognise him. Opposition parties were blocked from the ballot. Some opposition politicians were imprisoned; others fled into exile.Washington was watching closely. The firstTrump administrationimposed economic sanctions on Maduro, his allies and state-owned companies to try to force a government change but this had a limited effect on the powerful complex of military, paramilitary and party backers which increasingly made up Maduro’s support base. It did underline the increasing likelihood of a serious confrontation, however.2:18Venezuela in state of emergency after US strikes and capture of Maduro – video reportWith his back to the wall, Maduro implemented economic reforms and offered concessions to the US-backed political opposition, boosting hopes of a free and democratic presidential election in 2024.These would soon be disappointed. In 2023, the government banned Machado, Maduro’s strongest opponent, from running for office. In early 2024 came new crackdowns on opposition leaders and human rights defenders.Hours after polls closed in the 2024 election, the national electoral council declared Maduro the winner, but provided no detailed vote counts. Tally sheets collected by the opposition from more than 80% of electronic voting machines used in the electionshowed a massive defeat for the incumbent. Protests were crushed and the national assembly swore in Maduro for a third term in January 2025.View image in fullscreenMaduro with his wife, Cilia Flores, arrive at the National Assembly for his swearing-in ceremony for a third term in Caracas, Venezuela, on 10 January 2025.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APTrump’s return to the White House that same month led to rapid escalation. By the summer, the US had built up a military force in the Caribbean that put Venezuela’s government on high alert, and started taking drastic steps to address what it called narco-terrorism, blowing boats suspected of carrying drugs out of the water andkilling more than 100 people.Throughout his career, Maduro was often flanked by his wife, Cilia Flores, who held numerous high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament, and was often seen as a power broker with as much influence as her spouse. She is also thought to have been seized by the US.Maduro’s tenacity and tactical skill often surprised opponents who wrote him off too early. This time it looks like there will be no comeback.Explore more on these topicsNicolás MaduroVenezuelaAmericasUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsHugo ChávezfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And over this same period of time, Epstein avoided serious and meaningful punishment for his crimes.The US justice department’s recent disclosure of long-secret investigative files related to Epstein has once again raised the question of why he wasn’t interdicted sooner, despite numerous reports of misconduct. The issue has been the subject of many conspiracy theories, often focusing on the idea that Epstein – who lived at the center of a network of powerful people – enjoyed some form of protection.Some never-before-seen documents recently released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, as well as previously public filings tucked deep into prior civil litigation included in these disclosures, spell out numerous missed opportunities to stop Epstein before his 2019 arrest and subsequent suicide in prison.Longtime attorneys told the Guardian that there are multiple reasons why this might have occurred.“The Epstein and Maxwell problem is twofold. First, law enforcement agencies, especially at the local level, do not communicate well with one another,” Neama Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, said. “Second, prosecutors are risk-averse and do not want to prosecute difficult cases.”More, authorities can see sexual abuse cases as risky propositions in terms of success.“Sexual assault and sexual abuse prosecutions are often ‘he said, she said’ cases where the defense argues consent, or that the sexual contact never happened,” Rahmani said, explaining that prosecutors are expected to win every time. “They may hesitate taking difficult cases to trial, especially against defendants with significant resources.”“Cynics may also argue that Epstein wasn’t prosecuted because of his friendships with powerful elected officials. Some of this case has changed with #MeToo, more victims coming forward and being willing to testify, and more resources and changes in philosophy when it comes to prosecuting sex crimes,” Rahmani said.“But it’s still not enough and the victims were let down.”Indeed, the chronology of Epstein’s repeated mentions and investigations could suggest both an abject lack of communication as well as an overall lack of interest regarding complaints against him.There was Maria Farmer’s FBI report in 1996. Farmer, whose sister Annie was abused by Epstein, told authorities that Epstein “stole” photographs and film negatives of her sisters, and was “believed to have sold the pictures to potential buyers”.While the case type was listed as “child pornography” in this report, police did not act. Epstein, unencumbered by criminal investigation, went on to abuse numerous teen girls in the following years.Then came Alicia Arden’s police report in 1997. Arden said Epsteingropedher during what was supposed to be a modeling interview for Victoria’s Secret.Arden, who was 27 at the time,saidSanta Monica police blamed her rather than take action. “They said I went up to the hotel room willingly and that I intimidate men because of my appearance. I told police that I did not ask or give permission to be touched or to have Epstein start taking my clothes off. I thought I was going to a legitimate audition.”In 2001,Ghislaine Maxwell– who in 2021 was found guilty of aiding Epstein’s abuse of teen girls – drew police attention after accosting three Palm Beach college students. “Maxwell said she needed young, beautiful, unmarried women to answer phones and do office work at her home on Palm Beach,” the police report said.At least one of the students went to the house on several occasions and “described the telephone calls as men call[ing] in saying when they were going to drop of[f] particular girls”. Police investigated, including searching Epstein’s trash for potential evidence, ultimately concluding that while there was unusual activity at his south Florida mansion, “at this time, no illegal activity has been reported or detected”.Then came 2004. In August of that year, a taxi driver “flagged down” a police officer. The cabbie dropped off two females, who seemed to be 15 and 17, at a house that investigators would determine was Epstein’s.“The taxi cab driver stated that he picked the females up in West Palm Beach and while traveling to Epstein’s residence he overheard the females discussing how much money they would make ‘dating’ in Palm Beach and possible drug use,” a police report said.In 2005 and 2006, Palm Beach police interviewed numerous minor victims, and the FBI and US attorney’s office ultimately investigated abuse claims. But Epstein’s case was resolved with a cushy plea deal in 2008 that allowed him to avoid federal charges if he admitted to state-level prostitution charges.Epstein and Maxwell did not disappear. In 2011, a victim of Epstein and allegedly, also of Maxwell, contacted south Florida federal prosecutors.The woman, Virginia Giuffre, lived in Australia and was interviewed by an FBI agent there. Legal representatives for the late Giuffre, who had accused Epstein of trafficking her to high-profile men including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, met with a New York federal prosecutor to discuss Epstein.Mountbatten-Windsor has vehemently denied all allegations of misconduct. The former Duke of York relinquished his royal title amid the Epstein controversy.That prosecutor did not open an investigation following that meeting.Epstein did not face serious charges until 2019, months after a Miami Herald investigation prompted controversy about his plum plea deal. Epstein killed himself in jail weeks after his July 2019 arrest and Maxwell was arrested the next year and convicted of luring teen girls into his abusive world.Advocates for Epstein’s victims have repeatedly condemned local and federal law enforcement for failing to take victims’ claims seriously – enabling his abuse to continue years after initial reports.Lindsay Richards, a criminal defense partner at Coffer and Connelly in Texas, pointed to communication issues, as well as attitudes about sex crimes that were pervasive in the 90s and 2000s. With reports to local law enforcement, “there’s a very good chance there was just no communication between agencies in any way, especially in the 90s”.Federal agencies, on the other hand, “have always had decent communication, especially within the agency”, she said. “So once it became federal, I’m surprised there wasn’t more being done.”The state plea deal, she said, “does seem to be kind of nefarious, in my opinion” but in her experience as a prosecutor who long pursued sex crimes cases, “I really do believe that there were a lot of agencies, and even ones that I worked with, [where] for decades, sexual assault was dismissed.”The attitude with police agencies, she said, was: “You can report it, but these are so hard to prove and they’re so difficult that we’re just not going to really put a lot of time and energy into it.”John Day, founder of John Day Law and a former prosecutor in New Mexico, pointed to seeming intelligence failures when it came to pursuing cases.“Maybe the best explanation is rooted in why all the signals about Bin Laden were ignored until 9/11 – plenty of law enforcement [and] CIA analysts had him on their radar screens, but the information was never collated in a way that got understood until it was too late?” Day said. “Could this have been the equivalent for Epstein?”Day said that investigative failures with Epstein were not equivalent to a 9/11 attack, but noted “these timeframes were roughly parallel”.“I think you can make an argument that the failures of 9/11 to appreciate what information pointed to a pending attack were similar to the failures of law enforcement to understand what Epstein and Maxwell were up to.”But, Day also said: “This is separate from understanding why Epstein got such a sweetheart deal in Florida from US attorney Alexander Acosta.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

What more could you want?Phil HarrisonSat 3 Jan 2026 17.15 ESTShareIt’s hard to imagine a better route into true philosophical inquiry than time in prison. Regret, causality, the nature of freedom: these are urgent issues to the incarcerated. Time is both impossibly empty and passing at terrifying speed. You face endless days and nights with only the inside of your head for company. You are at the sharpest end of practical philosophy, whether you like it or not. What is life for? Could it be changed for the better?Accordingly, the teaching of philosophy in prison is entirely logical. But that depends on who is doing the teaching, and why. This magnificent six-part drama is adapted by Dennis Kelly (with both sitcom romp Pulling and conspiracy epic Utopia on his CV, Kelly is a hard man to predict) from Andy West’s memoir A Life Inside. By becoming a philosophy professor, West – recast here as Dan and brought astonishingly to life by Josh Finan – was escaping his background. But only up to a point. His father, uncle and brother all did time, while he found a different destiny. That didn’t save Andy/Dan from endless, intrusive fantasies that he was doomed to follow them anyway.View image in fullscreenAstonishing … Josh Finan in Waiting for the Out.Photograph: BBC/Sister Pictures/Kerry SpicerDan is a more tormented figure than many of the prisoners. He experiences crippling OCD – indeed, his relentlessly checked, photographed and filmed gas cooker probably deserves a Bafta nomination for the implacable yet weirdly expressive shift it puts in here – and is haunted by imaginary encounters with his long-estranged father. Is he that man? Where do questions around nature and nurture land in relation to him? Once we meet Dan’s father, it’s easy to see how that could become a preoccupation.We flash back to the family car, setting off on a seaside holiday. The pre-pubescent Dan is in the back seat. His brother Lee (more of whom later) is nowhere to be seen. Dad is singing My Way, very aggressively. Dad then proceeds to do it his way for the brief duration of the trip. This means bullying a waiter, drunkenly threatening violence against his family and stealing display jewellery from a shop. His toxic combination of menace and weakness is superbly realised by Gerard Kearns (one of many brilliant performances here). This is Dan’s biological legacy.View image in fullscreenA toxic mix of menace and weakness … Gerard Kearns in Waiting for the Out.Photograph: BBC/Sister Pictures/Kerry SpicerSo to prison. As he begins the job, Dan’s insecurities are clear – he’s bought some steel toe-capped boots in a doomed attempt to project masculinity. While he waits for his first class, his father – who we learn is in prison himself – appears to him. “They won’t get you, boy,” he snarls. “These are fucking men.”But eventually, they do get him. If anything, one or two of them get him slightly too well. It isn’t always the case with dramas set in prisons but these inmates are thoroughly well-written and performed characters, who work wonders with their limited screen-time. Well read, abrasive Keith (Alex Ferns) in particular is potentially Dan’s worst nightmare – his intellectual equal but with jailbird smarts thrown in; a troubling mixture of his world and that of his father. Keith’s nose for bullshit is amusingly acute – at one point he describes Slavoj Zizek as “the Billy Connolly of philosophy”. But his instinct for Dan’s weak spots is dangerous.Dan’s life outside work is an odyssey too. He burns through relationships. He memorably ruins a middle-class dinner party in at least three different ways. But at the heart of the story is his beautifully drawn relationship with his brother Lee (Stephen Wight). As a recovering addict and former prisoner, Lee has been through the mill. Even so, he’s comparatively well-adjusted; comfortable in his own skin. He’s walked in his father’s shoes, and accordingly, doesn’t share Dan’s compulsive curiosity about him. Lee is practically altruistic – the pair spend a night on the druggy trail of a young addict he is mentoring – but he doesn’t understand Dan’s need to see prison from the inside.View image in fullscreenPractically altruistic … Stephen Wight as Lee in Waiting for the Out.Photograph: BBC/Sister Pictures/Kerry SpicerAt certain points, Waiting for the Out could lapse into patronising cliches. Thankfully, it sidesteps them. Is Dan being taught valuable life lessons by these rough diamonds? Not really. Dan is a mess and his life threatens to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. But so are the inmates. Philosophy is a rock to cling to – not as a source of certainty but as an affirmation of chaos. It allows them to hide but it allows them to explore themselves too. The inmates assume he’s gay (they don’t care) and Dan doesn’t correct them. As a warder points out; “You’re living as a closeted heterosexual”. This environment is harsh but it’s counter-intuitively tolerant too. The only taboo is judging others – after all, that’s already happened and they’ve been found wanting.In the end, this is a gripping, moving study in vulnerability and acceptance. The prisoners open up and eventually, so does Dan. In doing so, they admit the capacity for change. Are we simply helpless victims (or indeed, lucky beneficiaries) of the circumstances we inherit? With a mixture of exquisite lightness and overwhelming heaviness,Waiting for the Out suggests that it’s never too late. We can still write our own stories.Waiting for the Out aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

I just think it’s cool that there’s a local fish that people actually go and see and talk about – it’s a special fish.What film do you always return to, and why?The 1942 Ernst Lubitsch film To Be Or Not To Be. I love this film. When I was growing up, it used to come on the ABC every now and again, and one time I videotaped it. I just thought it was so funny. It’s Carole Lombard and Jack Benny. Recently, they were playing it at the Ritz [cinema in Randwick], and it turned out that it was also the favourite film of a friend of mine, and so we went and just laughed and laughed and laughed. It’s such a great piece of comedy and all the actors in it are fantastic. Mel Brooks remade it in the 1980s – that wasn’t successful. But the original film is a brilliant comedy, to be watched regularly.What’s the best lesson you learned from someone you’ve worked with?I was doing A Doll’s House years ago with Pete [Peter O’Brien] – my husband now, but at the time we were not a couple. We were playing opposite each other and on opening night I tripped up – I jumped ahead a few lines in the script. I didn’t know what I’d done [but] I suddenly realised something wasn’t right. I remember looking at him, and he completely saved me in the situation, and then [the scene] took off again and went really, really well. But I think what I learned in that moment was, firstly, always trust the people you’re working with. If you don’t know where you are, if you turn around and look at the people you’re with, you will find where you’re meant to be in some way. It’s such a communal thing, acting on stage. And [secondly] just to have a sense of fun about it. Sometimes when something goes wrong, things actually spark off in a really great direction if you’re really present in that moment. It can be a gift when things go absolutely the wrong way.‘Cosy and comforting’: why The Fellowship of the Ring is my feelgood movieRead moreWhat’s been your most memorable interaction with a fan?It’s not just one particular interaction [but] when I meet fans ofLord of the Rings, particularly women, I hear a lot of stories about what Eowyn meant to them when they were growing up … things that had happened in their lives and how much that character meant to them and was some kind of help to them in those times.What do you get asked about the most byLord of the Ringsfans?The most specific question is always about the stew [that Eowyn serves Aragorn in a scene in the extended cut of The Two Towers]. “Was the stew really that bad?” It’s become such a joke, the whole thing about the stew, and everyone wants to know what was in the stew, and how was it made, and do you think she’s a better cook now, or do you think she reallyisa bad cook? People are, I think, obsessed with the humour of that situation. And I go into great detail describing the [ingredients] that made up the stew – because I remember what they did; like they even put bits of red cotton to make it look like bits of veins in the meat. They went to great detail to make it look as bad as possible.What’s been your most cringeworthy celebrity encounter?I was at a pilates class [in London] and there was a woman lying down doing pilates, and the teacher said to me: “Oh, Miranda, this is Miranda.” And I made some joke about, “oh, are you a journalist?” Because it’s an unusual name and most of the time when someone’s a Miranda, they’re a journalist. I wasn’t really seeing who it was. And when she got up, it wasMiranda Richardson. Then I didn’t know what to say. I still had to stay and do my class, and I felt so embarrassed. I wanted to say: “Oh my gosh, I do know who you are!” I think she’s so fabulous and I was just too starstruck to say anything.It’s been confidently claimed in several articles that you were named after Prospero’s daughter in Shakespeare’sThe Tempest, and yet I’ve read you saying otherwise – can you settle the matter once and for all?Yes – I was named after the Sydney suburb. Mum heard on the radio that they were opening a shopping centre at Miranda, and she thought that sounded like a nice name.View image in fullscreenMarin the cuttlefish, played by Miranda Otto, in 2026 animated film The Pout-Pout Fish.Photograph: Maslow EntertainmentWhat’s the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened on set?When I was working in Brazil [on 2013’s Reaching for the Moon] that was the most chaotic set I’ve ever worked on, and yet the film turned out incredibly well. But they just work in such a different way. The sense of time there is really different. In Australia, you normally have a call sheet, and you have to be on set by a certain time. [But] this was sort of open ended – you come on set whenever you happen to be ready. It was a really different way of working for me. The elements were all coming together at the very last minute, and sometimes they wouldn’t know where they were shooting the next day [or] how we were going to do it. And then you’d be in the middle of the scene and be like, “What was that noise that just interrupted the scene? Oh, it’s the producer popping open some champagne [on set], because he’s making a party.” It turned out great, but wow, it’s a really different style of film-making.‘I once Bogarted a joint from a Beatle’: Stewart Copeland of the PoliceRead moreWhat are you secretly good at?I’ve always been good with numbers. I memorise numbers easier than I memorise words a lot of the time, I’ve just got that kind of a brain. So I think if I hadn’t ended up in acting, I probably would have worked in something to do with numbers, like mathematics or accounting.What’s the best piece of advice you have ever received?When I was in high school, someone came to speak when we were graduating and they said, “don’t be afraid to fail” … which I think is the best piece of advice, because you learn so much more from failure than you learn from success. Success, you never really understand exactly how it happened. Failure, you learn so much more.The Pout-Pout Fish is in Australian cinemas now and in US cinemas on 20 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilm10 Chaotic QuestionsAnimation in filmFamily filmsTheatreLord of the RingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of the most common serious knee injuries is a tear of theanterior cruciate ligament, which crosses diagonally under the kneecap and connects the thigh bone to the shin bone – the same injury that took Matildas star strikerSam Kerrout of the game for over a year.The fascia secret: how does it affect your health – and should you loosen it up with a foam roller?Read moreIt is possible to reduce the risk of knee injuries like this by warming up properly before activity, says physiotherapist Dr Kathryn Mills, from Kensington Physiotherapy and Macquarie University in Sydney. “That’s not going for a run and stretch – it’s doing a designed program that is designed to train both how your muscles are working, the extent to which they’re working, and how your brain is turning on those muscles,” she says.Warm-up activities recommended for preventing ACL injuries include squats, walking lunges, running with high knees, and side-to-side jumps and hops.Maintain healthy weightThe knee is one of the key load-bearing joints of the body, so the greater the load on that joint, the greater the risk of damage over its lifespan. “If you think about how many steps a day someone walks, [that] accumulates over the course of their life, if you’re putting a lot of load on those joints – which can come from body weight – that can be a contributor,” says Prof Rana Hinman, a research physiotherapist at the University of Melbourne. She recommends maintaining a healthy weight for healthy knee joints, both to reduce load and reduce inflammation.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThere’s alsostrong evidencethat in people who are overweight and have knee pain, losing just a small percentage of body weight can significantly reduce their pain and osteoarthritis symptoms, Eyles says.Keep activeOne of the best ways to keep the knees healthy is to keep them moving, says Natalie Collins, an APA sports & exercise physiotherapist and associate professor at the University of Queensland. She advises about 150 minutes of at least moderate physical activity each week, “but also really importantly, building in some resistance training as well, twice a week, where you’re really getting your muscles to have the capacity to do all of the things you need to do in your day, like squat down, go up and down stairs, maybe play sport or run,” Collins says.View image in fullscreenWarming up properly, doing exercises such as leg curls and gradually introducing higher levels of activity over time can help keep your knees in good condition.Photograph: Oranuch Binmohamet/AlamySimple exercises like doing squats or lunges, or standing up from a chair repeatedly are good starting points. If you do have access to gym equipment, she recommends leg extensions – where you straighten your leg from a bent position with the weight on top of your ankle – or leg curls where you lie face down and bend your lower leg up against a weight or resistance band, both of which work the quad and hamstring muscles.Ease into activityDuring Covid lockdowns, many people dealt with cabin fever and gym closures by enthusiastically taking up a new outdoor activity such as running. And while activity is encouraged, it should be introduced in a gradual fashion, says physiotherapist Dr Michael O’Brien, from La Trobe University in Melbourne.“Everyone just got into running or walking, and just did a lot of it very quickly, and ran into a lot of problems in terms of sudden onset of pain doing a lot of an activity that they were not accustomed to,” he says.The key is to expose the body – especially the joints – to that load gradually. “If you want to run a marathon, you don’t decide three weeks beforehand and then just go out and do it,” he says.Mills suggests gradually building up your level of activity. “Start off really small, and every week you can increase by somewhere between about 10% [and] 30%,” she says. “You’ll get to where you want to go and, more importantly, you’ll make a consistent improvement.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe way you moveFitnessAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s far, far simpler than you think …Stop stressing about self‑improvement or waiting until you’re on top of everything. This year give yourself permission to prioritise pleasureOliver BurkemanSat 3 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 16.39 ESTShareIhave a proposal to make: 2026 should be the year that you spend more time doing what you want. The new year should be the moment we commit to dedicating more of our finite hours on the planet to things we genuinely, deeply enjoy doing – to the activities that seize our interest, and that make us feel vibrantly alive. This should be the year you stop trying so hard to turn yourself into a better person, and focus instead on actually leading a more absorbing life.Naturally, I anticipate certain objections to this suggestion.Possibly you consider yourself far too busy even tothinkabout spending time in ways you’d enjoy, and you wonder what sort of monster of privilege could even raise the notion. In this economy, and with AI coming for your job? Or maybe you’re convinced you need to address your personal failings first – your tendency towards procrastination, your sedentary lifestyle, your atrocious diet. On the other hand, maybe you think it’s morally outrageous to focus on yourself while the Earth is overheating, or while the sinister forces of ethnonationalism stalk the land. Or perhaps you’re worried that if you were to let yourself do what you want, you’d find yourself slouched on the sofa, scrolling slack-jawed through Instagram while overconsuming Hula Hoops, or gin, or heroin.None of these objections hold any water, though. In fact, there’s excellent reason to believe that doing more of what you want in 2026 will do nothing but good for your health and wellbeing, for your feelings of overwhelm, and even for the state of society.To see why, consider first the hidden logic of the conventional approach to self-improvement and habit change – the approach that, if it actually worked, would presumably have destroyed the market for further books and courses on self-improvement and habit change some time ago. It starts from the premise that there’s something badly wrong with you, which you need to fix. Then it prescribes the daily behaviours that – were you to follow them with sufficient discipline – might eventually lead you to the point at which you’d be an acceptable member of humanity, and could therefore relax (although not too much, for fear of backsliding).Stay offline by doing things so engaging that it wouldn’t occur to you to drift online in the first placeYet it’s entirely possible that there isn’t anything badly wrong with you, other than the conviction that there’s something badly wrong with you. And even if thereis, it’s not clear that organising your life around the grim struggle to fix it is a particularly effective strategy. It turns every day into a grinding internal struggle between different elements of your psychology. Which can become, ironically, a comfortable way to avoid launching into the life you really want to live – making the career switch that would fulfil you, for example, or daring to commit to a relationship. “Claiming that we are problematic,” the psychotherapist and author Bruce Tift points out, “means we don’t have to engage with our lives fully, because we aren’t ‘ready yet’ – there’s something wrong that needs to be fixed first. [So] we have a good excuse not to show up.”For one vivid illustration of the futility of fixing yourself – and the positive benefits of doing what you want instead – consider the ubiquitous problem of spending too much time online. If you’re prone to pointlessly doomscrolling, or numbing out with superficially amusing entertainment, you’ve probably experimented with multiple ways to stop yourself succumbing to temptation, like Odysseus ordering his sailors to bind him to the mast of his ship, to resist the call of the sirens. But app blockers and strict personal rules rarely seem to work very well, or for very long. (The most effective such intervention I discovered this year is Brick, a tiny device that blocks distracting phone apps, so that you physically have to move yourself and your smartphone to wherever you’ve put the device, in order to regain access. It turns out that there’s one thing more powerful than the lure of online time-wasting, which is the inertia of not wanting to get up and go upstairs to find your Brick.)A much more reliable way to stay offline is just to be doing things so engaging that it wouldn’t occur to you to drift online in the first place. On the few magical days in 2025 that I realised I’d forgotten where my phone even was, it was because I’d become so immersed in reading or writing or conversation or nature that the thought of it had left my mind entirely. “If you want to win the war for attention,” as the New York Timescolumnist David Brooks once put it, “don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the  terrifying longing crowd out everything else.” Or as Katherine Martinko, author of Childhood Unplugged, argues in the context of how parents might encourage their children to spend less time online: “If we want our children to revel in reality, then the most effective way to teach them is to do it ourselves … My advice is to fight [internet dependency] less with fleeting (and unreliable) hacks like time limits, tech‑free zones, digital detoxes, tech fasts, focus mode, and grayscaled screens, and more with an overwhelming love and appreciation for being present, active, and engaged with the real world.”Make time for art or writing or music, or long-neglected friendships, for community activism, or exhilarating escapes into the wildView image in fullscreenIllustration: Ben O’Brien/The GuardianIt isn’t hard to see how you might extend this principle to other domains of life as well. Instead of focusing on the food groups you plan on banning yourself from consuming this year, are there healthier styles of cooking about which you might genuinely enjoy learning – so that by the time you might normally be reaching for an inadvisable sort of snack, you’re already too full of nutritious food to want one? Instead of concocting a workout you’ll have to force yourself through three times a week – looking forward the whole time to the moment that it’s “out of the way”, so you can resume enjoying life again – are there forms of movement you naturally enjoy, and might only need to do a bit more often, or more intensely?Be careful, though: this is the point at which it’s tempting to devise all sorts of demanding plans for doing things more enjoyably – walking in the park five times a week!Working on your art projectfor an hour every day! – which may themselves become oppressive or intimidating, and thus speedily abandoned. You’re trying to spend more time doing things you enjoy – not turning the idea of “doing what you enjoy” into an unwanted extension of your already horrendous to-do list.If you’re the aforementioned kind of person convinced you don’t have the bandwidth to spend more of the coming year doing what you want, I think it’s time you reconsidered. For one thing, as a finite human being in a world of infinite inputs, you’re always going to have too much to do. So it makes no sense to put off enjoyment or aliveness until such time as you’re no longer facing an unmanageable to-do list; you are, I regret to inform you, likely to end your life with a long to-do list of uncompleted tasks. For another thing, much of what we dislike about the feeling of overwhelm isn’t really a simple quantitative matter of having too many things we feel we need to do; more pertinently, it’s the feeling of being at the mercy of the task list, of having no option but to grind through your days in service to it. As a result, adding a project to your list that you actually want to do can have the unexpected effect ofreducingthe sense of overwhelm by increasing your experience of agency and what psychologists call self-efficacy. You’re freely choosing to incorporate something extra into your day, because you truly want to do it; accordingly, it becomes harder to think of yourself as nothing more than the indentured servant of your to-do list.It’s not clear what life is really for at all, if it isn’t for doing more of whatever makes you feel most aliveNor should you be concerned that doing more of what you want might turn you into an unproductive, socially isolated layabout and irresponsible citizen. Notice the extraordinarily low opinion of yourself suggested by such fears: the implication that you’re such a nightmare, personality-wise, that only the fiercest schemes of self‑improvement, applied with unceasing vigilance, can spare you from disaster. (It’s also a self-contradictory worry, since you’d surely be unlikely to have much interest in the topic of changing your habits in the first place if you were really such a basket case.) Isn’t it at least possible that none of this is true – that if you paid careful attention to the question of what you really enjoy, you might find that it included feeling healthy, being well connected with others, and making whatever difference you could to the world at large? At the very least, it might be worth the experiment.In the end, though, there is a consideration even more fundamental than any of these, which is that it’s not clear what life is reallyforat all,if it isn’t for doing more of whatever makes you feel most alive. It’s notoriously easy to slip into the unconscious assumption that any such aliveness is for later: after you’ve sorted your life out; after the current busy phase has passed; after the headlines have stopped being quite so alarming. But the truth for finite humans is that this, right here, is real life. And that if you’re going to do stuff that matters to you – and feel enjoyment or aliveness in doing it – you’re going to have to do it before you’ve got on top of everything, before you’ve solved your procrastination problem or your intimacy issues, before you feel confident that the future of democracy or the climate has been assured. This part of life isn’t just something you have to get through, to get to the bit that really counts. Itisthe part that really counts.The celebrated child psychology research known as the “marshmallow experiments” suggests that it’s a great asset to have the kind of self-discipline that enables you to defer the gratification of a single marshmallow in order to receive an additional marshmallow, later on. But life offers no prizes for being so good at deferring gratification that you accumulate a thousand uneaten marshmallows, then drop dead. At some point, you’re going to have to eat a marshmallow. That might mean making time for art or writing or music, or long-neglected friendships, for community activism, or exhilarating escapes into the wild; it might mean a life lived more quietly than your current one, or alternatively one lived in a far more high-profile way. Obviously, nobody else can tell you how to spend more of 2026 doing what you genuinely want. That’s a question that can only be answered through honest introspection, bearing in mind the words attributed to (but probably paraphrased from) the American theologian and civil rights leader Howard Thurman: “Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”Explore more on these topicsNew yearHappinessHobbiesHealth & wellbeingMental healthHealthPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In doing so, he hinted at a disquiet concerning the club’s transfer policy.“You said you’re starting to understand that to play 3-4-3, you [need] a lot of top players and that’s not possible. Can I ask why you never realised that when you first came into the club?” was the question put to Amorim in his press conference for United’s visit to Leeds on Sunday.January transfer window 2026: what every Premier League club needsRead moreAmorim: “I don’t want to talk about that. I just focus on the Leeds game.”“That’s interesting. It’s not like you not to talk. Do you regret saying it, maybe?”Amorim: “No, no, no. But I don’t want to talk about it.”“I’m going to try one more time – it seems mystifying why you would say a year in, that you only just realised you wouldn’t be able to get [enough] top players. Has something changed with regard to what you were told, or did Jason Wilcox [the director of football] talk to you?Amorim: “I don’t want to talk about that … You are very smart, so …”The original response, given on Christmas Eve, jarred. “We can play a different way to take more quality from these players because I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time. I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt,” Amorim said at the time.Amorim had put on a noticeably cheery face when entering the first press briefing at United’s Carrington base aftertheir shock Carabao Cup loss at Grimsbyin August. In contrast, he was noticeably downbeat on Friday. Was this to make a point about his unhappiness over a change in budget regarding this transfer window?Antoine Semenyo had been pursued until the player signalled Manchester Cityas his preferred destination. Did Amorim expect that the £65m available to buy the Bournemouth winger could be used to land another target – say, Rúben Neves from Al-Hilal, or Atlético Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, to reinforce the No 6 position? A previous answer offered a hint. “The transfer window is not going to change,” Amorim said. “We have no conversation at this moment to have any change in the squad. There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue.”View image in fullscreenManchester United are missing Bruno Fernandes through injury, leaving them short of attacking options.Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPAAmorim was his usual open, loquacious self when fielding other questions. Missing eight frontline players due to injury and Africa Cup of Nations call-ups, the 40-year-old was asked about a lack of substitute options when United travel to Elland Road. “It was bad luck to lose Amad [Diallo], Bryan [Mbeumo] [both to Afcon], especially with Bruno [Fernandes injured]. If you lose the three of them at the same time, any team in the world will struggle.“You have all the data and you can sense that three guys create most of the chances for us. And if you lose not one but all three at the same time, of course we are going to struggle. The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it’s clear.”Amorim was also forthcoming when asked why, in most games, he makes like-for-like substitutions rather than more attacking ones in line with the club’s attacking tradition. “The first thing you spoke about is that we are creating and scoring more than most of the teams. That is a point,” he said. “Then I understand the team better than anyone. And sometimes you have supporters [scrutinising] your decisions. Sometimes you have to do what you think. And sometimes it’s hard for them to understand.“But I know when I look at the pitch, I can understand which player is tired. Which player is to struggle a lot if there is a one-against-one all the time. And I try to protect the team and win games. And sometimes it’s the best substitution. Sometimes it’s the wrong substitution.“We create a lot. We have more shots than anyone. So if we have something completely different here from last year it is the way we attack. I think we need to improve the way we defend.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result leaves the Hammers four points adrift of 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, whom they face on Tuesday. Nuno, who immediately walked down the tunnel at full time without shaking hands with Rob Edwards, has won two of his 15 Premier League games in charge since taking over from Graham Potter in September.Nuno, who did subsequently see Edwards, said: “I don’t recall one day that I felt so bad on a football pitch like today. I have to apologise to the fans. For those that travelled, it was embarrassing. There’s not much I can say other than we are sorry. We are sorry because what we showed was not good enough. Today was the worst performance we had.”The former Wolves head coach had witnessed his side fail to get a shot on target against a team who had previously failed to keep a clean sheet.“Of course,” Nuno said, when asked if he had the desire and determination to carry on. “It’s not about my future. It’s about how we can get out of this situation, how we can improve and get the results that make us climb the table. This is what we are concerned about. Now is the moment to reflect, to think, to speak among ourselves, to see if we are strong enough to solve it.”Quick GuideKey factsShow• The side starting the day bottom has won just two of their last 32 Premier League games (D6 L24), with both victories coming against teams managed by Nuno Espírito Santo (Wolves v West Ham today, and West Ham at Nottingham Forest in August).• Nuno Espírito Santo has gone 26 Premier League games without seeing his side keep a clean sheet, across spells at Nottingham Forest and West Ham. Only Steve Kean (30 between May 2011 and March 2012) has gone longer without a shutout among managers in the competition’s history.• West Ham’s Nuno Espírito Santo is the first manager in Premier League history to lose against teams starting the day bottom of the table with two different clubs in the same season (also 3-0 with Nottingham Forest against West Ham in August).OptaPhotograph: David Klein/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The West Ham defender Konstantinos Mavropanos said of his head coach: “For him so far it’s difficult, for the fans especially.

This is the reality. And I would not talk like that if it was not the case. But that’s why, in terms of results, I said this is the same story.

Given how well Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden have played from the right this season, it is not immediately obvious why City need him, but the modern game is the modern game, the rammed calendar makes large and flexible squads essential and Pep Guardiola may have some esoteric plan for the Ghanaian anyway. But perhaps what is most striking about the deal is the fee – or, more precisely, how little attention it has drawn.English football has become inured to big transfers. The fee feels about right. Semenyo is 25. He has four and a half years left on his contract. He is quick, skilful, intelligent and works hard. He is disciplined, but has the capacity to do the unexpected. Of course a player of his ability costs that much. Yet £65m would make him the third-most expensive player in Bundesliga history. He would be the seventh-most expensive in Serie A history, the 14th-most expensive in La Liga history. Only nine non-English clubs have paid a fee higher than that. Even inPremier Leagueterms, Semenyo sneaks into the top 25.Crystal Palace seal club-record £35m Brennan Johnson transfer from SpursRead morePerhaps that’s fine. As anybody who has raised any qualms about World Cup ticket prices recently has found out from online Americans passionately committed to being ripped off because that’s what capitalism demands, the market is what it is. Value is what people are prepared to pay. If one club say they will pay £65m for Semenyo, his price is £65m. City can afford it.A pedant might wonder whether Semenyo really is worth nearly seven times as much as, say, Nordi Mukiele, who was two years older when he joined Sunderland from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer (albeit with two years left on his contract). Sometimes a particular player or type of player becomes fashionable and if there is demand, then the price goes up. That is just supply and demand. Semenyo had seemingly drawn interest from Chelsea and Liverpool, whereas a desultory loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen meant everybody had pretty much forgotten about Mukiele.The effect those crazes can have is seen by the player Semenyo will slot one place below on the list of most expensive Premier League arrivals: Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian – nine league starts this season, two goals – is a jarring reminder of the trend of the summer: the big No 9. We are not quite in the territory of tulips in the Netherlands of 1636 or non-fungible tokens in 2021, but classic strikers are beginning to look like one of those crazes everybody almost immediately regrets joining in. Just why did you call your daughter Khaleesi?View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade has been a success since joining Newcastle.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersThere were not many centre-forwards out there, we were told. After the fracturing of theguardiolistaconsensus, coaches were going back to basics. Who knows how football will look in two or three years, what the next tactical orthodoxy will be. But goals will always be valuable, so get yourself a striker. Video assistant referee offside calls, the abolition in effect of “level” in decisions meaning a pixel of infraction will be penalised, has militated against the sniffer, the poacher, the hanger-on-the-shoulder, wiped out the Filippo Inzaghi-style forward, so best to make your No 9 a big one.Of the players signed in the great striker bubble of 2025, the most effective has probably been the one least like an orthodox No 9. Aside from his bullet header of anown goal in the Wear-Tyne derby, Nick Woltemade has been a success for Newcastle, not just for his seven goals and an assist in the Premier League, but for his link-up play, angular disruptiveness and general charisma; the beanpole Rudi Völler is hugely popular on Tyneside.Hugo Ekitiké,who cost Liverpool £82.5m, can also look back on his first six months in the Premier League with a reasonable degree of satisfaction, having managed eight goals and two assists and given the impression of being able to interact with his teammates in a way that has eluded many of the arrivals at Anfield in the summer. Had it not been for Arne Slot’s efforts to get Alexander Isak up and running, he might have achieved even more.Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s renaissance at Leeds renews talks of England returnRead moreBut by and large, the other big centre-forwards of the summer have – and with the caveat that half a season is no time to write somebody off – flopped. Isak is themost expensive signing in English history at £125m, and he is due sympathy afterfracturing his leg against Tottenhamlast month, but even before that he was already being talked of as potentially one of the worst signings in history. Probably because of his disrupted summer and the toxic nature of his departure from Newcastle, he arrived undercooked at Liverpool and had managed two goals and an assist from some desultory performances before suffering that injury.He is not the only one, though. Viktor Gyökeres and Liam Delap have had their fitness issues, but equally they have underwhelmed, as has Sesko.At the same time, the player who perhaps persuaded everybody that old-school No 9s might still have a role to play in the modern game, Erling Haaland, has somehow found another level: 19 goals in 19 league games is absurd, particularly when other parts of his game have developed as well. But just because one player resembling an old-school No 9 is thriving, it does not necessarily mean that old-school No 9s are back more generally. Hope and a large fee do not make a functioning centre-forward.There’s no reason to think Semenyo will not be an excellent player for City. Guardiola will have a plan and his plans tend to be better than those of most coaches (although as the case of Kalvin Phillips shows, even City get it wrong occasionally). Will he be worth £65m? That’s much harder to say. Value in the market is very much in the eye of the beholder and fees in the Premier League feel entirely divorced from any kind of objective reality.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueInside footballTransfer windowFootball tacticsManchester CityBournemouthcommentShareReuse this content"

They qualified for a third successive World Cup with ease and forced a draw in a friendly against Brazil in November, yet their football is infected with fear. To watch them play is to experience a dystopian world in which imagination has been outlawed. In the end, they went out of the Cup of Nations on Saturday because their self-doubt proved even stronger than Malian self-destructiveness.The Mali goalkeeper Djigui Diarra took the plaudits but this was a game Tunisia should never have lost. For over an hour and a half they played against 10. They took the lead in the 89th minute. Twice they led in the shootout. And somehow they still lost, undermined by their own unwillingness to take the game on. If they had only played, they would surely have won but as so often before, Tunisia did not just play. They squabbled and spoiled, feigned injury and moaned, and every so often forgot themselves, played a handful of passes and looked the decent side that they really should be.Mali 1-1 Tunisia (Mali 3-2 on pens): Africa Cup of Nations last 16 – liveRead moreThey finally took the lead in the 89th minute thanks to Firas Chaouat’s deft back-header but, almost immediately, Yassine Meriah handled a free-kick in the box and Lassine Sinayoko converted the resultant penalty. And Tunisia were never going to score twice.Tunisia are cursed by an awareness of their own history, of the fact that they were the first African side to win a game at a World Cup, and the sense that they are not perhaps quite what they were. They may have dropped just two points from 10 games in World Cup qualifying – they have been drawn with the Netherlands, Japan and Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania in Mexico and the US – but doubt is always lurking, ready to beset them. Last month’s group stage exit at the Arab Cup dispelled whatever optimism had begun to build over the previous year, and their coach Sami Trabelsi came into this tournament under pressure.In the group, it was the defeat by Nigeria that stood out, a couple of late goals reducing the deficit but not the impression they’d been outplayed in a 3-2 defeat. Trabelsi started with a back three for the only time other than that Brazil game. That may be a reasonable approach for trying to nullify a side he believes to be technically superior to his own, but there seemed little reason for such negativity against this Nigeria. The impression was of a manager feeling the pressure, fearing just the sort of humbling defeat his side ended up suffering.Quick GuideGueye double takes Senegal into last eightShowA double from the midfielder Pape Gueye enabled Senegal to come from behind and ease past Sudan 3-1 to become the first side to book a place in the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals.Senegal were behind after six minutes of their last-16 clash at the Grande Stade de Tanger but Gueye (pictured with his man-of-the-match trophy) scored two goals before half-time and the 17-year-old Ibrahima Mbaye added a third 13 minutes from the end. Senegal, the 2021 Cup of Nations winners, are the second-ranked team in Africa and, despite conceding early, showed their quality and strength to win in comfortable fashion.Sudan took a surprise lead with a classy goal when the Australian-based Aamir Abdallah, who plays in the state league in Victoria, cut inside the much vaunted Senegal defence and curled a left footed effort wide of Édouard Mendy.It was a shock setback for the highly fancied Senegal but they quickly assumed control of the game, dominating possession and fighting their way back to lead at the break.Nicolas Jackson had a point-blank effort expertly stopped by the Sudan goalkeeper Monged Elneel but a minute later Senegal were level when Sadio Mané pinched possession in midfield from Abuaagla Abdalla and fed Gueye, who stuck his effort into the corner of the goal.Ismaïla Sarr was brought down in the area five minutes later but the penalty award was overturned when the video assistant referee system showed Sarr was offside in the buildup. Sarr then had the ball in the net in the 43rd minute but was again denied by an offside call before his run set up Gueye’s second, feeding Jackson, who turned the ball back to the edge of the area, where Gueye side-footed it in with precision.The substitute Mbaye got the third in the 77th minute to become, three weeks before his 18th birthday, the second youngest scorer in Cup of Nations history as Mané was again the provider.ReutersPhotograph: Amr Abdallah Dalsh/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The back four returned for the draw against Tanzania that secured Tunisia’s progress against Mali. It was paired with a five-man midfield of which the kindest thing to say, perhaps, would be that it was picked for industry rather than creativity. Such attacking width as there was, was offered by Burnley’s Hannibal Mejbri and Augbsurg’s Ismaël Gharbi, neither of whom could be described as natural wingers. It was enough to have neutrals pining for Wahbi Khazri. Not until the 70th minute did they finally switch to a more orthodox 4-3-3.Negativity saps at them, as it has for at least two decades. Every contact brings protest, every throw-in is contested, every opportunity to break up play is taken. Against a team better than them it would be frustrating but understandable. Against a team like this Mali it was incomprehensible and, ultimately, self-defeating. At one point midway through the first half, Tunisia had a throw about 20 yards from the goalline, but were so lacking in ambition they sent only one player into the box. At times, it’s as though they would rather win a scrap than a football match. If they just played, they would surely win more than they do, but fear of defeat curdles everything.Here the onus was thrust on them to take the game to Mali with the 26th-minute dismissal of the skittish Woyo Coulibaly for treading on Hannibal’s achilles, a moment of foolishness that would have been baffling if it wasn’t so in keeping with the history of Malian football. The oddity of this particular Mali is the disjunction between their tactical approach – suited to sitting deep and playing on the break against bigger sides – and their psychological makeup – entirely lacking in the belief they can actually beat a big side.Which perhaps explains why all four of their games at this Cup of Nations were level at 90 minutes. But that only makes it more frustrating that, even against 10 men, Tunisia were unwilling or unable to take the initiative against them. The anxiety that entraps this Tunisia is debilitating and hard to explain – but that’s the way it’s always been.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Mali football teamTunisia football teamAfrica Cup of NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This might not have been how they chose it but it is safe to say the desired effect was achieved, a try by Arthur Green in the last minute snatching victory from the jaws of, if not defeat, one of the more dispiriting draws inflicted on a home team.It was Bath’s fifth try, but their first points since the 20th minute, after they had blown Exeter away with the reaction to theirdefeat here last Saturday by Northampton. But their four tries in that opening quarter were scored with the Chiefs down to 14 after Campbell Ridl was shown a 20-minute red card in the third minute for his aerial challenge on Henry Arundell.Callum Chick revels in Northampton’s chase of lost causes after culture shockRead moreSuch is the competitiveness of this league, no side is safe with a commanding early lead.Exeterscored four unanswered tries themselves, once restored to 15, precipitating Bath’s final assault on their line at the end of which, 38 phases later, Green burrowed his way over.

Third in the table the Chiefs may have been, but any side would have suffered at the hands of Bath on their own turf the week after that humbling by something approximating to a Northampton second XV. The home team duly claimed the season’s fastest bonus point, four tries notched up in the first 20 minutes.No one was calling last week’s Bath team less than full strength. And yet in came players of the calibre of Santiago Carreras, Ted Hill, Guy Pepper and Cameron Redpath – the type other clubs could build a team around. Then there were a couple of youngsters. Vilikesa Sela and Enoch Opoku-Gyamfi are not on many people’s radars, the latter still a teenager – a 150kg teenager – but remember the names.View image in fullscreenGreg Fisilau continues Exeter’s fightback with their third try.Photograph: Simon King/ProSports/ShutterstockBeno Obano was one luminary who did play last week but he, like pretty much everyone in the Bath pack, burst into this game as if he meant it. His was the first try, a pick-and-charge too many for Exeter, before Alfie Barbeary – another restored to the team – did much the same for the second.Carreras finished in superb style after Louie Hennessey’s break for the third. Hennessey was on for Arundell, who was being checked after that aerial challenge by Ridl. The Chiefs winger had scored his first Premiership try last Sunday, but this time overexuberance cost him any further involvement. Bath had the bonus point before the 20 minutes of his red card was up, Ben Spencer putting Ollie Lawrence over after an attacking lineout.Quick GuidePrem roundup: Northampton thump Quins but Dingwall injuredShowNorthampton'sdirector of rugby, Phil Dowson,  eased concerns over Fraser Dingwall after the England centre was knocked out in Saturday's 66-21 Gallagher Prem demolition ofHarlequinsat Franklin's Gardens. Dingwall was carried from the pitch on a stretcher after his head was caught on the wrong side during a tackle on Kieran Treadwell in the 39th minute, but he was able to give a thumbs-up as he left the field.\"Fraser's good,\" Dowson said. \"Obviously he's a bit shaken up and he was unconscious for a bit, but the medics were around him fast and are looking after him so he's going through the right procedure. We don't have any timelines. We'll make sure he's OK and look after him tonight and make sure he's got people around him.\"Northampton returned to the top of the Prem with an electrifying 10-try rout of Quins, Alex Coles leading the charge by running in a hat-trick of tries. They have amassed 154 points in their last three league outings with their high-speed attacking game currently making them the team to beat.Newcastleclinched their first Prem win of the season with a 25-19 victory overGloucesteron Friday night. George McGuigan and Tom Christie went over for the hosts at Kingston Park either side of yellow cards for Jamie Hodgson and Arthur Clark before Ollie Thorley replied for Gloucester. Brett Connon’s penalty gave Newcastle a 15-5 lead at the break and Simón Benítez Cruz grounded shortly after the restart to extend their advantage further. Thorley was shown red for Gloucester before Connon kicked another penalty and Newcastle withstood a late fightback.Pat Lam gave hisBristolplayers the target of being top of the league at the end of the evening and they delivered with a 19-17 win overSaleat Ashton Gate. Bristol were never ahead until the 73rd minute with a yellow card in the 70th minute for the Sale centre Rekeiti Ma’asi White proving decisive. Kalaveti Ravouvou, Joe Owen and Matias Moroni were on Bristol’s try-scoring sheet with Tom Jordan and James Williams each kicking a conversion. Lam, the Bristol director of rugby, said: “We set out that was effectively to be a final and that we needed to win it to be top of the table as Sale are our bogey team and always seem to be up for this fixture.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.No sooner, though, had Exeter been returned to a full complement than they were awarded their first penalty – and another six followed without reply. How the momentum can shift in these contests. The Chiefs sent a few of them to the corner, one by Henry Slade to five metres, and from two they secured a foothold with tries in the last 10 minutes of the half, by Joseph Dweba and Olly Woodburn. Slade converted both, one from each touchline.Bath thought they had wrestled back control when Spencer was in support after Redpath’s break in the 48th minute, but Opoku-Gyamfi, who was hobbling at the time, had blocked a defender. It was not until the final quarter that the game burst back into life and it was Exeter who forced the issue.They have a number of exciting young talents themselves, none more so than Greg Fisilau. He scored the Chiefs’ third try with less than a quarter of an hour to go. Then it was the No 8’s break five minutes later that set up the attack from which came the first of their two bonus points. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso needs less introduction. The whole Rec knew the outcome when he found himself out wide with one to beat at the end of a sustained attack. Slade’s conversion, from the touchline again, drew the teams level.And so the stage was set. “It’s like when you watch The Great Escape,” said Rob Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby. “I’m going to have to watch the game tonight, and I know Steve McQueen isn’t going to get over the barbed wire, but I’ll still have to watch it.“I’ll watch those pick-and-goes and think someone’s going to drop it.

But New York’s new mayor offers an alternative to more apathy: hopeSat 3 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 07.40 ESTShareOn 1 January, to mark hisinauguration as mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdanithrew a block party. As he was sworn in outside city hall in front of a crowd of a few thousand of us, a nearby street in Manhattan was closed to traffic so that tens of thousands more could gather to watch the historic moment live on enormous screens. The weather – a cloudless blue sky and arctic winds – felt somehow fitting: a licence to dream and a warning against complacency.Mayors don’t usually take office amid such a festival atmosphere. A smaller, more exclusive event is normally adequate. But a key feature of Mamdani’s rise has been the desire for mass participation in politics. There was no chance this day was going to pass without an open-invitation party.Throughout his mayoral campaign, Mamdani found novel ways to include people in his movement. It began in November 2024 with aviral videotaking to the streets to interview people in parts of Queens and the Bronx that had swung heavily to Donald Trump in the election. As his popularity grew, he inspired an army of volunteers for canvassing and door-knocking whom he eulogised in his speeches. In August of last year, he organised acity-wide scavenger huntthat thousands of people took part in. There was a football tournament not long after. After his victory in November, he immediately opened a jobs portal where people could submit their CV and area of interest,prompting 74,000 applications. In mid-December, heinvited New Yorkersto speak with him about their problems and concerns in 15-minute slots, across 12 hours. No longer is politics “something that is done to us”, hedeclared in his victory speech. “Now, it is something that we do.”These forms of participation are not trivial publicity stunts: they are as much a part of Mamdani’s rejection of the old neoliberal consensus as his universalist welfare policies are. For decades, major political parties across the west subscribed to a negative image of politics, in which government’s declared role was to get out of the way of private business and to help people only begrudgingly. In this framing, receiving welfare could feel like a sign of individual failure and participating in electoral politics like a waste of time. Political leaders themselves stoked disillusionment and suspicion toward their power. “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help,’” President Ronald Reaganfamously declared. Former British prime minister Tony Blair felt compelled to say in 2000: “I don’t feel myself a politician even now.” As election turnoutsfell or stalled, and political parties shed their partisan purpose and their memberships, a generalised feeling of depoliticisation and apathy set in. By 2006, the political scientist Peter Mair couldaptly describegoverning western democracies as “ruling the void”.Mamdani’s remarkable achievement is for seeing that this “void” is full of interesting voices, overlapping interests and shared yearnings – and for unashamedly stating that the government should be here to help them. His project is, in this sense, to transform the role politics plays in people’s lives.Enacting his universalist welfare reforms – free childcare, free buses for all and a rent freeze on all rent-stabilised apartments, free from any stigma about who “needs” it – is one part of the challenge. The other part is to continuously explore ways to include people in politics. It is a far harder task when governing than when campaigning, but one that Mamdani and his team see clearly. “I don’t think the campaign can end,” Mamdanisaid in a recent interview. “The same people who got us to this point, we want to keep moving forward with them.”View image in fullscreen‘A key feature of Mamdani’s rise has been the desire for mass participation in politics.’ New Yorkers watch a live broadcast of Zohran Mamdani’s speech.Photograph: Guerin Charles/ABACA/ShutterstockThe inauguration event felt like both a triumphant culmination and a symbolic continuation of the campaign. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez andBernie Sandersprovided the supporting cast, as they had at various moments in the mayoral election. There were chants of “tax the rich”, the unofficial soundtrack of the campaign. Volunteer leads were given the bulk of the seats, and every attendant received a pamphlet with “a message from the mayor” that paid exclusive homage to their efforts. “We are able to gather together only because more than 104,000 of our friends and neighbours … gave their time and energy to this movement,” it read. For the finale, Mamdani’s closing speech provided both a love letter to New York and an ode to the power of collective action, heralding “a new era” of “big government”. “If our campaign demonstrated that the people of New York yearn for solidarity, then let this government foster it,” he said.Mamdani is far from the first politician to seek to answer this yearning. Since the 2008 financial crash, spurred by social media and disillusionment with the major parties, various movements have arisen to meet this burgeoning desire for participation, this appetite for alternatives, across the political spectrum. Even the likes of Trump and Nigel Farage – with their mass rallies and social media fluency – give their supporters a feeling of inclusion and an appearance of an alternative. But the negative image of politics, which longs to rule a void, persists. Keir Starmer’suniform unpopularityoffers a warning of where this approach can lead.In New York, Zohran Mamdani showed how it’s done: ‘identity politics’ can win elections | Nesrine MalikRead moreUnlike Mamdani, Starmer has assumed that people want less politics. Ashe explained in January 2024, after 14 years of Tory misrule, people wanted “a politics that treads a little lighter on all of our lives”, because “the thing about populism” is that it “needs your full attention … and that’s exhausting, isn’t it?” In this vision, the best prime minister is one who lets us go about our business in peace once again. But the intended quiet didn’t last long, and soon all sorts of noisy actors rushed in to fill that silent void.The assumption that people want less politics affirms the conflation of politics with disappointment, scandal and devious leadership, surrendering to the disillusionment of past decades. Mamdani has shown the opposite can be the case. Many people want more from politics, and more of it: a movement to believe in, work for, mobilise and socialise through – spurred by the dream of a collective life, not a quiet one. “It will be loud, it will be different,” Mamdani told the crowd. With the block party broadcasting his speech a few streets away, it sounded as if his words were echoing through the city. Even Manhattan’s imposing skyscrapers were standing to attention.Samuel Earle is a writer based in London and the author ofTory Nation: The Dark Legacy of the World’s Most Successful Political PartyExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionDonald TrumpNew YorkKeir StarmerNigel FarageUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

So I was interested to spot, on a recent trip into the fine city, a woman carrying a Trader Joe’s-branded tote bag.Trader Joe’s is a US supermarket; it does not operate in the UK, let alone East Anglia. And yet its merchandise – specifically this black-strapped, red-stamped but otherwise unremarkable tote bag – has been increasingly ubiquitous in London this year, asnoted by the New York Timesin July.Three months to make it up to Norwich felt about right. But why, I wondered, was the arrival of the Trader Joe’s tote so inevitable in the first place? Tote bags used to generically signal eco-consciousness; now the message has become much more targeted and – naturally, given an online discourse obsessed with categorising people into types and tribes – fraught.A tote bag is no longer just something you receive for free with a purchase over £40: it’s seen as a personal statement and even a billboard for your individual “brand”. A tote bag from Daunt Books, Shakespeare and Company, the London Review of Books, the New Yorker or Fitzcarraldo Editions may earn you points for reading, but see them detracted for obviousness. Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods impress upon the observer your easy familiarity with North American produce. And a man carrying a Mubi bag risks being marked out as a boorish “film bro” or “performative male”.It may have started with totes from known brands selling items you at least need to carry, but the craze for merchandising has now spread to lesser-known and even local establishments – and well beyond bags.View image in fullscreenCondoms from Toad Bakery.Photograph: ToadJolene, the north London bakery,sells not just totesbut branded hats, socks, scarves and even oilskins. You can cherish the memory of ameal at St Johnwith a tea towel, T-shirt, engraved waiter’s friend, or a pig-shaped pin badge (£5). Greggs, of course,has its own range with Primark, including bum bags, shoes and cycling shorts, as well as aseparate jewellery line, featuring 22-carat gold-plated sausage roll earrings (£36) and a signet ring (£48, equivalent to 37 sausage rolls). But for the common man, Yard Sale Pizza sells its ownfootball-style scarf.Even just grabbing a sandwich or coffee increasingly presents a chance to upsize your order with a T-shirt or cap to go. The most bizarre merch tie-in I’ve heard of is branded condoms from Camberwell’s buzzy Toad Bakery. It was a Valentine’s Day stunt, and a world-first for a bakery, owner Oliver Costello told me.From the perennial line outside its doors, Toad has no need for publicity; indeed, Costello said they kept their limited-edition run of“toad in the hole” johnniesfairly low-key, while 100% of the funds went to charity. So what’s the business case for making them?Partly, it seems, production is driven by demand. “Merch is big now in the bakery world” Costello said. Toad makes T-shirts and caps in large part “because they kept selling out”. Customers are increasingly prepared to travel to such talked-about bakeries, and want a longer-lasting souvenir than a pastry for their efforts.A tote also cements and extends the street cred that comes with being “in the know” about the latest Instagram-famous establishment: been there, got the croissant. Costello likened it to picking up a T-shirt from a gig: “It’s nice to feel like you can represent them somewhere else.” For musicians in the streaming age, however, merchandise is an important source of revenue. For bakeries, sandwich shops, wine bars and other smaller-scale establishments, tacking on merch doesn’t make much of a dent in the overheads.Toad already sells the T-shirts that its employees wear as uniform, and intends to partner with local artists on more designs, helping to mint it as a Camberwell institution; its caps are embroidered in nearby Deptford. This reveals merch as a means of displaying postcode pride, signalling your belonging to SE5 v SE10 (let alonenorth). In the neighbourhood where I used to live in Sydney, a much-loved convenience store now sells shirts bearing acartoon of the owner’s face; people buy them to show support for his outspoken pro-Palestine stance and funny social media presence.While merch might not bring in much money, it cements loyalty, may generate word-of-mouth and is typically cheap to produce – making it a low-risk venture for small businesses. An order of 150 custom totes may work out at about £5 a bag; they are readily sold for twice that. (The Timesreported on a single customerat Daunt Books spending £120 on totes.)View image in fullscreenPeople wearing Greggs’s signet rings.Photograph: GREGGSThe craze for merch, then, is perhaps best ascribed to the demands on small businesses today to not just provide a product or service, but establish themselves as coherent and even covetable “brands”. Dom’s Subs, which started in Hackney during the pandemic, did a brisk trade in T-shirts and more to customers wanting to support businesses during that challenging time. “From our side, it’s great advertising,” said co-founder Dom Sherington.In 2021, they even partnered with Carhartt on a T-shirt that sold out in minutes. The collaboration came about because Dom’s Subs frequently supplied sandwiches to theCarhartt office in Hackney Wick. T-shirts have since been spotted for resale for £300, “which is wild,” said Sherington.For Dom’s Subs, merch has been a “great revenue stream”. The challenge has been keeping up. “It can be really tricky to manage that side of the business as we don’t have a dedicated team,” said Sherington. Though they aspire to launch new products consistently, “Currently we just don’t have the manpower – we’re just a trio of sandwich shops”.Of course, the market for more branded stuff says most about capitalism. My entrepreneurial-minded friend recently returned from the US with three Trader Joe’s totes, intending to resell them at a profit; he’s still got them, having found Vinted swamped. (At least “they’re nice spacious bags,” he added.)As much as merch may seem like an easy win for small businesses, it’s also a sideshow, distracting from what they’re really trying to sell and adding to the pressures they face to stay afloat, as much as alleviating them. And for individuals, it might be a stand-in for a kind of cultural cachet that money can’t buy. It’s safer to buy someone a tote from a cult bookshop than it is to select a book you know they’d love. And it’s easier to buy a cap from your local cafe than it is to build a community there.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If you live in the US, you can find this out very quickly: there’s a centralizedwebsiteprovided by the US Department of Justice that lets you search a name or location in seconds.This doesn’t mean that everyonefound liablefor sexual abuse comes up, of course. They have to have been convicted of certain sex offenses in a criminal, rather than civil, court to be put on the registry.Now let’s say you want to check whether your potential date has ever been found guilty of domestic violence. Good luck with that. There isn’t a similar sort of centralized registry and you’d have to look through various court records.If you live in Tennessee, however,that situation has just changed: the state has created the first registry in the US to track repeat domestic violence offenders. Anyone convicted of more than one domestic violence offense after 1 January will beregistered in a public databasemaintained by the Tennessee bureau of investigation. The new legislation, Savanna’s Law, is named for Savanna Puckett, 22, who was shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend, James Jackson Conn, in 2022. Conn, who also suffocated Puckett’s dog, had a history of domestic violence and stalking.The fact that Tennessee, consistentlyin the top 10 statesfor domestic violence homicides, is taking this issue seriously should be applauded. The new law, which was passed with bipartisan support, is very much a step in the right direction. It raises awareness of intimate partner violence and signals to survivors that the state is on their side.Nevertheless, it’s important to bear in mind the limitations to a registry like this. Domestic violence cases areunderreportedand can be notoriously difficult to prosecute – so a large number of offenders will never end up in the system.While well-intentioned, it should also be noted that an easily searchable registry of serious offenders isn’t always an unalloyed good. Various analyses, for example, have found that many state registries that keep track of sex offenders arefilledwith errors. Some criticsarguethat the registry system is overly expensive and inefficient and diverts resources away from survivors and prevention strategies. And, in the case of domestic violence, it’s possible that some survivors might actually end up on the registry: perpetuators of abuse frequently weaponize the law to paint theirvictims as abusers. It’s certainly possible to envisage a situation where someone fighting back against their abuser ends up convicted of abuse, and put on a registry, themselves.All that said, it’s good to see a red state making history in a positive way.More Norwegian women reporting abuse amid royal family rape trialThe 28-year-old son of the Norwegian crown princess is due to stand trial next month for charges including rape, domestic abuse and filming without consent.

It’s almost like Israel doesn’t want anyone to witness theongoing genocide.The Trump administration is reportedly freezing childcare payments to all statesThere have been long-running allegations of fraud related to federal funding for childcare programs in Minnesota, with a number of investigations and prosecutions happening during theBiden administration.

On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it would be freezing federal funding for childcare programs in Minnesota after allegations of fraud.Then, on Wednesday, itwas reportedthat childcare funds to all 50 states are going to be frozen until the states can prove there’s no corruption.

But though incurable, it’s a disease that can be treatedSat 3 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 19.31 ESTShareA few days before he took his last, mercifully peaceful, breath, my husband, Ian Reinecke, looked at me intently and asked: “Is there anything going on in the world I need to know about?”“No, nothing,” I said as calmly as I could to the man with whom I had intensely discussed events in the world and at home for nearly 50 years.I could not be sure he wasn’t fishing for an answer. All week, the thrum of helicopters, accompanied by the scream of sirens, had filled the Bondi air. Sensitive people pick up the vibes, even when the details are opaque.In his last year, I could never be completely sure how much he was aware of. Some things he talked about seemed fanciful to me but turned out to be true. Right to the end, his intuition about people and events astonished me.But the antisemitic massacre atBondi beach, just a few hundred metres away from where he drifted in and out of consciousness, was too much. “Please keep the TV off,” I said to his carers. “Don’t talk to him about what happened.”He didn’t need to know that the place we had walked to several times a week, where he marvelled at nature’s beauty and laughed with amusing people, had been desecrated.After a year of feeling powerless in the face of hideous global events, this violent assault seemed like the last straw.At times during 2025, it felt to me that the world was losing its mind, that our private pain was echoed everywhere. We’d watch PBS News Hour most afternoons, a respite of sorts from the endless repeats of Antiques Roadshow that fill the dead air of hospital free-to-air TV.Americans are waking up. A grand reckoning awaits us | Robert ReichRead moreBut the distress of watching the dismantling of the America he had known and loved was palpable, the devastation of Gaza, the incomprehensible destruction of Ukraine, Sudan, the ascendancy of kleptocratic autocrats and endless climate disasters was almost too much to bear.The extraordinary world that came into existence with Victory in Europe Day, a month after Ian was born, was crumbling. It was a world that, for all its shortcomings, for 70 years had fostered unprecedented peace, prosperity and innovation, and had valued human rights and the rational rule of law and reason.It was as if in 2025 the cosmos had dementia – memory disappeared, talk and action were disinhibited, the same mistakes were repeated over and over, as once-humiliated men and their powerful acolytes sought revenge on the good people of the world.The axis of the globe shifted; nothing was quite as it had once seemed.Dementia comes in many varieties; each patient is affected differently. It’s not as simple as losing your memory, forgetting names, struggling for words. For some people, memory remains surprisingly robust, but tasks like putting on a pair of shoes become impossibly complex. Some become disinhibited and angry, confused and aggressive, others withdrawn and ashamed, some lose mobility, others can’t stop walking, some manage to create new neural pathways, others are trapped in a world of perpetual childhood or bombarded with hallucinations.When asked for the umpteenth time to do the memory test and draw a clock that says 10 past 11, some find a workaround from the humiliatingly impossible task of drawing a circle, writing the numbers in order, positioning hands. “I know you hate drawing the clock,” Ian’s insightful gerontologist said about a year ago, “but just one more time, for me, please.”The tension in the room rose as he took the pen and looked at the piece of paper. He then, with a smile, drew a perfect Apple Watch: the numbers clear 11:10. “What is this silly game?” he seemed to say, “you want a clock, I’ll give you one.”The brain, like human ingenuity, is almost infinite. There are almost always workarounds.But in a world overrun by oligarchs, autocrats and charismatic crazies, workarounds seem harder to find than ever.From the day the presidency changed in the US, the world entered a new order of absolutes.

To ignore the deaths and mayhem, to think change is too hard, to retreat, to let the global chaos play out and reach its inevitable conclusion.But as Robert Reichwrote here recently, opposition begins small and grows until it becomes unstoppable. It has been seen everywhere, from the millions who protested in the No Kings rallies in the US, to the resounding endorsement of progressive democratic governments in country after country, to the sea of flowers at Bondi Pavilion.It doesn’t happen quickly, but, asIan McEwan demonstratesin his important novel What We Can Know, human beings have enormous capacity to muddle through even in the face of absurd human-made threats.After a year of regular medical appointments, tweaking drugs and monitoring vital symptoms, Ian’s highly skilled neurologist said, “I don’t need to see you for another year. Don’t let anyone tell you that these diseases can’t be treated. They can’t be cured but can be treated.”A year later, the next appointment was also set for 12 months. He had several more good years.There is a message in this.The worst excesses of human nature cannot be eradicated, like a disease we cannot yet cure. But with civic determination and good government, they can be treated and managed. It takes optimism, diligence and determination – not giving up.Dr Ian Reinecke AM died on Christmas Day from Lewy body dementia.

According to this picture, migrants are eager to experience the benefits of our society, but they are also out to undermine it, because they come from cultures whose values are dramatically different from our own. Think of the ongoing “grooming gangs” scandal: an undeniably appalling series of events, institutional failures and victim-blaming that has been transformed into a narrative that suggests any “alien” is likely to be a sexual predator, since their predatory behaviour is a direct consequence of their religious and cultural background.So often, all we are allowed to know about asylum seekers is that they are asking – with irritating persistence – for a place in our social fabric, as if they have no world of their own, no cultural hinterland, no really recognisable human values aside from mysterious and dangerous belief systems. This explains why there is now a feverish pressure to instantly reveal the ethnicity of any suspect in a major crime of unprovoked violence – as with theCambridgeshire train attack(where, confusingly, it transpired that the hero of the day was aman of north Africanbackground), or the tabloid habit of illustrating stories about migrants with images of young men, usually of Middle Eastern appearance.There are various ways to push against this myth-making. One is simply to take the time needed to look and listen to what migrant individuals and communities actually have to say about themselves. There have been numerous initiatives aiming to highlight art that is focused on migrant experiences – and there are some dramatic and profound instances to discuss.Issam Kourbaj, an artist who originally hails from Syria but is now working in Cambridge, has produced extraordinary work connecting his heritage with the experience of displacement today. One of his most effective installations has been exhibited in Britain and the US and is based on an ancient Syrian model boat carrying the small images of three goddesses.View image in fullscreenThe 13th-century Cosmati pavement in Westminster Abbey, London.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PABut there is another kind of “art” that migrants create. Anyone who has ever spent time in a refugee camp will have encountered this. People bring with them objects from home that are charged with special significance: often things snatched up at the last moment, without much reflection. Back in 2019, I was part of a small group of scholars and writers who put together a colloquium in Cambridge designed to hear and celebrate migrant voices. We were able to present some new artwork from Kourbaj and others, to listen to songwriters who had honed their skills in the Calais camps, to share food from different cultures andhear people talk about the objects they had grabbed to take with them on leaving their homes.Take the photographer Dragana Jurišić, who described to us how, as a 16-year-old fleeing army snipers in Croatia in the 1990s, she picked up a Bible, despite having no conscious interest in religion. Looking at it years later, she found she had marked passages that had acted as “mantras” in the worst moments of terror and danger. Jurišić is still anything but a conventional believer. But she needed something from her past and her culture to talk and listen to in the middle of the chaos. She needed to know she was not travelling alone.Recently, we held another event to mark the publication of the original conference proceedings. We were all reinforced in our conviction that these artworks and the imagination they stem from deserve sustained attention because they remind us of how our own culture, forms of poetry, architecture, song and much more. They are the way they are because people have travelled – sometimes freely, sometimes very much not.What we called “migrant forms”in the 2019 colloquium are not some sort of pollution that compromises an original, hermetically sealed culture, but the product of a mobile – and often cruelly insecure and unjust – human world. We find new things in conversation with our own past when we are uprooted from it. We talk and listen to what we thought was familiar, and find new things to say. We absorb the sound of strangers, including oppressors and enslavers, and find a voice of our own. It is not an accident that much of the huge and sophisticated structure of Hebrew scripture – the “Old Testament” – that has formed the imagination of well over half the inhabitants of the globe found its present shape through a generation of forced displacement and unfreedom in Babylon.View image in fullscreenBlues singer Howlin’ Wolf performing on the US TV show Shindig, watched by the Rolling Stones and Darlene Love, 1965.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesLook around: hospitality to migrant forms is not just about settled people tolerantly enjoying exotic entertainment. Many of the most characteristic forms of western medieval architecture – the shapes we see in Westminster Abbey or the Houses of Parliament – owe their development to the to-ing and fro-ing of engineers and architects between western Europe and the Middle East during the Crusades. And we find it easy to forget that most of the stylistic repertoire of modern western popular music would be unthinkable without the Black American tradition that itself adapted and reshaped African idioms in the new and terrible world of enslavement.Migrants carry worlds with them, and whatever conditions we lay down for admission to our borders will be both inhumane and counterproductive if we do not pay attention to the sheer depth and fluidity of these worlds. We need to pay attention to the imagination of newcomers, rather than resorting to rhetoric that effectively depicts every migrant either as an individual in search of security at all costs, or as a plain enemy of all we think is humanly significant. Migrants do not have only one face or one history. They are not ciphers for some opaque and sinister worldview. They do not lack agency, especially that uniquely human kind of agency we call imagination. Paying attention to their imagination may even release our own, helping us to see ourselves in a new light.Rowan Williams is a former archbishop of CanterburyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our argument would be, OK, he’s in perfect health, but he’s also 87. He’s clearly more vulnerable than someone who’s 38,” she said.Dan Holland, from the Salvation Army’s homelessness services team, said that 10% of people living in the charity’s residential accommodation were over 55, and they were seeing a large number of people in the older age category coming to them for help.“Not as many people now have a mortgage that they’ve paid off and a roof over their head that they can call their own. Lots more people are renting, relying on housing benefit which has been frozen, so it’s not rocket science, eventually they will end up experiencing homelessness,” he said.One of those was Raymond, 63, who ended up sleeping in his car for seven weeks after becoming homeless following the breakdown of his marriage. He approached the council at least six times for help and was told he was not a priority, before he ended up living at a Salvation Army centre in the north-west.“My legs were bad, they were really swelling up because it was only a small car so I couldn’t stretch my legs. I was sleeping on the seat and my body was just getting in a mess,” he said. “My doctor put me on folate tablets because I couldn’t afford to eat properly. I wasn’t getting any vegetables.“I just never got any advice. And I think the trouble with people my age, my generation, we just get on with it, we don’t always reach out. I have no idea what I’m going to do in the future as I’m approaching retirement.”Holland said services would soon need to start thinking about palliative and end-of-life care for homeless people, as more and more people end up in unstable accommodation in the last months of their lives.“If you are experiencing homelessness and you are naturally coming to the end of your life, or you’ve got a terminal illness – where do you go? That’s a huge issue that I think is definitely on the horizon,” he said.Research from Crisis found that one in five (17%) older people said they wanted to retire but could not because of their housing costs, while the number of older people facing homelessness in England has risen more than 50% in the past five years.There has also been a 35% increase in the number of over-55s in temporary accommodation since March 2022.Experts said the problem has been exacerbated by the country’s now deeply entrenched housing crisis, which has resulted in home ownership becoming increasingly out of reach and forced people to rent into their later years, leaving them vulnerable to eviction or unsustainable rent increases.People on lowest incomes being denied access to social housing, research findsRead moreBen Twomey, the chief executive of Generation Rent, said: “Soaring rents were locking people into renting for decades, forcing older people to live in homes unsuitable for their needs and damaging to their health, while pushing some into homelessness.”Edith Gomes Munda, a 61-year-old renter in Huntingdon, said she was increasingly fearful for the future, having been forced to move twice in recent years owing to her landlord selling up and rent rises that she could no longer afford.“It worries me that I may have to move every three or four years, and getting older, there comes a point when everything gets more difficult, more tiring,” she said.“I’m now 61 and I will get my pension soon but I don’t know if it will cover the rent. I’m healthy enough but how long will I be able to keep working for? I have that on my mind all the time. With the rent increases, you feel like you have to constantly move, you can’t really settle down.”Munda added that she previously was unable to buy a home and now it was too late. “I gave up on that and continued with my life. Now I’m too old, I wouldn’t find a lender when I don’t know how long I can work for. The only other option we have is to apply for social housing, but the waiting lists are so long,” she said.The government has yet to publish its long-term housing strategy, which has been delayed until March next year, but experts say prioritising older people is essential.“Even a reformed private rented sector doesn’t really work for older people. We get a lot of calls from people who have had to leave private rented homes as they’re just priced out, and they can’t find anywhere else,” said Lisabel Miles, housing policy manager at Age UK.“There’s going to be a lot of older renters emerging into retirement with real concerns about where they can go.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessOlder peopleSocial exclusionPovertyHousingRenting propertynewsShareReuse this content"

I’m still here’: ex-MP Patrick Duffy, 103, publishes memoirsRead moreAccording to Kevin Meagher, a writer who helped Duffy publish his memoirs, the politician was “kind of a living historical jukebox” where you could “push the buttons and say, what was it like to meet, you know, [the former prime minister] Clement Attlee?”Duffy, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and received a papal knighthood from Pope John Paul II, served in the second world war during which he survived a plane crash in the Orkney Islands while serving in the Fleet Air Arm.Duffy first ran for parliament in 1950 and was elected MP for the first time in 1963 after winning the Colne Valley byelection, before holding a seat in Sheffield Attercliffe from 1970 to his retirement in 1992.He served as parliamentary under secretary for the Royal Navy for James Callaghan’sLabourgovernment in the late 1970s.Duffy “took a lot of flak” as the only MP who “berated” the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1981 for the death of the Republican hunger striker Bobby Sands, Meagher said. Thatcher and Duffy would later have tea together, particularly when he was president of the Nato Assembly in the 1980s.A statement written by Meagher and approved by Duffy’s family said: “An extraordinary man with a lifetime of accomplishments, Patrick leaves behind him family and friends – across all age groups – who will miss his kindness, humour and incredible acuity in recalling personalities and events from a century ago.“Patrick’s was a life well-lived, brimming with achievement, the admiration of colleagues and the love and affection of his many family and friends.

Now, in the two grandly redeveloped stations with their swanky plazas, even a dropped paper ticket would look out of place.One last corner of St Pancras station is polluted by the fug of diesel trains – but not for much longer. East Midlands Railway, which runs services to cities including Derby and Sheffield, will fire up its diesel units in London for the final time by the end of 2026.It is a milestone moment for St Pancras – albeit one that has arrived later and with more difficulty than many had hoped. EMR’s fleet of cleaner Aurora trains, built by Hitachi, has arrived years behind schedule – and parallel engineering works to fully electrify the track they will run on, the Midland main line, have been scaled back.According to Will Rogers, the managing director of EMR, the Aurora trains “are going to make a step-change at St Pancras. It’s very noticeable in terms of noise and emissions.”The fleet is by necessity bi-mode: running on electricity in the south before switching back to diesel farther north. Where the trains can run on electricity – up until just south of Leicester – the carbon emissions can be cut by 66%, Rogers says.On such environmental considerations, rail travel largely beats most other mechanised transport: consuming less energy for each passenger than cars, far superior to the plane in its carbon footprint, and – in many places – pumping out fewer noxious fumes.That comparative advantage does not make it completely green. About 70% of Great Britain’s passenger train rolling stock is electric, and about 8% bi-mode; but only 39% of the entire route length of the railway is electrified – concentrated in the more populous south-east of England, where the majority of train journeys occur.According to the Rail Delivery Group’s own emissions calculator, the vast majority of journeys – about 94% – are greener for each passenger by rail than by a petrol car (based on an average car occupancy of 1.6 people). But the equation tips where a battery-powered car meets a diesel train.Electrification of the railway has long been the lodestar for government and industry, but the cost and delivery of recent works has given policymakers pause. The Great Western main line electrification was eventually concluded in 2020, withkey sections truncated, having run years late andtripled the budget.That kind of risk perhaps does not sit well with a government set on balancing the books – but many were still surprised and dismayed when the Midland main line electrification was halted south of Leicester last year.Rogers is diplomatic: “There’s clearly difficult choices, but we’d welcome any more electrification.” The new EMR trains had a £400m price tag, “and if you combine it with £1.5bn on the main line electrification, it’s a massive investment”.Electrification work continues elsewhere, notably on the TransPennine route east of Manchester and almost completed on the South Wales Metro. But, for now, Leicester and Derby, thenominated home of Great British Railways, will, like Bristol on Great Western, suffer the frustration of brand new main-line trains running on diesel in their city centres, having made it most of the way from London on electricity.View image in fullscreenAn EMR diesel train at St Pancras station, London.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThedieselgatescandal andLondon’s Ulezhighlighted the health risk of diesel’s nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from cars. But the immediate NOx exposure on the worst trains – for passengers as well as those waiting in stations, asresearch from the Rail Safety and Standards Board has shown– could exceed that from air pollution on a busy road.In London, most main line stations have eliminated diesel; at Euston, Avanti’s transition to fully electric completed a year ago, with a few bi-modes that switch to diesel at Crewe, 145 miles later, for tracks into north Wales. A handful of diesel trains run out of Waterloo for branch lines, and King’s Cross, for the 10 daily services run by Grand Central, whose order for tri-mode hybrid trains will eventually mean its small fleet runs only on electricity in the capital.The big outlier is London Marylebone, unelectrified, and its lines out through the Chilterns sufficiently hemmed in by ageing infrastructure, bridges and tunnels to make full electrification prohibitively costly, if not impossible.A solution for Chiltern, seen in south Wales and with similar potential for Northern’s network and the future East West Rail project linking Oxford and Cambridge, is a combined approach: selective track upgrades in accessible places allied to new train technology. Network Rail’s route director, Denise Wetton, says: “We’re looking at battery-hybrid trains and partial electrification all the way to Birmingham.”The potential for fast-charge technology was demonstrated by a GWR test, which took a train on a world-record 200 miles on a single charge this summer. “It was a bit of fun,” says Simon Green, GWR’s engineering director, “but it also underlined a serious point: investment in battery technology is essential as we look to replace our ageing diesel fleet.”Overhead lines are best, he says, but batteries could now bridge the gaps where the wires prove too hard or costly to install. For GWR trains, running out to the far south-west of England and Wales, those stretches could mean about 60 miles between charges. The test was, Green says, “clear evidence that this is a viable and exciting solution for the future of our railway”.Chiltern’s MD, Richard Allan, says he thinks there will be a “compelling case” for the better technology. For now, the line will be introducing a new fleet of more efficient diesels, and also mitigating the train’s emissions by using increasing proportions of hydrotreated vegetable oil – or recycled chip fat – from 7% to 20% of the fuel used.As EMR shows, new or better trains can take many years to order, build, test and bring into service. But it may still upgrade rail travel faster than some solutions, as commuters in the Chilterns can testify. Looking out from a new Chiltern train to High Wycombe at the scars of ongoing high-speed rail construction, Allan remarks: “They’ve had to watch HS2 being built – now they have some benefit locally too.”Meanwhile, the Department forTransportis working with Network Rail to develop an updated electrification plan – as well as a new rolling stock strategy. The past ambition to clear all diesels from the railway by 2040 is under review.A spokesperson said: “We are committed to electrifying and decarbonising our railway, and our approach will focus on the most cost-effective schemes that make the greatest difference as quickly as possible.”The better trains on their wayEast Midlands RailwayThe £490m new fleet of Hitachi-built Aurora trains has arrived three years late – but passengers on the intercity route linking Derby, Leicester, Sheffield and Nottingham to the capital will have more seats and space, as well as a smoother, quieter ride. Wheelchair users will ride in first class. And special, German-made glass promises to allow mobile phones and data to reach into the carriages, improving notoriously patchy connectivity.Chiltern RailwayThe new fleet of 13 Mark V trains, handed over nearly new from TransPennine Express, may not be electric but are certainly less shabby than some of the 50-year-old trains they are replacing. They will bring an extra 10,000 seats a week, as well as the kind of things familiar to other passengers for years: wifi, air-conditioning and accessible toilets.Piccadilly LineAlready electrified, but the Tube line’s new fleet, which is made of lighter material and is more energy efficient, should consume 20% less electricity in service, according to Transport for London. Most passengers will be more excited about the greater headroom, air conditioning and walk-through carriages. The trains are expected to come into service between late summer and December.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportPollutionLondonTransportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s also because of the stalling of our economy and causing a relative surplus of graduates. So the simple promise of a good job if you get a university degree, has now become conditional on which university you went to, which course you took,” Kapur said.“The old equation of the university as a passport to social mobility, meant that if you got a degree you were almost certain to get a job as a socially mobile citizen. Now it has become a visa for social mobility – it gives you the chance to visit the arena that has graduate jobs and the related social mobility, but whether you can make it there is not a guarantee.”While arguments have raged for decades over the value of a university degree, in 2025 Keir Starmer declared that aiming for 50% of young people to enter higher education was “not right for our times”, endingTony Blair’s pledgemade in 1999. Starmer’s declaration came two years after Rishi Sunak as prime minister had claimed: “The false dream of 50% of children going to university … was one of the great mistakes of the last 30 years.”But Kapur said experts such as the sociologistMartin Trowhave long predicted that large-scale entry into higher education would change the status of university degrees, as the sector moved from educating an elite of just 5% to 10% of young people to a more universal system attracting young people from all parts of society.Kapur saidTrow predictedthat as university education becomes universal: “Three things will happen. Social regard for the exceptionalism of university graduates will go down. The second thing is, the graduate premium will go down, because a degree will become something that’s not scarce at all. And from being a privilege, it [a university education] will start becoming a necessity” for participating in advanced society.He added: “I think in the UK, we are reaching that point now.”Figuresfrom the Department for Educationshow that England’s graduates still enjoy higher rates of employment and pay than non-graduates, although the real earnings of younger graduates have been stagnant for the past decade. Kapur points out that the national economy’s slow growth coincided with England’s introduction of £9,000 tuition fees and student loans in 2012, making it “the worst possible time” to transition to individual student loans.In 2022, Kapur wrote a gloomy discussion of UK higher education that described a“triangle of sadness”between students burdened with debt and pessimistic prospects, a government that used inflation to cut tuition fees, and overstretched university staff trapped in between.Three years later, Kapur says the situation has worsened, with the government “fossilising” domestic tuition fees at a level that does not cover undergraduate teaching costs. But he is convinced that UK universities still provide the best education in the world, thanks in part to the premium tuition fees they earn from international students.The higher fees allow the likes of King’s College London to subsidise the world-leading research that maintains their high position in international league tables. The high position in turn enables UK universities to charge premium fees – and benefits domestic students through greater access to researchers and a wider choice of courses.Less than Greggs? Public have no idea of value of top universities, study findsRead moreBut souring attitudes towards immigration have resulted in recent governments restricting international student visas and, most recently, imposing a levy on their fees that could disrupt those benefits.“The role of international students in our universities is a national conversation we need to have.International studentsare not some sort of oddity or indulgence of our universities. They are now a fundamental feature of our system. Not only does it benefit the international students, it greatly benefits our domestic students, in addition to UK as a nation. Therefore, if we’re going to change it, we should do it knowingly after considering all the implications for our domestic students, for our universities, for our productivity as a nation,” Kapur said.But he warned: “The older technologies and manufacturing productivity gains have run their cycle. If the UK is going to be at the cutting edge of technology related productivity growth, we cannot do this just by making faster baristas.“We have to invent at the cutting edge, or apply at the cutting edge so that we are the makers and not the takers of the next technological revolution - and universities will have a central role in doing that.”Explore more on these topicsStudentsUniversity fundingHigher educationKing's College LondonGraduate careersInternational studentsShareReuse this content"

Earlier, a 67-year-old man had been pulled unconscious from the water, but he died later.Emergency services were called to the area just after 3pm. The search was stopped at 12.30am on Saturday but HM Coastguard, Yorkshire ambulance service and Humberside fire and rescue remained in the area as the search recommenced at dawn.“Efforts will resume at first light, when coastguard rescue teams along with partner agencies will be sent to conduct additional searches of the area,” HM Coastguard said in a statement.Police said circumstances surrounding both deaths were not believed to be suspicious.“We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely,” the force added.Emergency services were called to reports of people in difficulty in the water and ambulances, helicopters and aircraft were among the services deployed to brave “horrendous conditions”, with waves reportedly reaching almost 3 metres (10ft) during the day.Darrin Stevens, a photographer who lives 250 metres from the coast, described the weather as bitter and freezing.He said: “I came back into my office and I could see [emergency services] 30ft away from the sea. You could see the helicopter so close to the house it was incredible.“The sea could have been very dangerous, the water is very bitter and if they are in that water they do not have long. It is a dangerous place to be.“It was freezing, and when the sea is as harsh as it is, every care needs to be taken, you need to be at your wisest,” he said.The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has issued advice, warning that the effects of cold water shock, combined with weather conditions, pose a risk to anyone entering water that is 15C or below, particularly at a time of year when the average sea temperature around the UK and Ireland is 6C to 10C.Gareth Morrison, the head of water safety for the RNLI, said: “We know this time of year many people take part in festive and new year dips, or continue to take part in regular winter swims. We are urging anyone entering the water to be aware of the dangers, check sea conditions carefully and to understand their own limitations.“With the sea temperatures still dropping and reaching their coldest around March, the effects of cold water, combined with weather conditions and any personal health issues, should be taken seriously before venturing in.”A 51-year-old man died in the sea at Brighton on New Year’s Day. Sussex police were alerted at 10.35am on Thursday after the swimmer, from Kettering, Northamptonshire,was recovered from the water to the west of Brighton Palace Pier.Explore more on these topicsYorkshireEnglandNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, a group of blokes with unruly hair and a couple of women walked across a field, talked things over in the pub and,at one point, gathered around a dot matrix printer to watch it slowly disgorging some results. The most exciting artefact they found was a lump of iron slag. No soil was overturned.Fromthose unpromising beginnings, however, a TV juggernaut was born. That first episode of Time Team, screenedon Channel 4on 16 January 1994, kicked off a remarkable 20-year run of more than 200 episodes, before falling audiences and anunhappy revampled to itseventual cancellationin 2013.But as any archaeologist will tell you, just because something is in the past doesn’t mean it will stay buried. In 2021, at the urging of a group of devoted fans, some of the original Time Team experts gathered again to film a dig, this time to be broadcast on theirown channelonYouTube.Four years on, Time Team has 350,000 subscribers on the platform, where its films regularly attract audiences of up to 2 million. More importantly for the bottom line, 16,000 people pay each month tosupport it on Patreon. That financial leverage means Time Team is again making archaeological waves: next summer, it will funda new digat theNess of Brodgar in Orkney, after a chance discovery by the programme’s resident geophysicist, John Gater, suggesting“something quite extraordinary”at the Neolithic world heritage site.View image in fullscreenExcavations at the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney.Photograph: markferguson2/AlamyEven the original presenter, Tony Robinson, has returned for some of the films, after initially, hehas admitted, being unsure how the format would work on YouTube. The programme’s renaissance has been “like one of those bulbs that you plant in the garden and forget about, and then five years later it flourishes again,” he says.A comedy favourite by the early 90s for his work as the gormless sidekickBaldrickon Blackadder, Robinson says that he was initially offered the presenting job “because [Channel 4] were thinking, ‘This is such an arcane subject. Who should we have to present it? Clearly we should get the person who epitomises stupidity on television.’” In fact, the actor already had a keen interest in archaeology, and was a friend of Professor Mick Aston, who served as the programme’s lead archaeologist.Carenza Lewis – a veteran of that first episode – was a twentysomething postdoc student when she was approached to take part, agreeing because “I thought it would be something I would regret if I didn’t.“I remember turning up at the very first one we did, and Mick had decided it would be a good idea to get everyone relaxed by bringing a couple of bottles of wine. It worked – but it meant it took us forever to do the first scene.”View image in fullscreenTony Robinson (left) with Mick Aston, who served as Time Team’s lead archaeologist, in 2006.Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PALewis, now aprofessor at the University of Lincoln, was let go from the programme in 2005 after 12 series – “I never really got a straight explanation” – but in the long gap before she rejoined the YouTube revival, Time Team never left her. She recalls giving a paper at a conference in Moscow more than a decade after she left the programme, when she was introduced with a reference to Time Team. “And there was a murmur of appreciative recognition, in a room full of Russian archaeologists. I really didn’t expect Time Team to have even reached Russia.” About 40% of its YouTube and Patreon audience is now from outside the UK.For Gater, also part of the original team, YouTube gives a flexibility that its previous incarnation didn’t allow. “The three-day format was brilliant, it created tension and so on,” he says. “But it became more and more expensive, and Channel 4 found it difficult to justify funding all the post-excavation work.“The beauty of crowdfunding is our supporters recognise that it’s not just the TV programme, it’s the archaeology – and they’re supporting that. We’re going to the Ness of Brodgar for a month – we wouldn’t have been able to do that with Channel 4.” Time Team will mark New Year’s Day with a three-hour broadcast onSutton Hoo– equally inconceivable on linear TV.YouTube brings new challenges, too, says Emily Boulting, Time Team’s senior producer-director, who first joined the programme in 2003: persuading careful archaeologists to adopt “acceptable hyperbole” to make their videos stand out online is one. But the audience doesn’t necessarily demand flashiness – one popular new approach is a fixed camera showing uninterrupted footage from a trench excavation. “People have loved the idea of sitting with moving wallpaper – it’s a bit like watching a test match,” she says.The programme is keen to expand – growing its supporter base, of course, but also investing in community digs and potentially a children’s strand. Brand partnerships would be very welcome, but they don’t see much advantage in teaming up with another broadcaster, says Boulting. “It’s difficult to imagine the right one at this point, because we are loving our freedom.”That Time Team is still flourishing three decades on is “extraordinary”, says Robinson – so how does he account for its enduring appeal? “I think archaeology is like magic. This is the ground that we walk on all day, every day. And yet if you weave the right spell, you can go down into it and find something extraordinary from another time. That is stunning, isn’t it? What better thing to be reminded of than the fact that there are wonders underneath our feet?”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyTelevisionHeritagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, more than ever, we must invest in hopeJosh HallidayNorth of England editorSat 3 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTShareWhen anti-immigration riots spread across the UK in the summer of 2024, one of Liverpool’s oldest churches found itself in the crosshairs.The 180-year-old St Anne’s in Toxteth was one of dozens of properties across the country on a far-right “hitlist” shared online. One menacing post showed its historic redbrick tower burning behind flame emojis.The church itself was not the target. Violent agitators were calling for an attack on one of its tenants: Asylum Link Merseyside (ALM), a charity that for 25 years has supported people fleeing war and persecution.The threat, said Ewan Roberts, then the centre manager for ALM, felt scarily real: “People had been scoping us out, driving past filming, kids on bikes filming. You think: ‘Oh God, is this how it happens?’”View image in fullscreenFather Peter Morgan, Dr Badr Abdullah, Catherine McCarron and Ewan Roberts have worked to strengthen community links since the unrest in 2024.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianBarely a mile away, al-Rahma mosque was also being watched. “You would see people monitoring the area, people on bikes hiding their faces. At one point we had someone with a machete outside,” said Dr Badr Abdullah, the chair of Liverpool Muslim Society.“It did feel like civil war … The feeling in the community was: someone is going to be killed, the mosque is going to be burned down,” he added.Across England and in Belfast, rioters had torched buildings, attacked mosques, battled police and brought terror to minority communities after the horrific murder of three young girls at a Taylor Swift holiday club in Southport on 29 July 2024.They singled out Britain’s immigrant and Muslim populations amid debunked claims that the killer, the Cardiff-born teenager Axel Rudakubana, was an Islamist terrorist who had arrived by small boat.View image in fullscreenProtesters turned out in Liverpool to counter planned far-right gatherings in the summer of 2024.Photograph: Ian Cooper/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Merseyside, the unrest was shocking and widespread. The next flare-up, planned for 7 August 2024, threatened to be even worse and triggered the biggest mobilisation of riot police across England in at least 13 years.But something else was happening too. Against what felt like a death spiral of racist attacks, solidarity was blossoming.Roberts, 60, describes “an army of carpenters” turning up to barricade the Grade II-listed windows of St Anne’s church. Hundreds more offered to protect the place of worship that survived Luftwaffe bombs in the second world war.As 7pm approached, mounted police patrolled the streets, riot vans were on virtually every street corner and Toxteth, with boarded-up pubs and shops, looked like a town bracing for war.Father Peter Morgan, the energetic 87-year-old parish priest of St Anne’s church, who arrived in Toxteth after the 1981 riots, had urged community members to stay away on the advice of police – though he stood defiantly outside.They came at first in their dozens. Then their hundreds. By dark, the mood had shifted as a crowd of about 2,000 people had amassed outside the glowering old church – not to raze it to the ground, but to defend it.View image in fullscreenFather Peter Morgan stood defiantly outside St Anne’s church on the day of the threatened attack.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianThey faced down the threat of petrol bombs and bricks with steel drums, dancing and homemade placards, one emblazoned “Nans against Nazis”. The scene wasreplicated across England: hope, not fear, had won.“That night was a turning point,” said Abdullah. “There was a sense of relief, solidarity, hope. We had seen a big rise of hate, but [then] we saw a big rise of love.”After more than a week of violence across England and in Belfast, the shift was immediate and palpable, Roberts, now the fundraising manager for ALM, said: “If it had gone the other way, you might have seen even more of an escalation. It took the whole sting out of it.”All three groups – St Anne’s church, al-Rahma mosque and ALM – are members of the Liverpool chapter of Citizens UK, one of five charities supported by this year’sGuardian charity appeal, which is raising money for grassroots voluntary organisations fighting division, hate and despair.Morgan said the solidarity shown that summer helped foster stronger links between the city’s many faith and community groups. “It was a gathering that couldn’t have come about through any other means.”Catherine McCarron, a community organiser for Citizens UK in Liverpool, said it had made her organisation more determined to fight division – particularly, she said, when it felt like politicians were not “showing leadership”.Although the immediate threat of violence has gone, anti-immigration rhetoric has become widespread. Across England, union jacks are hoisted from lamp-posts and a new form ofChristian nationalismis on the march, championed by the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.View image in fullscreenSt Anne’s church has revived its links with al-Rahma mosque, one mile away, since the 2024 unrest.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianMorgan is bemused about what he sees as the weaponisation of Christianity. “It’s absolute and utter nonsense – and utter hypocrisy,” he said. “They’re using Christian symbols, not really Christianism. If anything expresses unity for us, the cross does.”Abdullah, whose Liverpool Muslim Society represents more than 40,000 worshippers, said the “hijacking” of Christianity trod the same path as extremists in Islam. What worries him now is not this newfound zealotry – but that the anti-immigration message is now mainstream: “The momentum is back on their side.”Community leaders across England fear it is a matter of when – not if – disorder breaks out again. But when that day comes, the far right will be facing a more unified and determined voice.“It’s in all our self-interest to work together. We are community. We’re not separate strands – we belong,” said Morgan, whose church has revived its links with Abdullah’s mosque.“It’s that belonging that people want to have – and the trouble is some people feel that someone is taking away their belonging. But we’re tremendously enriched by what we share together.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolGuardian charity appeal 2025North of EnglandImmigration and asylumRaceRefugeesReligionFar rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then he was firedSam Levinein New YorkJoseph Tirrell says before he was fired as the DoJ’s senior ethics attorney, he fought battles over matters like the US attorney general accepting giftsSat 3 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 11.13 ESTShareJoseph Tirrell was reaching the end of a vacation on 11 July, and watching TV at home. He checked his email on his phone and saw a message from his employer, the Department of Justice. He thought it was strange that he was receiving email from the government on his personal account. Inside was a message that he was being fired from his job as the top ethics official at the department.The notice, signed by Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, did not give a reason for his firing. It alsomisspelled his first name, addressing it to “Jospeh W Tirrell”. Tirrell called his bosses at the department, who at first seemed as surprised as he did, before eventually confirming that he had in fact been terminated.At the start of the year, Tirrell knew that he might attract scrutiny from the incoming administration because he hadsigned offon special counsel Jack Smith receiving pro-bono legal services from a private law firm as he prepared to leave the government, something Tirrell said wasclearly allowedunder the department’s ethics rules. As the department’s top ethics official, he was responsible for overseeing ethics compliance across the agency and training the department’s top officers in their obligations.But as months passed and Tirrell remained in his job, he thought he was safe.Tirrell is one of scores of career federal employees this year who have been dismissed without reason. He isnow suingthe department over his firing.Those dismissedinclude prosecutorswho worked on January 6 cases,FBI agentswho kneeled during the 2020 George Floyd racial justice protests, and those whoworked underSmith, who criminally charged Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and retain classified documents. Many of those employees and other experts have said the firings create a dangerous environment in which career non-partisan federal employees, who are supposed to be protected from political interference, live in fear of losing their jobs for simply doing what is asked of them.“I think the reason to fire the senior ethics attorney at DoJ is pretty clear. It’s to send a message,” he said. “The message is: ‘Do what we tell you to do, or you’ll lose your job.’”Tirrell, 51, joined the FBI as an ethics lawyer in 2006 before joining the justice department in 2018. In every administration, he said, there were requests about whether or not employees could accept certain gifts or attend certain events. Usually those were dispensed with quickly, so he and his staff could focus on more complex ethical matters, like potential conflicts of interests.But this year, Tirrell found himself fighting protracted battles over those smaller matters that usually would be resolved fairly easily.When Tirrell trained Bondi on the justice department’s ethics rules, he wanted to be mindful of her time, so he prepared in advance for some hot topics he thought might come up, including the Hatch Act and ethical considerations around Bondi’s prior work for Trump. But when he got to the training, he said Bondi and her chief of staff were focused on a smaller question: could the attorney general accept commemorative challenge coins from subordinates in the department?“We’ve pretty much said you can’t accept gifts from employees unless it’s your birthday or Christmas or Hanukkah or a similar kind of holiday where people give gifts,” Tirrell said. “We spent more time than I thought was warranted on something, in frankly my view unimportant, as whether or not you could accept a challenge coin from whomever.“There seemed to be a lot of importance by these officials placed on [the] appearance of them getting stuff,” he added. “On the appearance of them showing their willingness to accept that gift.”For example, early on in the administration, Bondi received a box of cigars from the mixed martial artistConor McGregor, with a note congratulating her on becoming the attorney general, Tirrell said. The value of the gift exceeded what Bondi could accept under the department’s ethics rules, so the attorney general had three options: pay for the gift herself, send it back, or destroy it. (Tirrell said in his experience, employees will rarely open their pocketbooks to personally pay for a gift.)“Immediately I got the sense they were reluctant to send things back or destroy stuff,” he said referring to the attorney general’s office. “It’s like: ‘No we can’t send it back, I mean what does that say?’’”Seeking to build a rapport with Bondi’s office, Tirrell said he figured out a way to keep the cigars. The department would accept the gift and put it on display for everyone to see, preventing Bondi from personally benefiting from the cigars. “Nobody gets to smoke the cigars,” he said. “We put the box up, which had some engraving on it I think, and the AG gets to say: ‘Oh look how nice Mr McGregor and the MMA organization [are], they’re good members of the community.”Tirrell said he felt relatively comfortable with his decision.MMA is setto hold a fight at the White House on Donald Trump’s birthday next year and one of the potential participants is McGregor. “If we’d known more about that at the time, we might have raised more concerns about the ethics of accepting that gift,” he said.A justice department official said the cigars and cigar box were destroyed.There were also gifts fromFifa, which is set to host the World Cup in the US, Canada, and Mexico this year. Earlier this year, Tirrell said, Bondi received a scarf and a 2025 World Cup soccer ball from the organization. (The New Yorker reported Trump gave her the ball after a meeting with Fifa). Again, the value of the items exceeded what Bondi could accept and Tirrell said he told her as much. He received pushback.“We were going back and forth ‘you know what about keeping this for display?’,” he said. The items, he said, were “not really the kind of thing we would put up on the wall”.A justice department official said the soccer ball was accepted as a gift on behalf of the department.While those conversations were ongoing, Tirrell received word that Bondi was likely to be invited to a Fifa club World Cup final in July 2025. Tirrell pre-emptively wrote to Bondi’s office saying that ethics rules prohibited her and her staff from accepting tickets to attend the event. “We got some questions like: ‘What if we’re doing this, and what if we’re doing that?’ And the answers were: ‘Probably not, no, you can’t go, you can’t do this’,” Tirrell said. Then Bondi’s office asked if Bondi could attend if the president was there and had a question about security at the event.Tirrell responded and recalled saying something along the lines of: “If the president’s there and he’s got a question about security at the event, the AG, can walk into the booth, you know, walk into the box seats and say: ‘Mr President, here’s what’s going on with security. Right? Answer your question, sir. All right, excellent. Enjoy the game. I’ll be outside.’”Tirrell gave his advice the week before he was fired. Two days after he received notice of his dismissal, Bondi was photographed at the game with Trump. “Maybe the attorney general paid for that ticket or a ticket of her spouse, right?,” Tirrell said. “Maybe she sat in that box seat, facing the president and not watching the game right for three hours, was answering security questions. But, you know, come on, I know that’s not the case.”Asked about Bondi’s attendance at the match, a justice department official said career ethics officials are regularly consulted, and their advice has never been overruled.Tirrell said the problems around Bondi accepting seats at the game were related to showing fair and impartial law enforcement, particularly because Fifa has an interest in the US immigration policy as travelers around the world arrive to watch the tournament. “Fifa has an interest beyond sort of the normal: ‘Hey, can we get security?’” he said.There were other issues that raised concerns for Tirrell.Sometime this spring, he said, he was asked to work on a plan related to how the justice department could deploy the hundreds of millions of dollars private law firms had pledged in pro-bono work as part of agreements with theTrump administration. The government cannot simply deploy private lawyers to handle government work, Tirrell said. So one idea was to explorewhether the DoJ could accept the funds from the firms and then use that money to hire the firm’s lawyers at their current salaries for a period of time before sending them back to the firms.“As soon as it was explained to me, without even really having to do any legal research. I knew that this was a non-starter,” he said. Under ethics and bar rules, there would have been conflicts of interests between the government and private practice work.“The only way that those attorneys would have been able to come over is if their law firms had gotten a waiver from every client at the firm permitting that attorney to work for the government on every single matter that that attorney was involved in,” he said. “You’re not going to tell some client: ‘Hey I’m working on this secret investigation.’”Tirrell said that he and other officials discussed the idea at a meeting earlier this year and another official said they needed to find a way to get rid of the obstacles.“I said to him: ‘These are not obstacles. These are safety guidelines, these are safety rails. And you can’t remove them.’”A justice department spokesperson said no such proposal is under consideration.Ever since he was 15, Tirrell said he has never wanted to do anything else but work for the United States. He joined the US navy and after he said he wanted to be an attorney because “those are the people that do some of the most important work for our country that aren’t in uniform.”After law school, he found his way by chance to a compliance job at the FBI, where he quickly found himself contributing to major cases in important ways. After the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016, for example, Tirrell said he helped negotiate an agreement for free office space so the FBI could be onsite for family members.“I loved every minute of it,” he said of his tenure working for the federal government. “No desire to do anything else until now.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPam BondiUS politicsConor McGregorFifaEthicsLaw (US)interviewsShareReuse this content"

Why peace still feels elusive for UkraineThe US may be making positive noises, but exhausted Ukrainians remain wary after nearly four years of warShaun WalkerSat 3 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShare“Iwould give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a message to the Ukrainian people released just before midnight on New Year’s Eve. “Unfortunately, I cannot say that yet.”Zelenskyy said a peace agreement was “90% ready”, but added something that subverted Donald Trump’s constant claims that a deal is just around the corner. “Those 10% contain, in fact, everything,” he said.It is almost a year since Trump took office and promised to end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours. That never seemed possible, but as 2025 came to a closea new flurry of US diplomacybegan, accompanied by more optimistic statements about peace.View image in fullscreenPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivering his new year address to the Ukrainian people.Photograph: Ukraine presidency/Planet Pix/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe talks were kicked off by the leaking of a peace plan drafted by Russia and the US. Washington told Zelenskyy that Ukraine would have to give up the Donbas region, while the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, gathered diplomats from Nato countries in Kyiv for what one person presentdescribed as“a nightmare meeting” to tell them Ukraine should sign up to the deal now or face a worse one in future.Zelenskyy, in concert with his European allies, managed to stave off the plan, which would have felt like a capitulation to most Ukrainians, and started work with the Americans on a new kind of plan. But even ifUkraineand the US are now “90% ready” with that plan, the new year begins with a sense that peace remains elusive. There is little to suggest Russia will jump on board, and however much Trump claims Putin wants peace, Russian officials have made clear they will only sign up to an agreement that deals with what they call the “root causes” of the war.There is a sense, however, as Ukrainians endure another winter of power cuts, air raids and separated families, that some kind of respite is needed soon. Ukrainians are feeling the exhaustion of close to four years of full-scale war.View image in fullscreenRecruits of the 65th Separate Mechanised Brigade training in the Zaporizhzhia region.Photograph: 65th Mechanised Brigade press service/EPA“When I’m at the front I feel OK, but when I come back home I have bad dreams, take antidepressants and so on,” said Serhiy, a Ukrainian soldier who has served on some of the most volatile parts of the frontline, and in December was on home leave in Kyiv. He said he was ready to keep fighting, rather than sign up to something that could prove disastrous for Ukraine in the long run, but conceded he may now be in a minority. “I think by this stage, probably the majority would be ready to go for a bad deal; anything to stop the fighting,” he said.For many Ukrainians, this new year has been the hardest psychologically since the war began. At the start of 2023 there was still some hope that Ukrainian military success would putRussiaon the back foot and lead to something approaching victory. By 2024 this looked much less likely, but some semblance of hope remained.When 2025 arrived, it was already clear that victory on the battlefield was not imminent, but the election of Trump for a second term boosted hopes in Kyiv that the wildcard politician could benefit Ukraine. An oft-heard prediction in Kyiv a year ago held that when Trump realised Putin was not serious about peace, he would pivot to backing Ukraine fully, disregarding the Biden administration’s red lines and fear of escalation.That did not happen, and as 2026 begins, it is hard for many in Ukraine to find anything that would give hope of a positive medium-term solution. For now, the best-case scenario appears to be that the Ukrainian military, and society, can continue holding out until the situation in Russia worsens enough that the Kremlin may be forced to accept negotiations on terms that would not require Ukrainian capitulation. The worst-case scenarios do not bear thinking about.On Friday, Zelenskyy appointed his longstanding military intelligence head, Kyrylo Budanov, to be his chief of staff, after the resignation several weeks ago of Andrii Yermak, his closest advisor, in a corruption scandal.Budanov, a mercurial and charismatic figure known for planning audacious operations against Russia, has good contacts with western intelligence agencies and also maintains contacts with Russia over prisoner exchanges. His appointment could signal a new approach to security and negotiations from Kyiv.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises above residential buildings after Russian drone and missile attacks in Kyiv.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe coming year may also prove a challenging one for Zelenskyy politically, as the five-year presidential term to which he was elected in spring 2019 nears the seven-year mark.Martial law in Ukraine prevents the holding of elections, and while there is widespread criticism of Zelenskyy’s leadership on a range of factors, the impossibility of a wartime election is one point on which there is a broad consensus across the Ukrainian political spectrum.“It would only cause harm,” Serhiy Rakhmanin, an MP from the opposition Holos party,toldthe Guardian. “He’s the commander-in-chief, and the country is in a position where we don’t have that luxury, whatever issues we might have with him. It would only help the enemy.”View image in fullscreenFirefighters working at the site of an air attack in the Odesa region.Photograph: Ukrainian emergency service/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump, however, has called for an election, parroting the Russian claim that the lack of elections makes Zelenskyy an illegitimate president. “They haven’t had an election in a long time. You know, they talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it’s not a democracy any more.”Zelenskyy reacted by saying he would ask parliament to arrange the necessary laws to allow for a presidential election in wartime, and asked western allies to explain how they would see the security arrangements for a vote in a country at war. “I don’t want anyone to be able to use the lack of elections as an argument against Ukraine, so I’m reacting to what our partners are saying,” he said.Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander of Ukraine’s army and current ambassador to London, is widely seen asthe most viable electoral challenger to Zelenskyy. Zaluzhnyi has turned down previous offers to join Zelenskyy’s electoral team and is biding his time, having been sold on the idea of a political run but aware of the damage a competitive election could cause to Ukraine’s fragile wartime society.“He’s not making any active preparations for a campaign, and his public position is that while the war continues he is not thinking about elections and not preparing for them,” said a source close to Zaluzhnyi. “Time will tell whether he goes into politics.”View image in fullscreenA man examining a drone that Russia said was used in an alleged attack on a residence of Vladimir Putin.Photograph: Russian defence ministry press service/APThe year ended withRussia claiming Ukraine had launched a massive drone attack on Putin’s residence, an act it said would be met with a tough response. Moscow provided no evidence to back up the claim, with Kyiv insisting the whole story was fabricated, and the CIA reaching the same conclusion, according to US media outlets. It was a reminder of how easy it would be, even if a ceasefire was agreed around elections or as part of a deal, for Russia to invent a thin pretext to relaunch its war.Rakhmanin said he thought there were “no objective reasons” for negotiations to be successful while Russia felt it was still advancing its goals on the battlefield, but that there was a small chance of a window for a deal at the end of winter.“We need three things to come together: more systematic military and financial support fromEurope, a stabilisation of the frontline so Russia’s advances stop, and serious economic problems to begin for Russia,” Rakhmanin said. “If these three factors come together, then things can work out, even with Trump’s position as it is. But if even one of them doesn’t work in our favour, then it’s going to be extremely difficult.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropeNatonewsShareReuse this content"

It also included 279 influenza-associated pediatric deaths, the highest reported to the agency during a seasonal influenza epidemic.This year, a new variant, subclade K, has emerged and the flu season started earlier than usual in Europe, with “high or very high influenza activity”, in December in the region.In the United States, there had been an estimated 7.5m influenza cases and 81,000 hospitalizations by 20 December. That marked a 25% increase in cases over the previous week, according to the CDC.Thirty-two stateshave seen a “high or very high” number of flu illnesses.“A lot of people are getting the flu at the same time, which is always tough. That is actually tougher than a situation in which people get it and it’s spread out over a longer period,” Nuzzo said. “It could be a worse season, in part because more people are going to need more care than hospitals can easily deliver.”Epidemiologists are also concerned that fewer people could opt to get the flu vaccine because the CDC, led by the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, canceledits campaignencouraging people to get the shot. At the start of December, about 130m flu vaccines had been distributed in the US, 13m less than at the same point last year,according to the CDC.“It’s completely incredulous to me that after experiencing the worst flu season for kids on record that we could head into this flu season – with signs that it could be bad, based on the viruses circulating out there – with anything but a robust plan to encourage people to get vaccinated,” Nuzzo said.Some US residents could also be concerned about how much protection the new round of vaccine shots offer against the latest variant.“We have some reason to think that the protection may be lower, but I want to be careful by saying” that, Nuzzo said. “It may protect you less, but it’s likely still going to give you some important protection.”People also might not be aware that they can pick up an at-home test from a pharmacy, Nuzzo said.“There are some people who might benefit from medication if they tested positive, but that medication needs to be given very soon after symptoms start,” Nuzzo said.Explore more on these topicsFluInfectious diseasesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Fierce storms in recent weeks blew down or damaged thousands of tents, affecting at least 235,000 people,according to UN estimates.Prepared by thePalestineShelter Cluster, which coordinates the activities of nearly 700 non-government organisations in Palestine and is chaired by the Norwegian Refugee Council, the assessment found that newly delivered tents housing hundreds of thousands of people would “likely need to be replaced”.View image in fullscreenTents in Nuseirat, central Gaza, where parts of the camp has experienced flooding.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP“The fabric [of theEgyptian tents] tears easily as sewing quality is poor,” it reported. “The fabric is not waterproof. Other issues include small windows, weak structure, no flooring, the roof collects water due to the design of the tent, and no mesh for openings.”Tents from Saudi Arabia were criticised as having “non-waterproof light fabric, weak structure” and tents donated byChinawere “very light” and not waterproof.Those supplied by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and theUnited Nationswere judged to have met the specifications of UN experts.The findings – based on 9,000 responses to a poll on social media in November, observations “from partners on the ground” and “community feedback” – will raise new questions about the quality of aid being supplied directly to Gaza by individual countries, which have been favoured by Israeli authorities seeking to bypass the UN.Since the ceasefire in October after two years of conflict, only 20,000 of the 90,000 tents that had enteredGazawere supplied by the UN or other major international NGOs, one aid official said.View image in fullscreenA view of tents in Gaza City, including those marked by flags from the UAE and Qatar considered to have met UN specifications. The findings will raise questions about the quality of aid being supplied directly to Gaza by individual countries, which have been favoured by Israeli authorities seeking to bypass the UN.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesCogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees aid to Gaza, has said it is working to support “winterisation” in the territory by allowing the supply of more than25,000 tonnesof tarpaulins and tents.Palestinians in Gaza and humanitarian officials said tents sold on the open market by commercial contractors were inadequate for Gaza in winter and were expensive.“The tent we live in is worn out and rainwater leaks inside,” said Linda Abu Halima, 30, who was living in the coastal zone of Mawasi after her home in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, was destroyed. “We received it through the help of someone; it is handmade from wood and tarpaulin. We cannot buy a new tent due to the high prices, and we have not received any aid at all.”Almost all the 2.3 million population of Gaza has been displaced many times since the conflict was triggered in October 2023 by a surprise Hamas raid into Israel, and swathes of the territory have been reduced to rubble.Many in Gaza believed the ceasefire would allow them to start rebuilding their homes. Instead, the division of the territory and the continued humanitarian crisis have made this impossible. Few have the resources to move, most essential items remain scarce, and basic services are almost nonexistent.The UN’s operations may be further restricted as many NGOs that deliver services in Gaza on its behalfface a ban under new Israeli lawsimposing stringent registration requirements.View image in fullscreenChinese-donated tents in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/ShutterstockOfficials in Israel have saidthe new systemaims to “streamline the humanitarian system so that aid and humanitarian platforms are not used and abused by Hamas”. Aid officials said the consequences would be “catastrophic”.Hopes for rapid progress to a second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire are fading. Analysts say neither Hamas, which has control over most of the population of Gaza, nor Israel, which holds more than half of the territory and all the entry points, have much incentive to make immediate concessions. Both sides accuse the other of ceasefire violations.In their 2023 raid into Israel, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 250. Israel’s ensuing offensive killed about 70,000 people, mostly civilians. Another414 Palestinianshad been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire, Palestinian officials said.“The only thing that changed with the start of the ceasefire was the silence of the shelling and the end of the bloodshed; our daily lives remain almost the same, with the same suffering,” said Abdullah Abdo, 25, originally from Gaza City but now living in a tented encampment in Mawasi.According to Donald Trump’s20-point planto end the conflict in Gaza, the second phase would involve full disarmament of Hamas, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces, the deployment of an “international stabilisation force” and the appointment of a technocratic administration for the territory. The plan also calls for a “full” flow of aid.Aid officials told the Guardian that efforts to reinforce flood defences were hindered by Israeli restrictions on heavy equipment, construction material and sandbags. Israeli officials said some such machinery could be used by Hamas for military purposes, such as building tunnels.View image in fullscreenA displaced Palestinian looks out over a makeshift camp in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAJawaher Abd Rabbo, 25, lives with her husband and three small children in a single, rat-infested room with no windows or floor in the ruins of an apartment block in the Nasser neighbourhood of Gaza City. Nothing remains of her own home, only a mile further east.Rabbo and her family recently fled from a makeshift shelter east of the Tuffah neighbourhood close to the new “yellow line” which, since the ceasefire in October, divides Gaza into zones controlled by Israel and Hamas.“We left when we heard lots of explosions,” Rabbo said. “I left all our clothes and belongings behind, and carried my two-month-old daughter in my arms and held my two-year-old by the hand, while my husband was in a wheelchair due to an injury he got during the war.”Rabbo said she and her husband had tried to repair the room that is now their home, putting plastic sheets where there once were walls and on the ground.Nineteen people have been killed by buildings collapsing after recent heavy rain, Palestinian officials said.‘During this storm, we had no sufficient blankets or clothing to protect us from the cold,” Rabbo said. “Rainwater soaked everything. We only have one mattress, which my children and I share. I know staying in a ruined building during winter is extremely dangerous, but we have no other choice.”Explore more on these topicsGazaAidIsraelEgyptChinaSaudi ArabiaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Four huge metal urns of meat filling are waiting to be added. Workers in hairnets and overalls buzz about, checking a production line that holds 4.5 tonnes of pastry at any one time.This is food production on an industrial scale, designed to satisfy the UK’s seemingly insatiable appetite for sausage rolls, vegan bites and other baked treats.Every sausage roll or steak bake bought at any of Greggs’s 2,675 UK outlets will have been produced and frozen at this plant inNewcastleupon Tyne, the company’s home city, before being baked in store and served possibly hundreds of miles away.The scale may seem enough to satisfy demand – with bags of flour weighing 16.5kg and brick-sized blocks of fat and margarine moved around by forklift truck – yet the bakery chain is continuing to expand production.The Newcastle site, which churns out the equivalent of 1m sausage rolls every day, gained a fourth production line in 2024. Now,Greggsis preparing to launch an automated production site in Derby, followed in 2027 by another in Kettering, Northamptonshire. Its estimated capital expenditure in 2025 was £300m.View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes at the Northumberland Street branch of Greggs in Newcastle.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThe new factories are intended to help the company reach its target of 3,500 stores across the UK – 800 more than it operates currently.After years of rapid expansion, Greggs’ determination to keep opening new branches, even as like-for-like sales have fallen, has raised eyebrows among analysts and investors.Combined with a slide in the company’s share price over the last year, it has led some to ask: has the UK reached the limit of its appetite for Greggs?Roisin Currie,Greggs’ chief executive, insisted otherwise in July. “I absolutely don’t believe we have reached peak Greggs,” she said, adding the company had previously bounced back from “downturns”.View image in fullscreenFiona Wilson and Keith Stewart visit Greggs in Newcastle two to three times a week.Photograph: Joanna Partridge/The GuardianOthers have their doubts, however. Analysts at the broker Panmure Liberum said the chain now “sits at a crossroads”.Greggs is still held in particular esteem by people in its home city. On a chilly December morning, when the Guardian visited the branch in Newcastle railway station, customers were queueing out of the door. The same was true at the store outside the station.Waiting for a breakfast sandwich and a coffee were Fiona Wilson and Keith Stewart.“It’s very good quality coffee at a reasonable price,” said Stewart. Flashing her loyalty app and explaining she usually visits two or three times a week, Wilson added: “I love the products and like that it’s a local brand.”What would go on to become Britain’s largest bakery chain started with one man and a dream. In 1939, John Gregg began delivering fresh eggs and yeast to Newcastle families by bike. Just over a decade later, he opened his first shop selling bread and baked goods in the city’s Gosforth district, where the high street is still home to a branch of Greggs.Gregg could hardly have predicted the company bearing his name would balloon over subsequent decades, appearing from Elgin in Scotland to Truro in Cornwall, employing 33,000 people.The chain expanded through the 70s and 80s under the control of Gregg’s sons as it bought up regional bakery chains. Its most recent transformation came in the 2010s, when the then CEORoger Whiteside, Currie’s predecessor,decided toditch traditional products such as loavesto focus on the food-to-go market.View image in fullscreenAn archive photo of Greggs in Gosforth, Newcastle, displayed in the chain’s Christmas pop-up venue in Fenwick’s department store.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThe pivot was successful and the chain gained a reputation for cheap and reliable breakfasts and lunches as its logo of four orange squares on a blue background popped up on ever-more high streets.It reachedthe milestone of £1bn in annual salesin 2018 and launched avegan sausage rollthe following year, becoming something of a phenomenon as it wonplaudits for its lighthearted social media marketing.In the early 2020s, the pandemic notwithstanding, loaf-free Greggs was on a roll. Currie followed in Whiteside’s footsteps, offering menu items such as pizza and mac and cheese.The company was profiled ina behind-the-scenes TV documentaryand collaborated with other brands, including the budget clothing chain Primark, which released a sell-outGreggs “festival wear” range.Sales kept rising like puff pastry in a hot oven, and by 2024 Greggs had doubled annual turnover to £2bn and opened its 2,600th branch. At the same time, shares in the FTSE 250 company, which first listed in 1984, were on a mostly upwards trajectory.It was in 2025 that Greggs seemed to falter.Early on, bosses blamed wintry weather forthe company’s worst sales growth since the pandemic. A summer of warm temperatures and sunshine diminished customers’ appetite for pastry, leaving analysts and investors questioning the brand’s direction as it continued to target 120 net store openings in 2025.Greggs’ share price has fallen by about 40% over the past year, and it ended 2025 as the most-shorted stock in the UK as people placed bets that its value would fall further still.An activist investor – the Singapore-based hedge fund Lauro Asset Management – recently criticised the company’s management, urging it to cut costs to avoid becoming a takeover target.Others wonder whether the chain can sustain growth through new branch openings, which could simply move existing customers around if they prove to be too close to existing sites.Peter Backman, a restaurant consultant, drew a comparison to the rival chain Subway, which he said had “around 2,000” branches, “so Greggs are probably near the limit”.He added: “It will be a few years until they reach the maximum number of stores. However, there are other issues, and the number of people who visit their stores isn’t necessarily going to go up.”View image in fullscreenGreggs on Gosforth high street in Newcastle today.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianGiven its very British proposition, expansion overseas seems unlikely. A previous five-year attempt to woo Belgian consumers failed andthe chain closed its “Engelse Bakker” (English baker) storesin 2008.Consumers remain sensitive to price increases, too, even as inflation has cooled.The sausage roll that cost 66p in 2012 has now doubled to £1.30in Newcastle city centre, though prices can vary depending on location.Greggs has raised prices “ahead of the market”, according to analysts at the broker Jefferies. It found the chain’s sandwiches cost 6% more in October 2025 than a year earlier, while key hot items were 4.5% pricier – though it concluded “pricing is still sharp”.View image in fullscreenNaomi Watson at the pop-up Golden Flake Tavern in Newcastle’s Fenwick department store.Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianOthers have queried whetherwider uptake of weight-loss jabscould further knock sales of calorific pastries, though the company has been introducing healthier options, including fruit pots and salads.At a time when some believe it should focus on its core business, Greggs continues to try out new formats, such as smaller shops in high footfall locations. The first of these “Bitesize Greggs” opened in Sevenoaks railway station in November.Before Christmas, the chain launched its annual pop-up venue – this time a “Greggs pub” inside Newcastle’s Fenwick department store. Despite considerably higher prices – £12.50 for a steak bake served with egg, chips and tomato – the Golden Flake Tavern has been booked out with customers wanting to enjoy Greggs’ best-known products in a traditional-looking boozer.Naomi Watson and her mum described the plates of sausage roll, gravy and mash (£9) and mac and cheese bites (£4.25) at the pop-up as “very good”. Even though they would not usually describe themselves as “Greggs people” given the “lack of salad” on offer, the pair thought the pub visit would be “a fun day out”.Greggs will reveal on 8 January how many festive bakes and mince pies it sold in the final quarter. Dan Coatsworth, the head of markets at the broker AJ Bell, said the announcement could be crucial for the future direction of the company.“Greggs is at a massive strategic turning point and the bosses need to do something,” he said. “Banging the drum saying nothing is wrong is not cutting the mustard.

Three in five Brits online now encounter the site, up from a third in 2023,according to Ofcom.Its popularity is rising fastest with younger internet users. It is now the sixth most visited organisation of any kind by UK users aged between 18 and 24, up from 10th a year earlier. More than three-quarters of that cohort now visit it.The rapid growth marks a shift in the site’s standing, with its numerous forums once seen as arenas for hostile exchanges between largely anonymous users. The UK is a boom market for the platform, with the second largest user base behind the US, according to company records.A series of factors are behind its rise. However, a change in Google’s search algorithms last year to prioritise helpful content from discussion forumsappears to have been a significant driver.A recent deal with Google that allows the company to train its AI model on Reddit’s content also appears to have provided a boost. Reddit is the most-cited source for Google AI overviews, which is likely to see more people directed to its forums. It hasa similar deal with OpenAI, which owns the most popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT.The company believes it is also benefiting from shifting internet habits, as younger users seek out human-generated reviews and opinions on issues including parenting, skincare and sports.More than half its UK users are women. Internal company research suggests 71% of women on Reddit in the UK have a personal interest in skincare, beauty and cosmetics, prompting higher traffic for specific UK Reddit forums on those issues, known as subreddits.“Reddit started with this perception, rightfully so, for a male skew – gaming and tech as the anchor,” said Jen Wong, Reddit’s chief operating officer, who said she spent a lot of time in the UK gardening subreddit. “Reddit has become very diverse – it is gender-balanced in the UK now … what’s interesting is that one in three are gen Z women on the platform.“Gen Z are very open to looking online for advice around these life stage moments, like leaving home and renting for the first time, which happens a little bit later for some of this generation. It’s a very safe place to ask questions about balancing a cheque book, or how to pay for a wedding.”UK subreddits on pregnancy and parenting have doubled in size over the last year.There is also a growing trend for supporters of Premier League clubs to watch games while logged on to their team’s subreddit. The Premier League subreddit has grown by more than a billion views in the last year, according to company records.It also appears to be a popular discussion ground for women’s football, which has less dedicated coverage than the men’s game. There has been a doubling of views for subreddits covering Arsenal’s women’s team and the Lionesses in the last year.Wong said the company was focused on convincing users to come straight to the platform, rather than via a search result. She also touted Reddit as an antidote to AI-generated content.“You see these accidents of AI slop and AI advice – Reddit doesn’t have that,” she said. “It’s not clean. It’s messy, in that it has lots of different pieces of advice that you have to sift through. It’s not manicured down to one answer for you, but that’s kind of the point.”Amid the rise in prominence of the site, the UK government has launched its own account,UKGovNews, in the last year. It has posted about the cost of living, rail ticket prices and immigration. Steve Reed, the housing secretary, recently held an “ask me anything” session.Confrontational exchanges are still easy to find on the platform. Wong said it was part of the site’s culture but that all subreddits had their own rules and moderators.“Reddit is really honest and I think that’s one of the things that makes Reddit,” she said. “Every person who joins Reddit is a moderator, because you get to vote up or down on a post – and a down vote is incredibly powerful. ‘Be civil’ is one of the most common rules in communities.”Explore more on these topicsRedditSocial mediaInternetDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Tenerife has reclaimed the top spot for 2026, while Malta, Egypt, Dubai and Fuerteventura have all climbed sharply.The UK travel agency body Abta also said many travellers were booking further ahead than usual, with a significant number of holidays being secured for summer 2026 and even into 2027.Melissa Hawkins, a marketing manager for Dorset Cottage Holidays, said: “Bookings for stays over the first weekend back after Christmas are up 60% year-on-year … From what we’re seeing, that post-Christmas lull is being used more deliberately.“People have the headspace to plan … Short breaks and shoulder-season stays are proving especially popular, particularly with families and multi-generational groups who want something straightforward but high quality. There’s also a noticeable confidence in booking earlier.”A spokesperson for Jet2.com and Jet2holidays said: “Sunshine Saturday is traditionally a busy time for holiday bookings. We are expecting that to be the case this year, as customers flock to book their award-winning flights and holidays with the UK’s favourite tour operator and airline.”The TravelSupermarket research also found that Menorca, Lake Como and Sicily have seen the steepest declines in search interest. Several Italian destinations and parts of the Caribbean have also cooled compared with last year.The data suggests Britons are prepared to travel further, with the average flight time of searched destinations increasing by more than 20 minutes year on year, reflecting growing interest in mid-haul and long-haul travel.Rory Boland, the editor of the magazine Which? Travel, urged consumers not to “feel pressured into booking in a hurry” this weekend despite it being “advertised as a prime time to grab a holiday bargain”.He said: “Consider your options and shop around to make sure you’re getting the right holiday for you, at the right price. If you are flexible on destination, there are offers throughout the year.”Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureAir transportConsumer affairsMaltanewsShareReuse this content"

It was also two days after his final, death-infusedalbum Blackstarappeared from nowhere. As an artistic statement it was prophetic and impeccably theatrical. A feature-length documentary now shines a black light on that album’s recording, which some call Bowie’s creative resurrection. What does it reveal? And do we want to revisit that place, emotionally?Thankfully, Bowie: The Final Act (Saturday 3 January, 10pm, Channel 4) does not live solely in the catacombs. It begins at the zenith of Bowie’s pop fame: the 1983 Serious Moonlighttour, where the Thin White Duke turned American soul hero. This MTV-approved, Pepsi advert-inducing stardom was the onset of a career-stalling ennui, Bowie’s artistic voice drying out under the bright lights he sought. It then ricochets back to the start of his musical journey, pinballing us through its highlights. With a mythology this seismic it would be a crime not to. David Bowie invented serving looks, you know. They just happened to come from another planet.The contributors are decent. They include members of Bowie’s bands, friends, producers Tony Visconti and Goldie, and novelistHanif Kureishi. The latter remembers – without rancour – the way Bowie would form intense friendships with interesting people such as him, soaking up all he needed, before dropping them and moving on. It’s an important reminder that creative geniuses tend to leave plenty of personal debris in their wake. Moby also makes an appearance, with a neck tattoo that reads Vegan for Life. That’s not relevant, but it is distracting.The film’s unusual theme is the minor notes of a stellar career. The poorly received albums, crises of confidence. In one difficult scene, Melody Maker writer Jon Wilde reads out a scabrous review he wrote of Tin Machine II, which ends with the words: “Sit down man: you’re a fucking disgrace.” Bowie reportedly cried when he read it. As someone who made their start in snarky music criticism, I felt ants under my skin while watching.Bowie’s less successful ventures have been mostly reassessed. Tin Machine, his attempt to be a side player in a conventional rock outfit, still gets a kicking. “A really bad band, with a really bad name,” is editor Dylan Jones’s assessment. “Vulcan pimp suits” is how band leader Reeves Gabrels describes their actual outfits – collarless, colour-block two pieces. There’s fascination here, too: why would an otherworldly rock god, an androgyne who could no more blend into a crowd than a flamingo in a fur coat, desire to merely be “some bloke in a band?” Genius is lonely is the implication.‘The internet is an alien life form’: how David Bowie created a market for digital musicRead moreFlashes of supernovae, black holes and black stars recur throughout the film, a leitmotif of mortality. It’s hard to watch footage of Bowie walking off stage in Prague in pain, as his illness asserted itself. He left the limelight for 10 years, enjoying family life while he could. After going through chemotherapy, he recorded his loneliest, most vulnerable album in full knowledge of what was coming. There’s dignity and courage to songwriters who can do this. I think of Warren Zevon, Leonard Cohen. It is their final gift, whether or not we’re ready to receive it.Director Jonathan Stiasny’s film is no hagiography, yet it’s apparent he loves the Bowie myth as much as anyone. Thank God. There’s rapture in those images of Ziggy Stardust, that immortal face under all the reinventions, the hair that stayed perfect. There’s nostalgic bliss in the stories of Bowie’s playgrounds – 60s London, 70s New York. There’s black-and-white footage of an acid-drenched Glastonbury, when the festival’s audience was naked hippies who wandered in. Bowie walked to his first performance there, and ended up playing at 5am.There’s also the incredible clip of Bowie’s 1999 Newsnight interview with Jeremy Paxman, where he predicted the internet-mediated, chaotic world we live in today. I find myself wondering what he would have made of AI. I find myself missing him, and what he stood for. A beacon for misfits, a champion of creativity without horizons or fear. He was iconic and otherworldly. But in the end the art, and the man, were heartbreakingly human.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherTelevisionDavid BowiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rip up all the rules!After 35 years of teaching fiction writing, the prize-winning author shares her wisdom. First tip? Don’t write what you know…Elizabeth McCrackenSat 3 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 04.03 ESTShareBeginningI don’t think it’s a bad thing to want to write a first sentence so idiosyncratic, so indelible, so entirely your own that it makes people sit up or reach for a pen or say to a beloved: “Listen to this.” A first line needn’t be ornate or long. It needn’t grab you by the lapels and give you what for. A first line is only a demand for further attention, an invitation to the rest of the book. Whisper or bellow, a polite request or a monologue meant to repel interruption. I believe a first line should deliver some sort of pleasure by being beautiful or mysterious or funny or blunt or cryptic. Why would anyone start a novel, “It was June, and the sun was out,” which could be the first line of any novel or story? It tells you nothing. It asks nothing of you.Not everyone agrees with me, nor do all great novels have memorable first lines. Pull books from your shelf and you’ll find plenty that start with a month or day of the week plus the weather. Maybe there’s a good argument: if you orient your reader on some level immediately, they will be ready for disorientation on others. Flatness can be a screen upon which brightness may be projected. Disorientation is one of the duties of fiction.No, I insist. A generic first line is a failure of nerve.RulesIt might be helpful to believe in absolutes when you’re first writing fiction.You can’t have more than one point of view in a story. Novel chapters should be a uniform length. The present tense brings the reader in. The present tense is shallow as a dime. Epiphanies are how we understand life. Epiphanies are false, flimsy.These absolutes should be as small and solid as training wheels; like training wheels, you can easily take them off later.I have never encountered a rule for fiction I believed in, at least in the long run, apart fromDon’t use a gothic font to make your work feel spooky.SubjectIf you’re writing a book, I tell my students, you had better make it a book of your heart: something you suspect only you can write, something that will menace you if you don’t get it down on the page. Too many people try to write somebody else’s book, hoping that it’s publishable.View image in fullscreenI’ve taught creative writing for 35 years, longer than I’ve been publishing books, but I believe in modes of thinking, not rules. At heart, as both fiction writer and teacher, I’m an aphorist and a metaphorist. I hope to provoke my students into thinking the most interesting thoughts that they can, so they can teach themselves how to write.Be ambitiousAmbition is everything.Fictionisn’t ballet. It’s not marathoning. You don’t have to start small, with drills or exercises; there’s nothing you need to perfect before moving on. Your budget for characters and sets and props and visual effects is infinite. You can splash out for equipment, but it isn’t necessary. You should attempt everything. Ambition in fiction is merely the willingness to make mistakes. Mistakes are essential. It’s not ice-skating. You won’t break a bone.Sometimes a young writer decides to put off writing certain things, thinking they’re too “technically difficult”. This is a bad idea: if something excites you, don’t wait. You might forget what interested you so, and, moreover, there are some things you can only write when you’re young, and some things you can only write when you’re old. You can always try to write the same thing when you’re older; it will be a different book.Concentrate on processWhen you’re uncertain about the writing itself – the sentences or the content – write through it. If a page is impossible, try a sentence; if a sentence won’t come, take notes. Writing is a form of thought. Any superannuated writer will tell you – I’m one – that years after the end of any writing class or programme, it isn’t the most promising writers who are still working, still publishing books, it’s the most bullheaded. I’m one of those, too.Be strangerEmbrace your particular oddness. Don’t give up your obsessions. They are dear to you: they are what make your work original. Be open to new fixations in life as well as writing. When you are fascinated with a subject or place or image, that fascination will exist for the fiction you write about it.Perhaps this seems obvious: of course you should be interested in what you write about! You might be surprised at how many otherwise excellent writers choose material almost at random, a sort of frame on which to arrange their sentences and characters. These writers would rather be good than interesting; they worry about being caught in a passion. But what the writer isn’t interested in will never interest a reader. Your work may be beautifully formed, articulate, full of meaning, but if you’re not interested in it, it won’t have a soul.Write when you canPossibly the most ubiquitous advice is that you must write every day. Real writers write every day – that’s what the director of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop told us at our first-day picnic. Plenty of writers do. Make it a job. Sit at your desk and put your time in, first thing in the morning, four hours or five hundred words or five pages. Do the math: in a year you’ll have a draft of a book, even if you move slowly.It’s excellent advice for those for whom it is good advice, and, I imagine, satisfying to dispense. Nothing ambiguous about it. I would go so far as to say that everyone should try daily writing. You might find it changes your life.As advice, though, it’s not universally useful. Not everyone can write every day; not every writer wants to or works best on such a schedule. I became a writer so I wouldn’t have to do math or keep accounts. I can hear the voice of an every-day writer even now: If you wanted to – if you wereserious! No: by circumstance or temperament, some writers can’t or shouldn’t. Many people work on timetables run by the needs of others: small children, elderly parents. Other people’s illnesses; their own. Their own need to work a job to support themselves or others.There are circumstantial reasons not to write every day, but you don’t need one if writing every day makes you write badly. That’s reason enough.Worse: if you believe you must write every day and life intervenes and you stop, it can feel as though you’ve stopped for good. Too late to pick it up again. You might even feel ashamed. Writing becomes an unpaid bill. You can’t even open the envelope. You stick it in a drawer so you don’t have to look at it. Then the time away from writing stretches on.View image in fullscreenDon’t give upYou won’t injure yourself, writing after days or weeks of not writing; you won’t have atrophied. Indeed, you may be a cicada of a writer, back full force after going away. You might be an annual, or a shook-up bottle of soda pop, more forceful when you resume.If you’ve stopped writing for any reason, you can start again, from the exact place you left off or somewhere even better. The reasons you stopped have changed you as a writer. Made you more interesting. In your time away, you haven’t lost a step.You’ve probably gained some.IdeasThe first inklings of a piece can arrive in nearly any form: an image, a line of dialogue, a line of narrative, a setting (place or time period), an abstract idea (I havealways wanted to write about a scientist who is a devout believer in God), a title, a plot, a structure, a character. A character might arrive in any way: as a predicament, or a moustache; as a role (for instance a mother or a priest); as a physical fact. Concrete or abstract, it doesn’t matter. Myself, I know the height and weight of my characters before I know their names or secrets.DraftsSome writers compose drafts quickly, carelessly. They don’t worry about beauty at first, or music. They know ahead of time that they will write many drafts, and the most important thing is to get the shape of the thing on the page. In order to begin, they tell themselves it’s all right to write badly. Otherwise they might never get out of the first paragraph. They don’t look back until it’s time to revise.Other writers must be painstaking from the start. Every morning, they reread what they’ve done so far and edit sentence by sentence. They cannot go forward until the thing feels right.I am, in my way, a painstaking drafter: I sit down, read the entire book from the beginning before I go on, print it out an environmentally irresponsible number of times and scribble all over it. Still, there’s nothing exacting in my process. Nothing tidy. I don’t produce nearly-there drafts, even when I tell myself that I am doing so. But I can’t bear to write what strike me as bad sentences. In the innermost chamber of my writer’s heart, the only thing I really care about is language, and I cannot think about fiction except in sentences. Sentences are how I lower myself into the dreamworld, how I know my characters (body and soul); sentences are my bucket and my torch.Some people wait to start a novel until they feel confident enough, but you have to be a little panicked to make it across the ocean in a rowing boat.PlanningProponents of outlining, like every-day writers, like to recommend the process to everyone. They are talking to themselves, announcing how their own brains work.There’s a wonderful moment while writing a book when, after swimming alone in the ocean of your dreamworld, you can sense it becoming actual, you can imagine how another person might navigate it by the landmarks you have installed, but you don’t want to arrive at that shore too soon. For some people, outlining is a form of thought: free from sentences and paragraphs, they can make meaningful decisions about their books. The outline prolongs the dream. Others of us dream in sentences only. We dream as we draft. Nothing is possible (I am talking to myself) without language. I figure things out. I write with the abandon of a tourist. What interests me at first might bore me later. That’s all right.No process is wrong that leads to a first draft of a book.PlottingIn fiction there are needful mysteries and needless mysteries. If the author and characters know a secret and only the reader is left in the dark, that’s a needless mystery. If you withhold a fact and think,When I reveal this, it’s going to blow the reader’s mind, nine times out of 10 it will only make them think you’ve been playing cards with an ace up your sleeve. Fiction can disorient readers, but if they don’t know where they are, if a piece of fiction continually shuts a reader out of what’s happening, who’s talking, what year it is, they will feel as though they’re on the other side of the door of an interesting party. Some personality types enjoy this feeling of exclusion. Not many.The Hero of This Book by Elizabeth McCracken review – all about my motherRead moreAltogether, it’s easy to overestimate the pleasure readers take in figuring out facts, who is speaking, their relationships to one another, where they are, what time period or geographical location we’re in, what level of reality. It’s not that everything must be instantly clear, only that if everything is obscure, readers are only looking down at their feet, wondering where they are, not up at the glories of your fictional universe.Needfulmysteries are about the mysteries of life. What can be done and not done, what can be seen and not seen. Needful mysteries tend to be mysteries for the characters as well.Actual people are always saying the strangest things. They wish to wound, persuade, shock, be heard, be understoodDialogueIf you’re writing dialogue between strangers that’s just zinging along it’s possible they are only saying what you expect them to say. Don’t let your dialogue become too generic in your wish to make it realistic; don’t make it solely informational, characters talking for the sake of the plot. Actual people are always saying the strangest things. They wish to wound, persuade, shock, be heard, be understood. Talking is not an involuntary process.Dialogue is the answer to any number of problems in fiction. A character you can’t get close to? Let ’em talk. Dialogue characterises, shows the odd way people put sentences together. A plot that’s stalled? Dialogue is action; it’s something characters do to each other.LanguageThe writing of metaphors should not be laboured, nor automatic. Many a leafless tree has been described as having branches like an old man’s hands, reaching for the sky, but do they really? Must all lawns in suburbia be manicured?I often suggest that writers cut explanatory conjunctions and adverbs in fiction: but, because, therefore, since. Such words point out meaning; losing them paradoxically imbues the language with meaning, because the reader supplies it.She didn’t want to go because she had a headache.She didn’t want to go. She had a headache.When a reader gets to supply the connection between the two thoughts, there’s a little jounce of pleasure. We feel closer to the character: we know something they don’t.MaterialMaterial should be personal in that you should be personally interested in it: puzzled, intrigued, troubled. You should want to get to the bottom of it. Material needn’t be something lived through, though it can be. Lucky, some writers think, hearing of another writer’s eventful or terrible childhood. A complicated childhood full of privation and catastrophe isn’t an inheritance that sets up a writer for life. It isn’t even the childhood itself that’s useful: it’s that the writer is interested in the childhood and doesn’t entirely understand it and works to get it on to the page, out of the body, so it can be looked at.Plenty of excellent writers have awful childhoods that they’re not interested in and never write about; some do only later in life, when youth can be viewed through the telescope of time. This is true of geography, too: it can be easier to write about home when you’ve left it far behind. Then you can hold it in your palm, like a snow globe, and look at it from multiple angles without being overwhelmed.You don’t need to write what you (already) know, because with research and hard work and pure will and a willingness to blunder and bomb as you write, you can make yourself know a great deal.Write about what you know.If you already know it – if there’s no mystery – what’s the point in writing it?This is an extract from A Long Game: How to Write Fiction (Jonathan Cape).

Michaela Coel’s comedy-drama, based on her own experience of sexual assault, follows Arabella (Coel) as she realises she was drugged and raped on a night out. With one in four women in Britain having experienced sexual violence, the 12-part series was a difficult watch for many. If not relatable, then confronting and familiar; something that had happened to others, but close enough to know that it could happen to you. Three months later, itdidhappen to me. I remember going back to a man’s flat on a second date, but then there’s a vast nothingness that I’ve been unable to make sense of since.The morning after, confused and embarrassed by my memory loss, I asked him what had happened. When he said we’d had sex, and I said I couldn’t remember it, he seemed offended, as though my amnesia were an accusation. After tea and toast, I left to meet my sister, who, when I told her I had blacked out after only three drinks, suggested I’d been drugged. I initially dismissed this – that’s what depraved strangers do to paralytic women on sticky club toilet floors. Not men you like in nice flats with comfy sofas. Not men who you would have had sex with anyway, consciously and consensually. Then I remembered the half-empty bottle of wine, leftover from a dinner party, offered to me but untouched by him.Twenty minutes later, I was on the phone to the police. An hour later, they were at my house. I was being swabbed, putting my nice underwear into evidence bags, never to be seen again. I tried to answer their questions in a way that didn’t seem like I was lying, even though I wasn’t. When they asked for his name and address, I wondered out loud what would happen to him. “We’ll arrest him,” they said. It all seemed so dramatic, so irreversible, so life-ruining, and how could I be sure? I could already hear my own uncertainty being used against me.If he had been a stranger, the investigation would have continued, but as I knew him and wouldn’t divulge his details, I was withholding information, so it ended there. Either a crime had been committed or it hadn’t, and if it had, then they needed a name. In the absence of that, my samples wouldn’t be tested, but they would freeze my urine and keep my swabs in case I changed my mind. I put the police officer’s card on my bedroom shelf and to the back of my mind, where it stayed for the next five years.I thought spiking was done by depraved strangers. Not by men you like in nice flatsThis year, after a conversation with a friend who had gone through something similar, I decided to rewatch I May Destroy You, perhaps hoping it would become a catalyst. I felt nervous. It had rattled me the first time, so what would it do now that I had experienced my own version of violation? Would it be catharsis or a wound reopened? For years, I had carried the guilt that, in having protected one man, I’d probably sacrificed other women to unknowable sinister black holes.It was during the fifth episode, when Arabella is praised for her bravery, that I pressed pause and went looking for the officer’s card. I called 101 and asked whether they still had a record of the case. I was given another phone number, and spoke to more people. No one seemed sure of how to progress after so many years, or whether my sample still sat in a freezer. I searched for his name in WhatsApp to find a profile photo of him holding a baby like a father would hold his child. I felt both more and less certain than ever about the decision I had made. Could this dad really have violated me in the way I feared he had? At the same time, I felt angry that he had gone on to have a normal, full life.In the variations of Arabella confronting, avenging or understanding her rapist in the final episode, we see different reckonings; ones she will never have, I will never have, most women will never have. But rewatching I May Destroy You and picking up the phone to at last ask these questions – I finally have something like closure.The case is now in limbo but I feel better for having pursued it. Although I continue to live with the uncertainty, just knowing that reopening the case would be more complicated than I thought, and unlikely to bring the resolution I had spent years secretly fantasising about, felt like a full stop, an end to the guilt and shame that should never have been mine.AnonymousIn the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.In the US,Rainnoffers support on 800-656-4673.

Wai lives and works in Myin Ka Par, a village in Myanmar, and became interested in mobile photography several years ago. In this instance, he used his phone to capture this gaggle of local children as they were returning home from school.“They were playing on a sandbank with their own plastic bottles,” Wai recalls. He’d been collating props for some time; bottles and hoops he had painted in a variety of colours, including neon pink. “The children were happy to let me replace theirs with my own colourful ones for the purpose of this photo.” He later applied some minor edits using the Lightroom app.‘I climbed a building to get this shot of Egyptian fishermen with sardines’: Ahmad Mansour’s best phone pictureRead moreWai says their village is “generally considered a relatively safe environment for children. It’s a close-knit community where families tend to know one another, and outdoor play is a regular part of daily life. Despite challenges, there is a strong sense of care among residents.”While he didn’t play on this beach himself, Wai recalls taking part in “similar improvised games” in his own childhood. “We used whatever materials were at hand to invent new ways to play. This image evokes memories of carefree afternoons spent outdoors, and the shared sense of imagination that defines childhood everywhere.”The three girls and five boys he photographed were thrilled to see the result, Wai says. “They were delighted, laughing, pointing, and excited to recognise themselves in such bright colours. That moment of connection was one of the most rewarding parts of the experience.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereGwilym MumfordSat 3 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 02.01 ESTShareWelcome to 2026! I hope you are enjoying the final dribblings of the festive break, before reality bites on Monday. As is now tradition (well, we did it once before), this first newsletter of the new year looks at some of the big questions we hope will be answered in the next 12 months, across film, TV, music and games. Hopefully it will double up as a decent primer for the year ahead too, though for a more exhaustive rundown check the Guardian’s 2026 previews forfilm,music,TV,gaming, stage andart. Right, let’s get on with it:Can the Odyssey save cinema? (no pressure or anything, Chris)A storyline likely to rumble on through the year is the proposed purchase of Warner Bros by Netflix, which will require government approval (certainly not a given), not to mention all manner of contractual fine-tuning, before that big red N gets stamped on Warners’ famous water tower. Just enough time then for Hollywood’s greatest wrangler of spectacle, and newly installed head of the Director’s Guild, Christopher Nolan to demonstrate the value to Netflix of putting mass-market movies on the biggest screens possible. His Oppenheimer followup is a giant adaptation of Homer’sOdyssey(17 July) featuring a preposterous cast: Matt Damon! Tom Holland! Lupita Nyong’o! Robert Pattinson! Anne Hathaway! Zendaya as the goddess Athena! Charlize Theron turning people into pigs as Circe! The only thing itismissing is a Barbenheimer style foil.Other impending biggies will also help underscore the magic of the cinema:Project Hail Mary(20 March) blasts Ryan Gosling into outer space on a mission to save Earth (the trailerlooks very promising);Disclosure Day(12 June) sees Steven Spielberg go back to the ‘alien life’ almost 50 years on from Close Encounters; Denis Villeneuve will tackle the wildest of Frank Herbert’s series of novels withDune: Part Three(18 December);Avengers: Doomsday(also 18 December – let’s see how that one plays out!) is the first mega marvel teamup since Endgame, and will see Chris Evans return to the role of Captain America, and Robert Downey Jr head to the dark side as Doctor Doom. Most intriguing of all is Alejandro Iñárritu’s first English language film since The Revenant,Digger(2 October). Little is known about the film beyond its intriguing one-line description – “The most powerful man in the world causes a disaster and embarks on a mission to prove that he is the savior of humanity” – and the fact that the powerful man in question is played by one T Cruise. Could be very special indeed.Who will do an Oasis and conquer summer?So in the end the Gallaghers didn’t have the tour-ending scrap on the first night that everyone predicted, and instead delivered the year’s most euphoric, not to mention lucrative, cultural event. But those expected 2026 Knebworth dates are now looking unlikely, so someone else will have to rule 2026’s summer season. Early contenders include:My Chemical Romance, playing a series of vast reunion gigs at Anfield and Wembley stadiums and Glasgow’s Bellahouston Park;Ariana Grande, embarking on a crackers 10-night residency at London’s O2;Lewis Capaldi, nowback into the swing of touringand headlining two Hyde Park gigs as well as the Isle of Wight festival;Tyler the Creator, taking over east London’s All Points East festival over two nights; andBad Bunny, heading over to the Tottenham Hotspur stadium in July.Are we about to get a genuinely good Game of Thrones spin-off?There arguably hasn’t been a decent season of a show set in Westeros since the penultimate Game of Thrones back in 2017, given how underwhelming the show’sactualfinal run in 2019 was, and the dour stodge of prequel seriesHouse of the Dragon. But on the horizon is a GoT spin-off that might actually buck that negative trend.A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms(19 January, Sky/Now) has a lot going for it: it is drawn from George RR Martin’s much-liked Dunk and Egg novellas; its first series runs to a tight six episodes; and it won’t be weighed down by endless scenes of CGI dragons – instead focusing on the lower-stakes adventures of a hedge knight and his squire. And if that spin-off does end up underwhelming, later this year there’s another chance for House of The Dragon to redeem itself with a third season that boasts the addition of James Norton.Will Grand Theft Auto VI live up to lofty expectations (if it even arrives)?The last time Rockstar released a Grand Theft Auto game, GTA V in September 2013, the coalition government were still in power in the UK and Apprentice host Donald Trump was mulling his first foray into politics with a run at governor of New York. Following up on one of the most celebrated and successful video games in history has proved quite the undertaking, and theGrand Theft Auto VI’s release date has already been bumped back several times. Currently pencilled in for a 19 November arrival, it will return to the franchise’s fictional Miami stand-in of Vice City, and will boast the series’ first female protagonist, though little is known beyond those details and the briefest of teaser trailers. Given the long wait, it will be fascinating to see if it can still capture the frenzied identity of an America that has changed a fair bit since the last game.Will Wuthering Heights be the most beloved film of 2026, or the most reviled?View image in fullscreenKinky classic … Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros. PicturesWho better to entrust the adaptation one of literature’s most celebrated works to than Miss Marmite herself, Emerald Fennell? Well, arguably many, many people, but there is a certain boldness from Warner Bros in handing the Saltburn director the reins to their Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi-starringWuthering Heights(13 February) – not least because she has immediately used them in anS&M bondage scene. Expect that and plenty of other moments that will make the Brontë purists blanche in a movie event that will dominate the discourse like no other. If nothing else, its soundtrack should be strong, featuring a suite of glowering gothic songs from Charli xcx, part of a big movie year for the hyperpop star: she’s also acting in a number of upcoming dramas, includingThe Moment, a mockumentary loosely based on her Brat tour.Is 2026 the year the sprawling series strikes back?In recent years TV shows have tended to arrive on our screens for a good time, rather than a long time. Streamers like Netflix have lost their appetite for sprawling multi-seasoned dramas, and instead the limited, one-and-done series, which can lure in big acting names who don’t want to commit to years-long assignments, now seems to be the default mode of delivery. The fact that many of the shows that do run longer than a single season tend to have large gaps between outings, only adds to a sense that there’s something missing. So all hailIndustry(BBC iPlayer 12 January), a genuinely ambitious, sprawling swaggering, multi-series show, which returns for a fourth season this month, just over a year since its third outing.Slow HorsesandThe Bearshould be back, like clockwork, at some point this year too, and – less than a year after the conclusion of The Handmaid’s Tale – there’s a return to Gilead with an adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s followup novelThe Testaments. And this will hopefully be the year we finally get to see much-hyped real-time medical dramaThe Pittin the UK: its first series should be included as part of the launch of HBO Max, right as its second outing is airing in the States.If you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterTelevisionTheatreGamesnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Here’s all the kit you needTom HuntSat 3 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Similar to vinegar, kombucha is made with a scoby (a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast), or mother, which looks like a blobby creature from the deep. Homemade kombucha is an enjoyable project and really cheap to make (it’s essentially just the cost of some sugar and a teabag), but it’s also a skill that takes a little refining. Over-ferment it, and you end up with vinegar or, worse, it could explode during the secondary fermentation, especially if you forget to “burp” the bottle to release the excess gas that gives kombucha a natural effervescence.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And, whilemaking your own kombuchais fun, the range on the market now is vast and of really high quality, with some even being created expressly as non-alcoholic alternatives to cocktails and wine. Kombucha is naturally lower in sugar than most sweetened drinks – the fermentation process consumes sugar, but the amount left will depend on how long it’s fermented for. Some are completely sugar-free, but many of those are sweetened with steviol glycosides and erythritol, which makes them ultra-processed foods, and I think they taint the flavour, even though they’re derived from natural sources. Most of the products I tested had 2-3g sugar per 100ml, which is much lower than cola, say, which has about 10.6g, or the equivalent of about seven teaspoons per can! I tasted all these kombuchas chilled and straight from the vessel (and with water breaks in between).The best supermarket kombuchaBest overall:Holos ginger & hibiscus organic kombuchaView image in fullscreen£3.20 for 330ml at Waitrose (97p/100ml)★★★★★A very fizzy organic kombucha with a delicate touch of sourness that tastes more like a homemade one.

I love Seville oranges, grapefruit, brassicas, bitter greens, chicory and, most of all, radicchio. I like the burgundy-spotted castelfranco (great for salad with citrus and cheese) and the long-locked tardivo (best cooked with balsamic vinegar), but radicchio di chioggia is the popular leader of the pack. A chubby little cabbage-y nugget with a middle-of-the-road bitterness that becomes milder, sweeter and more delicious, especially when cooked alongside a large glass of juicy chianti and finished off with a snowy dusting of parmesan.Radicchio and chianti risottoOnly a couple of the major UK supermarket chains sell radicchio di chioggia, and you’re most likely to find it at a farmers’ market or online via retailers such asAbel & ColeandNatoora. Other red wines may be used in this recipe.Prep15 minCook40 minServes4For the risotto60g unsalted butter1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 radicchio di chioggia(about 400g), finely chopped350garboriorice250ml chiantiFine sea salt1 litre hot vegetable stock5 grinds of pepper70g vegetarian parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serveFor the radicchio and walnut pesto5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve16 sage leaves(5g), finely shredded25g walnuts, finely chopped½ lemon, zest finely grated, then juiced to get 1 tbspOn a medium heat, melt 40g of the butter in a heavy-bottomed pot for which you have a lid. When it starts to froth, add the onion and sweat, stirring, for six or seven minutes, until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic, cook for two minutes more, then add two-thirds of the radicchio and cook for about four minutes, until wilted.Add the rice, stir to coat the grains, then cook, stirring, until they turn semi-translucent. Pour in the chianti, stir to combine, then leave the rice fully to absorb the wine. Add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a couple of ladles of hot stock, then stir until the liquid is absorbed. Keep adding the stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until each ladle is absorbed before adding the next, for about 20 minutes, until the rice is al dente. Stir in the pepper and 50g grated parmesan, then dot the top of the rice with the remaining 20g butter. Turn off the heat, put the lid on the pot and leave the risotto to rest while you make the pesto.In a bowl, mix the extra-virgin olive oil, sage and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, then stir in the walnuts, the remaining finely chopped radicchio, the lemon zest and juice, and the remaining 20g parmesan. Mix really well, check the seasoning and adjust as required.Spoon the risotto on to a plates or shallow bowls and top with some radicchio pesto and a final showering of grated parmesan for good measure. Drizzle over some extra-virgin olive oil and serve with the remaining pesto alongside.Explore more on these topicsRiceMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodWineWinter food and drinkItalian food and drinkCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

Many people who vape say they want to stop, or at least cut down, and are discovering that it is harder than they expected. Some are even considering returning to smoking cigarettes, which for all their dangers, were harder to puff mindlessly at a desk or to conceal from those around them.‘Success is shutting them down’: Met police in fight against illegal vape and phone shopsRead moreConfusion about risk may be compounding the problem. Some public health experts worry that the risks of vaping may have been overstated – and that this could be inadvertently encouraging a new generation of smokers. Data released in September by the charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) found that63% of young peoplenow believe vaping is as harmful as, or more harmful than, smoking, despite decades of evidence showing cigarettes remain far more dangerous.So, if you want to quit vaping – or simply do it less – what does the evidence say about what actually works?At first glance, vaping and smoking can feel similar: both deliver nicotine, both involve inhalation, and both can become deeply habitual. But public health experts are unequivocal that they sit in very different risk categories.“We can be absolutely confident that vaping is far less harmful than smoking,” said Martin Dockrell, the recently retired tobacco evidence lead at the UK’s Office forHealthImprovement and Disparities. “They really aren’t comparable, and people who say they are either misinformed, or perhaps kind of wilfully trying to give a false impression.”chartThe reason lies in combustion.Smokingkills because of the constituents of smoke, including tar, carbon monoxide and hundreds of toxic combustion products. Vaping avoids combustion, and while it involves inhaling a different suite of chemicals, these are fewer in number, and based on current evidence, safer.A number of high profile health scares have also muddied the waters. A hypothetical risk of “popcorn lung” has never been demonstrated in vapers, and investigations into the US outbreak of vaping-associated lung injury linked most cases to illicit cannabis vapes rather than legal nicotine e-cigarettes.Yet less harmful does not mean harmless.Vapingstill exposes the lungs to heated chemicals, and long-term effects – particularly over decades – are not yet fully known.Vaping also introduces a behavioural challenge that largely disappeared with the ban on smoking indoors: ease of use. “Anecdotally, I hear a lot of people say that quitting vaping is harder for them, or they’re assuming it’s harder, but the evidence hasn’t really shown that yet,” said Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, assistant professor of health policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and co-author of a recentCochrane Reviewon interventions to help people quit vaping.From a psychological perspective, vaping and smoking are “both ultimately something that people have learned to do over time to avoid an uncomfortable internal state,” said Dr Jaimee Heffner at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle – whether that’s a physical urge or restlessness, a thought such as ‘I can’t get through this without vaping’, or an emotion like anxiety, sadness or anger.They also involve nicotine, which is highly addictive. Dependence has a physical component, driven by changes in the brain that cause cravings and withdrawal symptoms when nicotine levels fall, and a behavioural component, in which vaping becomes tied to routines, places and emotions. Because these processes reinforce one other, approaches that address both – easing withdrawal through nicotine replacement (eg patches or gum) while helping people break learned habits – are expected to work best.In their recent review, Hartmann-Boyce and colleagues found early evidence that text-message-based support may help some people – particularly teenagers and young adults – to quit, compared with little or no support. There was also tentative evidence that varenicline, a medication used to help people stop smoking, could increase quit rates among adults who vape.Another approach being tested focuses less on suppressing cravings and more on learning to live with them. Heffner has been trialling acceptance and commitment therapy, which teaches people to allow uncomfortable thoughts and nicotine cravings to be present without acting on them. In apilot study, participants using the approach made more quit attempts than those in a control group. A larger trial is now being planned.While research into how best to quit vaping is still relatively young, experts are also clear on whatnotto do.“Smoking is ridiculously deadly; one in two people who regularly smoke will die from it,” said Hartmann-Boyce. “So, you should only try and quit vaping if you are confident that you can do it without smoking cigarettes.”View image in fullscreenVaping still exposes the lungs to heated chemicals, and long-term effects – particularly over decades – are not yet fully known.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFor young people, the picture is different. Unlike adults, most are not vaping to quit cigarettes; it is their first exposure to nicotine, so the argument that vaping reduces harm does not apply. Their lungs and brains are also still developing. “There is growing consensus that vaping in young people is a bad idea – children should only be breathing air,” said Dr Rachel Isba, a paediatrician who piloted the UK’s first NHS vaping cessation clinic for teenagers at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool earlier this year. “There is also increasing evidence to suggest that some children and young people are progressing to smoking from vaping.”Social factors can loom larger during adolescence, with peer pressure, sharing devices and using vapes to cope with anxiety all playing a role. “You can’t just tell young people not to do it,” Isba said. “You have to understand why they’re vaping in the first place.”Rather than insisting on abstinence from the outset, her clinic supported young people to explore their own reasons for cutting down or quitting. While the pilot has now ended, the trust hopes to use what it has learned to deliver further services across Cheshire and Merseyside, pending funding.What is the impact of vaping on teeth and oral health?Read moreFor those trying to change their relationship with vaping in 2026, the message from experts is similarly pragmatic: quitting nicotine is rarely straightforward, setbacks are to be expected, and reducing harm should not be mistaken for failure – above all, smoking should be avoided at all costs.“Most people don’t quit nicotine on the first attempt,” said Hartmann-Boyce. “That’s normal.”How to quit vaping: expert tipsNotice your triggersPay attention to the situations that make you more – or less – likely to vape, whether that’s stress, certain friends or environments. Try to do more of the things that make vaping less likely, such as exercise. “If you use your vape to fidget, think about getting something else to fidget with,” said Dr Rachel Isba. “If you are a vaping doom scroller who has a vape in one hand and their phone in the other, try putting the vape in another room when you are on your phone.”Cut down graduallyWhile stopping abruptly works best for smoking, experts say vaping is different. “With vaping, we find that a gradual reduction, pausing when there’s any risk of going back to smoking, is the more successful way,” said Louise Ross, former manager of the Leicester Stop Smoking Service and co-author of aleaflet on how to quit vapingpublished by the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training.Set limits to break ‘autopilot’ useVaping slips easily into daily routines. Setting rules – such as not vaping at your desk, or only vaping outdoors or in the evening – can help weaken these habits.Consider lower nicotine productsLowering the nicotine strength of your vape may ease withdrawal, but watch out for compensatory behaviours, like inhaling more deeply or vaping more often. You could also try a nicotine-free vape alongside patches, gum or lozenges: cravings are managed, while the vape itself becomes less rewarding.Change the flavourSwitching to a less appealing flavour can make vaping less satisfying. Or try replacing the taste with sugar-free gum.Learn to ride out cravingsRather than fighting urges, approaches such as mindfulness encourage people to notice cravings without acting on them, until they pass.Get professional support“If you aren’t sure whether nicotine replacement might help, have a think about how long it is after you first wake up before you reach for your vape,” said Isba. Reaching for it very quickly may signal stronger dependence. “People who try to quit nicotine with professional support and medications have two to three times greater odds of being successful,” said Prof Jaimee Heffner.Don’t do it aloneFriends can help too. “Consider quitting with an ‘accountability buddy’ so you can support each other,” Isba suggested.Explore more on these topicsVapingSmokingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We clamber up from Flodigarry to circle under the black cliffs of the Quiraing where clouds flood around the bizarre rock formations. At the pass, we meet a howling wind and force our way down with shrieks of laughter.I’m walking on the Isle of Skye, specifically a section of the Trotternish Ridge forCoppaFeel!, the young people’s breast cancer awareness charity. There are 120 participants in total, split into four groups of 30. Over five days, we will trek about 100km on the island’s rugged trails, traversing sea cliffs, climbing mountains, passing ruined castles, crossing bogs and jumping over rivers to raise money for the charity.View image in fullscreenI’ve never been out in the hills with so many other women before. Some 117 of the participants are female, with a further six female celebrities spurring us on. We’re a raucous bunch.After a scenic lunch overlooking Raasay and the distant Scottish mainland, we tackle the second half of the day’s trek – then bad weather rolls in. As we climb, rain starts falling, thick as smoke. The ground is sodden. Cold water drips from my hood, running down my nose, cheeks and chin. It’s grim. My waterproofs need reproofing and I’m soon drenched right through, like everyone else.I don’t need to check where everyone is. I can hear them singing. They’re belting out Bohemian RhapsodyOf the 30 women in my group, most are new to mountain walking. For some, it’s their first time in Scotland. But somehow in these difficult miles across the wind and rain-battered mountain, morale stays high. I don’t need to turn and check where everyone is. I can hear them singing. They’re belting out Bohemian Rhapsody. When we pause, they dance.View image in fullscreenSinging helps to keep morale high while traversing a bog.Back on the campsite in the village of Uig, our base for the week, we shower, change and eat hot lasagne fromReally Delicious, the Glasgow caterer looking after us all week. The event is organised by CoppaFeel! in partnership withCharity Challenge, which specialises in adventure challenges, providing the transport, routes and accommodation, as well as the expert mountain leaders who guide the inexperienced walkers across the island.Today was a baptism of fire for novice walkers. I expect low spirits, but when the celebrity leaders walk in, the tent eruptsMass participation charity events such as this are growing, and since Covid, Charity Challenge reports a huge increase in demand. From national Three Peaks Challenges to Hadrian’s Wall and overnight ascents of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), group trekking in the UK has exploded. The events bring a range of benefits. Businesses find them a good way to bring teams together in person, boosting employee morale and mental health. In a tough funding climate, charities gain much-needed income and visibility. CoppaFeel!’s record is exemplary: in 2017, the charity raised £200,000 from trekking; in 2025, it was aiming to reach £2m.After dinner, we gather in the marquee for the daily debrief – 150 people crowd in, taking shelter from the wind. The ground squelches beneath our feet. Today was tough, a baptism of fire for novice walkers. I expect sullen stares and low spirits, but when the celebrity leaders and CoppaFeel! staff walk in, the tent erupts.View image in fullscreenThe walkers and a guide cross a stream on the Quiraing with views to Trotternish Ridge.“What a day!” says author and podcasterGiovanna Fletcher, one of CoppaFeel!’s celebrity patrons. The tent falls quiet, as everyone strains to catch her words. We’re two days in, and an intense cohesion is forming. It feels like family. Standing in front of the crowd wearing a giant boob costume, Giovanna reflects on the day.Tonight, even after the brutal storm, most people are laughing and cheering. She reminds us all to dig deep and remember our personal motivations – our “why” – to get through the week. Giovanna’s isKris Hallenga, the inspirational woman who founded CoppaFeel! in 2009 after she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer when she was 23. “Kris is why I’m here,” she says. Kris died in 2024.Over five days, we complete five different routes around Trotternish, the northernmost peninsula on Skye. It’s stunning. With each hike, we gain different views of the hills of Harris and North Uist, watching the light change on the sea between the mainland and the Outer Hebrides. The days are long and demanding but everyone shows good stamina and determination. By day three, a committed group have drunk the local bar dry.On our fourth day, we hike from Sligachan to the Fairy Pools and back again. Circling underneath the Black Cuillin (Skye’s highest and rockiest range), the women are awestruck. “It feels like we’re on another planet!” one woman says.Strangers form close bonds and my team becomes deeply supportive. In this safe space, people open upFor many, these treks provide a guided entry to adventure. The leaders support everyone on the mountain, covering route-finding and first aid, while CoppaFeel! helps with kit lists, a training plan, regular webinars and online meetups. I watch women who trained in London’s Richmond Park become adventurers, newly comfortable with trekking poles, gaiters and “nature pees”. They all say they will go out and do this again.Stopping for lunch at the Fairy Pools, a series of natural pools and waterfalls not far from the Black Cuillin, the women pose for photos and make videos. They dip their faces in the clear water and share their experiences on social media to raise awareness and fundraise. Every participant has a target of £2,500.View image in fullscreenHikers on the way to the Fairy Pools from Sligachan under ominous skies.By this point in the week, we’ve relaxed into each other’s company. Five days is a long time to spend with strangers, but as the week goes on, I come to see that the length of this challenge is part of its power.“At the start,” Giovanna says, “a week will feel like for ever. But make the most of it. Trust me, by the end, you won’t want to finish.”Strangers form close bonds and my team becomes deeply supportive. In this safe space, people open up.Many of the participants have personal experience of breast cancer. For some, it was five, 10 or 20 years ago – while others are now in treatment. Many have also experienced grief. In this context, the challenge is not merely physical: deep, raw emotions are close to the surface.Walking and talking beside the river underneath the Cuillin, one woman tells me about her life. From chronic illness to having children, her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, everything flows out in an easy conversational way. Then she falls behind, starts chatting with someone else and that’s how it goes. An hour later, we catch up and she says she cried after sharing those things with me – she realised she had never said them aloud before.View image in fullscreenParticipants ford a river in tutus.She’s not alone. People change over this week. There’s a mother in my group who has two young children. She has recently finished her breast cancer treatment and is emotionally wobbly. But by the end of the week she is beaming, looking stronger and happier, as if a weight has been lifted. The trek creates a profound space of mass empathy. Stigma is removed and the experience of breast cancer is normalised.Looking around, I see new friends for life have been madeThe final day dawns like a festival. Glitter goes on like war paint. There are flower garlands, frilly tutus and giant pink knickers. About 150 of us toil uphill through bog to reach the summit of Beinn Edra. The sun comes out and on the breast of this hill, those who choose to, bare it all.Back at camp, we cross the finish line, singing, hugging and crying. Looking around, I see new friends for life have been made. Then the CoppaFeel! girls read out the fundraising total. The reach is astonishing. This week, 120 women walking the rough trails of Skye have raised over £500,000. They are a force to be reckoned with.CoppaFeel! is runningfour treks in 2026, includingtwo day-long treks in the UK; apply to do a trek or register interest atcoppafeel.org/trekExplore more on these topicsIsle of Skye holidaysScotland holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingCancerBreast cancerCharitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A mistake, of course …Tim DowlingSat 3 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 16.32 ESTShareIam staring at my computer, mouth ajar, when my phone rings. The call is from an unknown mobile number, which I would not normally answer, but I’ve just emailed someone requesting an interview, with my own phone number appended to the bottom, and I’m hoping this might be them. I’m also hoping it might not be them.“Hello?” I say.“Hello, is that Tim, yeah?” a male voice says. I leave a long pause.“Yeah,” I say. This is definitely not the person I emailed. In the background I hear the sound of a busy open-plan office – a call centre perhaps.“Good morning, Tim,” he says. “I’ve just got some urgent questions to ask you about your account.”“What account?” I say.“The account you set up with us,” the voice says.“With who?” I say.“Maybe you don’t remember setting up the account?” he says.“What account?”“Maybe you … ” He stops speaking for a moment. I’m pretty certain I hear him giggle.“You may have dealt with my colleague Tony,” he says, now openly laughing. “I think …”“I don’t know who you are,” I say. “Or what you’re talking about.”“If you could just … ” But he is suddenly too hysterical to say anything more. There is only the occasional snort – the sound of a man trying and failing to regain control of himself. I hang up.As bewildered as I am, it still hurts to be randomly rung up and laughed at. I leave my office shed, cross the garden, step into the kitchen and tell the oldest one what happened. Soon he too is laughing.“What was he trying to do?” he says.“I don’t know,” I say. “Maybe he was on his first day of being a phone scammer, and forgot to read the part of the script where he pretends to be from my bank.”“Do you think?” the oldest one says.“And then he just couldn’t recover,” I say. “Or maybe he was just laughing at me.”“Maybe,” the oldest one says.My stock response when I think I’m being manipulated – to feign incomprehension – is now genuine: I have no idea what’s going on“Either way, it’s the lack of professionalism I find galling,” I say. “Even the people trying to con me out of my savings can’t be bothered to take it seriously.”To be honest I find it increasingly hard to distinguish between fraud and incompetence. Every example of either feels like a deliberate attempt to confuse me. My stock response when I think I’m being manipulated – to feign incomprehension – is now genuine: I have no idea what’s going on.This time last year, while waiting at home for a package, I received a text announcing that my parcel had been successfully delivered within the scheduled window. But my doorbell had not rung and the text included a photograph of a man in a pink jumper with a snowflake on the front, standing on his doorstep holding my parcel. According to the text, the man was called Dave.I knew no Dave, nor did I recognise his yellow front door. I suspected an elaborate scam, at least until my package arrived later that day. After that I began to suspect I’d simply been texted the picture of Dave in error, at a highly coincidental moment. In truth, I never for a moment understood what was going on.Many years ago I invented a charmless PA called Ron, who answered my phone, was monosyllabic with cold callers, and claimed not to have any idea when I would be available.“Yeah, fine,” Ron would answer when asked to pass on a message, in a tone that made it clear he wouldn’t. Ron was, in many ways, my truest self. Ron knew what was going on.I’ve been lost in thought in the kitchen for some minutes when the oldest one clears his throat in a manner that says: I’m working.“When’s lunch?” I say.“I have a Zoom meeting at one, so after that,” he says. I think: so like Ron.I go back to my shed. A few minutes later my phone rings – another unknown number. For old times’ sake, I adopt Ron’s unfortunate manner.“Hello,” I say.“Is that Tim?” a voice says. I’m about to say I’m not here, when I realise this is the person I’ve emailed requesting an interview.“Yes it is,” I say brightly, picking up a pen and a notepad with questions on it. “Thank you so much for doing this!”Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here is what we know so far:Donald Trump said“We’re going to run the country[Venezuela] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday eveningand they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.TheUS is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation, Trumpsaid.He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”View image in fullscreenA photograph of Maduro posted by Trump on Truth Social.Photograph: @realDonaldTrump/ReutersTrump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.TheUN security councilisdue to holdan emergency meeting on Monday.Trump said his administrationhad not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leaderMaría Corina Machado. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”Trump was asked about Cubaduring the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”TheUS Department of Justice released a new indictmentagainst Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”.Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vancewrote: “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Madurowas “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.TheUN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.View image in fullscreenA burnt-out vehicle at La Carlota airbase in Caracas.Photograph: Juan Barreto/AFP/GettyVenezuela’s government urged citizens to rise up against the US assaultand said Washington risked plunging Latin America into chaos with “an extremely serious” act of “military aggression”. “The entire country must mobilise to defeat this imperialist aggression,” it added. It accused the US of launching a series of attacks against civilian and military targets, largely focused on the capital, Caracas, before dawn on Saturday.Explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard in Caracas in the early hours of Saturday.In its statement, Venezuela’s government confirmed that the city had come under attack, as well as three other states:Miranda,La GuairaandAragua.The New York Times reported thatat least 40 people, including civilians and soldiers, were killed in Saturday’s attack. The estimate came from a senior Venezuelan official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Map showing location of US strikes on VenezuelaThe Britishprime minister, Keir Starmer,saidthe UK was“not involved in any way in this operation”,adding that “we should all uphold international law”. France said the US operation went against the principles of international law.Russia has demanded “immediate” clarification about the circumstances ofMaduro’s capture.Earlier, Venezuela’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, said the US needed to provide “proof of life” for Maduro and his wife.Venezuela’s allies Russia, Cuba and Iran were quick to condemn the strikes as a violation of sovereignty.Tehran urged the UN security council to stop the “unlawful aggression”. Among leading Latin American nations, Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, lauded Venezuela’s new “freedom” while Mexico condemned the intervention and Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said it crossed “an unacceptable line”.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroTrump administrationAmericasUS foreign policyColombianewsShareReuse this content"

But that is not even the most concerning thing about it.Venezuela attack: what we know so far as Trump claims Maduro capturedRead moreDonald Trump has been driving convoys of bulldozers through that increasingly fragile edifice since taking office nearly a year ago, and now it is mostly wreckage. The events overnight were preceded by airstrikes on small boats in the seas off Central America and the killing of their crews based on unproven allegations of drug trafficking, and the armed seizure of Venezuelan oil tankers on the high seas. It is not yet known how many people were killed in the capture of Maduro in the early hours of Saturday.In terms of global stability, the worst thing about the Maduro rendition is that it worked.Trump’s belief in his own global omnipotence, and his desire to grab the territory and natural resources of other countries has been held in check until now by his fear of entanglement in foreign wars. He claimed (falsely) to have ended eight wars, and his greatest ambition in 2025 seemed to be winning the Nobel peace prize. Less than a month ago he was brandishing a hastily confected substitute, the Fifa peace prize. That act of self-abasement by world football’s governing body looks even more absurd now than it did whenTrump grabbed the gold medal and put it around his own neck.Trump’s apprehension over foreign wars seems to be waning. He was clearly thrilled by the drama of the Maduro operation, and the efficiency of the American soldiers who carried it out, declaring on Saturday he was “not afraid” of deploying ground forces inVenezuelato pursue his interests. For an ageing president, growing more petulant, irascible and incoherent with every day in office – facing diminishing popularity and desperate to distract attention from the Epstein child-trafficking scandal – a tightening embrace of military power is an ominous development.View image in fullscreenMaduro is a dictator who has run an authoritarian state since 2013 with the help of elections widely regarded as rigged.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersOn Saturday morning, Trump seemed giddy with military success. “A lot of good planning and a lot of great, great troops and great people,” Trump told the New York Times. “It was a brilliant operation, actually.”The attack on Venezuela suggests the allure of foreign lands, oil and minerals is now glimmering brighter than the Nobel prize.It was mostly left to others in theTrump administrationto cast the attack in legal language and suggest that Maduro was being “brought to justice”. The Venezuelan leader was indicted in the US at the end of the first Trump term on corruption, drug trafficking and other offences.Maduro is a dictator who has run an authoritarian state since 2013 with the help of elections widely regarded as rigged. But thespecific drug allegations made against him by the USare seen by most experts as flimsy, and would not represent convincing grounds under international or US law for the attack on Venezuela and Maduro’s abduction. In repeated statements, Trump has made clearhe is more covetous of Venezuela’s oilthan motivated by a desire to bring Maduro before a court, or deliver democracy to the people of Venezuela.Hours after ousting Maduro, Trump said US were ready to move in to fix Venezuela’s decrepit, sanctions-ravaged oil industry. “We’ll be selling large amounts of oil,” he said.The international laws and norms Trump has barged through had already been loosened by previous US administrations. The operation most closely resemblesthe 1990 invasion of Panamaand forced surrender of its strongman, by the first Bush administration.Today an illegal coup in Venezuela, but where next? Donald Trump talks peace but he is a man of war | Simon TisdallRead moreThat was followed by the younger George Bush with the invasion of Iraq on false grounds, and his administration’s broad use of rendition of torture. Barack Obama failed to hold his predecessor’s administration to account and pursued his own legally questionable drone assassination campaign against suspected terrorists.These are arguably discrete acts of hypocrisy by earlier presidents, who claimed exceptions from international laws in the pursuit of US interests, but mostly embraced global norms in the knowledge that the “rules-based system” overwhelmingly favoured America.Trump has complete disdain for that system. He looks at the world through the eyes of a 19th-century imperialist, but with 21st-century weapons.2:18Venezuela in state of emergency after US strikes and capture of Maduro – video reportIt is unclear how far Trump intends to go in Venezuela to advance his aims, but he made clear on Saturday that the “American armada” would remain poised in the region “until United States demands have been fully met and fully satisfied” – demands that are likely to include a takeover of Venezuela’s oil industry.Trump said Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, was ready to cooperate with Washington and that he had other people in mind to put in place. It is unclear whether Maduro’s supporters have the capacity or will to resist a US takeover, or whether any rebel groups will take the opportunity to make a move. Atranquil outcome seems a remote prospect.What unfolded overnight in Venezuela will cause immediate anxiety to governments like Iran and Denmark, against which Trump has expressed enthusiasm for taking radical action.In recent days, Trump has said theUS would come to the defence of Iranian anti-government protesters, and his officials have kept up a drumbeat of threats to take control of Greenland by any necessary means. Last month, the Danish Defence Intelligence Servicelabelled the US as a security risk, a declaration that would have been unthinkable just a short time ago for a Nato ally.In his press conference on Saturday, Trump added Cuba to the list of countries in his sights, suggesting it was “very similar” to Venezuela “in the sense that we want to help the people in Cuba”. His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, added that Havana should feel “concerned” in the wake of the events in Venezuela.It accelerates the slide from a mostly rules-based world to one of competing spheres of influence, to be determined by armed might and the readiness to use it. One US commentator, David Rothkopf, called it the “Putinization of US foreign policy”.Russian commentators have frequently suggested that Latin America lies in America’s domain just as Ukraine was under the Russian shadow. Vladimir Putin thinks the same of much of eastern Europe. Xi Jinping will draw his own conclusions.The peril made brutally clear in the first few days of 2026 is one that will ultimately be faced by everyone.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpInternational lawAmericasTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS militaryanalysisShareReuse this content"

War and invasions are always a tragedy. That’s my reaction to the way he was removed.“But it’s also impossible not to feel relief when you know a system that has been built on fear, hunger, tortures, repression – it begins to collapse,” said the 69-year-old, who is the chair and founder of the charity Healing Venezuela.She is part of the small but growing Venezuelan community in the UK. The most recent census, which took place in 2021, put the number of Venezuelan-born residents in Britain at over 21,000. “We’re all very shaken and very moved. I hope this next chapter is going to be peaceful,” she said.De Santis came to the UK 22 years ago, shortly after her name was published on the Tascón List in 2004, the names of individuals who had signed a petition seeking to oust the then presidentHugo Chávez, by calling for a recall referendum. It was later used by the government to deny those who had signed it access to state jobs and welfare programs.View image in fullscreenCinzia de Santis: ‘No one who loves their country is happy to see foreign troops on its land. War and invasions are always a tragedy.’Photograph: Supplied“In a way, it was a forced exile. I wanted to stay,” she said. “My daughter had to go to school with an emergency kit filled with food, water, and pills in case it was attacked and she was exposed to teargas.”While De Santis is happy that Maduro,seen by many as a dictator, is gone, she is hardly a fan of Donald Trump. She called him “my least favourite person in the world”.“I think his charisma is quite debatable. I’m pretty sure his interest in Venezuela is a business interest,” she said.Nearly eight million Venezuelans have left the country under Maduro’s leadership – a quarter of the nation’s population. Venezuelans began fleeing their country en masse when its economy collapsed in 2014, generating rampant inflation, poverty and insecurity. It caused a migration crisis that is the largest in the history of Latin America and exceeds the number of people displaced from war-torn Syria.“Throughout the years, I’ve seen what has been happening. The crumbling of the health system, the increase in malnourishment cases in children, the dramatic increase in mortality rates of pregnant women,” said De Santis.For Alejandro Arenas-Pinto, the news has also been difficult to digest. He has been in touch with family who are still reeling from the situation. “I’m really worried about their wellbeing,” he says.2:27What we know about the US attack on Venezuela – video analysis“I think it’s very difficult to justify the methods but it’s very clear to me that the humanitarian crisis that Venezuelans have been living through makes people believe that perhaps this activity from a foreign government is justifiable.”The 55-year-old doctor said: “If you ask many people in Venezuela about the legality of this, that isn’t their main concern. The main concern is far more existential and far more basic.”While Arenas-Pinto understands why some in his home country may overlook the shocking and unprecedented way in which Maduro was ousted from power, he is worried about the future. “My main concern is in all these scenarios of political instability and military interventions, even when targeted, that there is a big possibility of trouble.View image in fullscreenA photograph which Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social account shows what he describes as ‘Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima’.Photograph: @realDonaldTrump/Reuters“We have seen what has happened in countries like Iraq or Libya or Syria – the humanitarian crisis is likely to get worse. Casualties and the deterioration of living may be called collateral damage by some but it can measured in lives,” he said.Maduro extended his 12-year rule despitewidespread suspicions that he stole the most recent presidential election, held in 2024. “They managed to go through the electoral path. They tried many ways. For many years, there have been a lot of people incarcerated for political reasons,” said Arenas-Pinto.“I don’t think this is the right way of sorting a political conflict. But this is worse than a political conflict for many people in Venezuela who have tried really hard to do it in other ways and have failed. They failed mostly because the repression from the government has been brutal.”View image in fullscreenDomingo Lapadula.Photograph: SuppliedDomingo Lapadula said he had concerns about the US breaking the understood “rules of engagement” but he expressed “some happiness that the status quo has broken”.“I think this is a very good situation. We should not talk about the US invading Venezuela and removing a president but removing a regime that has somehow kidnapped the country,” said the 58-year-old manager in the automotive industry.He said the reaction of the military, who “were not reacting against an intruder, but were happy to have this action happening” shows how little opposition there was to ousting Maduro. “What is clear is that you could see that there was no fight in Venezuela,” he said.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpAmericasNicolás MaduronewsShareReuse this content"

There were fears he wasas deep as 1km underground.Emergency responders found the dead worker on Saturday night, according to the state’s acting mines minister, Tony Perrett.“One worker was safely recovered yesterday, while specialist teams worked through the night to stabilise the site and access the second individual,” Perrett said in a statement.“Tragically, that worker could not be saved.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe Curragh coalmine is north of Blackwater, about 200km west of Rockhampton.The site covers about 256 square kilometres across two separate mines and has been in operation since 1983.Curragh has been owned by Coronado Global Resources since 2018.Coronado’s chief executive, Douglas Thompson, said the company was deeply saddened by the death and extended its deepest sympathies to the family and colleagues of the worker.He said it was providing support to contracted mine operator Mammoth Underground Mine Management, which was working with authorities to determine the cause of the collaspe.A Coronado spokesperson said earlier that all underground mining operations had been suspended.In a separate incident, about 300km north of Curragh, a gold prospector working at a private mine site died after being hit by falling rocks.The 58-year-old man had been working alone with an excavator at a Mount Britton property when a rock face partly collapsed on Friday afternoon.He died from injuries to his leg caused by a falling rock, police said on Saturday.Perrett said both incidents were “tragic reminders of the risks faced by those who work in our resources sector”.“Every worker deserves to return home safely, and I expect full and thorough investigations into both incidents to ensure answers are provided and lessons are learned.”Explore more on these topicsQueenslandMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

But the Albanese government has repeatedlyrebuffed callsto resurrect a version of the plans, arguing that policies to increase supply were the best way to tackle the housing crisis.Treasurymodelled changesto the concessions in 2024, but the government chose not to pursue them ahead of last year’s federal election.In its submission to the inquiry, the AMWU said the nation must “reframe” the housing debate.“The commodification of houses into a vehicle for accumulating and hoarding wealth has exacerbated inequality and allowed property developers, real estate agents and investors to profit from denying working people the dignity of home ownership,” the submission read.The AMWU recommended the capital gains discount on investment properties be immediately reduced and phased out entirely over a two-year period.The discount – which applies when a property is sold after at least 12 months of ownership – is expected to cost the federal budget$21.8bn in forgone revenue in 2025-26, according to Treasury figures published in December.The union wants to stop investors from using losses to lower their income tax bill, effectively ending the negative gearing of properties.The revenue recouped by winding up the concessions should be redirected to developing Australia’s modular housing industry, it argued.“The economic and social opportunity of home ownership is slipping out of reach for most workers. In fact, without substantial and real changes to our mindset and to policy, a whole generation is going to miss out,” the submission read.The AMWU’s position goes further than theAustralian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)proposal to last year’s productivity roundtable, which called for negative gearing and the capital gains tax breaks to be restricted to a single investment property and grandfathered for five years.The Greens also went to thefederal electionwith a policy of limiting negative gearing and the 50% capital gains tax discount to one investment property, which would also be grandfathered in.The pressure from inside the Labor movement to overhaul the tax breaks is expected to continue as the party prepares to thrash out its platform at its three-yearly national conference in Adelaide in July.In its submission to the Senate inquiry, the Grattan Institute thinktank said the 50% discount was too generous and had “overcompensated” property investors for inflation over the past 25 years.It recommended a 25% concession – which Shorten proposed – should be phased-in over five years, raising roughly $6.5bn a year that could be used to shore up the federal budget, lower the tax burden on young Australians or boost commonwealth rent assistance.The Centre for Independent Studies, a conservative thinktank, said the 50% discount was “simple and well understood and there was no strong reason for changing it”.The Senate inquiry is due to report on 17 March.Explore more on these topicsHousingTaxAustralian trade unionsLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

This time she’s perched on a tiny folding stool between a couple of pot plants, focusing intently on a plant nursery. It appears to be shut.Wilding has been sketching this same street in inner Melbourne for seven years. Stretching for a couple of kilometres through Fitzroy, one of Melbourne’s oldest suburbs,Brunswick Streethas everything – cafes, pubs, homes, churches, markets, shops and a branch of the legendary A1 Lebanese bakery.View image in fullscreenHelen Wilding drawing in Brunswick Street. Fitzroy.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianWilding has almost filled her long strip of paper, capturing most of the block. It’s folded into sections like an accordion, its edges pulled by the wind. A fire truck barrels past with its siren blaring, followed by a couple of trams rumbling in both directions, blocking the view. It’s a regular occurrence for someone who sketches on location. “Sometimes you’re sitting there and a truck comes and sits in front of you and won’t move for two hours,” she says.Wilding describes herself as an introvert, but the project has become a locus for a little community. Scattered in the surrounding streets are other sketchers, recording little bits of Fitzroy. A few people stop to chat, including tourists who take a photo for social media.“I met the man who owned Polyester,” Wilding says, referring to the record shop a couple of doors down from the nursery. “I gave him a sketch.” Once, a person who lived in the building she was sketching came to look at her work, Wilding says, and told her the names they had given for all the pigeons on the roof. They made it into the sketch.View image in fullscreenHelen Wilding discusses her work with a passerby.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianWilding has lived in the area for a couple of decades, regularly taking a tram down Brunswick Street to her job as a librarian. That occupation helps explain some of her approach – there’s incredible attention to detail in her sketches. They include shop signs and people, quick strokes for antennas and individual bricks. Murals that are faded in real life are also faded in the sketches; the colours capture the changing leaves. The only thing Wilding won’t include is graffiti – street art is in, but she hates vandalism.That isn’t to say the sketches are perfect. “There’s heaps of things in these drawings that are wrong,” Wilding says, “but they get lost in the details.” She picks up a finished line drawing to point out where she made a mistake on the facade: “My friend Joe says there are no eyebrows on this one.” She had to add an extra piece of paper to another sketch after she misjudged how tall one of the buildings was.View image in fullscreenOne of Helen Wilding’s sketches.Illustration: Helen WildingAlf Green, 85, is sitting on a stool in a side street, sketching an old wooden doorway as the cars whip by. He started sketching about 10 years ago, when he lived in a small country town. “I went over to the next town, and there was an artist society. I asked if I could join, thinking I could learn a lot about colour and composition.”Soon, Green got “sucked in” to the hobby. “I did a search and found there was going to be a meeting of sketchers in one of the suburbs ofMelbourne,” he says, a group that was organised by Wilding. He now travels more than an hour every week to sketch with the others. At lunchtime, they meet up to “share a parma and a pot” and show each other what they have sketched.View image in fullscreenAlf Green drawing in a street in Fitzroy.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThe line drawings take Wilding four to six hours to complete, which can stretch out over multiple weeks. She then paints them at home in bright, vivid colours – not always true to life, but capturing the feeling of being there. She doesn’t always paint them right away, and there’s a collection of finished line sketches waiting for colour at home, dutifully filed by street number in a cupboard.Sketching used to be a travel activity for Wilding. “When you travel and you draw, you notice different things,” she says. “You are looking up.” When you take the same route every day, it starts to slide by – she mentions another famous Melbourne painting,Collins St, 5p.m. by John Brack.Sketching has become a way for Wilding to properly absorb what’s in her own back yard. “I still feel like I don’t know it that well. I still feel like I’m exploring.”View image in fullscreenThe old Fitzroy Nursery at 390-394 Brunswick Street before it became an apartment building.Illustration: Helen WildingHer drawings are also a record of how the street has changed. Sketches she did during the Covid lockdowns show closed shops and signs for cancelled events and Black Lives Matter protests. In one sketch, you can see her friend across the street – they couldn’t be any closer due to social distancing rules.Right behind where Wilding is sittingtoday used to be another plant nursery with colourful gates. When she heard it was going to be demolished, she made a special trip to paint them (pictured above). It’s now an apartment building.The street may change, but Wilding and her friends willbe back next week.“It doesn’t sound much, saying I’m going to draw an entire street. But it’s a long project,” Wilding says. “It could take me 10 more years.”You can follow Helen Wilding’s streetscape project on herwebsite.Explore more on these topicsArtSummer essentialsMelbourneVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities planned to look into whether the sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar.The process of identifying the dead and injured continued on Saturday as relatives waited, desperate for news.Officials said they would also look at other safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes. The region’s senior prosecutor has warned of possible prosecutions if any criminal liability is found.The Valais region’s top security official, Stéphane Ganzer, told SRF public radio on Saturday that “such a huge accident with a fire inSwitzerlandmeans that something didn’t work – maybe the material, maybe the organisation on the spot”. He added: “Something didn’t work and someone made a mistake, I am sure of that.”Nicolas Féraud, who heads the Crans-Montana municipality, told RTS radio he was convinced checks on the bar had not been lax, the broadcaster reported.Explore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Power should be restored to other homes by early Sunday.“We are dealing with a particularly serious power outage affecting tens of thousands of households and businesses, including care facilities, hospitals, numerous social institutions and companies,” said Franziska Giffey, Berlin’s senator for economic affairs.The local district heating system, which transports heat around a pipe network in the area, is affected as it is powered by electricity.Stromnetz Berlin warned that repair work would “take a very long time”, with media reports saying that cold weather was hindering efforts to lay new underground cables.Police deployed about 160 officers to the site of the incident in the Lichterfelde area and said they were “investigating on suspicion of arson”.They drove vans equipped with loudspeakers through the affected areas, urging residents to stay with friends or relatives elsewhere if possible, use mobile phones sparingly and ensure they had torches to hand.Local train stations were affected, with electronic information signs and ticket machines not working – although the trains were still running.Giffey said Saturday’s outage was worse than one in September, when tens of thousands were also left without power in Berlin after a fire hit electricity pylons. Police also suspected arson in that case, and an unnamed anarchist group claimed responsibility online for starting the blaze.Germany has been on high alert for sabotage activities directed at its infrastructure, including from foreign actors such as Russia.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Why peace still feels elusive for UkraineThe US may be making positive noises, but exhausted Ukrainians remain wary after nearly four years of warShaun WalkerSat 3 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShare“Iwould give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a message to the Ukrainian people released just before midnight on New Year’s Eve. “Unfortunately, I cannot say that yet.”Zelenskyy said a peace agreement was “90% ready”, but added something that subverted Donald Trump’s constant claims that a deal is just around the corner. “Those 10% contain, in fact, everything,” he said.It is almost a year since Trump took office and promised to end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours. That never seemed possible, but as 2025 came to a closea new flurry of US diplomacybegan, accompanied by more optimistic statements about peace.View image in fullscreenPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivering his new year address to the Ukrainian people.Photograph: Ukraine presidency/Planet Pix/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe talks were kicked off by the leaking of a peace plan drafted by Russia and the US. Washington told Zelenskyy that Ukraine would have to give up the Donbas region, while the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, gathered diplomats from Nato countries in Kyiv for what one person presentdescribed as“a nightmare meeting” to tell them Ukraine should sign up to the deal now or face a worse one in future.Zelenskyy, in concert with his European allies, managed to stave off the plan, which would have felt like a capitulation to most Ukrainians, and started work with the Americans on a new kind of plan. But even ifUkraineand the US are now “90% ready” with that plan, the new year begins with a sense that peace remains elusive. There is little to suggest Russia will jump on board, and however much Trump claims Putin wants peace, Russian officials have made clear they will only sign up to an agreement that deals with what they call the “root causes” of the war.There is a sense, however, as Ukrainians endure another winter of power cuts, air raids and separated families, that some kind of respite is needed soon. Ukrainians are feeling the exhaustion of close to four years of full-scale war.View image in fullscreenRecruits of the 65th Separate Mechanised Brigade training in the Zaporizhzhia region.Photograph: 65th Mechanised Brigade press service/EPA“When I’m at the front I feel OK, but when I come back home I have bad dreams, take antidepressants and so on,” said Serhiy, a Ukrainian soldier who has served on some of the most volatile parts of the frontline, and in December was on home leave in Kyiv. He said he was ready to keep fighting, rather than sign up to something that could prove disastrous for Ukraine in the long run, but conceded he may now be in a minority. “I think by this stage, probably the majority would be ready to go for a bad deal; anything to stop the fighting,” he said.For many Ukrainians, this new year has been the hardest psychologically since the war began. At the start of 2023 there was still some hope that Ukrainian military success would putRussiaon the back foot and lead to something approaching victory. By 2024 this looked much less likely, but some semblance of hope remained.When 2025 arrived, it was already clear that victory on the battlefield was not imminent, but the election of Trump for a second term boosted hopes in Kyiv that the wildcard politician could benefit Ukraine. An oft-heard prediction in Kyiv a year ago held that when Trump realised Putin was not serious about peace, he would pivot to backing Ukraine fully, disregarding the Biden administration’s red lines and fear of escalation.That did not happen, and as 2026 begins, it is hard for many in Ukraine to find anything that would give hope of a positive medium-term solution. For now, the best-case scenario appears to be that the Ukrainian military, and society, can continue holding out until the situation in Russia worsens enough that the Kremlin may be forced to accept negotiations on terms that would not require Ukrainian capitulation. The worst-case scenarios do not bear thinking about.On Friday, Zelenskyy appointed his longstanding military intelligence head, Kyrylo Budanov, to be his chief of staff, after the resignation several weeks ago of Andrii Yermak, his closest advisor, in a corruption scandal.Budanov, a mercurial and charismatic figure known for planning audacious operations against Russia, has good contacts with western intelligence agencies and also maintains contacts with Russia over prisoner exchanges. His appointment could signal a new approach to security and negotiations from Kyiv.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises above residential buildings after Russian drone and missile attacks in Kyiv.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe coming year may also prove a challenging one for Zelenskyy politically, as the five-year presidential term to which he was elected in spring 2019 nears the seven-year mark.Martial law in Ukraine prevents the holding of elections, and while there is widespread criticism of Zelenskyy’s leadership on a range of factors, the impossibility of a wartime election is one point on which there is a broad consensus across the Ukrainian political spectrum.“It would only cause harm,” Serhiy Rakhmanin, an MP from the opposition Holos party,toldthe Guardian. “He’s the commander-in-chief, and the country is in a position where we don’t have that luxury, whatever issues we might have with him. It would only help the enemy.”View image in fullscreenFirefighters working at the site of an air attack in the Odesa region.Photograph: Ukrainian emergency service/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump, however, has called for an election, parroting the Russian claim that the lack of elections makes Zelenskyy an illegitimate president. “They haven’t had an election in a long time. You know, they talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it’s not a democracy any more.”Zelenskyy reacted by saying he would ask parliament to arrange the necessary laws to allow for a presidential election in wartime, and asked western allies to explain how they would see the security arrangements for a vote in a country at war. “I don’t want anyone to be able to use the lack of elections as an argument against Ukraine, so I’m reacting to what our partners are saying,” he said.Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander of Ukraine’s army and current ambassador to London, is widely seen asthe most viable electoral challenger to Zelenskyy. Zaluzhnyi has turned down previous offers to join Zelenskyy’s electoral team and is biding his time, having been sold on the idea of a political run but aware of the damage a competitive election could cause to Ukraine’s fragile wartime society.“He’s not making any active preparations for a campaign, and his public position is that while the war continues he is not thinking about elections and not preparing for them,” said a source close to Zaluzhnyi. “Time will tell whether he goes into politics.”View image in fullscreenA man examining a drone that Russia said was used in an alleged attack on a residence of Vladimir Putin.Photograph: Russian defence ministry press service/APThe year ended withRussia claiming Ukraine had launched a massive drone attack on Putin’s residence, an act it said would be met with a tough response. Moscow provided no evidence to back up the claim, with Kyiv insisting the whole story was fabricated, and the CIA reaching the same conclusion, according to US media outlets. It was a reminder of how easy it would be, even if a ceasefire was agreed around elections or as part of a deal, for Russia to invent a thin pretext to relaunch its war.Rakhmanin said he thought there were “no objective reasons” for negotiations to be successful while Russia felt it was still advancing its goals on the battlefield, but that there was a small chance of a window for a deal at the end of winter.“We need three things to come together: more systematic military and financial support fromEurope, a stabilisation of the frontline so Russia’s advances stop, and serious economic problems to begin for Russia,” Rakhmanin said. “If these three factors come together, then things can work out, even with Trump’s position as it is. But if even one of them doesn’t work in our favour, then it’s going to be extremely difficult.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropeNatonewsShareReuse this content"

Typhoon FGR4 combat jets were used to bomb the target, supported by a Voyager refuelling tanker.US strikes on Nigeria and Syria are ‘consistent’ with policy to combat IS, Republican saysRead moreThe facility had probably been used to store weapons and explosives, and the surrounding area was devoid of civilians, the ministry said.The defence secretary,John Healey, said the UK was determined to “stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies” to “stamp out any resurgence” of IS.He thanked members of the armed forces involved in the operation “to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life”.Western aircraft have been conducting patrols to stop a resurgence of the Islamist militant group that ruled parts ofSyriauntil 2019.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateJohn HealeyRoyal Air ForceMinistry of DefenceMilitaryFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

Her mother did not let her join thethrongs of crowds chanting “woman, life, freedom”in Tehran and across the country – so she could only watch at home as they were beaten back by batons and bullets.Since then, the 19-year-old computer science student in Tehran has waited for the chance to join fellow Iranians in protest. On Sunday, the moment finally came.A sudden nosedive in the value of Iran’s currency was the final blow to a population growing tired of being patient under an ailing economy.Protests soon began in Tehran and spread, kicking off the country’s biggest protests in years – some of which have turned deadly. At least 10 people had been killed by violence surrounding the protests, with two new deaths occurring overnight.“Despite my mother’s fears, I joined in [on protests] on Wednesday. They execute, and arrest us anyway. So people now think, if they continue to kill us when we are not even on the streets in protest, why the fuck are we waiting for the right moment?” said Mehnaz, speaking under a pseudonym for fear of repercussions.View image in fullscreenProtesters attack a government building in Fasa, in southern Iran, on 31 December.Photograph: UGC/AFP/GettyThe demonstrations started with merchants closing their shops in protest against deteriorating economic conditions and have spread from Tehran to about 32 cities across the country. What began as a movement to express economic grievances has widened in scope, with protesters chanting against the Iranian government.Students and activists have begun chanting “death to the dictator”, referring to the 86-year-old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and “woman, life, freedom”, echoing the 2022 protests that paralysed Iran.As the protests have grown, so has the government’s concern. Iran’s president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian,initially announced he had instructed authorities to listen to the “legitimate demands” of protestersand said he was seeking dialogue with protest leaders.At the same time, Iranian human rights groups allege security forces have used deadly force against protesters. The New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said on Fridaythat eight protesters have been killed by state security forces and dozens more injured. At least 119 people have been arrested for their involvement in protests, according to the human rights activists news agency.Iran officials warn Trump of red line after his threat to ‘rescue’ protestersRead moreReza, a 20-year-old university student involved in the protests, described how plainclothes officers and the Basij [the volunteer paramilitary force] burst into his dorms on New Year’s Eve. They began interrogating students and beating them as they asked about who was leading the protests. Since then, many classes have been moved online to prevent gatherings on campuses where security forces have beefed up their presence.“Joining these protests is a matter of ruining our future, but we have realised there is no future for us under this regime, so why cower and hide now?” said Reza, who asked to use a pseudonym.The protests come at a precarious time for the Iranian government, which was rocked by a 12-day war with Israel in June. More than 1,000 people were killed when Israel bombed Iran for nearly two weeks with almost complete impunity.View image in fullscreenWomen shop for fruit and vegetables in northern Tehran. The cost of living has soared, with the cost of food increasing on average by 50% since this time last year.Photograph: Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto/ShutterstockIt was a blow to the image of an impregnable Iranian regime, which for years had said Israel would not dare strike Iran on its home soil. Iranians watched Israelis shelter in missile bunkers, while they had to crowd inside metro stations and flee Tehran under the threat of bombs, wondering why their country was not better prepared for a war that seemed years in the making.As protests spread across the country, Donald Trump twice threatened a fresh attack on Iran. On Monday he told reporters he would “knock them down” if Iran was rebuilding its missile capabilities – a claim Iran denies. On Friday, he threatened US intervention if Iran killed protesters,warning that the US was “locked and loaded, and ready to go”.Trump’s threats have led Iranian officials to lean into the narrative that protests at home are foreign backed, with the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, Ali Larijani, accusing the US and Israel of having a hand in the demonstrations.The threats confronting the Iranian government have only fed some protesters’ convictions that the time is right to take to the streets.“We are fed up, and after June we know we must hit them when they are weakest, which is now. They say you must hit the iron when it’s hot, right?” said Mehnaz.Another 28-year-old protester said instead of foreign military attacks, he wanted the west to put diplomatic pressure on the Iranian authorities and provide technical support to protesters, such as ensuring the internet remained open in Iran.View image in fullscreenThe current protests are smaller and lack a rallying figure such as Mahsa Amini.Photograph: James Ross/EPAFuelling the protests is an ailing economy, which experts blame on a mixture of government mismanagement and international sanctions that have driven inflation as Iran cannot access frozen assets abroad and foreign exchange. The Iranian rial has lost more than 50% of its value in the last six months, hitting a historic low of 1.4 million rials to the dollar on Sunday.The cost of living has soared as people’s purchasing power has been eroded, with the cost of food increasing on average by half since this time last year. A new government tax, meant to take effect in the Iranian new year on 21 March, has further angered people.It is unclear if the protests could survive a violent crackdown such as the one in 2022. This time around, protests are smaller and lack a central figure such as Mahsa Amini to rally behind. Demands are more diffuse and grievances more economic in nature.Still, the protesters on the streets say they are determined to stay there until they see real change. They say they have learned from the protests three years ago and are eager to apply the lessons.“We learned that no matter what, the only way to get freedom is to continue protesting and doing so consistently and strategically, which I think lacked in the past,” said Moein, a 28-year-old protester in Lorestan speaking under a pseudonym. “We knew we wanted the end of the regime – and that’s been the common goal for all the protests.”Explore more on these topicsIranProtestMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fierce storms in recent weeks blew down or damaged thousands of tents, affecting at least 235,000 people,according to UN estimates.Prepared by thePalestineShelter Cluster, which coordinates the activities of nearly 700 non-government organisations in Palestine and is chaired by the Norwegian Refugee Council, the assessment found that newly delivered tents housing hundreds of thousands of people would “likely need to be replaced”.View image in fullscreenTents in Nuseirat, central Gaza, where parts of the camp has experienced flooding.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP“The fabric [of theEgyptian tents] tears easily as sewing quality is poor,” it reported. “The fabric is not waterproof. Other issues include small windows, weak structure, no flooring, the roof collects water due to the design of the tent, and no mesh for openings.”Tents from Saudi Arabia were criticised as having “non-waterproof light fabric, weak structure” and tents donated byChinawere “very light” and not waterproof.Those supplied by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and theUnited Nationswere judged to have met the specifications of UN experts.The findings – based on 9,000 responses to a poll on social media in November, observations “from partners on the ground” and “community feedback” – will raise new questions about the quality of aid being supplied directly to Gaza by individual countries, which have been favoured by Israeli authorities seeking to bypass the UN.Since the ceasefire in October after two years of conflict, only 20,000 of the 90,000 tents that had enteredGazawere supplied by the UN or other major international NGOs, one aid official said.View image in fullscreenA view of tents in Gaza City, including those marked by flags from the UAE and Qatar considered to have met UN specifications. The findings will raise questions about the quality of aid being supplied directly to Gaza by individual countries, which have been favoured by Israeli authorities seeking to bypass the UN.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesCogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees aid to Gaza, has said it is working to support “winterisation” in the territory by allowing the supply of more than25,000 tonnesof tarpaulins and tents.Palestinians in Gaza and humanitarian officials said tents sold on the open market by commercial contractors were inadequate for Gaza in winter and were expensive.“The tent we live in is worn out and rainwater leaks inside,” said Linda Abu Halima, 30, who was living in the coastal zone of Mawasi after her home in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, was destroyed. “We received it through the help of someone; it is handmade from wood and tarpaulin. We cannot buy a new tent due to the high prices, and we have not received any aid at all.”Almost all the 2.3 million population of Gaza has been displaced many times since the conflict was triggered in October 2023 by a surprise Hamas raid into Israel, and swathes of the territory have been reduced to rubble.Many in Gaza believed the ceasefire would allow them to start rebuilding their homes. Instead, the division of the territory and the continued humanitarian crisis have made this impossible. Few have the resources to move, most essential items remain scarce, and basic services are almost nonexistent.The UN’s operations may be further restricted as many NGOs that deliver services in Gaza on its behalfface a ban under new Israeli lawsimposing stringent registration requirements.View image in fullscreenChinese-donated tents in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/ShutterstockOfficials in Israel have saidthe new systemaims to “streamline the humanitarian system so that aid and humanitarian platforms are not used and abused by Hamas”. Aid officials said the consequences would be “catastrophic”.Hopes for rapid progress to a second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire are fading. Analysts say neither Hamas, which has control over most of the population of Gaza, nor Israel, which holds more than half of the territory and all the entry points, have much incentive to make immediate concessions. Both sides accuse the other of ceasefire violations.In their 2023 raid into Israel, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 250. Israel’s ensuing offensive killed about 70,000 people, mostly civilians. Another414 Palestinianshad been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire, Palestinian officials said.“The only thing that changed with the start of the ceasefire was the silence of the shelling and the end of the bloodshed; our daily lives remain almost the same, with the same suffering,” said Abdullah Abdo, 25, originally from Gaza City but now living in a tented encampment in Mawasi.According to Donald Trump’s20-point planto end the conflict in Gaza, the second phase would involve full disarmament of Hamas, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces, the deployment of an “international stabilisation force” and the appointment of a technocratic administration for the territory. The plan also calls for a “full” flow of aid.Aid officials told the Guardian that efforts to reinforce flood defences were hindered by Israeli restrictions on heavy equipment, construction material and sandbags. Israeli officials said some such machinery could be used by Hamas for military purposes, such as building tunnels.View image in fullscreenA displaced Palestinian looks out over a makeshift camp in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAJawaher Abd Rabbo, 25, lives with her husband and three small children in a single, rat-infested room with no windows or floor in the ruins of an apartment block in the Nasser neighbourhood of Gaza City. Nothing remains of her own home, only a mile further east.Rabbo and her family recently fled from a makeshift shelter east of the Tuffah neighbourhood close to the new “yellow line” which, since the ceasefire in October, divides Gaza into zones controlled by Israel and Hamas.“We left when we heard lots of explosions,” Rabbo said. “I left all our clothes and belongings behind, and carried my two-month-old daughter in my arms and held my two-year-old by the hand, while my husband was in a wheelchair due to an injury he got during the war.”Rabbo said she and her husband had tried to repair the room that is now their home, putting plastic sheets where there once were walls and on the ground.Nineteen people have been killed by buildings collapsing after recent heavy rain, Palestinian officials said.‘During this storm, we had no sufficient blankets or clothing to protect us from the cold,” Rabbo said. “Rainwater soaked everything. We only have one mattress, which my children and I share. I know staying in a ruined building during winter is extremely dangerous, but we have no other choice.”Explore more on these topicsGazaAidIsraelEgyptChinaSaudi ArabiaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Riyadh said the Yemeni government had issued the invitation for talks.Yemen’s separatist movement earlier on Friday announced a constitution for an independent nation in the south and demanded other factions in the war-torn country accept the move.The UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council depicted the announcement as a declaration of independence for the south. But it was not immediately clear if the move could be implemented or was largely symbolic.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have for years supported various factions within Yemen’s government-run territories, intervening in the neighbouring country’s long-running civil war.Meanwhile, the UAE said it had withdrawn all its troops from Yemen.Tensions between Saudis and Emiratis over future of Yemen reach boiling pointRead moreThe move comes after days of airlifts by UAE military aircraft following an order to withdraw from anti-Houthi forces in Yemen. This followed Saudi Arabia pushing back against the advance of Emirati-backed separatists there.The announcements came as the Saudi-backed and internationally recognised government moved to recapture the crucial region of Hadramout from the STC. The STC seized much of Hadramout, bordering Saudi Arabia, and neighbouring al-Mahralast month.Earlier on Friday, Salem al-Khanbashi, the Hadramout governor under the internationally recognised government, said he had launched a “peaceful” operation to restore control over the area.Saudi airstrikes hit an airport in Hadramout, according to a spokesperson for the province’s tribes, and the governor said his forces had taken control of the most important military base in the area.“This operation is not a declaration of war nor an attempt to escalate tensions,” Khanbashi was quoted as saying by the Saba Net news agency. “This operation does not target any political or social group,” he said, adding that it “aims to peacefully and systematically hand over military sites”.Mohammed Abdulmalik, the head of the STC in Wadi Hadramaot and Hadramaot desert, said seven airstrikes hit al-Khasah camp, killing seven people and wounding more than 20. Further strikes targeted other sites in the same region, he added.Saudi sources confirmed the strikes were carried out by the Saudi-led coalition, which nominally includes the UAE and was formed in 2015 to fight the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen’s north.A source close to the Saudi military said: “It will not stop until the Southern Transitional Council withdraws from the two governorates.”The wealthy Gulf powers formed the backbone of the military coalition aimed at dislodging the Houthis, who forced the government from the capital, Sana’a, in 2014 and seized Yemen’s most populated areas. But after a decade-long civil war, the Houthis remain in place and the Saudis and Emiratis are backing different factions in the government-held territories.Amr al-Bidh, the foreign affairs representative for the STC, accused Riyadh of having “knowingly misled the international community by announcing a ‘peaceful operation’ that they never had any intention to keep peaceful”. “This was evidenced by the fact that they launched 7 airstrikes minutes later,” he posted on X.Saudi Arabia has repeatedly urged the STC to withdraw from the recently conquered territories.US ‘adapt, shrink or die’ terms for $2bn aid pot will mean UN bowing down to Washington, say expertsRead moreOn Friday the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jabir, said the STC had blocked a Saudi delegation from landing at Aden airport, accusing the group of “intransigence”.On Thursday, Yemen’s STC-controlled transport ministry had denounced a Saudi demand that all planes to and from the UAE make a stop in Saudi Arabia for security checks.According toFlightradar24, no planes have taken off or landed at Aden airport for more than 24 hours, although the transport ministry did not officially announce its closure.With Agence France-Presse and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsYemenMiddle East and north AfricaSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

These figures relate to the number of convictions rather than the number of people convicted.Life sentences can be given to child rapists at a judge’s discretion under existing rules, with an offence range of six to 19 years for offences against children under 13.Reform said the policy had been “factored in” to itsplans to free up prison capacityby deporting foreign criminals to their country of origin and building “Nightingale prisons”.Yusuf said: “For too long, Conservative and Labour governments have failed to protect our children.“A Reform government will introduce mandatory minimum life sentences for those who rape children. It is shameful that this is not already the law.“It is a stain on our national conscience that grooming gangs were allowed to operate for years with impunity, and in many cases still do. Under Conservative governments, the average sentence for the rape of a child under 13 fell to as little as nine years.“Some grooming gang child rapists have received sentences as low as four years. Under Labour, violent offenders are now being released early from prison.”Number of people who say Britons must be ‘born British’ is rising, study showsRead moreWhole-life orders differ from standard life sentences, whereby a minimum term is served before parole, and are given in cases where the crime was deemed so serious that the offender should never be released from prison.According to the Sentencing Council, there were 70 whole-life prisoners as of March 2025 with recent examples including child serial killer Lucy Letby in 2023, Sarah Everard’s murderer Wayne Couzens in 2021, and Ali Harbi Ali, who murdered MP Sir David Amess in Southend in 2021.A government spokesperson said: “While sentencing sits with the independent judiciary, judges can and do hand down long terms, including life sentences, for these sickening criminals.“Recognising the national emergency violence against women and girls has become, this government is delivering the biggest overhaul of child protection measures in decades.“We are creating a clear legal duty to treat grooming as an explicit aggravating factor in sentencing for child sexual offences whenever it plays a part.“The Independent Inquiry into Grooming Gangs is now under way, with a chair appointed and progress being made toward securing answers for victims and survivors.”In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

And how do we actually begin to do something and address that?”One of the biggest issues was the levels of shame and stigma associated with porn use that creates “a sense of growing isolation because you’re not talking about it”, said Hall.Because of this, she set up the not-for-profit servicePivotal Recovery, an online self-help resource that can act as a starting point for people struggling with problematic porn use.Hall, who has written several books on the subject, founded theLaurel Centre, which specialises in treating sex and porn addiction. It also trains therapists in helping their clients with the problem, a service that is getting “busier and busier”.It is common for people not to initially recognise they have a problem, she said, and to first seek treatment for something else. Clients are often referred from couples counselling or through therapy for anxiety or depression, or other addictions.Hall described porn addiction as a spectrum disorder that can start out a something recreational but “builds into more problematic use, it becomes more and more habitual, becomes a way of escaping uncomfortable emotions”.She wanted to challenge the stigma about seeking help and called for more awareness and early intervention before people became dependent on it as their main coping strategy.Hall said: “The average person struggling with their usage, this being a problem, is a narrative that’s not really come out much to date. And the more we talk about that, I think the more people are going to start coming forward for help.”Andrew Harvey, a BACP-accredited therapist in Nottingham who works with clients with addiction, said porn addiction often causes serious personal issues.“They’re neglecting maybe their studies, work, or often the intimacy with their partner is suffering.“Online porn can deliver huge amounts of novelty or difference. And that, from a stimulation perspective, for some folks, can be more so than their partner, and once they feel compelled and out of control around that, then their intimacy with their partner suffers and [porn] becomes their only intimacy, so there’s an escalation.”On top of that, many sufferers also expressed concern over seeking out more extreme content over time to satisfy their compulsion, he said. Sometimes this would cause confusion, especially when they felt it did not align with their sexual preferences.While there is a debate about whether pornography can be addictive in the truest sense, many sufferers find it encroaches enormously into their day-to-day activities, with some users watching porn for hours on end and unable to complete daily tasks as a result.Harvey said: “Anecdotally, for many of us who work in the field, it certainly looks and feels a lot like addiction. And I think clients come with what they describe as addiction because that’s what’s in that discourse, and certainly their experience is very addictive-like.”He said treatment was not about banning or abstaining from anything sexual, and that there were ways in which people felt they benefited from porn, for example, in understanding their sexuality.“I hope the outcome is that people find joy within their sexual being rather than something that feels out of control and is hurting them,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPornographySexHealthHealth policyRelationshipsMennewsShareReuse this content"

But no one knew the addiction. I’d try to hide it as best I could. I just saw the funny side to it that no one would think to question it.”Despite the jokes, porn had become a huge problem, interfering in his relationships and demolishing his self-esteem.“The worst days my head would be racing at 100 miles per hour. All that will be in my head is porn, sex, everything. There would be a time where I’d just absolutely crave everything I’ve seen,” he said.“Every time I watched porn it didn’t necessarily mean that I was masturbating. I would literally watch it like you would pull your phone out and watch videos on YouTube or TikTok, Instagram or something. That was me but with porn.”Lennard began watching pornography as a child, after first seeing sexually explicit scenes at the age of 10 or 11 and seeking out more content.“When you’re young, you are curious about all that kind of stuff, and I guess at first it seemed normal to me because I’m young, it’s porn. And it wasn’t until … I started realising that there was an issue when it became so addictive that it was taking up my time.“It interfered with my life because I was always questioning why I was so addicted with it. Growing up, I became worse through school, in my personal life. And it wasn’t until the recent years in my 20s that things just got a bit out of control.”He said he found it hard to resist the “urge” or “craving” he would have.“It was addictive for me and at that time I didn’t really understand what was wrong with me so I kind of just compressed my feelings towards it.”He said he was left with a “guilty conscience” when in relationships, “because you think, ‘Oh, I should be loving my partner, respecting my partner and loving her and her body’”.“I had that guilty side to me where [I was thinking], ‘Why should I be watching porn? Why should I be watching other people have sex when I should be loving my partner?’ and you know it kind of headboggled me a little bit.”Watching porn would also give him unrealistic expectations of himself. He added: “It can very badly ruin your mental health. Where I’d been watching it for so long and so much, it kind of fed in my brain [that] I have to be like that. I’d compare myself, and it is very soul destroying.“I don’t think that people realise that it’s fake. [The performers] take so much medication and have surgeries and all this stuff to make it look good. People feed that into their heads that’s the reality of it, when it’s not.”An ADHD diagnosis in 2024 helped Lennard understand that his brain was wired more towards impulsive behaviour – especially around thrill and pleasure seeking – than a typical person.He has since gone “cold turkey”, assisted in part by the Online Safety Act, he said, because putting his personal details into porn websites was something he did not want to do.He said he “never in a million years” thought he would speak publicly about it but that now he felt as if “a massive weight” has been lifted from his shoulders.Explore more on these topicsPornographyHealthMental healthMenInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m still here’: ex-MP Patrick Duffy, 103, publishes memoirsRead moreAccording to Kevin Meagher, a writer who helped Duffy publish his memoirs, the politician was “kind of a living historical jukebox” where you could “push the buttons and say, what was it like to meet, you know, [the former prime minister] Clement Attlee?”Duffy, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and received a papal knighthood from Pope John Paul II, served in the second world war during which he survived a plane crash in the Orkney Islands while serving in the Fleet Air Arm.Duffy first ran for parliament in 1950 and was elected MP for the first time in 1963 after winning the Colne Valley byelection, before holding a seat in Sheffield Attercliffe from 1970 to his retirement in 1992.He served as parliamentary under secretary for the Royal Navy for James Callaghan’sLabourgovernment in the late 1970s.Duffy “took a lot of flak” as the only MP who “berated” the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1981 for the death of the Republican hunger striker Bobby Sands, Meagher said. Thatcher and Duffy would later have tea together, particularly when he was president of the Nato Assembly in the 1980s.A statement written by Meagher and approved by Duffy’s family said: “An extraordinary man with a lifetime of accomplishments, Patrick leaves behind him family and friends – across all age groups – who will miss his kindness, humour and incredible acuity in recalling personalities and events from a century ago.“Patrick’s was a life well-lived, brimming with achievement, the admiration of colleagues and the love and affection of his many family and friends.

Our argument would be, OK, he’s in perfect health, but he’s also 87. He’s clearly more vulnerable than someone who’s 38,” she said.Dan Holland, from the Salvation Army’s homelessness services team, said that 10% of people living in the charity’s residential accommodation were over 55, and they were seeing a large number of people in the older age category coming to them for help.“Not as many people now have a mortgage that they’ve paid off and a roof over their head that they can call their own. Lots more people are renting, relying on housing benefit which has been frozen, so it’s not rocket science, eventually they will end up experiencing homelessness,” he said.One of those was Raymond, 63, who ended up sleeping in his car for seven weeks after becoming homeless following the breakdown of his marriage. He approached the council at least six times for help and was told he was not a priority, before he ended up living at a Salvation Army centre in the north-west.“My legs were bad, they were really swelling up because it was only a small car so I couldn’t stretch my legs. I was sleeping on the seat and my body was just getting in a mess,” he said. “My doctor put me on folate tablets because I couldn’t afford to eat properly. I wasn’t getting any vegetables.“I just never got any advice. And I think the trouble with people my age, my generation, we just get on with it, we don’t always reach out. I have no idea what I’m going to do in the future as I’m approaching retirement.”Holland said services would soon need to start thinking about palliative and end-of-life care for homeless people, as more and more people end up in unstable accommodation in the last months of their lives.“If you are experiencing homelessness and you are naturally coming to the end of your life, or you’ve got a terminal illness – where do you go? That’s a huge issue that I think is definitely on the horizon,” he said.Research from Crisis found that one in five (17%) older people said they wanted to retire but could not because of their housing costs, while the number of older people facing homelessness in England has risen more than 50% in the past five years.There has also been a 35% increase in the number of over-55s in temporary accommodation since March 2022.Experts said the problem has been exacerbated by the country’s now deeply entrenched housing crisis, which has resulted in home ownership becoming increasingly out of reach and forced people to rent into their later years, leaving them vulnerable to eviction or unsustainable rent increases.People on lowest incomes being denied access to social housing, research findsRead moreBen Twomey, the chief executive of Generation Rent, said: “Soaring rents were locking people into renting for decades, forcing older people to live in homes unsuitable for their needs and damaging to their health, while pushing some into homelessness.”Edith Gomes Munda, a 61-year-old renter in Huntingdon, said she was increasingly fearful for the future, having been forced to move twice in recent years owing to her landlord selling up and rent rises that she could no longer afford.“It worries me that I may have to move every three or four years, and getting older, there comes a point when everything gets more difficult, more tiring,” she said.“I’m now 61 and I will get my pension soon but I don’t know if it will cover the rent. I’m healthy enough but how long will I be able to keep working for? I have that on my mind all the time. With the rent increases, you feel like you have to constantly move, you can’t really settle down.”Munda added that she previously was unable to buy a home and now it was too late. “I gave up on that and continued with my life. Now I’m too old, I wouldn’t find a lender when I don’t know how long I can work for. The only other option we have is to apply for social housing, but the waiting lists are so long,” she said.The government has yet to publish its long-term housing strategy, which has been delayed until March next year, but experts say prioritising older people is essential.“Even a reformed private rented sector doesn’t really work for older people. We get a lot of calls from people who have had to leave private rented homes as they’re just priced out, and they can’t find anywhere else,” said Lisabel Miles, housing policy manager at Age UK.“There’s going to be a lot of older renters emerging into retirement with real concerns about where they can go.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessOlder peopleSocial exclusionPovertyHousingRenting propertynewsShareReuse this content"

It also included 279 influenza-associated pediatric deaths, the highest reported to the agency during a seasonal influenza epidemic.This year, a new variant, subclade K, has emerged and the flu season started earlier than usual in Europe, with “high or very high influenza activity”, in December in the region.In the United States, there had been an estimated 7.5m influenza cases and 81,000 hospitalizations by 20 December. That marked a 25% increase in cases over the previous week, according to the CDC.Thirty-two stateshave seen a “high or very high” number of flu illnesses.“A lot of people are getting the flu at the same time, which is always tough. That is actually tougher than a situation in which people get it and it’s spread out over a longer period,” Nuzzo said. “It could be a worse season, in part because more people are going to need more care than hospitals can easily deliver.”Epidemiologists are also concerned that fewer people could opt to get the flu vaccine because the CDC, led by the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, canceledits campaignencouraging people to get the shot. At the start of December, about 130m flu vaccines had been distributed in the US, 13m less than at the same point last year,according to the CDC.“It’s completely incredulous to me that after experiencing the worst flu season for kids on record that we could head into this flu season – with signs that it could be bad, based on the viruses circulating out there – with anything but a robust plan to encourage people to get vaccinated,” Nuzzo said.Some US residents could also be concerned about how much protection the new round of vaccine shots offer against the latest variant.“We have some reason to think that the protection may be lower, but I want to be careful by saying” that, Nuzzo said. “It may protect you less, but it’s likely still going to give you some important protection.”People also might not be aware that they can pick up an at-home test from a pharmacy, Nuzzo said.“There are some people who might benefit from medication if they tested positive, but that medication needs to be given very soon after symptoms start,” Nuzzo said.Explore more on these topicsFluInfectious diseasesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are thehours-long, hundred-person lineswrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.On a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot forTeslacar charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.The novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsiteanti-Musk protests,noise complaints from neighborsand customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.We still don’t really know what Elon Musk’s Doge actually didRead moreGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month thathe was leaving the Tesla Dinerto focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chefremoved his previous Instagram postsreferencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.Greenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.Greenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Dinerfaced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Muskmade what rights groupshave described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.‘Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging’Musk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA sinceat least 2018as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”The diner received immense media coverage upon opening butpoor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.A display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.Tesla postedon X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.On social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.The diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.As the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTeslaElon MuskLos AngelesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And over this same period of time, Epstein avoided serious and meaningful punishment for his crimes.The US justice department’s recent disclosure of long-secret investigative files related to Epstein has once again raised the question of why he wasn’t interdicted sooner, despite numerous reports of misconduct. The issue has been the subject of many conspiracy theories, often focusing on the idea that Epstein – who lived at the center of a network of powerful people – enjoyed some form of protection.Some never-before-seen documents recently released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, as well as previously public filings tucked deep into prior civil litigation included in these disclosures, spell out numerous missed opportunities to stop Epstein before his 2019 arrest and subsequent suicide in prison.Longtime attorneys told the Guardian that there are multiple reasons why this might have occurred.“The Epstein and Maxwell problem is twofold. First, law enforcement agencies, especially at the local level, do not communicate well with one another,” Neama Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, said. “Second, prosecutors are risk-averse and do not want to prosecute difficult cases.”More, authorities can see sexual abuse cases as risky propositions in terms of success.“Sexual assault and sexual abuse prosecutions are often ‘he said, she said’ cases where the defense argues consent, or that the sexual contact never happened,” Rahmani said, explaining that prosecutors are expected to win every time. “They may hesitate taking difficult cases to trial, especially against defendants with significant resources.”“Cynics may also argue that Epstein wasn’t prosecuted because of his friendships with powerful elected officials. Some of this case has changed with #MeToo, more victims coming forward and being willing to testify, and more resources and changes in philosophy when it comes to prosecuting sex crimes,” Rahmani said.“But it’s still not enough and the victims were let down.”Indeed, the chronology of Epstein’s repeated mentions and investigations could suggest both an abject lack of communication as well as an overall lack of interest regarding complaints against him.There was Maria Farmer’s FBI report in 1996. Farmer, whose sister Annie was abused by Epstein, told authorities that Epstein “stole” photographs and film negatives of her sisters, and was “believed to have sold the pictures to potential buyers”.While the case type was listed as “child pornography” in this report, police did not act. Epstein, unencumbered by criminal investigation, went on to abuse numerous teen girls in the following years.Then came Alicia Arden’s police report in 1997. Arden said Epsteingropedher during what was supposed to be a modeling interview for Victoria’s Secret.Arden, who was 27 at the time,saidSanta Monica police blamed her rather than take action. “They said I went up to the hotel room willingly and that I intimidate men because of my appearance. I told police that I did not ask or give permission to be touched or to have Epstein start taking my clothes off. I thought I was going to a legitimate audition.”In 2001,Ghislaine Maxwell– who in 2021 was found guilty of aiding Epstein’s abuse of teen girls – drew police attention after accosting three Palm Beach college students. “Maxwell said she needed young, beautiful, unmarried women to answer phones and do office work at her home on Palm Beach,” the police report said.At least one of the students went to the house on several occasions and “described the telephone calls as men call[ing] in saying when they were going to drop of[f] particular girls”. Police investigated, including searching Epstein’s trash for potential evidence, ultimately concluding that while there was unusual activity at his south Florida mansion, “at this time, no illegal activity has been reported or detected”.Then came 2004. In August of that year, a taxi driver “flagged down” a police officer. The cabbie dropped off two females, who seemed to be 15 and 17, at a house that investigators would determine was Epstein’s.“The taxi cab driver stated that he picked the females up in West Palm Beach and while traveling to Epstein’s residence he overheard the females discussing how much money they would make ‘dating’ in Palm Beach and possible drug use,” a police report said.In 2005 and 2006, Palm Beach police interviewed numerous minor victims, and the FBI and US attorney’s office ultimately investigated abuse claims. But Epstein’s case was resolved with a cushy plea deal in 2008 that allowed him to avoid federal charges if he admitted to state-level prostitution charges.Epstein and Maxwell did not disappear. In 2011, a victim of Epstein and allegedly, also of Maxwell, contacted south Florida federal prosecutors.The woman, Virginia Giuffre, lived in Australia and was interviewed by an FBI agent there. Legal representatives for the late Giuffre, who had accused Epstein of trafficking her to high-profile men including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, met with a New York federal prosecutor to discuss Epstein.Mountbatten-Windsor has vehemently denied all allegations of misconduct. The former Duke of York relinquished his royal title amid the Epstein controversy.That prosecutor did not open an investigation following that meeting.Epstein did not face serious charges until 2019, months after a Miami Herald investigation prompted controversy about his plum plea deal. Epstein killed himself in jail weeks after his July 2019 arrest and Maxwell was arrested the next year and convicted of luring teen girls into his abusive world.Advocates for Epstein’s victims have repeatedly condemned local and federal law enforcement for failing to take victims’ claims seriously – enabling his abuse to continue years after initial reports.Lindsay Richards, a criminal defense partner at Coffer and Connelly in Texas, pointed to communication issues, as well as attitudes about sex crimes that were pervasive in the 90s and 2000s. With reports to local law enforcement, “there’s a very good chance there was just no communication between agencies in any way, especially in the 90s”.Federal agencies, on the other hand, “have always had decent communication, especially within the agency”, she said. “So once it became federal, I’m surprised there wasn’t more being done.”The state plea deal, she said, “does seem to be kind of nefarious, in my opinion” but in her experience as a prosecutor who long pursued sex crimes cases, “I really do believe that there were a lot of agencies, and even ones that I worked with, [where] for decades, sexual assault was dismissed.”The attitude with police agencies, she said, was: “You can report it, but these are so hard to prove and they’re so difficult that we’re just not going to really put a lot of time and energy into it.”John Day, founder of John Day Law and a former prosecutor in New Mexico, pointed to seeming intelligence failures when it came to pursuing cases.“Maybe the best explanation is rooted in why all the signals about Bin Laden were ignored until 9/11 – plenty of law enforcement [and] CIA analysts had him on their radar screens, but the information was never collated in a way that got understood until it was too late?” Day said. “Could this have been the equivalent for Epstein?”Day said that investigative failures with Epstein were not equivalent to a 9/11 attack, but noted “these timeframes were roughly parallel”.“I think you can make an argument that the failures of 9/11 to appreciate what information pointed to a pending attack were similar to the failures of law enforcement to understand what Epstein and Maxwell were up to.”But, Day also said: “This is separate from understanding why Epstein got such a sweetheart deal in Florida from US attorney Alexander Acosta.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

After Unai Emery’s Aston Villa felt the force of the Premier League leaders in a4-1 thrashing, this time it was Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth who were vanquished despite being gifted the opening goal by Gabriel Magalhães.The Brazilian promptly equalised before Declan Rice capped his return from injury with two goals asArsenalmoved six points clear at the top, even if they had to survive a nervous last 16 minutes after the substitute Eli Junior Kroupi pulled one back.‘We rolled over’: Parker angry at Burnley as Rutter and Ayari end Brighton’s lean runRead moreMikel Arteta had promised that his players would learn from last season’s defeat here and a2-1 loss to Bournemouth in Maywhen Liverpool had already been crowned champions. After a sloppy first half it seemed they still had some way to go to heed the lessons of previous seasons, but they were so much sharper after the break, no doubt with a few home truths from their manager still ringing in their ears. With Rice in this kind of marauding form and a fifth straight league win in the bag, Arsenal will take some stopping in 2026.Villa’s win over Nottingham Forestearlier in the day had cut their lead to three points. But the news that Rice had passed a late fitness test was a reason for Arteta to feel optimistic despite slumping to a2-0 defeat here last season. Probably with Thursday’s meeting with Liverpool in mind, Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard were introduced only from the bench in the second half after Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli had been handed rare starts. However, it was a fourth league match in succession that the £67.5m summer signing Eberechi Eze did not play a single minute in what must be a concern for the England forward in a World Cup year.Bournemouth were unchanged from theirdraw against Chelseabefore the new year, with Antoine Semenyo seen sharing a few hugs with the home fans before kick-off in what could be his last game for the club if an anticipated move to Manchester City goes ahead. One has to wonder whether it was part of Pep Guardiola’s plan to allow the Ghana forward to stay a bit longer and see if he could do some damage against their title rivals. Semenyo took less than 10 seconds to illustrate his threat after a long ball straight from kick-off caused confusion in the Arsenal box but he could not get a shot away. That was the story of his evening, although Semenyo was lucky to still be on the field for the second half after pulling back Rice when he had already been booked.View image in fullscreenEvanilson seizes on Gabriel Magalhães’s error to give Bournemouth an early lead.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAMadueke was determined to make the most of his opportunity on the right flank in place of Saka but wasted a glorious opportunity after cutting in from the right flank as Arsenal looked to have seized control. No one would have expected it to be Gabriel who would be guilty of presentingBournemouthwith a goal on a plate, so dependable is the Brazilian usually. Evanilson could not believe his luck when an ambitious pass intended for Jurriën Timber presented the striker with the simplest of tasks to open the scoring.Wolves thrash sorry West Ham to claim first Premier League win of the seasonRead moreA furious Arteta turned on his heels and headed for his seat in the dugout. It was not long before he was up again to celebrate their equaliser that came after Madueke left Semenyo for dead. His cross found its way to the back post after Martinelli’s effort was blocked and Gabriel lashed in a shot with his left foot.With the £64m striker Viktor Gyökeres again labouring up front, Arsenal were still far from their flowing best. In stark comparison, Evanilson was a real handful for their defenders and it needed some last-ditch defending from Gabriel to clear a number of dangerous crosses. Arteta exchanged angry words with the Bournemouth bench when Semenyo escaped punishment for pulling back Rice before storming down the tunnel at half-time with plenty on his mind.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice kisses a camera after scoring Arsenal’s third.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APDespite the freezing conditions, the Arsenal manager was back at his post early for the second half and would not have been pleased to see the space David Brooks was afforded before shooting wide. But Arteta’s mood was transformed within a minute. Gyökeres was involved in the buildup as he held off Marcus Senesi and allowed Martin Ødegaard to tee up Rice, whose shot flew past Djordje Petrovic in the Bournemouth goal.The England midfielder was soon celebrating his second by planting a kiss on a television camera after a brilliant combination between Saka and Ødegaard. Arsenal appeared to be home and dry but Bournemouth had other ideas. Kroupi came off the bench to fire past David Raya from 25 yards and briefly spark hopes of a comeback. The home fans were left incensed when the referee blew for full time with Bournemouth still on the attack, not that Arsenal nor their jubilant supporters will care one bit.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But I said we wanted that revenge from last year, and I think we kind of earned it tonight.”In the semi-finals Sunday, Finland will face Sweden, and Canada will play Czechia. Sweden beat Latvia 6-3, Canada had a five-goal first period in a 7-1 romp over Slovakia, and Czechia beat Switzerland 6-2.Michigan State’s Lee Ryker tied it for the United States with 1:33 left in regulation and the Notre Dame goalie Nick Kempf off for an extra attacker.Lee Tuuva and Joona Saarelainen scored in a 55-second span in the third to give Finland a 2-1 lead. Tuuva tied it at 2 with 7:17 left, then set up Saarelainen’s go-ahead goal with 6:22 remaining.

Heikki Ruohonen tied it at 4:46 on a quick shot from the left side.Rimpinen stopped 28 shots. Kempf made 21 saves.The Americans lost their last two games – falling 6-3 to Sweden on Wednesday night in the group finale – after winning their first three.“It was an honor to coach this group,” said Bob Motzko, the University of Minnesota coach. “They played a great game tonight and came up just short. Give Finland credit. It’s an empty feeling right now, but our guys gave it all they had.”In the late game at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, the Canadians routed Slovakia with the five-goal first.Cole Reschny, Tij Iginla, Michael Misa, Sam O’Reilly and Brady Martin scored in the first period, and Porter Martone and Cole Beaudoin connected in the second. Jack Ivankovic made 21 saves.“Just goes to show how powerful we are,” Martin said. “Going up 5-0, it kind of kills their confidence.”In the first quarter-final in St Paul, Anton Frondell scored twice for Sweden against Latvia. The defenseman Leo Sahlin Wallenius had a goal and two assists to help the Swedes remain perfect in five games.In Minneapolis Tomas Galvas, Samuel Drancak, Adam Jiricek.

Ollie Watkins celebrated his 250th appearance for the club with his fourth goal in three games and John McGinn added two more after the interval.Villa’s ability to score out of next to nothing epitomises their season. They managed this game superbly, inflicting a fourth straight defeat onNottingham Forest, but if the league table was made up of their expected goals difference they would have started this weekend in 15th place.Wolves v West Ham, Brighton v Burnley, and more: football clockwatch – liveRead moreInstead they overtook Manchester City, who play Chelsea on Sunday, to briefly move within three points of the top before Arsenal stretched the gap back to six with victory at Bournemouth on Saturday evening.Few would have suspected Villa had lost theirprevious game 4-1 at Arsenalas they set about swatting Forest aside. These are troubling times for Sean Dyche’s side, for whom Morgan Gibbs-White had given them hope when making it 2-1 but who are making “too many basic errors” according to their manager.To think that at this time last year Forest kept five clean sheets in a run of seven successive wins, their best sequence in the Premier League. Now it is hard to discern what Dyche’s Plan B is when they go behind, although their faltering form started when they slipped out of Champions League contention at the end of last season andAnge Postecoglu soon followedNuno Espírito Santo out the building in the autumn.“You can’t give basic errors away to teams like this in thePremier League,” Dyche said. “The mentality is there but you can’t keep giving yourself a mountain to climb. Players were switching off to the basics. We have worked on it and shown them but this is the job. I never expected it to be easy when I got here.”Part of Villa’s formula for success is to keep scoring belters from outside the area, and Watkins’s seventh of the season was the latest. Those who see their claret and blue glass as half empty might question whether this is sustainable but Unai Emery can point to the quality of the moves, the dominance that precedes some of the long-range strikes and the flourishing understanding between Watkins and Morgan Rogers.John Victor, retaining his place from Matz Sels, saved superbly from Watkins in the second minute but was culpable for McGinn’s clinching goal.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins puts Aston Villa ahead against Nottingham Forest.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAForest did counter well occasionally, Omari Hutchinson prompting Emi Martínez to dive full length to save after Nicolás Domínguez stole possession from Boubacar Kamara then Victor Lindelöf.Just as Forest thought they had implemented the perfect gameplan, Villa went ahead. Kamara’s header down to Tielemans allowed Rogers to pass in to Watkins’s feet. He turned inside before walloping in his sixth goal in eight games from the edge of the area.No pair have combined for more than the 10 goals between Villa’s England forwards since the start of last season. “Wow,” Emery said. “Morgan and Watkins are both fantastic players. They are fantastic competitors themselves. They are both focusing on improving things and their commitment here is massive. They set standards with their behaviour every day. I am proud of them.”Watkins’s goal knocked the stuffing out of Forest. Four minutes into the second half McGinn, rested from the starting lineup on Tuesday, converted with a smart left-foot shot from Matty Cash’s first-time cross.Gibbs-White gave Forest hope by running on to Dilane Bakwa’s through pass to dink home but the victory was wrapped up when John Victor inexplicably came out of his goal to deal with Tielemans’s pass and McGinn rounded him before slotting into an empty net from 30 yards.Emery played down Villa’s title credentials. “Our challenge is the next match, not how we will finish,” he said. “Our target is to be in Europe. We need players to feel comfortable and feel confidence, being demanding.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He leaned against the drinks table and let it take all his weight, clasped his face in his hands, cried a little. As if only just feeling the shape and hue of the unspeakable thing he had just done. As if some act of great violence had just left his hands. Perhaps it had.And before the double world champion, before the social media phenomenon, before the commercial giant, before the global icon, there wasLuke Littlerthe darts obsessive. A kid steeped and stewed in the heritage of the game, fully aware of the landmarks he is now chasing, the tapestry of greatness into which he is now indelibly woven.‘I’m here to win’: champion Luke Littler has ominous words for his rivalsRead morePerhaps in hindsight there was an element of wish fulfilment in the way we – the pundits, the public, the punters – had tried to will this final into a contest. Gian van Veen came into game on the back of the greatest season of his life, as the only player on tour with a winning head-to-head record against Littler in 2025. But in dismantling the Dutchman 7-1 in a little over 40 minutes, the 18-year-old again demonstrated that over the longest format and under the highest pressure, he remains untouchable.There was blood on the board and a wasp on the oche, but nothing could throw him off balance. And perhaps the unique genius of Littler is the ability to locate the effortless flow state that produces great darts and to live in it, breathe in it, turn those seven feet of pure windless air into his home and his castle. To whisk sets away from you in the space of two or three minutes of pure magic, and do it again and again. He doesn’t get in the zone. He is the zone. The zone is Littler-shaped.He nails the relentless consistency that creates opportunities, and the big moments that seize them. He can speed it up and slow it down. His averages this tournament: 102, 97, 107, 107, 100, 105, 106. And above all he masters the visceral quality of combat darts, aware that this sport is essentially an act of showmanship. You create a character, project an aura, burnish a brand. Throw the right darts at the right time, ride the energy, harness the noise, and you can suck the very essence out of your opponent.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler holds the trophy aloft after winning his second world title.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnd this was essentially what happened to Van Veen. He didn’t play a bad game – average 100.0, 38% on his doubles – but both were down on his best, a measure of the sheer stress he was under. He won the first set, missed darts for the second, and “that was probably the game”, as he put it brutally afterwards. “Luke Humphries and Gary Anderson always put you under pressure. But this is different pressure.”Stung into action after going behind, Littler put together the sort of surge no player on the planet can cope with: a terrifying blend of anger and calmness, a man in utter command of his emotions. There was a big fish to take the third set. There were crucial double-fives. There were 16 180s. Almost a fifth of his visits ended with three trebles. “On stage at times,” he said immodestly but truthfully, “I’m unstoppable.”And before long, he stood a leg away, 327 to get. Hit a maximum. Hit a treble-20. Hit a treble-19. Hit the double-15 to unleash chaos, a millionaire’s finish to claim a million-pound prize. He didn’t throw a nine-darter in the end, but at least he got a 147.View image in fullscreenGian van Veen won the first set but it was all downhill from there.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe first ever £1m cheque in darts is a once-unthinkable windfall that owes itself not entirely but largely to the Littler effect: an electrifying ripple of attention and interest that has drawn in the younger audiences other sports spend decades trying to chase down. Quite apart from his brilliance, Littler gets the intensely visual appeal of darts, celebrating memorably, interacting with the crowd, albeit not always in the most cordial way.The boy is now a man, and how the paying public respond to this era of sublime dominance remains to be seen. The sport has broadened and deepened immeasurably since the dominance Phil Taylor enjoyed in the 1990s and 2000s. Taylor’s 16 titles still feels impossibly remote, but there are other records and milestones to chase in the meantime. The World Masters later this month is one of the two remaining majors he is yet to win, along with the European Championship in October, which will require him to conquer the hostile German crowds.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But set aside the numbers and the monuments, and perhaps Littler’s greatest gift to us is the sheer joy of brilliance: the haptic rush of seeing a skill perfected, of talent in its fullest expression, of an athlete and an audience in perfect harmony.Sir Chris Hoy was on stage to present the trophy. Terminally ill with cancer, the great man doesn’t have many nights left, but he wanted to spend one of them at the darts. To be where life is, a place where the humdrum everyday can be inflected with fun and flamboyance and colour. And on nights like this, where the genius of the individual and the genius of the collective collide, there is no better place on earth to be.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipLuke LittlerDartsnewsShareReuse this content"

The candid photos from his camera roll included dozens of friends and family, various barbecues and his many haircuts throughout the year, but there was no room for one notable individual: Juan Carlos Ferrero.The abrupt dissolution of their partnership is one of the most shocking recent coaching splits and the reaction has been dramatic. Journalists swarmed outside Alcaraz’s tennis club in El Palmar a day after the news in their futile attempts to speak with the world No 1, then Ferrero decided to give a number of interviews to offer his own side of the story.I was there: Carlos Alcaraz’s comeback in French Open final is still hard to comprehendRead moreReports from Spain detailing reasons for split continue to circulate. Depending on who you ask, Alcaraz either made a fatal mistake by not fighting harder to maintain his relationship with the coach who guided him for seven years or he is courageously taking responsibility for his career as an adult.What is clear, however, is that at the beginning of the new season, how the change affects Alcaraz and plays into the sport’s defining rivalry, is the biggest storyline of all. He enjoyed by far the best season of his career in 2025, winning two grand slam titles andreturning to the No 1 ranking.The 22-year-old will soon head to Melbourne for the Australian Open, which begins on 12 January, attempting to become the youngest man to win all four grand slams. In order to do so, he will probably have to battle withJannik Sinner, the two-time defending Australian Open champion, who will have his own shot at the career grand slam at the French Open.Last year, Alcaraz and Sinner tightened their hold over the tour, sharing the biggest titles and shutting the rest out. Sinner produced another astounding season under intense scrutiny after his failed doping test in 2024 that led to a three-month ban last year. With so many eyes on his adversary, the Italian will surely relish being able to work in relative silence.Dominant periods from players can sometimes inspire a reaction from the challengers beneath them, but it is difficult to see who could match Sinner and Alcaraz. Novak Djokovic recently noted that the 2028 Olympics remains his goal and he has no intention of retiring, but challenging for the biggest titles is more difficult each year. The 38-year-old reached the semi-finals in all four grand slams last year and he is still capable of playing brilliantly, but his body has not been able to withstand the rigours of the best-of-five-sets format. The rest of the field, including Alexander Zverev, Félix Auger-Aliassime, Alex de Minaur, Lorenzo Musetti, Ben Shelton and Taylor Fritz, has a long way to go to close the gap.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner has lost his world No 1 ranking, but remains a fierce competitor for Carlos Alcaraz.Photograph: Marco Alpozzi/LaPresse/ShutterstockAs ever, the two-pronged dominance on the ATP Tour contrasts sharply with the uncertainty at the top of the WTA circuit. That is in excellent shape, also led by two supreme champions inAryna Sabalenkaand Iga Swiatek.Although Sabalenka produced one of her best seasons, holding off Swiatek to earn the year-end No 1 ranking, the 27-year-old has plenty of questions to answer. Her remarkable consistency is reflected in nine finals, but she lost five of them. She has not always been able to produce her best form under the suffocating pressure of major finals, which could mark the difference between Sabalenka ending as one of the best f her generation and a true all-time great.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka reached nine finals in 2025, but lost five of them.Photograph: Amy Alfiky/PASwiatek, meanwhile, will surely be emboldened byher triumph at Wimbledon, the one tournament she was genuinely unsure she could win. She will also be attempting to complete her career grand slam at the Australian Open, aged just 24.Although Sabalenka and Swiatek lead the field, the rest know they are capable of beating anyone in any draw. After reaching the past two grand slam finals, at Wimbledon and the US Open, Amanda Anisimova has positioned herself as one of the main challengers. As hasElena Rybakina, the 2025 WTA Finalschampion, who finally seems ready to follow upher 2022 Wimbledon triumph.Coco Gauff had an extended period during the off-season to work on her service woes with her new biomechanics coach, Gavin MacMillan.Her triumph at the French Openprovided prime evidence of her ability to make herself so difficult to beat under pressure. Still just 21, she will surely show those qualities again. Mirra Andreeva, even at 18, has plenty to prove after losing steam in the second half of 2025.While the players return to match courts around the world, there is still plenty to resolve away from them. The ProfessionalTennisPlayers Association remains in a legal battle with the most of the governing bodies, but a separate settlement between the PTPA and Tennis Australia is on the table. The top players will probably continue to demand a greater revenue share from grand slam tournaments.The All England Clubcontinues to navigate the legal processesobstructing the club from putting the AELTC Wimbledon Park project into action and beginning the expansion of its grounds on the land of the private golf club it bought directly across the road.A new season has arrived, but so many of sport’s issues remain unchanged.Explore more on these topicsTennisCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnerIga SwiatekAryna SabalenkaCoco GaufffeaturesShareReuse this content"

Given how well Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden have played from the right this season, it is not immediately obvious why City need him, but the modern game is the modern game, the rammed calendar makes large and flexible squads essential and Pep Guardiola may have some esoteric plan for the Ghanaian anyway. But perhaps what is most striking about the deal is the fee – or, more precisely, how little attention it has drawn.English football has become inured to big transfers. The fee feels about right. Semenyo is 25. He has four and a half years left on his contract. He is quick, skilful, intelligent and works hard. He is disciplined, but has the capacity to do the unexpected. Of course a player of his ability costs that much. Yet £65m would make him the third-most expensive player in Bundesliga history. He would be the seventh-most expensive in Serie A history, the 14th-most expensive in La Liga history. Only nine non-English clubs have paid a fee higher than that. Even inPremier Leagueterms, Semenyo sneaks into the top 25.Crystal Palace seal club-record £35m Brennan Johnson transfer from SpursRead morePerhaps that’s fine. As anybody who has raised any qualms about World Cup ticket prices recently has found out from online Americans passionately committed to being ripped off because that’s what capitalism demands, the market is what it is. Value is what people are prepared to pay. If one club say they will pay £65m for Semenyo, his price is £65m. City can afford it.A pedant might wonder whether Semenyo really is worth nearly seven times as much as, say, Nordi Mukiele, who was two years older when he joined Sunderland from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer (albeit with two years left on his contract). Sometimes a particular player or type of player becomes fashionable and if there is demand, then the price goes up. That is just supply and demand. Semenyo had seemingly drawn interest from Chelsea and Liverpool, whereas a desultory loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen meant everybody had pretty much forgotten about Mukiele.The effect those crazes can have is seen by the player Semenyo will slot one place below on the list of most expensive Premier League arrivals: Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian – nine league starts this season, two goals – is a jarring reminder of the trend of the summer: the big No 9. We are not quite in the territory of tulips in the Netherlands of 1636 or non-fungible tokens in 2021, but classic strikers are beginning to look like one of those crazes everybody almost immediately regrets joining in. Just why did you call your daughter Khaleesi?View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade has been a success since joining Newcastle.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersThere were not many centre-forwards out there, we were told. After the fracturing of theguardiolistaconsensus, coaches were going back to basics. Who knows how football will look in two or three years, what the next tactical orthodoxy will be. But goals will always be valuable, so get yourself a striker. Video assistant referee offside calls, the abolition in effect of “level” in decisions meaning a pixel of infraction will be penalised, has militated against the sniffer, the poacher, the hanger-on-the-shoulder, wiped out the Filippo Inzaghi-style forward, so best to make your No 9 a big one.Of the players signed in the great striker bubble of 2025, the most effective has probably been the one least like an orthodox No 9. Aside from his bullet header of anown goal in the Wear-Tyne derby, Nick Woltemade has been a success for Newcastle, not just for his seven goals and an assist in the Premier League, but for his link-up play, angular disruptiveness and general charisma; the beanpole Rudi Völler is hugely popular on Tyneside.Hugo Ekitiké,who cost Liverpool £82.5m, can also look back on his first six months in the Premier League with a reasonable degree of satisfaction, having managed eight goals and two assists and given the impression of being able to interact with his teammates in a way that has eluded many of the arrivals at Anfield in the summer. Had it not been for Arne Slot’s efforts to get Alexander Isak up and running, he might have achieved even more.Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s renaissance at Leeds renews talks of England returnRead moreBut by and large, the other big centre-forwards of the summer have – and with the caveat that half a season is no time to write somebody off – flopped. Isak is themost expensive signing in English history at £125m, and he is due sympathy afterfracturing his leg against Tottenhamlast month, but even before that he was already being talked of as potentially one of the worst signings in history. Probably because of his disrupted summer and the toxic nature of his departure from Newcastle, he arrived undercooked at Liverpool and had managed two goals and an assist from some desultory performances before suffering that injury.He is not the only one, though. Viktor Gyökeres and Liam Delap have had their fitness issues, but equally they have underwhelmed, as has Sesko.At the same time, the player who perhaps persuaded everybody that old-school No 9s might still have a role to play in the modern game, Erling Haaland, has somehow found another level: 19 goals in 19 league games is absurd, particularly when other parts of his game have developed as well. But just because one player resembling an old-school No 9 is thriving, it does not necessarily mean that old-school No 9s are back more generally. Hope and a large fee do not make a functioning centre-forward.There’s no reason to think Semenyo will not be an excellent player for City. Guardiola will have a plan and his plans tend to be better than those of most coaches (although as the case of Kalvin Phillips shows, even City get it wrong occasionally). Will he be worth £65m? That’s much harder to say. Value in the market is very much in the eye of the beholder and fees in the Premier League feel entirely divorced from any kind of objective reality.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueInside footballTransfer windowFootball tacticsManchester CityBournemouthcommentShareReuse this content"

In doing so, he hinted at a disquiet concerning the club’s transfer policy.“You said you’re starting to understand that to play 3-4-3, you [need] a lot of top players and that’s not possible. Can I ask why you never realised that when you first came into the club?” was the question put to Amorim in his press conference for United’s visit to Leeds on Sunday.January transfer window 2026: what every Premier League club needsRead moreAmorim: “I don’t want to talk about that. I just focus on the Leeds game.”“That’s interesting. It’s not like you not to talk. Do you regret saying it, maybe?”Amorim: “No, no, no. But I don’t want to talk about it.”“I’m going to try one more time – it seems mystifying why you would say a year in, that you only just realised you wouldn’t be able to get [enough] top players. Has something changed with regard to what you were told, or did Jason Wilcox [the director of football] talk to you?Amorim: “I don’t want to talk about that … You are very smart, so …”The original response, given on Christmas Eve, jarred. “We can play a different way to take more quality from these players because I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time. I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt,” Amorim said at the time.Amorim had put on a noticeably cheery face when entering the first press briefing at United’s Carrington base aftertheir shock Carabao Cup loss at Grimsbyin August. In contrast, he was noticeably downbeat on Friday. Was this to make a point about his unhappiness over a change in budget regarding this transfer window?Antoine Semenyo had been pursued until the player signalled Manchester Cityas his preferred destination. Did Amorim expect that the £65m available to buy the Bournemouth winger could be used to land another target – say, Rúben Neves from Al-Hilal, or Atlético Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, to reinforce the No 6 position? A previous answer offered a hint. “The transfer window is not going to change,” Amorim said. “We have no conversation at this moment to have any change in the squad. There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue.”View image in fullscreenManchester United are missing Bruno Fernandes through injury, leaving them short of attacking options.Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPAAmorim was his usual open, loquacious self when fielding other questions. Missing eight frontline players due to injury and Africa Cup of Nations call-ups, the 40-year-old was asked about a lack of substitute options when United travel to Elland Road. “It was bad luck to lose Amad [Diallo], Bryan [Mbeumo] [both to Afcon], especially with Bruno [Fernandes injured]. If you lose the three of them at the same time, any team in the world will struggle.“You have all the data and you can sense that three guys create most of the chances for us. And if you lose not one but all three at the same time, of course we are going to struggle. The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it’s clear.”Amorim was also forthcoming when asked why, in most games, he makes like-for-like substitutions rather than more attacking ones in line with the club’s attacking tradition. “The first thing you spoke about is that we are creating and scoring more than most of the teams. That is a point,” he said. “Then I understand the team better than anyone. And sometimes you have supporters [scrutinising] your decisions. Sometimes you have to do what you think. And sometimes it’s hard for them to understand.“But I know when I look at the pitch, I can understand which player is tired. Which player is to struggle a lot if there is a one-against-one all the time. And I try to protect the team and win games. And sometimes it’s the best substitution. Sometimes it’s the wrong substitution.“We create a lot. We have more shots than anyone. So if we have something completely different here from last year it is the way we attack. I think we need to improve the way we defend.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s about how we can get out of this situation, how we can improve and get the results that make us climb the table. This is what we are concerned about.

The board would be most likely to return to Martin O’Neill, who enjoyed a successful interim spell before Nancy was hired, if the Frenchman were sacked.“We are together with the board,” said Nancy. Pressed on whether he was concerned about his own future, the 48-year-old said: “I don’t think about it. I think about finding ways to help my team to be good on details.“It’s the results [that leads to pressure]. So this is the reality for the moment.

No. What I mean is we are really close, really, really close to turn things around.”Nancy continues to cling to the fact Celtic can perform strongly for one half at a time. Indeed, but for poor finishing they would have been more than 1-0 up on Saturday. “I saw enough except the fact that we haven’t scored more goals,” he said. “I know that we lost, but I have also to be objective.“The level we had at certain moments was really, really, really high. This is the reality. And I would not talk like that if it was not the case. But that’s why, in terms of results, I said this is the same story.

Loum Tchaouna came close to halving the deficit, but Scott Parker’s struggling side remain six points adrift of Nottingham Forest in 17th after their wait for a league victory stretched to 11 games.Wolves thrash sorry West Ham to claim first Premier League win of the seasonRead moreParker said: “We lacked belief and I didn’t feel for one second that it was a team or group that ever believed they could come here and get a result really. You can lose football matches but there are ways of losing and I just felt we looked at times powder puff.“We were never in the game. We didn’t deserve anything just from our general approach and body language and the way we went about it. The [winless] run is the run. But you need to bring a certain something about you as a group.“Today what concerns me, what angers me, frustrates me, and makes me hugely disappointed was we didn’t show that. We just rolled over. If you perform like we did today, you ain’t collecting enough points to stay in this division, no chance.”Asked about his future, Parker, who led Burnley to promotion last season, said: “That’s out of my hands. I have the utmost support from the ownership, from everyone at the football club. I’m fully committed and I feel like everyone at the football club is as well. We’re all hurting, we’re all disappointed but we’ll keep going.”Brighton began the day in 14th position after picking up three points from 18 available during December, while Burnley had collected two from a possible 30 dating back to October.Charalampos Kostoulas, who made his first Premier League start as part of four changes fromTuesday’s 2-2 draw at West Ham, was denied a 10th-minute opener by a marginal offside.Brighton continued to be the dominant side and edged ahead in the 29th minute with their first attempt on target. After Ayari’s effort from the edge of the penalty area deflected off Kostoulas, the ball broke kindly for Rutter to slam home his second goal of the season into the bottom-left corner from a tight angle.View image in fullscreenYasin Ayari doubles Brighton’s lead just after half-time.Photograph: Simon Dack/TPI/ShutterstockBurnley, who made three changes from a3-1 midweek loss to Newcastle, had failed to win any of their previous 39 matches when conceding first in the Premier League, but did threaten an equaliser in first-half added time when Lucas Pires’s low shot was repelled by the left leg of the goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.Brighton doubled their advantage within two minutes of the restart. The Burnley midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu conceded possession on the edge of his own area, allowing Ayari to sidestep Bashir Humphreys and drill an angled finish into the bottom-left corner.Kostoulas thumped straight at the Burnley keeper, Martin Dubravka, before Burnley almost pulled one back in the 67th minute. After Verbruggen flapped at Pires’s corner from the right, Tchaouna nodded towards the unguarded net, only for Ferdi Kadioglu to produce a superb last-ditch clearance by heading the ball against the crossbar.Quick GuideKey factsShow• James Milner (pictured after the game with Fabian Hürzeler) has now made a Premier League appearance in each of the last 25 calendar years since 2002, the longest such run.

They qualified for a third successive World Cup with ease and forced a draw in a friendly against Brazil in November, yet their football is infected with fear. To watch them play is to experience a dystopian world in which imagination has been outlawed. In the end, they went out of the Cup of Nations on Saturday because their self-doubt proved even stronger than Malian self-destructiveness.The Mali goalkeeper Djigui Diarra took the plaudits but this was a game Tunisia should never have lost. For over an hour and a half they played against 10. They took the lead in the 89th minute. Twice they led in the shootout. And somehow they still lost, undermined by their own unwillingness to take the game on. If they had only played, they would surely have won but as so often before, Tunisia did not just play. They squabbled and spoiled, feigned injury and moaned, and every so often forgot themselves, played a handful of passes and looked the decent side that they really should be.Mali 1-1 Tunisia (Mali 3-2 on pens): Africa Cup of Nations last 16 – liveRead moreThey finally took the lead in the 89th minute thanks to Firas Chaouat’s deft back-header but, almost immediately, Yassine Meriah handled a free-kick in the box and Lassine Sinayoko converted the resultant penalty. And Tunisia were never going to score twice.Tunisia are cursed by an awareness of their own history, of the fact that they were the first African side to win a game at a World Cup, and the sense that they are not perhaps quite what they were. They may have dropped just two points from 10 games in World Cup qualifying – they have been drawn with the Netherlands, Japan and Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania in Mexico and the US – but doubt is always lurking, ready to beset them. Last month’s group stage exit at the Arab Cup dispelled whatever optimism had begun to build over the previous year, and their coach Sami Trabelsi came into this tournament under pressure.In the group, it was the defeat by Nigeria that stood out, a couple of late goals reducing the deficit but not the impression they’d been outplayed in a 3-2 defeat. Trabelsi started with a back three for the only time other than that Brazil game. That may be a reasonable approach for trying to nullify a side he believes to be technically superior to his own, but there seemed little reason for such negativity against this Nigeria. The impression was of a manager feeling the pressure, fearing just the sort of humbling defeat his side ended up suffering.Quick GuideGueye double takes Senegal into last eightShowA double from the midfielder Pape Gueye enabled Senegal to come from behind and ease past Sudan 3-1 to become the first side to book a place in the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals.Senegal were behind after six minutes of their last-16 clash at the Grande Stade de Tanger but Gueye (pictured with his man-of-the-match trophy) scored two goals before half-time and the 17-year-old Ibrahima Mbaye added a third 13 minutes from the end. Senegal, the 2021 Cup of Nations winners, are the second-ranked team in Africa and, despite conceding early, showed their quality and strength to win in comfortable fashion.Sudan took a surprise lead with a classy goal when the Australian-based Aamir Abdallah, who plays in the state league in Victoria, cut inside the much vaunted Senegal defence and curled a left footed effort wide of Édouard Mendy.It was a shock setback for the highly fancied Senegal but they quickly assumed control of the game, dominating possession and fighting their way back to lead at the break.Nicolas Jackson had a point-blank effort expertly stopped by the Sudan goalkeeper Monged Elneel but a minute later Senegal were level when Sadio Mané pinched possession in midfield from Abuaagla Abdalla and fed Gueye, who stuck his effort into the corner of the goal.Ismaïla Sarr was brought down in the area five minutes later but the penalty award was overturned when the video assistant referee system showed Sarr was offside in the buildup. Sarr then had the ball in the net in the 43rd minute but was again denied by an offside call before his run set up Gueye’s second, feeding Jackson, who turned the ball back to the edge of the area, where Gueye side-footed it in with precision.The substitute Mbaye got the third in the 77th minute to become, three weeks before his 18th birthday, the second youngest scorer in Cup of Nations history as Mané was again the provider.ReutersPhotograph: Amr Abdallah Dalsh/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The back four returned for the draw against Tanzania that secured Tunisia’s progress against Mali. It was paired with a five-man midfield of which the kindest thing to say, perhaps, would be that it was picked for industry rather than creativity. Such attacking width as there was, was offered by Burnley’s Hannibal Mejbri and Augbsurg’s Ismaël Gharbi, neither of whom could be described as natural wingers. It was enough to have neutrals pining for Wahbi Khazri. Not until the 70th minute did they finally switch to a more orthodox 4-3-3.Negativity saps at them, as it has for at least two decades. Every contact brings protest, every throw-in is contested, every opportunity to break up play is taken. Against a team better than them it would be frustrating but understandable. Against a team like this Mali it was incomprehensible and, ultimately, self-defeating. At one point midway through the first half, Tunisia had a throw about 20 yards from the goalline, but were so lacking in ambition they sent only one player into the box. At times, it’s as though they would rather win a scrap than a football match. If they just played, they would surely win more than they do, but fear of defeat curdles everything.Here the onus was thrust on them to take the game to Mali with the 26th-minute dismissal of the skittish Woyo Coulibaly for treading on Hannibal’s achilles, a moment of foolishness that would have been baffling if it wasn’t so in keeping with the history of Malian football. The oddity of this particular Mali is the disjunction between their tactical approach – suited to sitting deep and playing on the break against bigger sides – and their psychological makeup – entirely lacking in the belief they can actually beat a big side.Which perhaps explains why all four of their games at this Cup of Nations were level at 90 minutes. But that only makes it more frustrating that, even against 10 men, Tunisia were unwilling or unable to take the initiative against them. The anxiety that entraps this Tunisia is debilitating and hard to explain – but that’s the way it’s always been.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Mali football teamTunisia football teamAfrica Cup of NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Another 15-16 years I’d say. If it happens, it happens. But I’ll be around for a very long time. And I’m here to win.”With this victory, Littler became only the fourth player to retain a PDC title, following on from Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson. And while it wasn’t quite as sweet as last year’s win, he was clearly delighted with the result as well as his 106 three-dart average.“Nothing will ever beat a first world title for anyone in any sport, that’s the first time you’ve done it,” said Littler. “But this was just all about retaining it and adding my name to the list of world champions to go back to back.”“It’s very special. We’ve got to keep going and adding more titles, we can’t stop here.”Asked about the match, Littler added: “I was expecting everything. I was expecting Gian to throw the kitchen sink at me. Obviously he did that in the first set. He could have gone 2-0 up, but from there I don’t really know what happened. He missed a few doubles here and there, and I just had to pounce on him.”Littler also revealed that he was so locked in he didn’t realise that he hadn’t eaten all day until he arrived at Alexander Palace.“I woke up at 11/12 o’clock, and had a good sleep. But actually I turned up to the venue and realised I hadn’t met anything all day. So I got a margarita pizza and scrammed that.”Asked about being booed after beating Rob Cross, Littler added: “Darts is a funny old sport. That’s what happens on the day, we bounced back from that, the crowd are back on my side, I’m world champion, there is nothing more I can say.”Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipDartsnewsShareReuse this content"

This might not have been how they chose it but it is safe to say the desired effect was achieved, a try by Arthur Green in the last minute snatching victory from the jaws of, if not defeat, one of the more dispiriting draws inflicted on a home team.It was Bath’s fifth try, but their first points since the 20th minute, after they had blown Exeter away with the reaction to theirdefeat here last Saturday by Northampton.

Third in the table the Chiefs may have been, but any side would have suffered at the hands of Bath on their own turf the week after that humbling by something approximating to a Northampton second XV. The home team duly claimed the season’s fastest bonus point, four tries notched up in the first 20 minutes.No one was calling last week’s Bath team less than full strength. And yet in came players of the calibre of Santiago Carreras, Ted Hill, Guy Pepper and Cameron Redpath – the type other clubs could build a team around. Then there were a couple of youngsters. Vilikesa Sela and Enoch Opoku-Gyamfi are not on many people’s radars, the latter still a teenager – a 150kg teenager – but remember the names.View image in fullscreenGreg Fisilau continues Exeter’s fightback with their third try.Photograph: Simon King/ProSports/ShutterstockBeno Obano was one luminary who did play last week but he, like pretty much everyone in the Bath pack, burst into this game as if he meant it. His was the first try, a pick-and-charge too many for Exeter, before Alfie Barbeary – another restored to the team – did much the same for the second.Carreras finished in superb style after Louie Hennessey’s break for the third. Hennessey was on for Arundell, who was being checked after that aerial challenge by Ridl. The Chiefs winger had scored his first Premiership try last Sunday, but this time overexuberance cost him any further involvement. Bath had the bonus point before the 20 minutes of his red card was up, Ben Spencer putting Ollie Lawrence over after an attacking lineout.Quick GuidePrem roundup: Northampton thump Quins but Dingwall injuredShowNorthampton'sdirector of rugby, Phil Dowson,  eased concerns over Fraser Dingwall after the England centre was knocked out in Saturday's 66-21 Gallagher Prem demolition ofHarlequinsat Franklin's Gardens. Dingwall was carried from the pitch on a stretcher after his head was caught on the wrong side during a tackle on Kieran Treadwell in the 39th minute, but he was able to give a thumbs-up as he left the field.\"Fraser's good,\" Dowson said. \"Obviously he's a bit shaken up and he was unconscious for a bit, but the medics were around him fast and are looking after him so he's going through the right procedure.

How the momentum can shift in these contests. The Chiefs sent a few of them to the corner, one by Henry Slade to five metres, and from two they secured a foothold with tries in the last 10 minutes of the half, by Joseph Dweba and Olly Woodburn. Slade converted both, one from each touchline.Bath thought they had wrestled back control when Spencer was in support after Redpath’s break in the 48th minute, but Opoku-Gyamfi, who was hobbling at the time, had blocked a defender. It was not until the final quarter that the game burst back into life and it was Exeter who forced the issue.They have a number of exciting young talents themselves, none more so than Greg Fisilau. He scored the Chiefs’ third try with less than a quarter of an hour to go. Then it was the No 8’s break five minutes later that set up the attack from which came the first of their two bonus points. Immanuel Feyi-Waboso needs less introduction. The whole Rec knew the outcome when he found himself out wide with one to beat at the end of a sustained attack. Slade’s conversion, from the touchline again, drew the teams level.And so the stage was set. “It’s like when you watch The Great Escape,” said Rob Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby. “I’m going to have to watch the game tonight, and I know Steve McQueen isn’t going to get over the barbed wire, but I’ll still have to watch it.“I’ll watch those pick-and-goes and think someone’s going to drop it. I know they don’t, but it was compelling viewing.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyBathExeterRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Three in five Brits online now encounter the site, up from a third in 2023,according to Ofcom.Its popularity is rising fastest with younger internet users. It is now the sixth most visited organisation of any kind by UK users aged between 18 and 24, up from 10th a year earlier. More than three-quarters of that cohort now visit it.The rapid growth marks a shift in the site’s standing, with its numerous forums once seen as arenas for hostile exchanges between largely anonymous users. The UK is a boom market for the platform, with the second largest user base behind the US, according to company records.A series of factors are behind its rise. However, a change in Google’s search algorithms last year to prioritise helpful content from discussion forumsappears to have been a significant driver.A recent deal with Google that allows the company to train its AI model on Reddit’s content also appears to have provided a boost. Reddit is the most-cited source for Google AI overviews, which is likely to see more people directed to its forums. It hasa similar deal with OpenAI, which owns the most popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT.The company believes it is also benefiting from shifting internet habits, as younger users seek out human-generated reviews and opinions on issues including parenting, skincare and sports.More than half its UK users are women. Internal company research suggests 71% of women on Reddit in the UK have a personal interest in skincare, beauty and cosmetics, prompting higher traffic for specific UK Reddit forums on those issues, known as subreddits.“Reddit started with this perception, rightfully so, for a male skew – gaming and tech as the anchor,” said Jen Wong, Reddit’s chief operating officer, who said she spent a lot of time in the UK gardening subreddit. “Reddit has become very diverse – it is gender-balanced in the UK now … what’s interesting is that one in three are gen Z women on the platform.“Gen Z are very open to looking online for advice around these life stage moments, like leaving home and renting for the first time, which happens a little bit later for some of this generation. It’s a very safe place to ask questions about balancing a cheque book, or how to pay for a wedding.”UK subreddits on pregnancy and parenting have doubled in size over the last year.There is also a growing trend for supporters of Premier League clubs to watch games while logged on to their team’s subreddit. The Premier League subreddit has grown by more than a billion views in the last year, according to company records.It also appears to be a popular discussion ground for women’s football, which has less dedicated coverage than the men’s game. There has been a doubling of views for subreddits covering Arsenal’s women’s team and the Lionesses in the last year.Wong said the company was focused on convincing users to come straight to the platform, rather than via a search result. She also touted Reddit as an antidote to AI-generated content.“You see these accidents of AI slop and AI advice – Reddit doesn’t have that,” she said. “It’s not clean. It’s messy, in that it has lots of different pieces of advice that you have to sift through. It’s not manicured down to one answer for you, but that’s kind of the point.”Amid the rise in prominence of the site, the UK government has launched its own account,UKGovNews, in the last year. It has posted about the cost of living, rail ticket prices and immigration. Steve Reed, the housing secretary, recently held an “ask me anything” session.Confrontational exchanges are still easy to find on the platform. Wong said it was part of the site’s culture but that all subreddits had their own rules and moderators.“Reddit is really honest and I think that’s one of the things that makes Reddit,” she said. “Every person who joins Reddit is a moderator, because you get to vote up or down on a post – and a down vote is incredibly powerful. ‘Be civil’ is one of the most common rules in communities.”Explore more on these topicsRedditSocial mediaInternetDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.During a golden sunset in Memphis in May, Sharon Wilson pointed a thermal imaging camera at Elon Musk’s flagship datacentre to reveal a planetary threat her eyes could not. Free from pollution controls, the gas-fired turbines that power the world’s biggest AI supercomputer were pumping invisible fumes into the Tennessee sky.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“It was jaw-dropping,” said Wilson, a former oil and gas worker from Texas who has documented methane releases for more than a decade and estimates xAI’s Colossus datacentre was spewing more of the planet-heating gas than a large power plant. “Just an unbelievable amount of pollution.”That same week, the facility’s core product was running riot on news feeds. Musk’s maverick chatbot, Grok,repeated a conspiracy theorythat “white genocide” was taking place in South Africa when asked about topics as unrelated as baseball and scaffolding. The posts were quickly deleted but Grok has gone on topraise Hitler,push far-right ideologiesand make false claims.View image in fullscreenGrok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, has previously praised Hitler and repeated conspiracy theories about ‘white genocide’.Photograph: Algi Febri Sugita/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“It’s a horrible, horrible waste,” said Wilson, the director of campaign group Oilfield Witness, pointing to Grok-generated images ofNazi Mickey Mouseas an example of what fossil gas was being burned to produce. “What useful purpose does this serve?”Wilson is not alone in asking this question. Scientists are watching the AI boom with unease as it pollutes the natural world with carbon and the digital world with dangers ranging fromdodgy health mythstodeepfake pornography targeting children.Some experts fear datacentres may derail the shift to a clean economy, adding an unnecessary hurdle to the quixotic task of keeping the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F). Others are sanguine about the energy costs, arguing they pale in comparison not just to polluting industries, but also to the technology’s power to reshape society.How big a threat is AI to the climate? And could it help more than it harms?When Hannah Daly ran models for the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris and then became a professor of sustainable energy at University College Cork in Ireland, she spent little time worrying about the carbon cost of computers. Cars, cows and home heating were among the knotty problems draining the carbon budget; emissions from digital services were small and relatively flat.But in Ireland, the computational hunger for energy has reached levels that are impossible to ignore. Datacentres guzzle one-fifth of the country’s electricity and are projected to devour nearly one-third of it within a few years. The rapid expansion of chip-filled warehouses, which have sprung up faster than the electricity grid can handle, led to them being effectively banned from grid connections in 2021.The trajectory of “enormous, exponential growth” is what is so worrying, said Daly. “I’m not sure whether Ireland is a real outlier or a harbinger of what’s to come. But it’s definitely a cautionary tale.”Datacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but may soon demand much more. Their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF, while the IEA projects datacentres will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.Some of the demand is being met through long-term agreements to buy renewable power – supporting the expansion of clean energy even when the electricity powering the facility is dirty – while some tech firms have signed deals to use nuclear energy.But for the near future, fossil fuels are set to dominate supply. China’s datacentres are clustered in its coal-heavy east. In the US, where natural gas is expected to generate most of the electricity in datacentres over the next decade, the Trump administration used them to justify burning more coal. “Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to … winning the AI race,” energy secretary Chris Wright said in September when announcing a $625m (£467m) investment package.View image in fullscreenAn Amazon datacentre in Didcot, Oxfordshire.Photograph: Horst Friedrichs/AlamyIn Ireland, which is building terminals to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and power plants to burn it, the datacentre boom has offset climate gains from renewable expansion in the power sector, according to ananalysisDaly conducted for Friends of the Earth Ireland last year. Poorer countries may not be immune, either. Cheap solar has begun to displace coal at a remarkable rate in Pakistan, but datacentres are poised to pick up the spare capacity of idling power plants after the government announced it would devote 2GW of power to AI and bitcoin.“This idea that the lower cost of renewables alone will drive decarbonisation – it’s not enough,” said Daly. “Because if there’s a huge source of energy demand that wants to grow, it will land on these stranded fossil fuel assets.”Does this mean using chatbots to draft emails, write essays and plan holidays endangers the planet? Tech companies have resisted pressure to provide detailed data on their AI energy footprints, but popular guesstimates hover about 0.2 to 3 Watt-hours (Wh) for a simple text query and rise considerably for “deep research” and video production. In a blogpost in July, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, claimed a ChatGPT query uses as little energy as running a lightbulb for a couple of minutes, in line with a recent report from Google on the median text prompt to its AI assistant, Gemini.The figures are negligible compared to activities such as flying, eating meat, or driving a car. Still, sceptics worry about the sheer scale of the technology – ChatGPT claims to have several hundred million weekly users just three years after its release – and the fervour with which companies have shoved it into every aspect of digital life. Google controls an estimated 90% of the global search engine market and has forced generative AI on to its results page. The rise of AI agents and behind-the-scenes services is expected to add to the background hum.“What I’m worried about is that we’re deploying AI in such a way that we don’t have a good idea of the energy use,” said Sasha Luccioni, climate lead at AI company Hugging Face, who has grown frustrated by “selective disclosures” from big companies that obscure the real climate impact of their products. “We’re essentially operating on the hypothesis that it’s not a problem – or that if it is a problem it will somehow be solved – instead of getting ahead of it.”What if AI could pay off its energy debts by saving carbon in other parts of the economy? That is the thesis put forward in an IEA report in April, which argued existing AI applications could cut emissions by far more than datacentres produced. Apaperby researchers at the London School of Economics and Systemiq came to a similar conclusion in June after modelling scenarios in which AI would help to integrate solar and wind into the electricity grid, identify alternative proteins that mimic meat, improve battery composition in electric cars and nudge people to make climate-friendly choices.“AI can accelerate the deployment of those clean technologies by basically accelerating their position along the curve of innovation and adoption,” said co-author Roberta Pierfederici, a policy fellow at the LSE’s Grantham Institute.The projected carbon savings carry large uncertainties – greater efficiency can lead to more use, the IEA warns, and rebound effects may undercut the gains, such as self-driving cars undermining public transport – butexamplesalready exist. Google says AI has helped it cut cooling in datacentres by 40%. Spain’s Iberdrola says AI has optimised wind turbine maintenance and performance, increasing operational efficiency by 25%. France’s Engie says it has reduced downtime on solar farms by using AI to detect faults.Because other sectors are so polluting, the researchers say, AI would only need to cut their emissions by a small fraction to cover the carbon cost of its computing, which a recentstudyestimated to be 0.1-0.2% of global emissions, and rising. “In the power sector we are already seeing the results,” said Pierfederici. “Whereas the meat sector is not there yet.”Clean tech advocates are not the only ones to have noticed AI’s transformative potential.When Holly and Will Alpine decided to quit their jobs at Microsoft last year, they knew they were throwing away a good deal. The married millennial couple enjoyed US tech salaries through their positions in the company’s responsible AI and sustainability teams, with close colleagues and work that gave them a sense of purpose. Will had been among the early voices pushing to tackle the energy cost of datacentres.But Microsoft’s work for oil and gas clients troubled the pair, and they started to grow more concerned about the emissions it enabled than the ones it produced. In 2019, the company announced a partnership with ExxonMobil with the potential to expand production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day. That same year, it began a digital project with Chevron that the oil company says has cut 30 days off its deepwater well planning process. As more deals emerged, the Alpines began to push their employer for answers.“The response from the company was often pointing back to their own operational footprint, which is not relevant,” said Holly Alpine, who left the company with Will to campaign for the tech industry to tackle its enabled emissions. “After a four-year internal advocacy campaign, where we got a lot of promises but most were unfulfilled, we realised that internal pressure was not enough.”View image in fullscreenThe chief executive of oil company Saudi Aramco recently said the company had embedded AI ‘in everything’.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe IEA estimates that AI could boost technically recoverable oil and gas reserves by 5% and cut the cost of a deepwater offshore project by 10%. Big oil is even more bullish. “Artificial intelligence is, ultimately, within the industry, going to be the next fracking boom,” Mike Sommers, head of the American Petroleum Institute,told Axios. Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said the company had embedded AI “in everything” inan interview with Bloomberg Televisionearlier this year. The world’s biggest oil company doubled its technology spending from 2023 to 2024, according to Nasser, and the widespread adoption of AI has “increased productivity, and with that, the number of wells”.At the same time, the oil and gas industry says AI can cut its carbon intensity, for instance by analysing satellite data to spot methane leaks. But even here, critics say there is a gap between digital insights and corporate actions. Wilson, who saw “giant clouds of gas escaping everywhere” during a recent field trip to the Permian Basin, said the industry’s sophisticated network of satellites have achieved little because leaks are only a small problem compared to intentional releases of methane.“They are using this as an excuse to delay action,” said Wilson. “Watching methane from space is not stopping methane.”Perhaps even more concerning than the expansion of fossil fuel supply is the effect on consumption. Generative AI adverts outperform human ones, astudyfound in October, and the ease with which they can be made slashes the cost of encouraging consumption. The marketing industry, already familiar with hyperpersonalised adverts and streamlined shopping, is preparing for AI agents that could buy presents and book flights on a customer’s behalf. Tui, Europe’s biggest travel operator, says it isinvesting heavilyin AI as people turn to ChatGPT to book their holidays.“The narrative is really focused on this false comparison between the energy used to run the technology and the positive use cases,” said Alpine. “But it is dangerous to omit the negative use cases.”Some voices are calling to hit pause, at least until better rules are in place. In October, the UN’s special rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking watercalled for a moratoriumon the development of new datacentres, citing the damaging environmental impacts. In December, a coalition of more than 230 environmental groups in the USdemanded a national moratoriumuntil they were regulated. Ireland’s utility commission has lifted its de facto ban on grid connections, but said 80% of a datacentre’s annual electricity consumption must eventually come from new renewable projects.Others have called to push the sector to do good. Spain, which is the only country to mention AI in a piece of climate legislation, obliges the government to promote digitalisation that can help decarbonise the economy. Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the Paris climate agreement, has suggestedtaxing AIto generate funds needed to stop the planet from heating.The Alpines, who say they are not anti-AI but just want “reasonable guardrails” on the technology, are pushing for the EU’s upcoming AI bill to classify fossil fuels as a high-risk application of the technology. They also want to get investors to consider enabled emissions in a company’s ratings on environment, social and governance metrics.Google and xAI did not respond to a request for comment. OpenAI said it gives considerable thought to the best use of its computing power, supports efforts with partners to meet sustainability goals and believes AI will be instrumental in tackling climate change.Microsoft said the energy transition is complex and requires moving forward in a principled manner, with technology having an important role to play in helping the industry decarbonise. “That requires balancing the energy needs and industry practices of today, while inventing and deploying those of tomorrow,” a spokesperson said.Luccioni said that, rather than panic about AI, people should pressure companies to make tools that are frugal by design.“Maybe I’m a little naive, but I still believe that AI can do good in terms of fighting the climate crisis – designing the next generation of batteries, tracking deforestation, predicting hurricanes,” she said. “There are so many good things for which we can be using it – and instead we’re creating social media websites filled with AI slop while datacentres are getting powered by diesel generators.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are thehours-long, hundred-person lineswrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.On a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot forTeslacar charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.The novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsiteanti-Musk protests,noise complaints from neighborsand customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.We still don’t really know what Elon Musk’s Doge actually didRead moreGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month thathe was leaving the Tesla Dinerto focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chefremoved his previous Instagram postsreferencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.Greenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.Greenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Dinerfaced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Muskmade what rights groupshave described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.‘Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging’Musk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA sinceat least 2018as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”The diner received immense media coverage upon opening butpoor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.A display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.Tesla postedon X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.On social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.The diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.As the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTeslaElon MuskLos AngelesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump talks peace but he is a man of warSimon TisdallThe world will be anxious, and rightly so. For a man so bent on a peace prize, Trump appears to revel in conflictSat 3 Jan 2026 09.40 ESTFirst published on Sat 3 Jan 2026 09.07 ESTShareThe overthrow andreported captureby invading US forces of Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s hardline socialist president, will send a shiver of fear and consternation around the world. The coup is illegal, unprovoked and regionally and globally destabilising. It upends international norms, ignores sovereign territorial rights, and potentially creates an anarchic situation inside Venezuela itself.It is chaos made policy. But this is the world we now live in – the world according toDonald Trump.The direct attack on Venezuela marks an extraordinary, dangerous assertion of unfettered US power and comes in the same week that Trump threatened military strikes against another unpopular anti-western regime:that of Iran. It followsmonthsof escalating US military, economic and political pressure on Maduro, including lethal maritime attacks on the boats of alleged drug traffickers.Trump claims to be acting to prevent illegal narcotics flowing into the US viaVenezuelaand to halt an alleged influx of “criminal” migrants. In an echo of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, he is also accused of coveting Venezuela’s huge oil and gas resources – suspicions reinforced by repeated, illegal US seizures of Venezuelan oil tankers.But Trump’s primary motives appear to be personal animosity directed at Maduro, and a desire to revive the 19th-century Monroe doctrine bycreating a US sphere of influenceand dominance throughout the west.Regional leaders, including Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, who has clashed with Trump in recent months, greeted the coup with outrage and alarm; not least, perhaps, because they fear they too could become victims of Washington’s aggressive new hegemony. Cuba’s leftwing government has particular cause for concern. It relies heavily on Venezuela’s regime for cheap energy and political and economic support.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state,has made no secretof his wish to see regime change in Havana. In Panama, too, anxiety levels will be running high. Trump has previously threatened military action there, over control of the Panama canal. Indeed, the reported capture of Maduro recalls the 1989 US invasion of Panama and the toppling and arrest of its then dictator, Manuel Noriega.Authoritarian, anti-democratic regimes around the world will be carefully watching Trump’s next steps, as will Washington’s democratic allies. Iran condemned the coup. It has good reason to be fearful. ButVladimir Putin, Russia’s president, may not be totally displeased by the defenestration of his Venezuelan ally.Trump’s unprovoked resort to violence is not so very different from Putin’s actions in invading Ukraine. Both have illegally attacked a neighbouring country and sought to remove its leadership. For China’s Xi Jinping, whose forces werelast weekpractising military action against the “separatists” of Taiwan, Trump has just set a precedent he may one day gladly follow.Trump’s coup is of great concern to Britain, the EU and western democracies. They should, and must, unequivocally condemn it. It directly challenges the rules and principles of the international order they hold dear. The US has once again ignored the UN and traditional methods of addressing inter-state grievances. And it is acting with apparently scant regard or thought for what happens next in Venezuela.The Caracas government has been decapitated, but other senior members of the regime appear still to be in place. They are urging resistance and, potentially, retaliation against the US. There are unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties. If a power vacuum develops, public ordercould collapse, sparking civil war or a possible military coup. And it is unclear whether the latest US military action has ended, or may escalate further.The idea that exiled opposition leaders, such as the 2025 Nobel peace prizewinnerMaría Corina Machado, will swiftly return and that full democracy will now be restored is naive. The coming days will be critical. And it’s all down to Trump.Trump’s reckless action should finally lay to rest his always misleading characterisation of himself as a “global peacemaker”. It’s high time Keir Starmer and other European leaders publicly recognise him for what he is – a global warmaker, a universal menace.Each time he blunders noisily into conflict zones, such as Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Palestine, setting deadlines, issuing ultimatums, picking favourites and monetising misery, the quest for just and lasting peace is set back.Little wonder peace is elusive. And bizarrely, even while posing as a disinterested peacemaker and non-interventionist, Trump simultaneously wages war on the world. The US conductedrecord numbers of air strikesin the Middle East and Africa last year, surveys show.Since returning to office a year ago, peace-loving Trump has bombed Yemen, carelessly killing numerous civilians after loosening rules of engagement; bombed Nigeria, to counter-productive effect; bombed Somalia, Iraq and Syria; and bombedIran, where he mendaciously exaggerated the success of US strikes on nuclear facilities. He even refuses to rule out bombing Greenland, a sovereign territory of Nato ally Denmark.What’s going on inside Trump’s head? A benign interpretation is that in matters of war and peace, he has no idea what he is doing – no strategy, no clue – and makes up policy as he goes, depending on how he feels.The sinister interpretation says he knows exactly what he’s at, that more and worse is to come. Like previous second-term presidents who ran out of road domestically, Trump finds the world stage offers greater possibilities for the exercise of power and ego. He is building a legacy in blood.Trump’s irresponsible, dangerously erratic behaviour is getting measurably worse. His Venezuela “success” may encourage him to attempt more and bigger, unhinged outrages. Like Mark Antony minus the toga and brains, he struts and preens, cries havoc! and lets slip the dogs of war.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS foreign policyVenezuelaVladimir PutinBenjamin NetanyahuVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

If you live in the US, you can find this out very quickly: there’s a centralizedwebsiteprovided by the US Department of Justice that lets you search a name or location in seconds.This doesn’t mean that everyonefound liablefor sexual abuse comes up, of course. They have to have been convicted of certain sex offenses in a criminal, rather than civil, court to be put on the registry.Now let’s say you want to check whether your potential date has ever been found guilty of domestic violence. Good luck with that. There isn’t a similar sort of centralized registry and you’d have to look through various court records.If you live in Tennessee, however,that situation has just changed: the state has created the first registry in the US to track repeat domestic violence offenders. Anyone convicted of more than one domestic violence offense after 1 January will beregistered in a public databasemaintained by the Tennessee bureau of investigation. The new legislation, Savanna’s Law, is named for Savanna Puckett, 22, who was shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend, James Jackson Conn, in 2022. Conn, who also suffocated Puckett’s dog, had a history of domestic violence and stalking.The fact that Tennessee, consistentlyin the top 10 statesfor domestic violence homicides, is taking this issue seriously should be applauded. The new law, which was passed with bipartisan support, is very much a step in the right direction. It raises awareness of intimate partner violence and signals to survivors that the state is on their side.Nevertheless, it’s important to bear in mind the limitations to a registry like this. Domestic violence cases areunderreportedand can be notoriously difficult to prosecute – so a large number of offenders will never end up in the system.While well-intentioned, it should also be noted that an easily searchable registry of serious offenders isn’t always an unalloyed good. Various analyses, for example, have found that many state registries that keep track of sex offenders arefilledwith errors. Some criticsarguethat the registry system is overly expensive and inefficient and diverts resources away from survivors and prevention strategies. And, in the case of domestic violence, it’s possible that some survivors might actually end up on the registry: perpetuators of abuse frequently weaponize the law to paint theirvictims as abusers. It’s certainly possible to envisage a situation where someone fighting back against their abuser ends up convicted of abuse, and put on a registry, themselves.All that said, it’s good to see a red state making history in a positive way.More Norwegian women reporting abuse amid royal family rape trialThe 28-year-old son of the Norwegian crown princess is due to stand trial next month for charges including rape, domestic abuse and filming without consent.

But New York’s new mayor offers an alternative to more apathy: hopeSat 3 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 07.40 ESTShareOn 1 January, to mark hisinauguration as mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdanithrew a block party. As he was sworn in outside city hall in front of a crowd of a few thousand of us, a nearby street in Manhattan was closed to traffic so that tens of thousands more could gather to watch the historic moment live on enormous screens. The weather – a cloudless blue sky and arctic winds – felt somehow fitting: a licence to dream and a warning against complacency.Mayors don’t usually take office amid such a festival atmosphere. A smaller, more exclusive event is normally adequate. But a key feature of Mamdani’s rise has been the desire for mass participation in politics. There was no chance this day was going to pass without an open-invitation party.Throughout his mayoral campaign, Mamdani found novel ways to include people in his movement. It began in November 2024 with aviral videotaking to the streets to interview people in parts of Queens and the Bronx that had swung heavily to Donald Trump in the election. As his popularity grew, he inspired an army of volunteers for canvassing and door-knocking whom he eulogised in his speeches. In August of last year, he organised acity-wide scavenger huntthat thousands of people took part in. There was a football tournament not long after. After his victory in November, he immediately opened a jobs portal where people could submit their CV and area of interest,prompting 74,000 applications. In mid-December, heinvited New Yorkersto speak with him about their problems and concerns in 15-minute slots, across 12 hours. No longer is politics “something that is done to us”, hedeclared in his victory speech. “Now, it is something that we do.”These forms of participation are not trivial publicity stunts: they are as much a part of Mamdani’s rejection of the old neoliberal consensus as his universalist welfare policies are. For decades, major political parties across the west subscribed to a negative image of politics, in which government’s declared role was to get out of the way of private business and to help people only begrudgingly. In this framing, receiving welfare could feel like a sign of individual failure and participating in electoral politics like a waste of time. Political leaders themselves stoked disillusionment and suspicion toward their power. “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help,’” President Ronald Reaganfamously declared. Former British prime minister Tony Blair felt compelled to say in 2000: “I don’t feel myself a politician even now.” As election turnoutsfell or stalled, and political parties shed their partisan purpose and their memberships, a generalised feeling of depoliticisation and apathy set in. By 2006, the political scientist Peter Mair couldaptly describegoverning western democracies as “ruling the void”.Mamdani’s remarkable achievement is for seeing that this “void” is full of interesting voices, overlapping interests and shared yearnings – and for unashamedly stating that the government should be here to help them. His project is, in this sense, to transform the role politics plays in people’s lives.Enacting his universalist welfare reforms – free childcare, free buses for all and a rent freeze on all rent-stabilised apartments, free from any stigma about who “needs” it – is one part of the challenge. The other part is to continuously explore ways to include people in politics. It is a far harder task when governing than when campaigning, but one that Mamdani and his team see clearly. “I don’t think the campaign can end,” Mamdanisaid in a recent interview. “The same people who got us to this point, we want to keep moving forward with them.”View image in fullscreen‘A key feature of Mamdani’s rise has been the desire for mass participation in politics.’ New Yorkers watch a live broadcast of Zohran Mamdani’s speech.Photograph: Guerin Charles/ABACA/ShutterstockThe inauguration event felt like both a triumphant culmination and a symbolic continuation of the campaign. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez andBernie Sandersprovided the supporting cast, as they had at various moments in the mayoral election. There were chants of “tax the rich”, the unofficial soundtrack of the campaign. Volunteer leads were given the bulk of the seats, and every attendant received a pamphlet with “a message from the mayor” that paid exclusive homage to their efforts. “We are able to gather together only because more than 104,000 of our friends and neighbours … gave their time and energy to this movement,” it read. For the finale, Mamdani’s closing speech provided both a love letter to New York and an ode to the power of collective action, heralding “a new era” of “big government”. “If our campaign demonstrated that the people of New York yearn for solidarity, then let this government foster it,” he said.Mamdani is far from the first politician to seek to answer this yearning. Since the 2008 financial crash, spurred by social media and disillusionment with the major parties, various movements have arisen to meet this burgeoning desire for participation, this appetite for alternatives, across the political spectrum. Even the likes of Trump and Nigel Farage – with their mass rallies and social media fluency – give their supporters a feeling of inclusion and an appearance of an alternative. But the negative image of politics, which longs to rule a void, persists. Keir Starmer’suniform unpopularityoffers a warning of where this approach can lead.In New York, Zohran Mamdani showed how it’s done: ‘identity politics’ can win elections | Nesrine MalikRead moreUnlike Mamdani, Starmer has assumed that people want less politics. Ashe explained in January 2024, after 14 years of Tory misrule, people wanted “a politics that treads a little lighter on all of our lives”, because “the thing about populism” is that it “needs your full attention … and that’s exhausting, isn’t it?” In this vision, the best prime minister is one who lets us go about our business in peace once again. But the intended quiet didn’t last long, and soon all sorts of noisy actors rushed in to fill that silent void.The assumption that people want less politics affirms the conflation of politics with disappointment, scandal and devious leadership, surrendering to the disillusionment of past decades. Mamdani has shown the opposite can be the case. Many people want more from politics, and more of it: a movement to believe in, work for, mobilise and socialise through – spurred by the dream of a collective life, not a quiet one. “It will be loud, it will be different,” Mamdani told the crowd. With the block party broadcasting his speech a few streets away, it sounded as if his words were echoing through the city. Even Manhattan’s imposing skyscrapers were standing to attention.Samuel Earle is a writer based in London and the author ofTory Nation: The Dark Legacy of the World’s Most Successful Political PartyExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionDonald TrumpNew YorkKeir StarmerNigel FarageUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But though incurable, it’s a disease that can be treatedSat 3 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 19.31 ESTShareA few days before he took his last, mercifully peaceful, breath, my husband, Ian Reinecke, looked at me intently and asked: “Is there anything going on in the world I need to know about?”“No, nothing,” I said as calmly as I could to the man with whom I had intensely discussed events in the world and at home for nearly 50 years.I could not be sure he wasn’t fishing for an answer. All week, the thrum of helicopters, accompanied by the scream of sirens, had filled the Bondi air. Sensitive people pick up the vibes, even when the details are opaque.In his last year, I could never be completely sure how much he was aware of. Some things he talked about seemed fanciful to me but turned out to be true. Right to the end, his intuition about people and events astonished me.But the antisemitic massacre atBondi beach, just a few hundred metres away from where he drifted in and out of consciousness, was too much. “Please keep the TV off,” I said to his carers. “Don’t talk to him about what happened.”He didn’t need to know that the place we had walked to several times a week, where he marvelled at nature’s beauty and laughed with amusing people, had been desecrated.After a year of feeling powerless in the face of hideous global events, this violent assault seemed like the last straw.At times during 2025, it felt to me that the world was losing its mind, that our private pain was echoed everywhere. We’d watch PBS News Hour most afternoons, a respite of sorts from the endless repeats of Antiques Roadshow that fill the dead air of hospital free-to-air TV.Americans are waking up. A grand reckoning awaits us | Robert ReichRead moreBut the distress of watching the dismantling of the America he had known and loved was palpable, the devastation of Gaza, the incomprehensible destruction of Ukraine, Sudan, the ascendancy of kleptocratic autocrats and endless climate disasters was almost too much to bear.The extraordinary world that came into existence with Victory in Europe Day, a month after Ian was born, was crumbling. It was a world that, for all its shortcomings, for 70 years had fostered unprecedented peace, prosperity and innovation, and had valued human rights and the rational rule of law and reason.It was as if in 2025 the cosmos had dementia – memory disappeared, talk and action were disinhibited, the same mistakes were repeated over and over, as once-humiliated men and their powerful acolytes sought revenge on the good people of the world.The axis of the globe shifted; nothing was quite as it had once seemed.Dementia comes in many varieties; each patient is affected differently. It’s not as simple as losing your memory, forgetting names, struggling for words. For some people, memory remains surprisingly robust, but tasks like putting on a pair of shoes become impossibly complex. Some become disinhibited and angry, confused and aggressive, others withdrawn and ashamed, some lose mobility, others can’t stop walking, some manage to create new neural pathways, others are trapped in a world of perpetual childhood or bombarded with hallucinations.When asked for the umpteenth time to do the memory test and draw a clock that says 10 past 11, some find a workaround from the humiliatingly impossible task of drawing a circle, writing the numbers in order, positioning hands. “I know you hate drawing the clock,” Ian’s insightful gerontologist said about a year ago, “but just one more time, for me, please.”The tension in the room rose as he took the pen and looked at the piece of paper. He then, with a smile, drew a perfect Apple Watch: the numbers clear 11:10. “What is this silly game?” he seemed to say, “you want a clock, I’ll give you one.”The brain, like human ingenuity, is almost infinite. There are almost always workarounds.But in a world overrun by oligarchs, autocrats and charismatic crazies, workarounds seem harder to find than ever.From the day the presidency changed in the US, the world entered a new order of absolutes. My way or the highway. Where an impossibly rich man could dance on a stage with a chainsaw, destruction and personal aggrandisement the aim.My sister died 10 years ago. Here’s what I wish I had known about dementia when she was alive | Jackie BaileyRead moreThe temptation is to give in to the wilful demolition of institutions. To ignore the deaths and mayhem, to think change is too hard, to retreat, to let the global chaos play out and reach its inevitable conclusion.But as Robert Reichwrote here recently, opposition begins small and grows until it becomes unstoppable. It has been seen everywhere, from the millions who protested in the No Kings rallies in the US, to the resounding endorsement of progressive democratic governments in country after country, to the sea of flowers at Bondi Pavilion.It doesn’t happen quickly, but, asIan McEwan demonstratesin his important novel What We Can Know, human beings have enormous capacity to muddle through even in the face of absurd human-made threats.After a year of regular medical appointments, tweaking drugs and monitoring vital symptoms, Ian’s highly skilled neurologist said, “I don’t need to see you for another year. Don’t let anyone tell you that these diseases can’t be treated. They can’t be cured but can be treated.”A year later, the next appointment was also set for 12 months. He had several more good years.There is a message in this.The worst excesses of human nature cannot be eradicated, like a disease we cannot yet cure. But with civic determination and good government, they can be treated and managed. It takes optimism, diligence and determination – not giving up.Dr Ian Reinecke AM died on Christmas Day from Lewy body dementia.

According to this picture, migrants are eager to experience the benefits of our society, but they are also out to undermine it, because they come from cultures whose values are dramatically different from our own. Think of the ongoing “grooming gangs” scandal: an undeniably appalling series of events, institutional failures and victim-blaming that has been transformed into a narrative that suggests any “alien” is likely to be a sexual predator, since their predatory behaviour is a direct consequence of their religious and cultural background.So often, all we are allowed to know about asylum seekers is that they are asking – with irritating persistence – for a place in our social fabric, as if they have no world of their own, no cultural hinterland, no really recognisable human values aside from mysterious and dangerous belief systems. This explains why there is now a feverish pressure to instantly reveal the ethnicity of any suspect in a major crime of unprovoked violence – as with theCambridgeshire train attack(where, confusingly, it transpired that the hero of the day was aman of north Africanbackground), or the tabloid habit of illustrating stories about migrants with images of young men, usually of Middle Eastern appearance.There are various ways to push against this myth-making. One is simply to take the time needed to look and listen to what migrant individuals and communities actually have to say about themselves. There have been numerous initiatives aiming to highlight art that is focused on migrant experiences – and there are some dramatic and profound instances to discuss.Issam Kourbaj, an artist who originally hails from Syria but is now working in Cambridge, has produced extraordinary work connecting his heritage with the experience of displacement today. One of his most effective installations has been exhibited in Britain and the US and is based on an ancient Syrian model boat carrying the small images of three goddesses.View image in fullscreenThe 13th-century Cosmati pavement in Westminster Abbey, London.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PABut there is another kind of “art” that migrants create. Anyone who has ever spent time in a refugee camp will have encountered this. People bring with them objects from home that are charged with special significance: often things snatched up at the last moment, without much reflection. Back in 2019, I was part of a small group of scholars and writers who put together a colloquium in Cambridge designed to hear and celebrate migrant voices. We were able to present some new artwork from Kourbaj and others, to listen to songwriters who had honed their skills in the Calais camps, to share food from different cultures andhear people talk about the objects they had grabbed to take with them on leaving their homes.Take the photographer Dragana Jurišić, who described to us how, as a 16-year-old fleeing army snipers in Croatia in the 1990s, she picked up a Bible, despite having no conscious interest in religion. Looking at it years later, she found she had marked passages that had acted as “mantras” in the worst moments of terror and danger. Jurišić is still anything but a conventional believer. But she needed something from her past and her culture to talk and listen to in the middle of the chaos. She needed to know she was not travelling alone.Recently, we held another event to mark the publication of the original conference proceedings. We were all reinforced in our conviction that these artworks and the imagination they stem from deserve sustained attention because they remind us of how our own culture, forms of poetry, architecture, song and much more. They are the way they are because people have travelled – sometimes freely, sometimes very much not.What we called “migrant forms”in the 2019 colloquium are not some sort of pollution that compromises an original, hermetically sealed culture, but the product of a mobile – and often cruelly insecure and unjust – human world. We find new things in conversation with our own past when we are uprooted from it. We talk and listen to what we thought was familiar, and find new things to say. We absorb the sound of strangers, including oppressors and enslavers, and find a voice of our own. It is not an accident that much of the huge and sophisticated structure of Hebrew scripture – the “Old Testament” – that has formed the imagination of well over half the inhabitants of the globe found its present shape through a generation of forced displacement and unfreedom in Babylon.View image in fullscreenBlues singer Howlin’ Wolf performing on the US TV show Shindig, watched by the Rolling Stones and Darlene Love, 1965.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesLook around: hospitality to migrant forms is not just about settled people tolerantly enjoying exotic entertainment. Many of the most characteristic forms of western medieval architecture – the shapes we see in Westminster Abbey or the Houses of Parliament – owe their development to the to-ing and fro-ing of engineers and architects between western Europe and the Middle East during the Crusades. And we find it easy to forget that most of the stylistic repertoire of modern western popular music would be unthinkable without the Black American tradition that itself adapted and reshaped African idioms in the new and terrible world of enslavement.Migrants carry worlds with them, and whatever conditions we lay down for admission to our borders will be both inhumane and counterproductive if we do not pay attention to the sheer depth and fluidity of these worlds. We need to pay attention to the imagination of newcomers, rather than resorting to rhetoric that effectively depicts every migrant either as an individual in search of security at all costs, or as a plain enemy of all we think is humanly significant. Migrants do not have only one face or one history. They are not ciphers for some opaque and sinister worldview. They do not lack agency, especially that uniquely human kind of agency we call imagination. Paying attention to their imagination may even release our own, helping us to see ourselves in a new light.Rowan Williams is a former archbishop of CanterburyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So I was interested to spot, on a recent trip into the fine city, a woman carrying a Trader Joe’s-branded tote bag.Trader Joe’s is a US supermarket; it does not operate in the UK, let alone East Anglia. And yet its merchandise – specifically this black-strapped, red-stamped but otherwise unremarkable tote bag – has been increasingly ubiquitous in London this year, asnoted by the New York Timesin July.Three months to make it up to Norwich felt about right. But why, I wondered, was the arrival of the Trader Joe’s tote so inevitable in the first place? Tote bags used to generically signal eco-consciousness; now the message has become much more targeted and – naturally, given an online discourse obsessed with categorising people into types and tribes – fraught.A tote bag is no longer just something you receive for free with a purchase over £40: it’s seen as a personal statement and even a billboard for your individual “brand”. A tote bag from Daunt Books, Shakespeare and Company, the London Review of Books, the New Yorker or Fitzcarraldo Editions may earn you points for reading, but see them detracted for obviousness. Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods impress upon the observer your easy familiarity with North American produce. And a man carrying a Mubi bag risks being marked out as a boorish “film bro” or “performative male”.It may have started with totes from known brands selling items you at least need to carry, but the craze for merchandising has now spread to lesser-known and even local establishments – and well beyond bags.View image in fullscreenCondoms from Toad Bakery.Photograph: ToadJolene, the north London bakery,sells not just totesbut branded hats, socks, scarves and even oilskins. You can cherish the memory of ameal at St Johnwith a tea towel, T-shirt, engraved waiter’s friend, or a pig-shaped pin badge (£5). Greggs, of course,has its own range with Primark, including bum bags, shoes and cycling shorts, as well as aseparate jewellery line, featuring 22-carat gold-plated sausage roll earrings (£36) and a signet ring (£48, equivalent to 37 sausage rolls). But for the common man, Yard Sale Pizza sells its ownfootball-style scarf.Even just grabbing a sandwich or coffee increasingly presents a chance to upsize your order with a T-shirt or cap to go. The most bizarre merch tie-in I’ve heard of is branded condoms from Camberwell’s buzzy Toad Bakery. It was a Valentine’s Day stunt, and a world-first for a bakery, owner Oliver Costello told me.From the perennial line outside its doors, Toad has no need for publicity; indeed, Costello said they kept their limited-edition run of“toad in the hole” johnniesfairly low-key, while 100% of the funds went to charity. So what’s the business case for making them?Partly, it seems, production is driven by demand. “Merch is big now in the bakery world” Costello said. Toad makes T-shirts and caps in large part “because they kept selling out”. Customers are increasingly prepared to travel to such talked-about bakeries, and want a longer-lasting souvenir than a pastry for their efforts.A tote also cements and extends the street cred that comes with being “in the know” about the latest Instagram-famous establishment: been there, got the croissant. Costello likened it to picking up a T-shirt from a gig: “It’s nice to feel like you can represent them somewhere else.” For musicians in the streaming age, however, merchandise is an important source of revenue. For bakeries, sandwich shops, wine bars and other smaller-scale establishments, tacking on merch doesn’t make much of a dent in the overheads.Toad already sells the T-shirts that its employees wear as uniform, and intends to partner with local artists on more designs, helping to mint it as a Camberwell institution; its caps are embroidered in nearby Deptford. This reveals merch as a means of displaying postcode pride, signalling your belonging to SE5 v SE10 (let alonenorth). In the neighbourhood where I used to live in Sydney, a much-loved convenience store now sells shirts bearing acartoon of the owner’s face; people buy them to show support for his outspoken pro-Palestine stance and funny social media presence.While merch might not bring in much money, it cements loyalty, may generate word-of-mouth and is typically cheap to produce – making it a low-risk venture for small businesses. An order of 150 custom totes may work out at about £5 a bag; they are readily sold for twice that. (The Timesreported on a single customerat Daunt Books spending £120 on totes.)View image in fullscreenPeople wearing Greggs’s signet rings.Photograph: GREGGSThe craze for merch, then, is perhaps best ascribed to the demands on small businesses today to not just provide a product or service, but establish themselves as coherent and even covetable “brands”. Dom’s Subs, which started in Hackney during the pandemic, did a brisk trade in T-shirts and more to customers wanting to support businesses during that challenging time. “From our side, it’s great advertising,” said co-founder Dom Sherington.In 2021, they even partnered with Carhartt on a T-shirt that sold out in minutes. The collaboration came about because Dom’s Subs frequently supplied sandwiches to theCarhartt office in Hackney Wick. T-shirts have since been spotted for resale for £300, “which is wild,” said Sherington.For Dom’s Subs, merch has been a “great revenue stream”. The challenge has been keeping up. “It can be really tricky to manage that side of the business as we don’t have a dedicated team,” said Sherington. Though they aspire to launch new products consistently, “Currently we just don’t have the manpower – we’re just a trio of sandwich shops”.Of course, the market for more branded stuff says most about capitalism. My entrepreneurial-minded friend recently returned from the US with three Trader Joe’s totes, intending to resell them at a profit; he’s still got them, having found Vinted swamped. (At least “they’re nice spacious bags,” he added.)As much as merch may seem like an easy win for small businesses, it’s also a sideshow, distracting from what they’re really trying to sell and adding to the pressures they face to stay afloat, as much as alleviating them. And for individuals, it might be a stand-in for a kind of cultural cachet that money can’t buy. It’s safer to buy someone a tote from a cult bookshop than it is to select a book you know they’d love. And it’s easier to buy a cap from your local cafe than it is to build a community there.Elle Hunt is a freelance journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s the people seizing the means of production. Every “what if?” is a tiny revolution. What if the side character got a backstory? What if the finale didn’t end in heartbreak? What if Harry Styles and Zayn Malik kissed just once, for morale?Of course, many would argue that fan fiction isn’trealliterature. It borrows worlds and characters that someone else created. It’s often unedited, published online for free and written by people with no verified experience. To the purists, it lacks originality, polish and commercial value, the hallmarks of what they believe “serious” writing should be.But this is to misunderstand the purpose of fan fiction. Fan fiction starts with the itch of dissatisfaction, it is the art of emotional correction. When what is canon fails to deliver, the fan fiction writers step in, armed with Word documents and righteous indignation. You think this character deserved more hand-holding? Fine. Someone out there is writing 10,000 words of forehead kisses and mutual healing right now.Because fan fiction isn’t just rewriting, it’s repairing. It’s giving yourself the closure you need when the author won’t. It’s deciding that pain can end differently, that love can be louder, that characters who were doomed in print get to live this time. It’s literature written by people who refused to move on and sometimes these people spell really badly (and that is completely OK).And yes, it’s rebellion. Against gatekeeping, against prestige, against the assumption that stories only count when they make money. Fan fiction exists because readers loved something so much they refused to let it die.Besides, the cultural influence of fan fiction is undeniable. Fifty Shades of Grey crawled out of the Twilight fandom and bought itself a mansion. Every fandom renaissance, from Marvel to One Direction to A Court of Thorns and Roses, is quietly fuelled by people writing feelings into being at 2am.Fan fiction allows people to explore identity, sexuality, trauma and love through characters they already trust. For many queer readers and writers, it was the first place they saw themselves represented.It’s messy, derivative, occasionally incomprehensible, but so is life. And that’s what makes it beautiful.Fan fiction is democracy. Fan fiction is rebellion. Fan fiction is literature. And sometimes, we all just need more hand-holding.Urooj Ashfaq is a Mumbai-based comedian, writer and actor.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was also two days after his final, death-infusedalbum Blackstarappeared from nowhere. As an artistic statement it was prophetic and impeccably theatrical. A feature-length documentary now shines a black light on that album’s recording, which some call Bowie’s creative resurrection. What does it reveal? And do we want to revisit that place, emotionally?Thankfully, Bowie: The Final Act (Saturday 3 January, 10pm, Channel 4) does not live solely in the catacombs. It begins at the zenith of Bowie’s pop fame: the 1983 Serious Moonlighttour, where the Thin White Duke turned American soul hero. This MTV-approved, Pepsi advert-inducing stardom was the onset of a career-stalling ennui, Bowie’s artistic voice drying out under the bright lights he sought. It then ricochets back to the start of his musical journey, pinballing us through its highlights. With a mythology this seismic it would be a crime not to. David Bowie invented serving looks, you know. They just happened to come from another planet.The contributors are decent. They include members of Bowie’s bands, friends, producers Tony Visconti and Goldie, and novelistHanif Kureishi. The latter remembers – without rancour – the way Bowie would form intense friendships with interesting people such as him, soaking up all he needed, before dropping them and moving on. It’s an important reminder that creative geniuses tend to leave plenty of personal debris in their wake. Moby also makes an appearance, with a neck tattoo that reads Vegan for Life. That’s not relevant, but it is distracting.The film’s unusual theme is the minor notes of a stellar career. The poorly received albums, crises of confidence. In one difficult scene, Melody Maker writer Jon Wilde reads out a scabrous review he wrote of Tin Machine II, which ends with the words: “Sit down man: you’re a fucking disgrace.” Bowie reportedly cried when he read it. As someone who made their start in snarky music criticism, I felt ants under my skin while watching.Bowie’s less successful ventures have been mostly reassessed. Tin Machine, his attempt to be a side player in a conventional rock outfit, still gets a kicking. “A really bad band, with a really bad name,” is editor Dylan Jones’s assessment. “Vulcan pimp suits” is how band leader Reeves Gabrels describes their actual outfits – collarless, colour-block two pieces. There’s fascination here, too: why would an otherworldly rock god, an androgyne who could no more blend into a crowd than a flamingo in a fur coat, desire to merely be “some bloke in a band?” Genius is lonely is the implication.‘The internet is an alien life form’: how David Bowie created a market for digital musicRead moreFlashes of supernovae, black holes and black stars recur throughout the film, a leitmotif of mortality. It’s hard to watch footage of Bowie walking off stage in Prague in pain, as his illness asserted itself. He left the limelight for 10 years, enjoying family life while he could. After going through chemotherapy, he recorded his loneliest, most vulnerable album in full knowledge of what was coming. There’s dignity and courage to songwriters who can do this. I think of Warren Zevon, Leonard Cohen. It is their final gift, whether or not we’re ready to receive it.Director Jonathan Stiasny’s film is no hagiography, yet it’s apparent he loves the Bowie myth as much as anyone. Thank God. There’s rapture in those images of Ziggy Stardust, that immortal face under all the reinventions, the hair that stayed perfect. There’s nostalgic bliss in the stories of Bowie’s playgrounds – 60s London, 70s New York. There’s black-and-white footage of an acid-drenched Glastonbury, when the festival’s audience was naked hippies who wandered in. Bowie walked to his first performance there, and ended up playing at 5am.There’s also the incredible clip of Bowie’s 1999 Newsnight interview with Jeremy Paxman, where he predicted the internet-mediated, chaotic world we live in today. I find myself wondering what he would have made of AI. I find myself missing him, and what he stood for. A beacon for misfits, a champion of creativity without horizons or fear. He was iconic and otherworldly. But in the end the art, and the man, were heartbreakingly human.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherTelevisionDavid BowiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Don’t write what you know…Elizabeth McCrackenSat 3 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 3 Jan 2026 04.03 ESTShareBeginningI don’t think it’s a bad thing to want to write a first sentence so idiosyncratic, so indelible, so entirely your own that it makes people sit up or reach for a pen or say to a beloved: “Listen to this.” A first line needn’t be ornate or long. It needn’t grab you by the lapels and give you what for. A first line is only a demand for further attention, an invitation to the rest of the book. Whisper or bellow, a polite request or a monologue meant to repel interruption. I believe a first line should deliver some sort of pleasure by being beautiful or mysterious or funny or blunt or cryptic. Why would anyone start a novel, “It was June, and the sun was out,” which could be the first line of any novel or story? It tells you nothing. It asks nothing of you.Not everyone agrees with me, nor do all great novels have memorable first lines. Pull books from your shelf and you’ll find plenty that start with a month or day of the week plus the weather. Maybe there’s a good argument: if you orient your reader on some level immediately, they will be ready for disorientation on others. Flatness can be a screen upon which brightness may be projected. Disorientation is one of the duties of fiction.No, I insist. A generic first line is a failure of nerve.RulesIt might be helpful to believe in absolutes when you’re first writing fiction.You can’t have more than one point of view in a story. Novel chapters should be a uniform length. The present tense brings the reader in. The present tense is shallow as a dime. Epiphanies are how we understand life. Epiphanies are false, flimsy.These absolutes should be as small and solid as training wheels; like training wheels, you can easily take them off later.I have never encountered a rule for fiction I believed in, at least in the long run, apart fromDon’t use a gothic font to make your work feel spooky.SubjectIf you’re writing a book, I tell my students, you had better make it a book of your heart: something you suspect only you can write, something that will menace you if you don’t get it down on the page. Too many people try to write somebody else’s book, hoping that it’s publishable.View image in fullscreenI’ve taught creative writing for 35 years, longer than I’ve been publishing books, but I believe in modes of thinking, not rules. At heart, as both fiction writer and teacher, I’m an aphorist and a metaphorist. I hope to provoke my students into thinking the most interesting thoughts that they can, so they can teach themselves how to write.Be ambitiousAmbition is everything.Fictionisn’t ballet. It’s not marathoning. You don’t have to start small, with drills or exercises; there’s nothing you need to perfect before moving on. Your budget for characters and sets and props and visual effects is infinite. You can splash out for equipment, but it isn’t necessary. You should attempt everything. Ambition in fiction is merely the willingness to make mistakes. Mistakes are essential. It’s not ice-skating. You won’t break a bone.Sometimes a young writer decides to put off writing certain things, thinking they’re too “technically difficult”. This is a bad idea: if something excites you, don’t wait. You might forget what interested you so, and, moreover, there are some things you can only write when you’re young, and some things you can only write when you’re old. You can always try to write the same thing when you’re older; it will be a different book.Concentrate on processWhen you’re uncertain about the writing itself – the sentences or the content – write through it. If a page is impossible, try a sentence; if a sentence won’t come, take notes. Writing is a form of thought. Any superannuated writer will tell you – I’m one – that years after the end of any writing class or programme, it isn’t the most promising writers who are still working, still publishing books, it’s the most bullheaded. I’m one of those, too.Be strangerEmbrace your particular oddness. Don’t give up your obsessions. They are dear to you: they are what make your work original. Be open to new fixations in life as well as writing. When you are fascinated with a subject or place or image, that fascination will exist for the fiction you write about it.Perhaps this seems obvious: of course you should be interested in what you write about! You might be surprised at how many otherwise excellent writers choose material almost at random, a sort of frame on which to arrange their sentences and characters. These writers would rather be good than interesting; they worry about being caught in a passion. But what the writer isn’t interested in will never interest a reader. Your work may be beautifully formed, articulate, full of meaning, but if you’re not interested in it, it won’t have a soul.Write when you canPossibly the most ubiquitous advice is that you must write every day. Real writers write every day – that’s what the director of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop told us at our first-day picnic. Plenty of writers do. Make it a job. Sit at your desk and put your time in, first thing in the morning, four hours or five hundred words or five pages. Do the math: in a year you’ll have a draft of a book, even if you move slowly.It’s excellent advice for those for whom it is good advice, and, I imagine, satisfying to dispense. Nothing ambiguous about it. I would go so far as to say that everyone should try daily writing. You might find it changes your life.As advice, though, it’s not universally useful. Not everyone can write every day; not every writer wants to or works best on such a schedule. I became a writer so I wouldn’t have to do math or keep accounts. I can hear the voice of an every-day writer even now: If you wanted to – if you wereserious! No: by circumstance or temperament, some writers can’t or shouldn’t. Many people work on timetables run by the needs of others: small children, elderly parents. Other people’s illnesses; their own. Their own need to work a job to support themselves or others.There are circumstantial reasons not to write every day, but you don’t need one if writing every day makes you write badly. That’s reason enough.Worse: if you believe you must write every day and life intervenes and you stop, it can feel as though you’ve stopped for good. Too late to pick it up again. You might even feel ashamed. Writing becomes an unpaid bill. You can’t even open the envelope. You stick it in a drawer so you don’t have to look at it. Then the time away from writing stretches on.View image in fullscreenDon’t give upYou won’t injure yourself, writing after days or weeks of not writing; you won’t have atrophied. Indeed, you may be a cicada of a writer, back full force after going away. You might be an annual, or a shook-up bottle of soda pop, more forceful when you resume.If you’ve stopped writing for any reason, you can start again, from the exact place you left off or somewhere even better. The reasons you stopped have changed you as a writer. Made you more interesting. In your time away, you haven’t lost a step.You’ve probably gained some.IdeasThe first inklings of a piece can arrive in nearly any form: an image, a line of dialogue, a line of narrative, a setting (place or time period), an abstract idea (I havealways wanted to write about a scientist who is a devout believer in God), a title, a plot, a structure, a character. A character might arrive in any way: as a predicament, or a moustache; as a role (for instance a mother or a priest); as a physical fact. Concrete or abstract, it doesn’t matter. Myself, I know the height and weight of my characters before I know their names or secrets.DraftsSome writers compose drafts quickly, carelessly. They don’t worry about beauty at first, or music. They know ahead of time that they will write many drafts, and the most important thing is to get the shape of the thing on the page. In order to begin, they tell themselves it’s all right to write badly. Otherwise they might never get out of the first paragraph. They don’t look back until it’s time to revise.Other writers must be painstaking from the start. Every morning, they reread what they’ve done so far and edit sentence by sentence. They cannot go forward until the thing feels right.I am, in my way, a painstaking drafter: I sit down, read the entire book from the beginning before I go on, print it out an environmentally irresponsible number of times and scribble all over it. Still, there’s nothing exacting in my process. Nothing tidy. I don’t produce nearly-there drafts, even when I tell myself that I am doing so. But I can’t bear to write what strike me as bad sentences. In the innermost chamber of my writer’s heart, the only thing I really care about is language, and I cannot think about fiction except in sentences. Sentences are how I lower myself into the dreamworld, how I know my characters (body and soul); sentences are my bucket and my torch.Some people wait to start a novel until they feel confident enough, but you have to be a little panicked to make it across the ocean in a rowing boat.PlanningProponents of outlining, like every-day writers, like to recommend the process to everyone. They are talking to themselves, announcing how their own brains work.There’s a wonderful moment while writing a book when, after swimming alone in the ocean of your dreamworld, you can sense it becoming actual, you can imagine how another person might navigate it by the landmarks you have installed, but you don’t want to arrive at that shore too soon. For some people, outlining is a form of thought: free from sentences and paragraphs, they can make meaningful decisions about their books. The outline prolongs the dream. Others of us dream in sentences only. We dream as we draft. Nothing is possible (I am talking to myself) without language. I figure things out. I write with the abandon of a tourist. What interests me at first might bore me later. That’s all right.No process is wrong that leads to a first draft of a book.PlottingIn fiction there are needful mysteries and needless mysteries. If the author and characters know a secret and only the reader is left in the dark, that’s a needless mystery. If you withhold a fact and think,When I reveal this, it’s going to blow the reader’s mind, nine times out of 10 it will only make them think you’ve been playing cards with an ace up your sleeve. Fiction can disorient readers, but if they don’t know where they are, if a piece of fiction continually shuts a reader out of what’s happening, who’s talking, what year it is, they will feel as though they’re on the other side of the door of an interesting party. Some personality types enjoy this feeling of exclusion. Not many.The Hero of This Book by Elizabeth McCracken review – all about my motherRead moreAltogether, it’s easy to overestimate the pleasure readers take in figuring out facts, who is speaking, their relationships to one another, where they are, what time period or geographical location we’re in, what level of reality. It’s not that everything must be instantly clear, only that if everything is obscure, readers are only looking down at their feet, wondering where they are, not up at the glories of your fictional universe.Needfulmysteries are about the mysteries of life. What can be done and not done, what can be seen and not seen. Needful mysteries tend to be mysteries for the characters as well.Actual people are always saying the strangest things. They wish to wound, persuade, shock, be heard, be understoodDialogueIf you’re writing dialogue between strangers that’s just zinging along it’s possible they are only saying what you expect them to say. Don’t let your dialogue become too generic in your wish to make it realistic; don’t make it solely informational, characters talking for the sake of the plot. Actual people are always saying the strangest things. They wish to wound, persuade, shock, be heard, be understood. Talking is not an involuntary process.Dialogue is the answer to any number of problems in fiction. A character you can’t get close to? Let ’em talk. Dialogue characterises, shows the odd way people put sentences together. A plot that’s stalled? Dialogue is action; it’s something characters do to each other.LanguageThe writing of metaphors should not be laboured, nor automatic. Many a leafless tree has been described as having branches like an old man’s hands, reaching for the sky, but do they really? Must all lawns in suburbia be manicured?I often suggest that writers cut explanatory conjunctions and adverbs in fiction: but, because, therefore, since. Such words point out meaning; losing them paradoxically imbues the language with meaning, because the reader supplies it.She didn’t want to go because she had a headache.She didn’t want to go. She had a headache.When a reader gets to supply the connection between the two thoughts, there’s a little jounce of pleasure. We feel closer to the character: we know something they don’t.MaterialMaterial should be personal in that you should be personally interested in it: puzzled, intrigued, troubled. You should want to get to the bottom of it. Material needn’t be something lived through, though it can be. Lucky, some writers think, hearing of another writer’s eventful or terrible childhood. A complicated childhood full of privation and catastrophe isn’t an inheritance that sets up a writer for life. It isn’t even the childhood itself that’s useful: it’s that the writer is interested in the childhood and doesn’t entirely understand it and works to get it on to the page, out of the body, so it can be looked at.Plenty of excellent writers have awful childhoods that they’re not interested in and never write about; some do only later in life, when youth can be viewed through the telescope of time. This is true of geography, too: it can be easier to write about home when you’ve left it far behind. Then you can hold it in your palm, like a snow globe, and look at it from multiple angles without being overwhelmed.You don’t need to write what you (already) know, because with research and hard work and pure will and a willingness to blunder and bomb as you write, you can make yourself know a great deal.Write about what you know.If you already know it – if there’s no mystery – what’s the point in writing it?This is an extract from A Long Game: How to Write Fiction (Jonathan Cape).

Michaela Coel’s comedy-drama, based on her own experience of sexual assault, follows Arabella (Coel) as she realises she was drugged and raped on a night out. With one in four women in Britain having experienced sexual violence, the 12-part series was a difficult watch for many. If not relatable, then confronting and familiar; something that had happened to others, but close enough to know that it could happen to you. Three months later, itdidhappen to me. I remember going back to a man’s flat on a second date, but then there’s a vast nothingness that I’ve been unable to make sense of since.The morning after, confused and embarrassed by my memory loss, I asked him what had happened. When he said we’d had sex, and I said I couldn’t remember it, he seemed offended, as though my amnesia were an accusation. After tea and toast, I left to meet my sister, who, when I told her I had blacked out after only three drinks, suggested I’d been drugged. I initially dismissed this – that’s what depraved strangers do to paralytic women on sticky club toilet floors. Not men you like in nice flats with comfy sofas. Not men who you would have had sex with anyway, consciously and consensually. Then I remembered the half-empty bottle of wine, leftover from a dinner party, offered to me but untouched by him.Twenty minutes later, I was on the phone to the police. An hour later, they were at my house. I was being swabbed, putting my nice underwear into evidence bags, never to be seen again. I tried to answer their questions in a way that didn’t seem like I was lying, even though I wasn’t. When they asked for his name and address, I wondered out loud what would happen to him. “We’ll arrest him,” they said. It all seemed so dramatic, so irreversible, so life-ruining, and how could I be sure? I could already hear my own uncertainty being used against me.If he had been a stranger, the investigation would have continued, but as I knew him and wouldn’t divulge his details, I was withholding information, so it ended there. Either a crime had been committed or it hadn’t, and if it had, then they needed a name. In the absence of that, my samples wouldn’t be tested, but they would freeze my urine and keep my swabs in case I changed my mind. I put the police officer’s card on my bedroom shelf and to the back of my mind, where it stayed for the next five years.I thought spiking was done by depraved strangers. Not by men you like in nice flatsThis year, after a conversation with a friend who had gone through something similar, I decided to rewatch I May Destroy You, perhaps hoping it would become a catalyst. I felt nervous. It had rattled me the first time, so what would it do now that I had experienced my own version of violation? Would it be catharsis or a wound reopened? For years, I had carried the guilt that, in having protected one man, I’d probably sacrificed other women to unknowable sinister black holes.It was during the fifth episode, when Arabella is praised for her bravery, that I pressed pause and went looking for the officer’s card. I called 101 and asked whether they still had a record of the case. I was given another phone number, and spoke to more people. No one seemed sure of how to progress after so many years, or whether my sample still sat in a freezer. I searched for his name in WhatsApp to find a profile photo of him holding a baby like a father would hold his child. I felt both more and less certain than ever about the decision I had made. Could this dad really have violated me in the way I feared he had? At the same time, I felt angry that he had gone on to have a normal, full life.In the variations of Arabella confronting, avenging or understanding her rapist in the final episode, we see different reckonings; ones she will never have, I will never have, most women will never have. But rewatching I May Destroy You and picking up the phone to at last ask these questions – I finally have something like closure.The case is now in limbo but I feel better for having pursued it. Although I continue to live with the uncertainty, just knowing that reopening the case would be more complicated than I thought, and unlikely to bring the resolution I had spent years secretly fantasising about, felt like a full stop, an end to the guilt and shame that should never have been mine.AnonymousIn the UK,Rape Crisisoffers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 inScotland, or 0800 0246 991 inNorthern Ireland.In the US,Rainnoffers support on 800-656-4673.

I love Seville oranges, grapefruit, brassicas, bitter greens, chicory and, most of all, radicchio. I like the burgundy-spotted castelfranco (great for salad with citrus and cheese) and the long-locked tardivo (best cooked with balsamic vinegar), but radicchio di chioggia is the popular leader of the pack. A chubby little cabbage-y nugget with a middle-of-the-road bitterness that becomes milder, sweeter and more delicious, especially when cooked alongside a large glass of juicy chianti and finished off with a snowy dusting of parmesan.Radicchio and chianti risottoOnly a couple of the major UK supermarket chains sell radicchio di chioggia, and you’re most likely to find it at a farmers’ market or online via retailers such asAbel & ColeandNatoora. Other red wines may be used in this recipe.Prep15 minCook40 minServes4For the risotto60g unsalted butter1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 radicchio di chioggia(about 400g), finely chopped350garboriorice250ml chiantiFine sea salt1 litre hot vegetable stock5 grinds of pepper70g vegetarian parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serveFor the radicchio and walnut pesto5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve16 sage leaves(5g), finely shredded25g walnuts, finely chopped½ lemon, zest finely grated, then juiced to get 1 tbspOn a medium heat, melt 40g of the butter in a heavy-bottomed pot for which you have a lid. When it starts to froth, add the onion and sweat, stirring, for six or seven minutes, until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic, cook for two minutes more, then add two-thirds of the radicchio and cook for about four minutes, until wilted.Add the rice, stir to coat the grains, then cook, stirring, until they turn semi-translucent. Pour in the chianti, stir to combine, then leave the rice fully to absorb the wine. Add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a couple of ladles of hot stock, then stir until the liquid is absorbed. Keep adding the stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until each ladle is absorbed before adding the next, for about 20 minutes, until the rice is al dente. Stir in the pepper and 50g grated parmesan, then dot the top of the rice with the remaining 20g butter. Turn off the heat, put the lid on the pot and leave the risotto to rest while you make the pesto.In a bowl, mix the extra-virgin olive oil, sage and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, then stir in the walnuts, the remaining finely chopped radicchio, the lemon zest and juice, and the remaining 20g parmesan. Mix really well, check the seasoning and adjust as required.Spoon the risotto on to a plates or shallow bowls and top with some radicchio pesto and a final showering of grated parmesan for good measure. Drizzle over some extra-virgin olive oil and serve with the remaining pesto alongside.Explore more on these topicsRiceMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodWineWinter food and drinkItalian food and drinkCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

Here’s all the kit you needTom HuntSat 3 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Similar to vinegar, kombucha is made with a scoby (a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast), or mother, which looks like a blobby creature from the deep. Homemade kombucha is an enjoyable project and really cheap to make (it’s essentially just the cost of some sugar and a teabag), but it’s also a skill that takes a little refining. Over-ferment it, and you end up with vinegar or, worse, it could explode during the secondary fermentation, especially if you forget to “burp” the bottle to release the excess gas that gives kombucha a natural effervescence.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And, whilemaking your own kombuchais fun, the range on the market now is vast and of really high quality, with some even being created expressly as non-alcoholic alternatives to cocktails and wine. Kombucha is naturally lower in sugar than most sweetened drinks – the fermentation process consumes sugar, but the amount left will depend on how long it’s fermented for. Some are completely sugar-free, but many of those are sweetened with steviol glycosides and erythritol, which makes them ultra-processed foods, and I think they taint the flavour, even though they’re derived from natural sources. Most of the products I tested had 2-3g sugar per 100ml, which is much lower than cola, say, which has about 10.6g, or the equivalent of about seven teaspoons per can! I tasted all these kombuchas chilled and straight from the vessel (and with water breaks in between).The best supermarket kombuchaBest overall:Holos ginger & hibiscus organic kombuchaView image in fullscreen£3.20 for 330ml at Waitrose (97p/100ml)★★★★★A very fizzy organic kombucha with a delicate touch of sourness that tastes more like a homemade one.
