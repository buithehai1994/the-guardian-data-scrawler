But with bland algorithmic content on the rise, perhaps we consumers should start taking our art a bit more seriouslyRachel AroestiSun 28 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 13.49 EDTShareInToo Much, Lena Dunham’s Netflix romcom, protagonist Jess has a toxic ex called Zev. Via flashback, we witness Zev dismiss her emotional needs, demand she get rid of her dog and – worst of all – pour scorn on her cultural preferences: Vanderpump Rules, the “Real Housewomen of North Carolina”, Miley Cyrus songs. When Jess enthusiastically sings along to the ballad Angels Like You, Zev admonishes her: “It’s not real music, it’s manufactured bullshit – come on, you’re too smart to fall for that.” Jess briefly defends Cyrus, before retreating. “Don’t make me feel stupid for loving things!” she implores tearily.Zev is a bad guy and a cultural snob. He’s a bad guy partly because he’s a cultural snob. He’s also a relic. We live in a world where contempt for culture based on its level of sophistication or intellectual value is considered deeply passé, if not borderline evil. The derogatory labels – guilty pleasure, idiotbox, dumbed-down entertainment, disposable pop, trash TV – are no longer in circulation. Culture of every stripe is worthwhile: superhero movies prompt near academic levels of discourse; Taylor Swift is the subject of multiple university classes; and reality shows double as state of the nation treatises (The Traitors echoes British democracy’s dysfunctions,wrote Ian Dunt in the i; the brutal competition of Love Island USA is an allegory for the mercilessness of American life, according tothe New Yorker). Throwing insults – vapid, stupid, pointless, brain cell-depleting – is now like spitting into a mirror: it says more about you than the song/show/movie you are criticising.But what if cultural snobbery, so effectively cast off over the past decade, wasn’t a waste of time? What if it did actually uphold certain standards? What if – faced with a future dominated by social media advertainment and AI-generated content – it’s our only hope?You could argue that culture has been on an intellectual downward spiral since the Victorian era, when mass-market literature lowered the collective brow. Ever since, we’ve adapted to art in increasingly populist, democratic and easily digestible forms – cinema, pop music, television, the internet – much of it reflective of new technologies. Over time, suspicion about specific mediums became synonymous with elitism and a fear of change – yet there were always hierarchies within these modern forms, often directed along lines of race, gender and sexuality with the output (and tastes) of the straight, white male generally receiving the least derision.View image in fullscreenStrange bed fellows … Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixIn a2004 New York Times article, Kelefa Sanneh summarised rockism – the musical facet of that mindset – as favouring punk over disco, live shows over music videos and idolising “the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star”. By the mid-00s, rockism seemed suffocating. To move beyond it, Sanneh suggested we envisage a world where “it’s impossible to separate classics from guilty pleasures” and try “to acknowledge that music videos and reality shows and glamorous layouts can be as interesting – and as influential – as an old-fashioned album”.We certainly rose to that challenge. Soon poptimism – an ideology that maintained that authenticity was a pose and conventionally unserious music (and, later, film, TV and books) had inherent value – became the status quo. It was bolstered by the belief that snobbery towards certain genres was inseparable from bigotry (the shudder-inducing memory of 1979’s Disco Demolition night; Noel Gallagher responding to Jay-Z’s 2008 Glasto headline slot by saying: “I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury, it’s wrong”). People wanted to purge themselves of the prejudices that prevented them embracing lowbrow culture, resulting in headlines such as “My anti-romance book snobbery was rooted in internalised misogyny”. In Zev and Jess’s case, it is no coincidence that her favoured music and TV are stereotypically feminine. Needless to say, appraising art through a misogynistic, homophobic, white-supremacist lens is not a good thing. Yet poptimism’s reach went far beyond oppressive power structures – in the end, open-mindedness curdled into indiscriminate celebration.Too Much demonstrates how. Jess’s ultimate defence of her devotion to Cyrus is to equate Zev’s disdain with a kind of emotional robbery; to judge is to shame is to destroy joy that is in short supply in a world plagued by catastrophe and disconnection. This applies not only to reality TV and chart fodder, but also manchild-friendly comic franchises and fantasy epics. In 2016, a webcomic by Adam Ellis depicting a sports fan telling his snide friend to “let people enjoy things” captured this perspective so well it became a popular meme.View image in fullscreenMaking a scene … The Studio.Photograph: APThese days, “let people enjoy things” is the prevailing attitude towards all cultural consumption. The mainstreaming of obsessive fandom helped conflate criticism with trauma-inducing attacks (see: Swifties who take the musician’s output – and discussion of it – incredibly personally), as did superstars clapping back at commentators (Lana Del Rey taking the time totweet multiple haughty rebuttalsto an NPR review; Halsey expressing her hopes that the “basement they run [Pitchfork] out of” – situated in the World Trade Center no less – collapses). With any negativity now considered psychic violence (sometimes countered by threats of actual violence from fans), enthusiasm took over as the default mode. Ironically, considering the Gallaghers’ track record of insulting their peers, it’s a mindset that has benefited the Oasis reunion no end: don’t call them derivative, dull or lyrically inane like people did in the 1990s; just focus on the rare and precious sight of British people having fun.This may all sound very nice, but a new age is upon us. Accounts pumping out AI-generated music are reaching massive audiences; in June, a fake rock band calledthe Velvet Sundownamassed more than 1m Spotify plays in weeks. In light of advances in AI video technology, YouTube recently issued a warning about content that is “inauthentic”, “mass-produced” and “repetitious” (which does admittedly sound like a 1990s dad describing happy hardcore). There is now an established term for this sort of thing: slop – a word that reflects its junky, empty, imitative nature. Should we just let people enjoy that, too?Probably not. In December, brain rot – a term popular with gens Z and A – was crowned the Oxford word of the year. Defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state” due to “overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging”, it is proof we don’t need to wait for the robots to take over: consuming human-created social media dross clearly feels unhealthy on a biological level.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ryan Olbrysh/The GuardianThe funny thing is, the defining traits of AI and social media slop are the very qualities cultural snobbery used to rail against. One of these was naked commercialism: AI content takes barely any time or effort to create and economies of scale mean profit is the point, while the success of social media content is judged almost entirely on its viewership. Another was soulless imitation: AI draws crudely on existing culture; social media slop, meanwhile, often involves re-enacting trends or crazes.Some of these old standards will feel alien to zoomers and alphas. In his 2022 book The Nineties, the critic Chuck Klosterman explores the decade’s hostility towards “selling out,” which he calls “the single most nineties aspect of the nineties”. Selling out involved a respected artist deciding to make work that was more “palatable” and therefore more commercially viable. By 2010, says Klosterman, “it was hard to illustrate to a young person why this act was once seen as problematic; by 2020 it was difficult to explain what the term literally expressed”.Social media decimated the binary between advertising and entertainment long ago. So what if art and commerce become synonymous? Well, how about this remarkably on-the-nose warning from the recent past. When NFTs – digital artworks that only exist online – exploded in popularity during the pandemic, there was little sign of luddite elitism: Christie’s sold an NFT by Beeple for a record-setting $69.3m. To detractors, Rosanna McLaughlin wrote in the Guardian, the makers of NFTs were “morally bankrupt, environmentally vandalistic money-grabbers whose creations barely qualify as art”, a view shared by Beeple himself who described the work as “a big pile of ass-shit”. NFTs helped “the distinction between art and asset” disappear, observed McLaughlin. “Prices, not ideas, dominate.” This meant that when the bubble burst – it was reported in 2023 that 95% of NFTs were worthless – nothing at all remained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Deliberate imitation and an obsession with numbers increasingly rule conventional popular culture, too. The tech companies who now create and distribute so much television are interested almost exclusively in viewership (as their policy of cancelling acclaimed shows has repeatedly proved) and they have always been committed to exploiting existing tastes: House of Cards, Netflix’s first original series, came about after the platform noticed that Kevin Spacey, director David Fincher and the original BBC version were all popular.Following the prestige television era, this mindset has, unsurprisingly, produced diminishing returns. Last year, the New York Times critic James Poniewozikcoined the term“mid TV”, defined as a “profusion of well-cast, sleekly produced competence” that represented modern television’s “willingness to retreat, to settle, to trade the ambitious for the dependable”. In other words, to make safe bets on emulative and unchallenging shows (Poniewozik cites Mr and Mrs Smith and House of the Dragon as examples).The quest to appeal to proven preferences has reshaped pop music too, as songwriters craft bland, vapid tracks in the hope of pleasing Spotify algorithms. It’s also why we’re trapped in a nightmare of endless reboots, adaptations and spin-offs (there have been 11 Star Wars shows since 2021 alone). AI may be entirely derivative, but so is much TV. And Hollywood is so obviously beholden to branding – whether that be existing IP or actual consumer products – that Apple TV+’s affectionate satire The Studio used this obsession as the cornerstone of its movie business pastiche. Initially, The Studio’s protagonist Matt Remick (Seth Rogen) pays lip service to cultural snobbery: he is infuriated by his CEO’s insistence they make a Kool-Aid film. But the show teaches him to compromise in a post-Barbie reality. (You really can’t hold it against Remick: he exists within the TV arm of a phone company trying to foster cultural cachet; he was always going to be a capitalist stooge.)View image in fullscreenEconomies of scales … House of the Dragon.Photograph: HBOObviously, the value of art is subjective up to a point, but there are still some broad criteria we can claw back, regardless of the medium.Shifty, Adam Curtis’s recent docuseries about 1980s Britain, includes a clip of Martin Amis informing an interviewer that “there is a great convulsion of stupidity happening in the world, mostly to do with television […] It’s almost like consumerism of culture.” Amis seems almost comically fusty in the footage. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a point. A great convulsion of stupidity endures – see: brain rot – but the idea that art can spread idiocy has disappeared. Implicit in the “let people enjoy things” mindset is the argument that people need mindless pleasure and distraction during terrible times. To deny them that is mean-spirited. But what if those terrible times were partly a product of our dumbed-down, money-fixated culture in the first place?AI, bot farms and innocent indie victims: how music streaming became a hotbed of fraud and fakeryRead moreIn a 1993 interview, David Foster Wallace defined “low” culture – such as “TV and popular film” – as art that is lucrative because it knows “audiences prefer 100% pleasure”. Serious art is “more apt to make you uncomfortable, or to force you to work hard to access its pleasures, the same way that in real life true pleasure is usually a by-product of hard work and discomfort”. We may live in an era when watching an entire TV programme without looking at your phone feels like monastic contemplation, but Foster Wallace’s ethos remains true and applicable. The easier art is to consume and produce, and the more focused it is on remuneration, the less it gives us: no food for thought, just reaffirmation at a time when echo chambers are the default.Cultural snobbery might end up being no match for tech giants and AI and social media’s infinite scroll. But as a bulwark against vacant, commercial, intellectually bereft art made by robots or humans or a combination of the two, it’s worth reconsidering. Throughout this article, I’ve been tempted, in characteristically millennial style, to give assurance of my own lack of cultural snobbery – I have enthusiastically consumed years’ worth of dross – but by the end I felt less perverse pride than straightforward shame. At the very least, we should stop villainising the proponents of some kind of standards: the Zevs of this world may have their flaws, but when it comes to brain-rotting culture, they could also be our saviours.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The MP who whispered to a journalist: ‘The atmosphere in here is like Dignitas on the Mersey.’ Then there was the charity worker who was asked to unroll the corporate banner she was planning to put up at a fringe event. To make sure it didn’t say anything offensive or constituted a thought crime. Like support for Andy Burnham.Others were a little more chipper. Laughing and relaxed. Upbeat even. That could just be because they’ve already given up caring, another observed. The worst has already happened. Conference aspirations narrowed down to just trying to make the best of the next few days and hang out with old mates. Fair to say that most delegates have come to Liverpool with mixed expectations. To say the least. Survival appears to be uppermost in people’s minds. To get through without things getting any worse than they already are.What a difference a year makes. Labour was riding high at its conference 12 months ago after its landslide election victory. Most of the country was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. That they could turn things round after 14 years of Tory government. That they would be a safe pair of hands. The grownups were back in charge.Now the national mood is unforgiving. Reform is10 points aheadin many polls. If there were an election today, Nigel Farage might well be in Downing Street with an overall majority. Keir Starmer’s personal ratings are some of the worst ever recorded. Nor is there any comfort for Labour in being ahead of the Tories because they are headed for annihilation. And that’s before we add Labour’s own goals to the list.Labour’s poll ratings have plummeted – so is Starmer’s future in question?Read more“How much trouble are you in?” began Laura Kuenssberg in her customary first-day-of-conference interview with the Labour leader for her Sunday BBC show. Keir didn’t appear to have heard the question. Instead, he rattled on about how well everything was going. Hospital waiting lists going down. More homes being built. Early years education never better. Ships being built.Kuenssberg tried again. “How much trouble are you in?” This time Starmer mumbled something about understanding that people were frustrated and that everything was pretty much normal. But he was on a mission to fix and change the country. Out came his new buzzwords. “Patriotic national renewal”. Which, loosely translated, appeared to mean carrying on doing the things he already had been doing but with added moral purpose. Saving the country and saving himself had now become almost synonymous.But just as it looked as if this interview was about to slide into all the other interviews he has given over the past years – dull, technocratic, out of touch and instantly forgettable – Keir upped a gear. For the first time, we got a flash of what really motivates him. A bit of edge. No more two-dimensional cardboard Keir. No longer hedging his bets with an “Ooh, well you know they’ve got a point.”Now Starmer wasgoing for the jugular. Making the case for a more diverse and tolerant country. Yes, Reform was a racist party with itsplans to deporttens of thousands of immigrants who had been granted indefinite leave to remain. Because we all know what that would look like in practice. Most of the people getting deported would be people with brown skins. Families split up, centuries of British fair play destroyed. This was calling out Nige for what he was. Not allowing him to get away with his snide, racist-adjacent innuendo. It was racist. And it was immoral.You could almost hear the cheers from Labour supporters and MPs. They have been willing Starmer to say something like this for months. This wasn’t about illegal immigration. That was a separate issue. This wasn’t about saying Farage’s own supporters were racist. Even if some of them are. It was Labour taking the fight back to Nige. Not giving him the freedom to dictate the debate. Make him defend himself. The patriotism of a man who has supported Putin. The patriotism of a man who urged the US to impose sanctions on the UK. For once in his life, make Nige sweat a bit.It almost felt cathartic. For Keir as much as the party. No longer tied up in his vanilla straitjacket. One unmemorable sentence after another. Trying to be everything to everybody and pleasing no one. For the first time in ages, Starmer had taken a stand and it felt good to him. He was a man released. The swagger that has been missing from him for ages seemed to return. As though a light had been switched on. You could tell he cared. That this stuff mattered to him.‘There are ripples of hope’: allies of Keir Starmer say he can prove doubters wrongRead moreThoughts of a leadership challenge suddenly felt rather premature. Kuenssberg asked about Burnham. Who? Oh, that Andy. He’s doing just great as Manchester mayor. Damning with faint praise. Let Andy come for him if he thought he was hard enough. Keir wasn’t going anywhere just yet. “We’re in the fight of our lives,” he said. The political has rarely felt so personal. The prime minister’s survival linked to that of the country.Over in the main hall, the conference got under way with its traditional lacklustre speeches. The general secretary, Hollie Ridley, asked for a minute’s silence to remember “the deep-rooted decency of political donors”. Niche to say the least. Steve Reed found himself with the biggest cheer of the day, but only because he mentioned his predecessor as housing secretary, Angela Rayner. Safe to say, she won’t be getting a speaking slot this time round.The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, or Albo, as Keir called him, was granted the international speaker slot. After pointing out that being in government was a lot harder than being in opposition – I think everyone present had already clocked that – Albo went on to insist that a healthy diversity of opinions was a sign of a healthy conference. Starmer may beg to differ. And someone should also give the security staff the heads up.Explore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025The politics sketchKeir StarmerImmigration and asylumLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Retirement, it turns out, was more “retirement”, an extended bit of rest and recuperation for another gauntlet. Anemone, the three-time Oscar winner’s quote-unquote comeback film and the feature directorial debut of his son Ronan Day-Lewis, is an even less sunny experience. (At least for the viewer; Day-Lewis has described filming with his son as “beginning to end, just pure joy to spend that time together with him”.) In fact, it’s gray-skies-only for the film’s plodding two hours, the better to hammer home the point of roiling disquiet within, to quote the logline, “the complex and profound ties that exist between brothers, fathers, and sons”.Daniel Day-Lewis says he ‘never intended to retire, really’Read moreFather and son, who co-wrote the script set in the late 1980s, seem aligned on the somber task of peeling back what has not been said for two generations of stoic, war-torn men. Anemone – a title that, like the film, is vaguely symbolic and overly portentous – settles in like fog on the northern English coast: at once heavy and weightless, overcast with dour import. It starts with a prayer (fromSean Bean, face creased with unrelenting seriousness) and proceeds into the mist of unexpressed trauma, over-communicated in close-up shots of bloody knuckles, blank walls and truncated torsos.It’s a bleak mood, at times effective – I occasionally found myself aching for a hug – and more often alienating. To be fair, Day-Lewis’s Ray Stoker is a bitter pill. A lone wolf driven into self-imposted exile in the Yorkshire wood by a mysterious trauma 20 years earlier, he’s gruff and sour, foul-tempered and foul-mouthed (his first monologue, transfixing as ever, was so filthy in content that it provoked more than one swear from the audience). Day-Lewis, an actor of singular intensity born to portray a man of singular isolation, makes a meal out of him, ferociously needling his long-estranged brother Jem (Bean) as if he’d never left.After a full term of pregnant, woodsy silences, the stakes come creeping in. Jem seeks reconciliation on behalf of his wife, Nessa (Samantha Morton), Ray’s former lover, and his son Brian (Samuel Bottomley), a young man visibly corroded with anger whose origin soon becomes clear; Ray, haunted by his time as a British paramilitary in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, seeks continued disappearance. (Nessa, as well as Brian’s brief love interest, played by Safia Oakley-Green, do little more than offer the female-coded antidotes of patience, yearning and tenderness.) Both reckon with the trauma of the past, thunderously delivered in blunt confessions, ear-splitting deluges of spectral chords, and flourishes of magical realism that, with the exception of one PTSD-flagging nightmare, fail to communicate anything beyond the desire to be serious. “Didn’t have much of a father, did we?” Ray asks his brother, referring to both the blood and the cloth, the sins of both neither surprising nor sticky.Drink it up! All 21 Daniel Day-Lewis films – rankedRead moreThat is, until Day-Lewis delivers them, with two mesmerizing monologues that briefly allow the project to transcend theme into deliverance. Son knows how to film father, tightly framing the actor’s imperious countenance in shadow, either blocking or, in one exquisite shot, allowing glinting firelight. When the dam on his silence finally breaks, in one hard-earned, gutting scene of gruesome confession, you are right there with him in the muck, close but still estranged, hanging on to every word.But that cinematically triumphant moment is quickly swallowed again by the booming sense of Import, a literal storm to convey the potentially damaging emotional turmoil swirling in the atmosphere. The younger Day-Lewis shows promise as a film-maker – Anemone certainlylooksserious, the correct scowls and swirling skies and wordless, eerie montages to suggest weighty themes, big emotions and ominous suspense. The tools to back up that style with emotional punches that land like the real ones of the brothers – best believe they tussle it out, because of course – are not yet refined, but in this father-son duo, at least, I have faith.Anemone is screening at the New York film festival and is out in US cinemas on 3 October, in UK cinemas on 7 November and in Australia on 5 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDaniel Day-LewisFirst look reviewSean BeanDrama filmsSamantha MortonreviewsShareReuse this content"

The daughter of a blacksmith, she used her wit, intelligence and beauty to rise to the highest echelons of European society, mingle with royalty and win the heart of Britain’s great hero, AdmHoratio Nelson.Now, more than 200 years after she died in drink and debt inCalais, French scientists have identified what they believe are Lady Hamilton’s remains.Experts say they cannot be certain the bones, discovered in a tomb in the “English section” of a graveyard in Calais and exhumed in 2021, are hers. However, a digital reconstruction of a face from the largely intact skull bears a remarkable likeness, France’s foremost forensic pathologist has said.“There’s every chance it’s her but we cannot be entirely certain,” Dr Philippe Charlier told the Guardian. “We have a skull that is in very good condition and about 80% of a skeleton that has been lying in the earth.”The scientific examination and carbon dating of the bones pointed to a woman aged between 45 and 55 who died around 1815, Charlier said. Hamilton was 49 when she died on 15 January 1815.“Traces on the mouth and teeth suggest alcohol abuse, though the rest of the body appears to have been in a healthy state. There were no traces of conditions and diseases like rickets, common in the general population at the time,” Charlier added.Attempts to establish a cause of death and extract DNA from the bones have so far been unsuccessful, but Charlier’s team continues to examine the skeleton in the hope scientific advances will make identification more certain. Until then, the remains are described as “presumed” to be Hamilton.Charlier, who has studied theremains of historical figures, including Richard the Lionheart, the French kings Louis IX and Henry IV and Adolf Hitler’s teeth, said the team that worked on reconstructing the face was told only that the skull was that of a European woman of a certain age. From this, they were asked to create a reproduction of how the unnamed woman may have looked.“It took 18 months and was done in a completely scientific and not artistic way. The likeness to portraits of Emma Hamilton is incredible,” he added.Hamilton was born Amy Lyon, daughter of a Cheshire blacksmith who died shortly after her birth and his wife, Mary. She was raised by her grandmother in north Wales and sent into domestic service as a nursery maid to a local doctor at 13 years old before becoming a housemaid for the composer Thomas Linley.Aged 16, Hamilton became the mistress of the wealthy aristocrat Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, the MP for Portsmouth, who historical records describe as a “witless playboy” who threw wild parties. At his Sussex home, she met Charles Greville, a British antiques collector and politician, who took her to London and ordered a series of portraits of her by George Romney and one by Sir Joshua Reynolds.View image in fullscreenEmma Hart as Circe, by George Romney, c 1782. At Greville’s request, Hamilton changed her name to ‘Mrs Emma Hart’.Photograph: TateGreville soon tired of Hamilton and packed her off to his widowed uncle Sir William Hamilton, the British envoy to Naples, suggesting mendaciously that her stay would be temporary. Among those she befriended was Queen Maria Carolina of Naples, the sister of Marie Antoinette.In 1791, Emma, then 26, and William, 60, travelled to London to marry and returned to Naples where she met Nelson, who was instantly smitten, historians have said. Their daughter Horatia was born in 1801 while both were still married to their respective spouses.William died in 1803 and Nelson was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar two years later, leaving Emma without protectors and penniless.After she was released from the debtors’ prison, Hamilton escaped with Horatia to Calais, where she is thought to have become an alcoholic. When she died she was first buried in the churchyard of St Pierre’s in Calais. Her body was later moved and her remains lost.Musical tributes to Nelson found in Lady Hamilton’s songbooksRead moreThe Calais councillor Dominique Darré, who enlisted the help of municipal gravediggers in a decade-long hunt for Hamilton’s grave, said he had almost given up hope of finding it when the skull and skeleton were discovered in the other graveyard.“I feared she had been thrown into a common grave and we would never find her,” Darré said. “It’s incredible to think that this is her. I am convinced, but the experts say we have to presume it is her until science has evolved further and we have more proof.”In a ceremony this month, the remains were placed in Calais’s Notre Dame church.“We have done this as memorial and homage to a woman who was forgotten but who is part of the history of Calais and part of our common history,” Darré said.Explore more on these topicsHoratio NelsonCalaisFranceForensic sciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to make the most of itRachel DixonSun 28 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 09.08 EDTSharePeople seem to have had their fill of mock-meat burgers, veggie sausages and fake chicken. Last month,the Grocer reportedthat Quorn and Linda McCartney’s, the UK’s leading meat-free brands, lost a combined £15.7m in 2024. Overall sales of meat substitutes fell by 6%, or £30m.But that doesn’t mean meat is back on the menu.According to Eating Better, an alliance of environmental, animal welfare, public health and social justice charities, meat consumption in the UK has been on a downward trend for more than a decade. Its 2024 survey found that fewer people eat meat every day, 61% are willing to eat less and 24% reduced their consumption in the past year.Enter tofu and tempeh, which are flying off supermarket shelves. The Grocer says tofu sales are up 15.3% in the UK, while tempeh is one of the fastest-growing foods. Tiba Tempeh, the UK’s biggest producer, has announced a736% increase in salesyear on year. Its main rival, Better Nature,increased sales by 128%in the same period. Both have recently raised more than £1m in funding to expand internationally.Tofu has been in supermarkets for years but, despite its burgeoning popularity, tempeh remains relatively unknown. So what exactly is it, and why has it suddenly taken off?What is tempeh?View image in fullscreenTempted? … Tempeh is made by a fermentation process that binds soya beans into a cake form.Photograph: danikancil/Getty Images/iStockphotoLike tofu, tempeh is traditionally made from soya beans. But whereas tofu is made from soya milk, tempeh uses the whole beans. They are fermented by live cultures – typicallyRhizopusspecies – which transforms them into a firm, dense block. As Tofoo, a tofu brand that also makes tempeh, puts it: “Tempeh is like tofu after it’s been at the gym – HARD.” The only other ingredient is water.Where does it come from?While many shoppers may be discovering tempeh for the first time, it’s certainly not a new invention. Ina 2021 review, researchers from the University of Massachusetts and the Indonesian Academy of Sciences explained: “Tempeh is an indigenous food from Indonesia, where it has been consumed as a staple source of protein for more than 300 years.”Petty Elliott, a UK-based Indonesian chef and the author ofThe Indonesian Table, says: “Tempeh is very important in Indonesian culture, especially for Javanese people – it was invented in the Java islands.” The earliest known reference to tempeh was found in the Serat Centhini, a compilation of Javanese teachings written in the 1800s. But, saysLara Lee, an Australian chef and food writer of Chinese-Indonesian heritage: “Some argue its existence may date back more than 1,000 years.”What does it taste like?“Tempeh has a mild, mushroom-like and nutty taste with a firm, meaty consistency. It’s often described as earthy and slightly yeasty,” says Dr Sammie Gill, a registered dietitian andBritish Dietetic Associationspokesperson. Even if you’re not usually a fan of fermented foods, you may like it, says Elliott. “Tempeh has the same ingredients as miso, but as the fermentation time is not as long, it’s not so strong a taste.”View image in fullscreen‘A nutty taste with a firm, meaty consistency’ … tempeh semur from UK-based Indonesian chef Petty Elliott.Photograph: Petty ElliottBut that doesn’t mean it’s boring, she says: “Tempeh has more flavour and texture than tofu – you can make it really crunchy.”Eleanor Ford, a food writer and the author ofFire Islands: Recipes from Indonesia, agrees. “The nutty, nubbed texture is a key feature of tempeh, making it anything but bland.”Lee, whose latest cookbook isA Splash of Soy, adds that, like tofu: “Tempeh is also porous, so it acts as a wonderful sponge. When it is simmered in a sauce or broth, it absorbs all of the flavours it is cooked in.”Is it good for me?According to Better Nature: “Tempeh has a similar amount of protein to chicken, more fibre than apples and is rich in gut-loving prebiotics.” Ross Longton, co-founder of Tiba Tempeh, says it has double the protein and six times the fibre of tofu. It sounds too good to be true. Is it?“Tempeh is a rich source of plant-based protein,” Gill confirms. “For example, 100g contains around 20g of protein.” That’s about two-thirds as much as a similar-size chicken breast.There’s more. “Tempeh contains isoflavones such as genistein and daidzin, which have been linked with several benefits, including improved cognition function, reduced menopausal symptoms and lowered cancer risk,” says Gill. “It is a source of B vitamins, including vitamin B12, which is normally found only in animal products.”Finally, she says: “The fermentation process increases the nutritional value because it breaks down complex nutrients – including proteins and fibre – into simpler, more digestible and absorbable forms. It also breaks down anti-nutrients [ie, substances that block the absorption of nutrients], such as phytates, which improves the bioavailability of minerals including iron, zinc and calcium.”What kinds can I buy?View image in fullscreenNew on the block … tempeh is sold in plain or smoky versions.Photograph: Petty ElliottOutside Indonesia, where it is traditionally wrapped in banana leaves, tempeh is sold in plain or smoky blocks, and as ready-to-use marinated pieces, mince and burgers. I tried some marinated pieces, shallow-fried until crispy and served with potato salad; a plain block, sliced and used in a stir-fry with satay sauce; and some mince, in place of tofu in a vegan ragu. All went down surprisingly well with my boyfriend, who will eat tofu only under duress. Next on my list is a smoky block, which Longton says makes a good bacon substitute: “Slice it, shallow-fry it and have it in a bagel with a bit of avocado or ketchup.”Tempeh aficionados may, like Lee, prefer to seek out small-batch, fresh tempeh, sold chilled in most Asian supermarkets.How do I cook it?“Nearly all Indonesians deep-fry their tempeh,” says Lee. “If an Indonesian sees someone trying to pan-fry their tempeh in an attempt to be healthy, they will think the world has gone mad. The savoury meatiness, umami flavour and texture of tempeh are amplified when it is deep-fried. Thin slices can be marinated in salt, water, ground coriander and minced garlic for 30 minutes, then drained and deep-fried in oil to make tempe goreng. The flavour is incredible and it is one of my favourite snacks.” Of all the styles of tempeh I tried, the deep-fried slices atToba, an Indonesian restaurant in central London, were definitely the most delicious, although the stewed tempeh in coconut milk sauce came a pretty close second.Toba, SW1: ‘The bliss is in the devilishly good detail’ – restaurant reviewRead more“In saying that, deep-frying for many western cooks is not second nature, so I usually offer a pan-fried option in my recipes, so it feels less daunting,” adds Lee. “One of the tricks in cooking with tempeh is that the more surface area is fried, the better it tastes. I learned the genius technique of crumbling tempeh into ‘tempeh rocks’ from the Dutch-Indonesian cookbook author Vanja van der Leeden. The tempeh is crumbled into small rocks and then shallow-fried in oil, maximising its texture and flavour.”For Indonesian authenticity, Lee suggests drizzling your cooked tempeh with kecap manis, a fermented sweet soy sauce, or eating it with sambal, a chilli condiment. She says it works with ginger, garlic, shallots, lemongrass and other spices and aromatics.View image in fullscreenFried flavours … Toba’s gulai daun singkong pete – a tempeh vegan curry.Photograph: Revano HanifHowever, “You can also use tempeh in non-Indonesian dishes, such as a tasty filling for tacos, in brunch bowls or even in bolognese,” says Lee. TheTiba TempehandBetter Naturewebsites have a host of recipes from all kinds of cuisines, including salads, stir-fries, curries,pastaand traybakes.Why is it suddenly so popular?Longton says that launching a tempeh brand in 2019 wasn’t easy. “It was a real slog for the first four years. We asked ourselves: do we really want to continue? But over the past two years, it has really picked up.” He thinks the main reasons for tempeh’s newfound popularity are that, compared with most other meat-free alternatives, it is “all-natural”, “considerably cheaper” and “far more nutritious”. “There’s a huge move away from ultra-processed food [UPF],” he says. “People want healthy wholefood products.”View image in fullscreenFrom tacos to bolognese, minced tempeh is adaptable … a tempeh pasta dish.Photograph: Petty ElliottIs it just for vegetarians and vegans?“In Indonesia, tempeh has the nickname ‘Javanese meat’,” says Lee. “It has always been a cheap source of protein and you’ll find it served almost daily in the family home. Meat is typically reserved for ceremonial occasions or eaten at restaurants.” Ideal, then, for flexitarians saving meat for special occasions, as well as plant-based eaters.Neither Tiba Tempeh nor Better Nature trumpet their vegan credentials on the front of the packs, preferring to focus on the high-protein, gut-friendly, non-UPF selling points instead. “The word ‘vegan’ can put people off; it’s polarising,” says Longton. “Meat reducers don’t want copies of meat – they’d rather have something completely different. We’re proud to be tempeh and we’re not trying to be anything else.”Is it still a staple in Indonesia?“Tempeh’s popularity waned shortly after Indonesia’s independence from the Dutch in 1945,” says Lee. “President Sukarno told the people: ‘We are a great nation; we are not a tempeh nation’ – referring to tempeh’s status as a soft-textured and cheap food. For decades, tempeh was looked down on as food for the poor and weak, but over time its status returned to its former glory, as national pride grew over tempeh’s Indonesian origins.”“Tempeh was traditionally associated with food for the poor, a bit likecucina poverain Italy,” agrees Elliott. “People didn’t know how nutritious it was. It’s only recently that awareness has been raised. Now people have realised it’s actually a superfood.”Is it sustainable?In the 2021 review, the researchers found that tempeh delivers protein far more efficiently than meat, based on the energy obtained versus the carbon emissions produced. They suggested it could be even more sustainable if it was made from locally grown legumes, grains and nuts, rather than imported soya beans. While Tiba Tempeh and Better Nature’s soya beans are sustainably sourced and non-GM, they come all the way from Canada. In Indonesia, says Lee, 90% of the soya beans used to make tempeh are GM and imported from the US.Although most commonly made from soya beans, tempeh can be made with other ingredients. Lee says: “The Indonesian Tempe Movementencourages farmers to make tempeh using locally sourced produce, and there are now more than 30 varieties that include other legumes, seeds, grains, cassava, coconut and even instant noodles. Even leftover soya-bean pulp from making soya milk can be turned into tempeh.” Elliott mentions the UK brandTempt Me Tempeh, which sells tempeh made from black turtle beans, pinto beans, chickpeas and more.But Longton believes soya beans are still best: “Soya is one of the most nutritious, efficient beans in the world.” Legions of new tempeh fans around the world seem to agree.Not tempted by tempeh?

But for some death is no longer considered an inevitability …Aleks KrotoskiSun 28 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 12.48 EDTShareImagine you’re the leader of one of the most powerful nations in the world. You have everything you could want at your disposal: power, influence, money. But, the problem is, your time at the top is fleeting. I’m not talking about the prospect of a coup or a revolution, or even a democratic election: I’m talking about the thing even more certain in life than taxes. I’m talking about death.In early September, China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin were caught on mic talking about strategies to stay young. “With the development of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, and people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality,” Putin said via an interpreter to Xi. “There’s a chance,” he continued, “of also living to 150 [years old].” But is this even possible, and what would it mean for the world if the people with power were able to live for ever?Over the centuries, we have used ever more sophisticated technology to heal ourselves into unprecedented longevity. In the 20th century, it was innovations in public health and medicine that effected this transformation, allowing today’s children to live longer, healthier lives than at any time in history. Yet that’s still not enough for some.I got curious about the growing cadre of billionaire investors coming from Silicon Valley who wanted to live for ever. What world were they imagining?I’ve been a technology reporter for 25 years, chronicling the rise of the web from its early days. I have reported on how it has transformed our social world, and I’ve railed against overzealous developers pushing disruptive innovations that inevitably come into conflict with society at large. I got curious about the growing cadre of billionaire investors coming fromSilicon Valleywho wanted to live for ever. What world were they imagining and building, and how would the rest of us fit into it? I’ve met people who have tried radical life-extending experiments and biohackers who swear the numbers will keep them for ever young, and seen inside Silicon Valley labs where technologists are planning a longevity revolution. I uncovered the motivations, ethical conundrums and doctrines that drive the belief that we are on the brink of eternal life, and that these immortalists are the people who will give it to us.There are several different types of immortality in this movement. There’s the literal live-for-ever kind, dominated by highly intelligent, mathematically minded computer scientists, philosophers and hopefuls who have an unwavering faith in the life-giving power of technology. They imagine that they will one day merge with artificial intelligence and become post-human, and will live for ever in a state of bliss and delight.Then there are the immortalists who want to reconstruct the infrastructure of the world we live in so that they can live for ever. Already, and in plain sight, they are restructuring sovereign nation states, pushing an agenda of technological acceleration at any cost. These powerful people aren’t searching for the fountain of youth – they’re building it.And still another version of immortality is parroted by people like Xi and Putin, who believe in the certainty of exponentially accelerating science and technology. Life will continue not by merging with tech, but by using it to slow down the onslaught of time, thereby allowing medical science to develop treatments that will heal us. They believe they are living proof of age reversal, physical rejuvenation and the ability to stop time.Imagine old age. What comes to mind? For many, it means losing faculties, and losing function. Ageing is something we all experience, at different rates and in different ways. In 2015, in the World Report on Ageing andHealth, the World Health Organization defined healthy ageing as “the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that maintains wellbeing in older age”. Key to this definition is functional ability, or “intrinsic capacity” – “the health-related attributes that enable people to be and to do what they have reason to value”.That’s because what you want to do when you’re 80 is not what you want to do when you’re 20, nor do you necessarily want to do the same things that someone else does. Say you want to go skydiving at 80, but can’t get on the plane because it’s become more difficult to get upstairs, your functional ability has declined. If you’re 80 and you have no physical trouble getting on the plane, but you have cataracts and you’d rather read than parachute, your functional ability has also declined. So it’s not just the presence, relative encroachment or absence of a disease, or even the absolute number of years of life that’s important, but the quality and the quantity of those years in the context of a range of other factors, such as lifestyle.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianThere is growing evidence that there is something biological underlying how we age – and some out-there researchers are trying to figure out how to tweak itThe term used for this in age research is “healthspan” – and the objective in most contemporary science in this field is to increase it. Healthspan means staying healthy for longer, and keeping the diseases of old age at bay. It means keeping your body young, intervening in the process of growing old, and considering the possibility of “rejuvenation”.This is where “respectable” science gasps: “the fringe of the fringe”, a doctor colleague said to me dismissively when I mentioned I was researching the topic. Yet there is a growing body of evidence that there is something biological underlying how we age – and some out-there researchers, funded by Silicon Valley, are trying to figure out how to tweak it, so that our bodies actually can go backwards in time.It started in the 1990s, when a young molecular biologist named Cynthia Kenyon and her postgrad student Ramon Tabtiang designed several landmark experiments with a tiny nematode calledC.elegans. Their findings suggested that tweaking a gene doubled the lifespans of these creatures.Kenyon gave a talk at Stanford University not long afterwards. “She looked like a super-young, very hip professor,” says Irina Conboy, who was there with her then boyfriend Mike, both PhD students at the time. “And she suggested that simply by changing the intensity of certain molecules, you can make an old animal younger.”When I meet Irina and Mike Conboy in their office – now married, they are both professors in the bioengineering department at the University of California, Berkeley – they are wearing matching tie-dye sweatshirts, and finishing each other’s sentences. They are charming, warm and a bit shambolic. Their tiny white pup is comfortably chewing on his leg on a saggy sofa, next to a sheaf of papers.The couple have one big question when it comes to ageing: “So why is it that all the tissues of the body seem to grow old together?” Mike asks. “It doesn’t matter whether they’re on the outside or on the inside, whether they’re exercised or going along for the ride. Everything seems to go to heck in a handbasket with age.” They wondered if there was some kind of signal in the body that changes the molecular structure of muscles, and ages them all simultaneously. They set out to find out what all tissues have in common.Think back to your biology class in school, and you might remember those hand-drawn anatomy posters with elaborate illustrations and labels for each part of the body: the skeletal system – the body’s framework of bones, ligaments, cartilage and joints that gives us structure and shape; the nervous system – the network that transmits electrical signals between our brain and the rest of our body; and the vascular system – the blood-vessel pipelines that take nutrients and oxygen to our muscles. Could it be that some sort of ageing alarm was passed through the body via one of these systems?“The ideal experiment would be, ‘OK, what if we transplanted a young nervous system into an old mouse,’” says Mike. “Well, we can’t technically do that. What if we put a young vascular system in an old mouse? We can’t do that, either.”Irina looks at me with a twinkle in her eye while Mike continues. “What if we put young blood into an old mouse?” he says. This would have to be more than a one-off injection – they would need to transfer a large proportion of blood from a young mouse to an old one to make sure there was an observable effect.“What if we connected the young and old mouse together? You can take an old mouse and stitch it to a young mouse, and instead of the skin healing edge to edge of the old mouse, it heals across edge to edge to the young mouse,” Mike explains, describing a technique known as parabiosis. “As that tissue heals, blood vessels re-form there. Now you have blood slowly trickling from one animal to the other and back and forth.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianThe Conboys had discovered a fountain of youth, but they had no idea why or how it workedBetween 2003 and 2004, they sutured three categories of mice together: young and old, young and young, and old and old. They let the blood flow for five weeks, and then gave each mouse an injury in its hind leg muscle. Five days later, the mice with the young blood – including the old ones – recovered “robustly”, unlike the untampered-with oldies, whose muscles regenerated “typical of aged animals”.The team tried again elsewhere, with injuries on other body parts. The liver, same thing. The brain, same thing. As the results began to trickle in over the lifespan of their conjoined rodents, the Conboys were able to conclusively say that the tissues of the old mice looked more like the tissues of a young mouse – whether they were in the muscles or in the liver or in the brain.Somethingin the young blood rejuvenated the old tissues. In 2005, theypublished their results in Nature.The Conboys had discovered a fountain of youth, but they had no idea why or how it worked.Scientific knowledge is more of a process than a single moment in time. The path to today is littered with old, disproven ideas that, perhaps, were actually the stepping stones that got us to where we are now. The road to longevity is no different.In 1889, in Paris,Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, a distinguished and celebrated physiologist and member of the Royal Society, stood before an esteemed audience of peers at the Société de Biologie and gave what became his most famous presentation. Sensing himself growing old at the age of 72, Brown-Séquard had started investigating loss of sexual function, and claimed to have found the right treatment: an injection into both of his arms of a mixture of blood taken from the gonads, semen and “juice extracted from a testicle” of a dog or a guinea pig.He was met with stunned silence. There had been research suggesting that something as yet unidentified in the sex organs was a salve for the effects of age (at least in men). After his treatment, Brown-Séquard reported improved energy levels, muscle rejuvenation, cognitive functioning, and heightened abilities and skills in the bedroom. Alas, it proved to be a potent form of placebo effect.However, one of Brown-Séquard’s apprentices was Serge “Samuel” Voronoff, also a student under the eugenicistAlexis Carrel, a Nobel laureate and pioneer of organ transplantation. Voronoff took his mentors’ two novel ideas – putting an organ from one body into another, and the mysterious rejuvenating power of testicles – and tested his own theory of rejuvenation: he transplanted sex glands from the young into the old. Specifically, he transplanted fragments of monkey testicles into older men’s scrotums. In 1923, he appeared before scientists at the International Congress of Surgeons in London, informing them that the procedure had been so successful that the Pasteur Institute had built him a chimpanzee-breeding compound in west Africa.Within two decades, more than 45 surgeons around the world used his technique more than 2,000 times; 500 men were operated on in France alone. Voronoff published books and papers, and was quoted as saying that life could span more than 140 years; the press described the outcomes as miraculous and life-changing. In Brazil, where he was a minor celebrity, Voronoff inspired carnival songs. But his celebrity faded when his methods were proven to be less effective than what appeared to be the enigmatic active agent: testosterone, isolated by Ernst Laqueur in 1935.Both men, learned and respectable, had pulled on a thread of scientific research that seemed logical. Yet both were off the mark. At the time, the gold standard of regulatory checks hadn’t yet been established to ensure that the treatment they were proposing was both safe and effective. Today, the equivalent treatments have been, and young blood is dancing around it.In 2016, Jesse Karmazin, a Stanford Medical School graduate, opened Ambrosia Health’s doors in a business park near a redwood forest in Monterey, California, to run an experiment testing the Conboys’ hypothesis, but in humans. There still wasn’t much to go on aboutwhyyoung blood appeared to reverse ageing – in the decade of research since their papers on parabiosis, only a few molecular and hormonal candidates had surfaced, but even in these the evidence for them was inconclusive, and all of it was in mice.Karmazin decided to run a human trialof his own as a private company, and charged an entry fee to anyone over the age of 35 who wanted to take part: $8,000 to have biomarkers measured, to receive a transfusion of one litre of young plasma from a donor between the ages of 16 and 25, and to have their biomarkers measured again for comparison.He phoned Irina Conboy to see what she thought; she declined involvement. She didn’t agree with the premise, she tells me – Karmazin’s study didn’t “fit very well”. There wasn’t enough evidence that positive effects would be reflected so broadly. Yet, even without her endorsement, the company and the trial got more than 100 press mentions in under two years.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The Guardian‘If the goal is to stop ageing, or to gradually become younger – we  don’t have it now. But if you invest correctly, we will have it soon’Jesselyn Cook was a tech reporter at the Huffington Post at the time. “Karmazin was quoted saying things like, ‘It works, it reverses ageing’, and ‘I’m not really in the camp of saying this will provide immortality, but I think it comes pretty close,’” she says. “It doesn’t matter if you were young, wanting to feel extra capable, or if you were old and trying to, in his own words, reverse your age,” Cook tells me. “It just seemed like no matter what the problem was, Ambrosia could help.”By 2019, Ambrosia Health had a total of five clinics around the US, and Karmazin was hinting he was looking to open another in Manhattan. Other private clinics, also claiming to carry out research studies, had popped up, offering paying clients young blood transfusions. Yet young plasma treatments for the physical and cognitive effects of age had never been approved by the FDA, which released a statement in February that year citing concerns that patients were being “preyed upon” by “unscrupulous actors” touting the treatments as “cures and remedies”. Ambrosia Health went dark within hours.When I exchanged emails with Karmazin in 2023, he told me: “The FDA never reviewed our data before making their announcement … I have no idea if they were ever aware of Ambrosia, in fact. It is entirely possible they were referring to our competitors, who acted with less diligence and respect for the rules.”“If you think that you can simply go and do the procedure and become younger – not yet,” Irina Conboy says to me when I bring up the Ambrosia Health story. “If the goal is to stop ageing and plateau, or start to gradually become younger, I would just say that, right now, we don’t have it. But if you invest correctly, your time and efforts and resources, we will have it soon. That is my feeling about it. Soon.”“Soon” is exactly what some longevity pioneers are banking on.When I spoke with “rejuvenation athlete”Bryan Johnsonin 2023, he was 45 years old. The biohacker and tech entrepreneur had used his Blueprint algorithm to help him “reverse” time, by devising a strict protocol of supplements, nutrition, and exercise that would bring his “biological” age significantly lower than his “chronological” age. He had also dabbled in young plasma therapy; his teenage son Talmadge had become what Johnson called his “blood boy” for a short time while Johnson’s medical team assessed whether there was any truth to the rumours of blood’s benefits. Johnson ultimately discontinued the treatment with his son, but still tweets about going to the clinic every few months to pick up several litres of albumin – the protein in plasma – like a regular longevity oil change.On Johnson’s 46th birthday, he tested his biological age again. His objective over the previous 12 months of the protocol was to see if Blueprint could help him stay the same biological age for a whole year. His computer appeared to be doing its job:his body was ageing at a rate of 277 days for every 365.Now, holding back time for one year may not seem enough to live for ever, but here’s why it might: think of it like a rocket leaving the Earth. It needs to reach a certain speed to overcome the pull of gravity. This is called escape velocity. Now imagine that through treatments, lifestyle changes and prayers you could stop yourself from ageing. The idea is that you would eventually reach the point where each age-related disease, such as dementia or diabetes, and those that we don’t know about yet, will have been cured before your body ages into them. You would escape the pull of mortality. This is called longevity escape velocity. Fundamentally, this isn’t living for ever; it’s not dying today.The escape velocity cusp is closer than most of us would imagine, maintains gerontologist Dr Aubrey de Grey, who coined the term in 2004 and now runs private research group theLEV Foundation. Two decades ago, he predicted that, as we are already so long-lived, “even a 30% increase in healthy life span will give the first beneficiaries of rejuvenation therapies another 20 years – an eternity in science – to benefit from second-generation therapies that would give another 30%, and so on ad infinitum”.Longevity escape velocity relies on a major mathematical assumption: that technology can keep up with the heterogeneity of human decline. The conditions that affect you when you’re young are – medically speaking – relatively simple. But the illnesses of old age could be said to grow in severity at an exponential rate. Johnson has to stay young, or an age-related disease that can’t yet be treated will kill him. If you are trying to age in reverse, you would need to be living in a time when treatments and technologies both improve at the same exponential rate. These people are literally racing against the clock.They believe in an idea calledMoore’s law– a widely held observation that predicts that every 18 months, computer technology gets twice as good. Moore’s law is the reason the phone that you have in your hand costs around the same as the last model (not taking into account inflation), but is twice as powerful.Everything from MRI scans to drug discovery to protein folding is now being regarded as a computational problem, therefore the idea goes that modern medicine, too, should be characterised by an exponential increase of capability. If every 18 months it gets twice as powerful at keeping you alive, what will medicine be like in 20 years’ time? And if you figure out how not to age in that time, you begin to understand why living to 200 years seems like something that could happen.Technofundamentalists believe that ever advancing technology should be able to solve the ever more complex problems we throw at it. So if the body can be expressed as data and we can figure out how to fix it when it goes wrong, why aren’t we already living for ever? Life – mortality – is complicated.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianTruly, all of this radical technological and governance innovation will not help the rest of us live longer, healthier livesIn his2024 book Why We Die, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnandescribes “the characteristic arrogance that many physicists and computer scientists display toward biologists” that causes the engineers to miss something crucial. That something may by physical, but it’s more likely to be something impossible to break down into data. Seamus O’Mahony, the doctor and prize-winning author ofThe Way We Die Now, found this when he went to a longevity conference in 2025. “They are interested only in the biomolecular and the monetisable,” he says. “I heard a great deal over the four days about AI-designed drugs, glycans, the transcriptome ageing clock, but almost nothing on the complexity of death systems and the social determinants of death and dying. They seemed strangely uncurious about the enemy they have declared war on. Ageing to them is simply a technical problem that can, and will, be fixed.”The irony is that the mechanistic metaphor that served us so well is now dramatically impeding further progress. Too much faith in data and engineering overlooks the value of the unknown and the unknowable. In order to defeat ageing and death, we must bend to the technical tools that are supposed to serve us – from spreadsheets to large language models. We must become more like appliances. “This impulse, this motivation, this moral mandate to want to improve yourself means we must become like a machine,” says Dr Elke Schwarz, political theorist at Queen Mary University of London.Yet “we live an inconvenient life”, says Schwartz. “We are weird. We are messy. Our bodies are mortal. We die. Why can’t we be like products? Why can’t we be like the things that computer scientists make that they can improve and fine-tune?” Because we aren’t. Yet this is the starting point for how Silicon Valley intends to “fix” mortality, and their simple solutions – and what they need to achieve them – are on the radar of some of the most powerful people in the world.In 2025, Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office with bold ambitions to rework the US government. Flanking him at his inauguration were representatives of the largest tech companies in the world, all of whom have thrown their weight and their Silicon Valley wealth behind America’s AI future.In the months since January 2025, Trump has granted them access to finances and infrastructure that will ensure that AI is the driving force behind the US economy; it will also propel the technological search for eternal life. They believe it is a moral imperative to use technology to enhance the body and mind towards immortality.Regulation is standing in their way, and regulation is what Trump’s team is dismantling. In the early part of 2025, Elon Musk’s Doge implemented actions that significantlyaffected research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and regulatory oversight of the FDA. The department cancelled leases, reduced the workforce in the FDA’s Office of Digital Transformation, and terminated hundreds of research projects valued at billions of dollars.Techno-libertarianPeter Thiel, longevity investor and co-founder of PayPal, has assisted with the placement of former colleagues and staffers in positions where they can help dissolve government oversight. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – until recently RFK Jr’s right hand man – is Jim O’Neill, a longtime Thiel ally who in 2014 suggested reforms to the FDA “so that it’s approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety – and let people start using them, at their own risk, but not much risk of safety”, which might include unproven longevity treatments using “young blood”.The cost of giving so much to the technofundamentalist dream of AI immortality has been that resources have been allocated away from initiatives that support people who are getting older today. The administration proposed cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars to Medicare – the social support network for healthcare for millions of US citizens over the age of 65 – and cancelled the White House Conference onAgeing, a flagship event held every 10 years since 1961 to determine the strategic direction for policy to support older Americans.Truly, all of this radical technological and governance innovation will not help the rest of us live longer, healthier lives.It’s easy to roll our eyes at people like Xi and Putin who wish for immortality, and to dismiss their delusions of grandeur. They believe we are on the brink of radically extended life, and that they, uniquely in history, are the ones who will help build the machines that will get us there.‘People can get younger, perhaps even immortal’: Putin’s pursuit of longevityRead moreBut consider this: the technologists who fundamentally believe in the immortality project – whether they want to literally live for ever, or are building AI that they think will usher in the next enlightenment – are enjoying unparalleled political access to the leaders of the world, and they are once again building our future.For the immortalists of Silicon Valley and the rich and the powerful like Xi and Putin, death is not considered an inevitability. Although organ transplantation for eternal life is science fiction, they do have a head start in the race to longevity escape velocity, simply because they can afford cutting-edge treatments, personalised protocols, and as much young blood as they can morally handle. They can live on: as kingmakers, rulers of the world, or bits of computer code that carry their essence throughout the cosmos. But as they remodel the world in their image, they promote the myth that human beings are only as complex as computer code. These are the ideas that are laying the groundwork for an eternal for ever. But we do have a choice about whether to accept them – or to live in the here and now.The Immortalists by Aleks Krotoski is published by Bodley Head on 23 October at £22.

One in seven primary schools in the UK do not have a library, according to the National Literacy Trust, rising to one in four for disadvantaged areas.Children’s authors including Cressida Cowell and the Gruffalo illustrator, Axel Scheffler, welcomed the scheme. “A school library is more than just a room full of books,” Scheffler said. “It’s a place where imaginations grow, confidence builds, and a lifelong love of reading takes root.”Reeves, for whom educational opportunity is a personal priority, will make the announcement in her speech to theLabourparty conference, where she will also unveil plans to get thousands of young people back into work.Young people on universal credit who have been out of work or education for 18 months will be guaranteed an offer of paid work. “I can commit this government to nothing less than the abolition of long-term youth unemployment,” she will say.Claimants will face sanctions such as losing their benefits, however, if they refuse to take up jobs under the scheme without a reasonable excuse. It has echoes ofGeorge Osborne’s “workfare” schemein 2013, which brought in tighter benefits sanctions.The chancellor will make the case in her speech for a society founded on “contribution”.She will say: “I believe in a Britain founded on contribution, where we do our duty for each other, and where hard work is matched by fair reward. I believe in a Britain based on opportunity, where ordinary kids can flourish, unhindered by their background.”The focus on “contribution” comes amid concerns among some in Labour that the government needs to offer voters a clearer vision of its agenda.Keir Starmer told the BBC on Sunday that he hoped that by the end of the conference, people “can’t say they don’t know what we stand for, what this government is trying to achieve”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will not stand by while a generation is consigned to benefits almost before they’ve begun.“We will not accept that school pupils full of promise become adults full of frustration. We cannot, we will not, allow wasted talent to become Britain’s story. The youth guarantee is how we will offer every young person a chance to get up and get on.”Reeves is expected to place strong emphasis on economic responsibility in her speech, despite pressure from some in the party to rethink her fiscal rules. Labour sources suggested, however, that she was unlikely to start rolling the pitch for inevitable tax rises at the budget.The chancellor faces the prospect of having to find up to £30bn in tax rises or spending cuts on 26 November if, as expected, the Office for Budget Responsibility cuts its forecast for future productivity growth to match the consensus of other experts.Explore more on these topicsLabour conferenceLabourRachel ReevesEducation policyPrimary schoolsUnemploymentEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

In 2019, the average was below 800,000.Jobs site Indeed recently said graduates in the UK were facingthe toughest job market since 2018as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs.Healthcare and teaching continue to be among the hardest-hit areas of the labour market, with vacancies in the health sector down by 6.7% after a fall of more than 10% in July. Teacher vacancies fell by 6.4% in August, while hospitality was down 6.5%.Jobseekers’ prospects also varied significantly depending on where they were in the UK. In the south-west, there were 1.3 people competing for every job, with the south-east registering 1.46.But the picture in the north-east was much tougher. There, 3.36 people battled over each vacancy, followed by 3.25 in Northern Ireland and 3.14 in the West Midlands.Senior figures in the retail and hospitality industries haveraised concerns recently that job seekers face mounting challenges, citing factors including the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and higher costs for employers after last year’s budget.Unemployment remains at a four-year high of 4.7%, while Adzuna’s figures showed that the average number of job seekers per vacancy across the UK has risen slightly from 1.93 to 2.Overall, the number of available positions fell to 846,567 in August, 2.1% below both the figure registered in the previous month and 1.3% below the same month of last year.The year-on-year fall ended a five-month run in which the number of vacancies had risen year on year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, warehouse worker positions climbed to the top of the rankings.The fastest increase in vacancies came in the domestic help and cleaning sector, up 6.8%, followed by human resources and recruitment (5.1%) and retail (3.7%).Andrew Hunted, Adzuna’s co-founder, said the appetite for hiring was “uneven and increasingly shaped by a mix of sector-specific swings and the growing role of AI within the UK labour market”.He added: “It’s a reminder that the market is still finding its balance as emerging technologies, shifting skills demand, and macro-economic conditions continue to redefine where and how employers are hiring.”The average time to fill a role reached 37.3 days in August, almost a day longer than the previous month’s 36.3 days.Hospitality and catering roles were filled almost a week faster than the previous month, averaging 31.9 days compared with 38.4 days, while IT roles slowed sharply, taking 50 days compared with 40.3 days the month before.Employers also dialled down transparency over what prospective candidates would be paid.

Medics reported 16 more deaths in strikes on homes in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to at least 21. The Gaza health ministry said later that Israeli fire had killed at least 77 people in the previous 24 hours.Hamas’s armed wing urged the Israeli military to halt airstrikes temporarily and withdraw from part of Gaza City on Sunday to allow it to locate two Israeli hostages it said it had lost contact with there.“The lives of the two prisoners are in real danger and [Israeli] forces must immediately withdraw … and halt aerial operations for 24 hours … to allow attempts to rescue the prisoners,” the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement.There was no immediate response from Israel, where Hamas has previously been accused of exploiting the hostages to wage “psychological warfare”.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinian boys in Deir al-Balah.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is expected to visit the White House on Monday, told Fox News Sunday that Israel was working on a new ceasefire plan with the White House.“We’re working on it,” he said. “It’s not been finalized yet, but we’re working with President Trump’s team, actually as we speak, and I hope we can – we can make it a go.”Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday: “We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!”He promised at the start of his second term in office a quick end to the war but eight months later a resolution remains elusive.Speaking at the UN on Friday, Netanyahu vowed to “finish the job” against Hamas, days after Britain, France and other western powersrecognised a state of Palestine.Trump has floated a 21-point proposal for an immediate ceasefire that includes the release of all hostages within 48 hours, the disarmament of Hamas, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to news reports in the US and Israel.A Hamas official said the group had been briefed on the plan but had yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators.Israel is likely to come under new international pressure in the coming days as an international aid flotilla nears its territorial waters. The flotilla stopped for several days in Greek waters for repairs but set sail on Sunday for Gaza, where activists including Greta Thunberg intend to challenge Israel’s naval blockade and deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.On Sunday Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani,repeated a proposal made last week for the flotilla to take the aid to Cyprus for eventual distribution in Gaza by the Roman Catholic church. The flotilla, which was struck in international waters off Crete on Wednesday by drones armed with stun grenades and irritants, rejected the suggestion.Israel has previously said it will use any means to prevent the boats from reaching Gaza.The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 incursion into Israel during which militants killed 1,219 people, mostly civilians. Of the 251 people abducted during the attack, 47 are still held in Gaza, including 25 whom the Israeli military says are dead.The ensuing Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 66,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000. Much of the territory has been reduced to rubble and famine has been declared in parts of its some northern areas.In the occupied West Bank on Sunday, Israeli security forces shot dead an alleged attacker in a car-ramming incident in which an Israeli man was seriously injured at a junction near Nablus. Hamas praised the attack.Violence has surged in the West Bank, which alongside Gaza and East Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the six-day war in 1967 and which the Palestinians want as their future state.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That was an increase from £2.8m the year before, when Pulp and The Chemical Brothers headlined the Friday and Saturday night lineups.The 2026 headliners will be The Cure, Lewis Capaldi and Calvin Harris, organisers announced on Monday.The festival began in 1968 and achieved worldwide fame –and notoriety– two years later when an estimated 600,000 people descended on an island whose permanent population numbered just 100,000.The 1970 lineup featured the Who, Miles Davis, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Jethro Tull and Sly and the Family Stone, as well as a set by Jimi Hendrix just weeks before his death, in which he played a heavily distorted version of God Save the Queen.One of the attenders that year was John Giddings, who has run the festival since 2002. Since 2017 the festival has been part of a sprawling corporate network of UK live music events all ultimately owned by the vast and sometimes controversial US events and ticketing business Live Nation.Accounts filed at Companies House show that Isle of Wight Festival Ltd paid a £2.6m dividend, up from £1.9m in 2023, to its immediate parent, UK Festival Holdings Ltd, a holding company that also runs festivals such as Reading.That company is too small to publish detailed accounts. The firm immediately above it in the ownership chain, LN-Gaiety Holdings Ltd, is a conduit for dividends from Live Nation’s UK events. LN-Gaiety Holdings has reported nearly £34m in dividend income over the past two years for which accounts are available.In 2023 it paid out nearly £49m in dividends to LNGH Ireland Ltd, a holding company in Ireland, where corporation tax rates are lower than in the UK.Los Angeles-based Live Nation, which also owns Ticketmaster, bought theIsle of Wight festivalin 2017 during a period of expansion. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) cleared the deal, saying the event was not a rival to the company’s portfolio of about 20 UK festivals including Reading, Leeds and Download.Live Nation is facing alawsuit in the USfor allegedly allowing ticket touts to make millions of dollars at fans’ expense. It is also the subject oflegal action from the US department of justiceover an alleged dominance of the live events industry that “suffocates” competition at the expense of fans.In the UK, the competition watchdog has forced Live Nation’s subsidiary Ticketmaster tochange how it advertisesconcert tickets, including ending “misleading” information about the seats they are buying, after a fan backlash over its handling of the Oasis reunion tour.Explore more on these topicsMusic industryIsle of Wight festivalMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Two miserly points from 11 matches. So easy to say, much harder to actually accomplish. Anybody in any doubt about that need only askLuke Donald.ARyder Cupbroke out under the blaring sun at Bethpage Black on Sunday. The competitive spirit summoned by the United States of America ultimately was not enough to rip the 17-inch trophy back from Europe’s grasp but wow, did they give Donald and his players a shuddering fright. A singles session that started with the visitors eyeing a procession and record breaking was dominated by Keegan Bradley’s US team. Donald surely feared one of the worst sporting capitulations of our time. How would they recover? How would Europe’s golfers ever recover?Ryder Cup 2025: USA 12-14 Europe as Lowry helps visitors retain trophy after epic singles finale – liveRead moreThey have been spared that nightmare. It was notRory McIlroy, Justin Rose or Tommy Fleetwood who carried Europe over the line at Bethpage. Instead, Donald and his players collapsed in an exhausted heap as Shane Lowry holed out from 6ft on the final green of match eight to ensure at least a draw. The record books will show a European win, 15-13. They will not depict the breathlessness.For Lowry, this was as epic a moment as when he won the 2019 Open Championship. A golfing continent exhaled as Lowry danced across the putting surface with unbridled joy. “That was the hardest couple of hours of my whole life,” a tearful Lowry said. “ I can’t believe that putt went in. The Ryder Cup means everything to me.”How precarious this situation was can be explained by the fact that when Lowry took to the 18th tee, Europe held no lead in the four games left on the course. The Irishman was one down. Russell Henley hit a glorious bunker shot to set up a chance of sealing his point. Henley, incredibly, left his putt short. Cometh the hour, cometh the Offaly man.This was, eventually, a triumph for Donald’s diligence and planning. It should also, though, serve as a reference point for spectator behaviour. Too much of what transpired in New York, largely towards the visiting team, should never be seen at a Ryder Cup again.Golfshould be proud of its failure to embrace a yobbish culture. It should recoil at the abuse dished out to Europe as they rampaged towards victory. Adare Manor in 2027 has to and surely will be totally different. McIlroy’s defeat by Scottie Scheffler was due in no small part to the mental exhaustion suffered by the Masters champion. The treatment of McIlroy over three days here was disgraceful.View image in fullscreenEurope captain Luke Donald celebrates after Tyrrell Hatton halves his match on the 18th hole during the singles to win the Ryder Cup.Photograph: Paul Childs/ReutersThere was an on-course ruckus to add to the mix. Bradley became irritated by the drop given to Rose – or the time taken to decide on it – on the 13th, the Englishman’s second shot to the par five having found a road. After a delay of about 15 minutes, with Bradley still chuntering in the ear of a referee, Rose played from scrubland at the back of a spectator stand; quite wonderfully, as it transpired. Rose’s shot finished within 6ft of the hole, from where he converted to pull one back against Cameron Young. As Rose won the 14th as well, Young’s lead was suddenly under threat. Bradley continued to mump and moan. Young lightened his captain’s mood with an 11ft putt on the final green to snatch a point from game one.Justin Thomas backed up Young by seeing off Fleetwood, again on the last. Bryson DeChambeau had been five down after seven to Matt Fitzpatrick but rescued half a point. “I love my country,” said DeChambeau, in typically understated fashion. Scheffler’s game with McIlroy also went the distance, the world No 1 signing off from what was overall a disappointing tournament on a high.“This has been a really special team and it’s been a lot of fun,” Scheffler said. He is, however, clearly far more at home in individual battle. Light relief for Donald was supplied by Ludvig Åberg, who beat Patrick Cantlay 2&1. Half a point needed. Half a point!Red was added to the leaderboard by Xander Schauffele, who defeated Jon Rahm, and JJ Spaun’s success over Sepp Straka. Europe were now firmly in squeaky bum territory. Rasmus Højgaard was struggling against Ben Griffin in the battle of the Ryder Cup rookies and Tyrrell Hatton was locked in a tense battle against Collin Morikawa. Could match 11 of 11, where Robert MacIntyre was taking on Sam Burns, really be pivotal? Lowry ended that notion. Griffin prevailed, Hatton halved with Morikawa, before Burns three-putted the last for the same result. Europe won just one singles game to the US half-dozen.Europe’s Sunday task had been simplified further by the removal of Viktor Hovland from the singles because of a neck injury. In what was a rare example of the Ryder Cup’s envelope rule, the US player pre-determined by Bradley to sit out in a scenario such as this was revealed as Harris English. Both teams took half a point. In keeping with the tone of this competition, US fans heckled Hovland as he watched his teammates from the fairways. And, one assumes, between his fingernails.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupLuke DonaldRory McIlroyJustin RoseUS sportsGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts say such spaces can play a role in radicalisationFar-right Facebook groups are engine of radicalisation in UK, data investigation suggestsPamela Duncan,Raphael Hernandes,Elena Morresi,Pablo Gutiérrez,Garry BlightandLydia McMullanSun 28 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 14.02 EDTShareFar-right ideas are gaining ground. They are thriving in online worlds which are not easily visible to large swathes of the public but which spread misinformation that has real-world consequences.Take last year. In the summer of 2024, riots broke out across parts of the UK, fuelled by misinformation thatspread on social media.The violent disorder was primarily aimed at asylum seekers and Muslims, including an incident of rioterssetting fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers.The rioting was as surprising as it was appalling. It was mostly carried out bylocal peoplewhowere not members of formal far-right organisations. Some rejected the far-right label, carrying banners that read: “We’re not far-right, we’re just right.”What we found was a community bound together by a deep distrust of government and its institutions, whose members trade in anti-immigrant sentiment, nativism, conspiracy and misinformation.Experts say their posts include content that is far-right and extremist, and that such online spaces can play a role in radicalisation.Loading...Membership of one of these groups does not signify any wrongdoing – for example, we found a small number of posts calling out racism – and there will inevitably be users who joined these groups through curiosity or because their friends had.However, experts to whom we showed our findings said some comments posted in the groups were far-right in their nature. They pointed to a worrying normalisation of far-right ideologies onFacebook, still the world’s largest online social media platform.Here is an overview of the key themes observed in the groups since their inception through to mid-May 2025, alongside expert analysis of the psychological processes driving this content.1. Distrust of mainstream institutionsMany of the group members expressed support forReform UK, with a sizeable proportion of the posts – about two in five of the sample – voicing widespread criticism of government institutions and figures, including anti-establishment and populist rhetoric.In many of the posts, this included the use of contemptuous, dehumanising or villainising language. Ingrained in these posts was a deep-seated distrust of mainstream politics and various mechanisms of the state: Labour and the Conservatives were “traitors”, “treacherous”, “scum”; the police and the judiciary “two-tier”; the media “controlled” – even the RNLI was villainised as a “taxi service” for “illegals”.FB_POSTS_1Anki Deo of the advocacy group Hope Not Hate said the main beneficiary of the loss of trust in institutions was Reform. She said the party was part of a wider ecosystem – which included GB News, social media influencers, far-right political groups and others with non-electoral aims – all of which drove anti-establishment rhetoric.This in turn spilled into these Facebook groups, “filling the gap” for “people who are disillusioned with their usual parties and general politics”.She said the Guardian’s deep-dive analysis of three of the groups in the network pointed to a worrying online environment: “Public Facebook groups like those used for the data sample contain a mixture of political discussion alongside extremely harmful language.”Sander van der Linden, a professor of social psychology at Cambridge University, who has researched the impact of conspiracy and misinformation and its connection to extremism, said the undermining of democratic institutions on display in these groups echoed fascist methods used throughout history.“Generally, fascists and extremists are trying to undermine institutions of truth, facts and education because that is what’s standing in their way – an informed citizenry,” he said.However, he said the people reading these posts – or even posting themselves – were unlikely to be aware that attacking the credibility of mainstream institutions was a tactic associated with the current far right.“Regular people interacting with this content often don’t know that they’re part of some playbook or agenda. Political elites and opinion leaders such as Farage, [the far-right party] Homeland, or Tommy Robinson do take a page out of the fascist playbook and are using it to dupe regular people into engaging with their rhetoric. So they come up with a narrative such as ‘the mainstream media is lying to you’, or ‘scientific institutions are looking to censor people’.“And then they try to get regular people to support, amplify and engage with those topics.”Dr Julia Ebner, a radicalisation researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and an expert on online radicalisation, said it was worrying that populist parties, including Reform, were increasingly using a rhetoric that fuelled some of the key radicalisation elements online – whether the undermining of institutions, out-group demonisation, existential threat ideas or the emphasis on a victimised in-group of patriots.“If Reform UK doesn’t want to be considered far-right it has to make a better effort to distance itself from the most extreme voices supporting its political agenda. Likewise, many Reform UK voters might not like to be associated with far-right ideas but it is important that they are aware of the psychological elements driving all forms of extremism,” she said.2. The scapegoating of immigrantsImmigration has become one of the most important issues for British voters, with two-thirds of adultspolled in Maysaying the total number of people entering the UK was too high.Posts in the network about immigration were commonplace, making up about one in seven of the entries captured in our sample.Our analysis differentiated between criticism of government policy or migration statistics and demeaning, dehumanising, generalised or out-and-out racist posts.One in 10 fell into this latter category.FB_POSTS_3The pattern of demonisation in the Facebook groups was noticeable in our analysis, with some posts portraying migrants as dangerous, deceitful, criminal or culturally incompatible.Others were more subtle, using insinuations and generalisations about “military-aged men” and “grooming gangs” – both commonly used in these forums as coded language for an inherent threat – or the broad-stroke labelling of all immigrants as “illegals” or an “invasion”.Ebner said participation in this kind of discourse played a role in radicalisation. “Immigrants are often the scapegoats, especially in far-right extremist communities [where they are] systematically demonised and dehumanised.”The issue, she said, was that the gradual condoning of or justification for extremist ideologies – including the demonising and dehumanising language used about immigrants seen here – could form part of a “toxic cocktail”, resulting in riots or violence against groups or individuals.Deo, of Hope Not Hate, noted that while many people had legitimate grievances, such as the cost of living crisis or the decline of their local high street, the scapegoating of immigration was not legitimate.“The way in which they’re engaging [with these issues] is rarely in and of itself – it’s always in contrast to another group. The conversation around the welfare system, for example, which is legitimate, is very often based on this premise of mistruth, which is that people who immigrate to the UK can just instantly access benefits.”While overt racism was rare in these groups – as is to be expected in a Facebook-moderated space withguidelinesabout what constitutes hate content – it wasn’t wholly absent: immigrants were variously described as “criminal”, “parasites”, “primitive”, “scum”, “lice” or having “dinosaur” beliefs or values.Some of these posts were still accessible on the site in mid-May, months or years after being posted, despite Meta’scommunity standardsand the groups’ own stated rules.3.‘White British people are fed up’Alongside anti-immigrant sentiment, there was a strong vein of nativism, with the posters tending to cling to a common in-group identity – that of being “indigenous”, “British”, “white” and “Christian” – which they perceived to be under threat, saying Britons were now “second-class citizens”.One in 25 posts in our sample fell into this bucket. Deo said the implication in this grouping was that “white, British or English people are the pure group and everyone else is other”.FB_POSTS_9The repetitive nature of this messaging can be particularly harmful, according to Van der Linden. He said that the psychological mechanism at play here, when this kind of post is frequently appearing in someone’s social media feed, was one of “illusory truth”.“The more often you hear something, the more likely your brain is to think that it’s true. So the more you keep hearing that immigrants are replacing the white population, the more it starts to feel like that is something that must be true. There’s social reinforcement.”Ebner said that the posts in this group included a perceived “existential threat” to the in-group, as well as some signs of “identity fusion” – feelings of oneness with the in-group.“When this sense of very strong pro-group commitment is activated in combination with a sense of existential threat from a demonised out-group, that’s when extremist ideologies can become dangerous,” she said.“This type of identity fusion with an in-group, in this case among people who perceive themselves as a victimised in-group of patriots or white Brits, can then be the final ingredient that tips someone over into the violent spectrum; into being willing to do anything on behalf of the group to save them from a perceived threat from a demonised out-group.”4:‘I’m not far-right … I’m just right’Although there was some condemnation of last year’s riots in the groups analysed, we also found hundreds of posts supporting what the commentators saw as legitimate protest or – in the case of those charged with online offences – freedom of speech.Many of these posts were contemporaneous to the unrest in July and August 2024, as the riots unfolded and initial sentencing took place.FB_POSTS_HEREThey included posts decrying the arrest of Lucy Connolly, a childminder and the wife of a Conservative councillor from Northampton. She was jailed for 31 months in October after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be torched.Deo said this reflected views in other online spaces where people “saw the riots as a watershed moment where their beliefs were finally being recognised” and portrayed the online offenders as “ordinary people expressing legitimate concerns”.She said this was true of online and offline groupings: “Many of those who participated in the riots do not view themselves as far-right, racist or even anti-immigration. The majority will not be part of any far-right organisation or group.“The line of what makes someone a member of the far right is increasingly blurred: whereas previously someone might have had to join an organisation, now people can participate or just observe through online groups, dipping in and out.”One unique and distinguishing element to the patterns of behaviour we found was the online environment in which it was taking place. Ebner said that while the narratives around existential threats, dehumanisation of out-groups and nativism were similar to what had been seen throughout far-right history, what was new here was that the online spaces amplified a lot of these dynamics.“It’s the algorithmic amplification – the speed at which people can end up in a radicalisation engine – which is different. There are also elements related to new technologies such as fabricated videos or deepfakes, as well as chatbots’ automation.”She said spaces such as these Facebook groups “definitely play a role in radicalisation of individuals”.“There is a sense that a lot of this rhetoric has been normalised to an extent that they no longer have to fear legal consequences or societal pushback,” she said, adding that this had only been strengthened by Meta’s announcement this year that it wasreversing its takedown policies on certain content.“[Extremist] rhetoric is welcome again because we’ve seen a reversal of removal policies and takedown guidelines that were in place,” Ebner said. “Not all of the users in the groups analysed by the Guardian show the same degree of radicalisation and extremist ideologies but there are definitely some users who showed clear signs of extremism,” she said of our sample.Van der Linden said the unprecedented reach of social media meant the dynamics around this rhetoric were playing out differently to how they had in the past.“You may be able to find two people in your neighbourhood who feel the same way, but now you can connect with thousands of individuals who feel the same way as you in a matter of seconds, which leads to a misperception about what the consensus is in society,” he said.The way the rhetoric spilled over into offline violence was also distinct to other periods in history, he said. “Obviously, people have been sitting in rooms saying nasty things about other groups of people for a very long time. But whereas before you would have to commit violence in person, now there’s a buildup that happens online, which was just much more difficult without the internet.”5. ‘Entry points’ for deeper conspiraciesOne stark theme we have uncovered in the analysis is the prevalence of conspiracy theories and misinformation, which account for about one in 20 posts in the network.Denial of the climate crisis featured heavily, as did replacement theory – referred to elsewhere as the “great reset” – and the view that the World Economic Forum or other “shadowy” elite bodies were dictating policy in the UK and elsewhere.FB_POSTS_4These far-fetched ideas are able to take root due to the atmosphere of confirmation bias which is already taking place in these groups.Van der Linden said the atmosphere of mutual agreement on issues such as immigration could be hijacked by more extreme “leaders” in the groups, who seeded conspiracies where people were already looking for answers to their more mainstream societal questions.“When people feel that they’re connecting with others who have the same idea, it’s a community, but then when the community starts to have an agenda and leaders emerge it becomes a structure,” he said.Deo agreed: “In some cases, the content about immigration is an entry point. From then onwards, people are exposed to a whole range of conspiracy beliefs and ideas.”Sara Wilford, a lead researcher on the EU-funded research projectSmidge(Social Media Narratives: Addressing Extremism in Middle Age) said that many conspiracies and misinformation posts contained some truth but were cynically distorted to exaggerate or exclude certain facts.“I think our biggest problem as a society is that there are so many people who are taking that information and legitimising it,” she said, adding that conspiracy and misinformation were often spread by grassroots amplification originated by “bad actors” with large social media followings.Van der Linden pointed toPizzagate, the single conspiracy theory that turned intoQAnon, as an example of how conspiracy theories could galvanise movements.“When you have enough angry people and you get them together and you direct that anger towards a singular goal, for example immigrants, that can be and that’s what led to the Southport [and subsequent] riots.”***The combined membership of the groups across the network stood at 611,289 as recorded by the Guardian’s methodology on 29 July 2025: however, this figure almost certainly includes double counting of individuals can be members of more than one group.Additional reporting by Olivia Lee and Carmen Aguilar García.The full methodology including our use of OpenAI’s API can be foundhere.

Counting was expected to continue late into the night before full results were announced.Stanislav Secrieru, Sandu’s national adviser, wrote on X that Moldovans were voting “under massive pressure fromRussiaand its proxies”. Russia has repeatedly rejected claims of meddling in Moldova and dismissed the allegations last week as “anti-Russian” and “unsubstantiated”.Secrieru said that bomb threats had been called into voting stations in Brussels, Rome and the US. The ballots of Moldova’s sizeable diaspora, which tends to back closer ties with Europe,were expected to play a decisive role in the outcome.Dodon, who heads the Patriotic bloc opposing Sandu’s pro-European course, said his allies had documented electoral violations and were gathering evidence. He called on all opposition parties to join a peaceful protest outside parliament on 29 September.Casting her ballot in Chișinău, Sandu warned voters of the stakes. “Moldova, our dear home, is in danger and it needs the help of each one of you. You can save it today with your vote. Tomorrow may be too late,” she said. “The fate of our country must be decided by your vote, not by bought votes.”View image in fullscreenMaia Sandu warned voters of the staeks while casting her ballot in Chișinău.Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/ShutterstockSince gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova has oscillated between building closer ties with Brussels and clinging to Soviet-era relations with Moscow.Sandu is a former World Bank official who waselected as president in 2020 on a wave of anti-corruption sentiment. Her government oversaw a referendum last October in which Moldovans narrowly voted to enshrine EU membership as a constitutional goal. On the same day, Sandu was re-elected as president for a four-year term.In Moldova, power is shared between the directly-elected president and a prime minister appointed by parliament.This year’s parliamentary campaign was overshadowed by mounting allegations of Russian interference. Moldovan authorities accuse Moscow offunnellingbillions of dollars into pro-Russian parties, vote-buying schemes and propaganda campaigns aimed at stoking anti-western sentiment.A Reuters investigation revealed on Wednesday how Moscow recruited and paid dozens of priests in the deeply religious country to urge congregations to vote against PAS.View image in fullscreenPeople vote at home during a visit from members of a local electoral commission in Durlesti.Photograph: Vladislav Culiomza/ReutersTwo pro-Russian parties were barred from the race on Friday over financing irregularities, a move that angered the opposition and drew sharp criticism from Moscow.Moscow has denied interfering in Moldova’s affairs but it continues to shelter the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, who is under US and EU sanctions and is widely believed to be orchestrating campaigns aimed at destabilising the country.Ahead of the vote, a western diplomat in Moldova said: “It’s a small country but the consequences are disproportionately big for Europe. If Moldova turns back to Russia, it will be a massive headache for European security.”A separate western intelligence official told the Guardian that Moscow had made Moldova its “key foreign policy priority after Ukraine” in recent months, noting that the Kremlin had reshuffled the team handling Moldova earlier this year to pursue a more aggressive strategy.View image in fullscreenPeople dance as they queue outside a polling a station located in the embassy of Moldova.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersSandu’s main vulnerability is the economy. Inflation remains stubbornly high, emigration continues and GDP growth has been modest.Her supporters argue the problems stem largely from external shocks: Russia’s war in Ukraine plunged the country into turmoil, cutting off key trade routes, triggering an energy crisis and forcing Moldova to absorb tens of thousands of refugees.Sandu’s stronghold lies with Moldova’s diaspora, which has traditionally backed PAS, as well as younger urban voters.But her party remains far less popular in regions with strong pro-Russian leanings: Transnistria, where Moscow still stations about 1,500 troops after a brief separatist war in the 1990s, and Gagauzia, a semi-autonomous area where pro-Russian sentiment runs deep.Explore more on these topicsMoldovaRussiaEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field,” Mamdani said. “But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too. And we beat you by 13 points. Looking forward to doing it again on November fourth.”Earlier on Sunday, Mamdaniposted videoon Instagram of an influential Black pastor welcoming him to address the congregation of a Black Christian megachurch in East New York earlier this month. The pastor, A R Bernard, pointed out to congregants that, if elected, Mamdani would not be the first democratic socialist mayor of the city, since the late David Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor, was also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.Sliwa, the Republican nominee, said last week that he had turned down multiple offers of millions of dollars to end his own campaign.Recent polls of the four-way contest have shownMamdani leading Cuomoby more than 20 points, with Sliwa and Adams far behind. When pollsters asked likely voters for their preferences in a race without Adams, Mamdani still led Cuomo by a double-digit margin.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkEric AdamsUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He categorically denied that this was the case.Why has the question arisen of whether Starmer had a trust?Starmer bought his parents a field at the back of their house for £20,000 because his mother liked donkeys. He later sold it for almost £300,000 in 2022. The obvious structure would have been that Starmer owned the land throughout this period while his parents simply used it for their donkeys.He forgot to declare it to the parliamentary authorities for some years while an MP, for which he apologised at the time. And in a statement to the parliamentary standards commissioner in 2022, Starmer said: “I immediately gifted the land to my parents for as long as they should live but I did not transfer the legal title – that remained with me.”This language around “gifting” has led legal experts to suggest to the Sunday Times that a trust may have been created, which could have helped him avoid any future inheritance tax liability upon the death of his parents. His mother died in 2015 and his father in 2018 and their estate does not appear to have been big enough for inheritance tax to apply.What does Starmer say about it?The prime minister told Kuenssberg on Sunday that no trust was created. He said he bought the land because he was working as a lawyer at the time and had enough money to buy a field that would help his parents keep donkeys.“I bought a field for my mum and my dad because they loved donkeys. My mum was very ill and she couldn’t move around any more,” he said. “She, by the end of her life, had her leg amputated and she could barely communicate. She was very, very ill.“She loved her donkeys and I wanted her to be able to see her donkeys. I was a lawyer, I had quite a lot of money, I bought a field for £20,000 at the back of their house. I said: ‘Here’s your field. It’s yours for as long as you may live.’”He added: “The idea of setting up some complicated trust for a £20,000 agricultural field which then housed four donkeys? It was so my mum, she was able to – they had a little outhouse at the edge of the field – and she was able, in the end, to see the donkeys. My dad built a little sort of porchway so he could wheel the wheelchair out so she could touch the donkeys. That’s what it was for. I gave it to them.”Starmer said he had no thoughts about tax in his mind at the time but in recent weeks he has commissioned a KC with expertise in tax to make sure the right amount was paid at all times.Why did he not simply say this to the Sunday Times when it asked about it three weeks ago?This is one of the mysteries about No 10’s handling of queries around the donkey field. It did not categorically say there was no trust in its original statement to the Sunday Times but is now clear that Starmer did not create any complicated legal structure or additional paperwork with the help of lawyers – he simply told his parents that they could use the land for their animals.Some lawyers may still argue that the gift of land while retaining ownership in itself creates a trust but this would not be the case if he was simply allowing his parents to use land that he bought.A Downing Street spokesperson told the Sunday Times: “Keir Starmer bought a field for his parents to use for their donkeys during his parents’ lifetime. He did not give any thought at the time to any tax considerations. His only consideration was the wellbeing of his parents … Keir Starmer engaged a leading tax KC to give him comprehensive advice on all the taxes paid. He confirmed that there had been absolutely no underpayment of taxes.”Starmer appears to dislike talking about his family affairs so he may have thought the whole business was a private matter. But as Angela Rayner’s resignation after her mistake over paying the right amount of stamp duty shows, there will always be scrutiny of the tax affairs of senior politicians.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

At the moment there are also three campaign offices on the main drag as Labour, Reform and Plaid all try to make their presence felt.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage and Llŷr Powell, Reform’s candidate for Caerphilly, this month.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAWhen the Guardian visited, the contrast between the offices of the two leading contenders – Reform and Plaid – was marked.Visitors to the Reform base are greeted by a staff member with the air of a bouncer rather than a receptionist. Its candidate,Llŷr Powell, was there but did not have time to chat.The staff member handed out campaign leaflets that tell a familiar tale. One calls on voters to “Stop Labour and Plaid Cymru’s mass immigration agenda”.Migration is not a devolved issue, but Reform wants the Welsh government’s“nation of sanctuary” plan, a framework for helping refugees find homes and jobs, scrapped.The Plaid office could not have been more welcoming, with its candidate,Lindsay Whittle, a local councillor for half a century, popping out for a chat. He said it was the most upbeat campaign for the nationalists here since the Caerphilly byelection of 1968 when Plaid cut Labour’s majority from more than 21,000 to less than 2,000.Whittle reminisced about the Joan Baez and Bob Dylan protest songs of that era, the Prague spring and pro-Alexander Dubček graffiti scribbled on the fabric of the castle. “Exciting times!”Rhun ap Iorwerth,the Plaid leader, brought it back to the present. “This is an area linked most with Labour dominance, not for 10 or 20 years, but over a century,” he said. “And we are seeing a change of historic proportions.”Ap Iorwerth said there was a “deep sense” among citizens that the Tories and Labour had forgotten them. “That’s left a vacuum.” He argued, as he would, that Plaid provided a “positive alternative” to fill this gap.The Plaid leader said he thought that the people of Caerphilly were tired of Reform’s focus on migration. “Migration isn’t even devolved to Wales,” he said. “This is the sowing and perpetuating of divisions and tensions.”Reform’s arrival in the town is certainly causing discomfort. Their office is surrounded by businesses – grocery stores, barber shops and nail salons – that are staffed by relative newcomers to the UK.“It makes us feel scared when we see them here,” said one shopkeeper, who started a business in the town having arrived in the UK from the Middle East. “We are contributing, paying our taxes but we see the leaflets and it worries us.” The shopkeeper asked not to be identified because he feared reprisals.Cath, who was pushing her grandchild in a pram, expressed disappointment at Starmer. “I voted for him and had every hope for him. I feel let down by him.”But she was worried about Reform. “They just tell people what they want to hear.”View image in fullscreenCaerphilly’s Piccadilly pub will host a Reform community event.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianBut the Reform message is hitting home for some. The Piccadilly pub in the town has put up Reform posters in its windows and will host a “community event” there. “I believe we need change,” said the landlady, Christine. “I hope they put a spoke in some wheels.”Labour’s standing in Wales has dropped off a cliff sinceVaughan Gething stepped down as first minister last yearamid a donations scandal. His successor, Eluned Morgan, has tried – but so far failed –to draw a line between Welsh Labour and the increasingly unpopular UK party.According to a YouGov poll, only 14% of people would vote for Labour at the Senedd (Welsh parliament) elections compared with Plaid Cymru (30%) or Reform UK (29%). The party polled just ahead of the Conservatives (11%).Laura McAllister, a professor at the Wales Governance Centre that is part of the University of Cardiff, said fatigue and frustration had gripped Welsh Labour. “Having been in power for so long, the party hasn’t been able to reinvent itself, modernise itself, refresh itself.”Will Hayward, who publishes a newsletter on Welsh politics, said it was difficult to overstate the trouble Welsh Labour was in. He also pointed out that success for Reform in Wales would lead to a sharp rise in staffers working for the party who are able to promote it across the UK.Labour has chosen a political newcomer to fight Caerphilly.Richard Tunniclifferuns a Welsh language publishing business and was thrust into this election campaignafter the death of his friend Hefin David, who represented Caerphilly since 2016.Welsh Labour has gone on the offensive, dismissing the Reform candidate as Farage’s “puppet” and claiming Caerphilly had little to show from the Plaid contender’s 50 years of service to the area.But Tunnicliffe’s endorsement of Starmer sounded lukewarm. Asked whether the UK prime minister was listening to people, he replied: “I think he is having to listen to people.”He said he was prepared to speak up against his own party. For example, he is opposing the Labour-run local authority’splans to close libraries.Tunnicliffe said people wanted change, not tribalism. “People feel things have been going backwards. People are feeling they’re not listened to, things have been done to them, not with them.”It is a refrain that under-pressure candidates may be repeating ad nauseam across the UK in the next few years.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I took every opportunity to talk about it: pitching it in meetings, sketching it out on a whiteboard for anyone who was interested, even drawing the web in the snow with a ski pole for my friend on what was meant to be a peaceful day out.I relentlessly petitioned bosses at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern), where I worked at the time, who initially found the idea“a little eccentric”but eventually gave in and let me work on it.I was seized by the idea of combining two pre-existing computer technologies: the internet and hypertext, which takes an ordinary document and brings it to life by adding “links”.I believed that giving users such a simple way to navigate the internet would unlock creativity and collaboration on a global scale. If you could put anything on it, then after a while, it would have everything on it.But for the web to have everything on it, everyone had to be able to use it, and want to do so. This was already asking a lot. I couldn’t also ask that they pay for each search or upload they made. In order to succeed, therefore, it would have to be free. That’s why, in 1993, I convinced my Cern managers to donate the intellectual property of the world wide web, putting it into the public domain. We gave the web away to everyone.Today, I look at my invention and I am forced to ask: is the web still free today? No, not all of it. We see a handful of large platforms harvesting users’ private data to share with commercial brokers or even repressive governments. We see ubiquitous algorithms that are addictive by design and damaging to our teenagers’ mental health. Trading personal data for use certainly does not fit with my vision for a free web.On many platforms, we are no longer the customers, but instead have become the product. Our data, even if anonymised, is sold on to actors we never intended it to reach, who can then target us with content and advertising. This includes deliberately harmful content that leads to real-world violence, spreads misinformation, wreaks havoc on our psychological wellbeing and seeks to undermine social cohesion.We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual.Solidis an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.You generate all this data – your actions, your body, your preferences. You should own itSharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered by it.Somewhere between my original vision for web 1.0 and the rise of social media as part of web 2.0, we took the wrong path. We’re now at a new crossroads, one where we must decide if AI will be used for the betterment or to the detriment of society. How can we learn from the mistakes of the past? First of all, we must ensure policymakers do not end up playing the same decade-long game of catchup they have done over social media. The time to decide the governance model for AI was yesterday, so we must act with urgency.In 2017, I wrote a thought experiment about an AI that works foryou. I called itCharlie. Charlie works for you like your doctor or your lawyer, bound by law, regulation and codes of conduct. Why can’t the same frameworks be adopted for AI? We have learned from social media that power rests with the monopolies who control and harvest personal data. We can’t let the same thing happen with AI.So how do we move forward? Part of the frustration with democracy in the 21st century is that governments have been too slow to meet the demands of digital citizens. The AI industry landscape is fiercely competitive, and development and governance are dictated by companies. The lesson from social media is that this will not create value for the individual.I coded the world wide web on a single computer in a small room. But that small room didn’t belong to me, it was at Cern. Cern was created in the aftermath of the second world war by the UN and European governments who identified a historic, scientific turning point that required international collaboration. It is hard to imagine a big tech company agreeing to share the world wide web for no commercial reward like Cern allowed me to. That’s why we need a Cern-like not-for-profit body driving forward international AI research.I gave the world wide web away for free because I thought that it would only work if it worked for everyone. Today, I believe that to be truer than ever. Regulation and global governance are technically feasible, but reliant on political willpower. If we are able to muster it, we have the chance to restore the web as a tool for collaboration, creativity and compassion across cultural borders. We can re-empower individuals, and take the web back.

Surely this documentary should have done more to tackle such horrendous online abuseLucy ManganSun 28 Sep 2025 17.20 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 17.21 EDTShareThere is always a line in any documentary about a death, and especially that of a child, that suddenly distils the bereaved’s pain so effectively you can only bow before it and wonder at the strength of the human spirit surviving amid such suffering. In The Disappearance of Jay Slater, it comes from Jay’s father, Warren, as he remembers the brutal hope the family had that their son had been taken by kidnappers, and the online rumours swirling about his torture for a supposed drug debt. “At least if we’d got him back,” says Warren, “I could have mended him.”Nineteen-year-old Jay Slater went missing on 17 June last year. He was partying until the early hours with his pals at a music festival in Tenerife – the first time he had gone on holiday without his parents – then left a nightclub with two people he had met there and went back to their Airbnb 30 miles from his own digs. After a few hours’ sleep, he started to make his way back. Then he disappeared. His friends couldn’t get hold of him. His family flew from their home in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire to Tenerife and watched and waited as the search of the mountainous terrain he was thought to have tried to pass through was started by the Guardia Civil. This was expanded via volunteers and eventually concluded on 15 July when human remains were discovered at the bottom of a ravine, close to the last known location of Jay’s phone. DNA fingerprinting confirmed that this was Jay. A preliminary autopsy by the Spanish authorities said he had died as a result of head injuries sustained in a fall from a great height. Back in England, once the body had been repatriated, another autopsy agreed, and noted that toxicology results suggested he had ingested drugs and alcohol not very long before.It’s a terrible story. But it should have been one about a tragic accident and parents left to come to terms with life without their son. Yet it was complicated by the media attention that the disappearance and long search garnered, which in turn opened the way for conspiracy theorists to seize on the case, and trolls to spread rumours and fuel the misery. Kernels of truth and grains of possibility were spun – by, well, anyone who wanted to, really – into full-blown narratives trumpeted as truth. Jay was in one incarnation a watch thief, in another a dangerous drug dealer offed by a gang when he got into debt, in another the aforementioned kidnap and torture victim, or some combination of the above, and more. The GoFundMe page set up by Jay’s friend Lucy inspired further theories and vitriol – it was to pay off his drug debt, then he would reappear. No, the whole thing was a set-up from the beginning and the family was in on it. No, it was this, it was that, it was something else entirely … all of it emotionally devastating to his family.However, you have to pull much of this together yourself from the documentary, which is messy, unfocused and fails to do justice to either strand of the narrative. It seems unable to decide what it wants to be. At times, it edges towards becoming an examination of the power of the internet and the harm people liberated by anonymity do to others – either with the gleeful intent of the true troll or the unthinking carelessness of the armchair sleuths who view unfolding news stories as if they were movies and have apparently no regard for the fact that these are real things happening to real people. But there the film is hamstrung by (bizarre though it seems) the fact that not only are experiences like the poor Slaters’ far from rare; but that theirs is not even at the worst end of the spectrum of abuse to which vulnerable people suddenly in the public eye can find themselves subjected.What is left, without such an interrogation of the wider issues raised by the Slaters’ experiences, is essentially an obituary. The beloved boy – lost to an accident as daft, drunk, high or hungover lads too often are – is remembered and then the credits roll. This, you hope, brings some catharsis and closure for the family, of course. But what the point of it otherwise was or should have been remains an open question.The Disappearance of Jay Slater is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

I was finding my feet as a creative director, so magazines wanted to put me on their pages. The clothes – Norma Kamali trousers and a Donna Karan bodysuit – were a subliminal way of reflecting who I was. In my early 20s, I was dressing to cater to the trends. As I approached 30, I realised it was time to consider my personal style: dynamic, strong and sharp.My memories from this time are of joy and contentment. I was confident at work, but everything felt new and exciting. I remember thinking, “I am rocking this.” A significant feeling, as for a long time I’d been lost.Growing up, I was one of five kids. I was spiky and naughty, always pushing boundaries and disinterested in getting good grades or making close friends. I was studying at a convent school and found myself constantly distracted in lessons. By the time I was a teenager, most of my siblings had left home to either study or work. Then, very suddenly, Mum died of meningitis.So much of business and consumerism has been terrible for society. I have to accept that I’ve played my part in thatDad fell apart; he couldn’t cope at all. Even though I was 16, it was left to me to take care of my younger brother, Lawrence. It wasn’t just losing Mum; my siblings, my elders, my whole support system was gone. The house went from this warm, crazy, chaotic Irish family environment – always a dog barking, food on the stove – to darkness and silence. Mum was strong, funny – a matriarch who made things happen. I didn’t even own a house key because she was always at home.In the 1970s, there was no therapy. It was just back to school on Monday and onwards. I had won a place at Rada, but enrolled on a college course in visual merchandising so I could look after Lawrence instead. As soon as I got home, I would turn the radio or TV on, anything to fill the house with noise. Then I would try to cook something, having never cooked before. My brother would come through the front door. He was 14, and I could see the grief on his face. I had no choice but to become the responsible matriarch, a role that I have never stopped inhabiting since.Sarah Parish and James Murray look back: ‘Losing a child is such a hard thing to digest, but when we harnessed the grief, it got easier’Read moreAfter Mum died, my dad met someone new. He died two years later, and left the family home to his new wife, making me and Lawrence homeless. We relied on the kindness of other people, and lived with family friends in a council house. I wouldn’t want to go into the headspace of the woman who took our family home – I can’t imagine doing that to any child. There must have been some pain in her. I don’t harbour resentment, but I do often look back and grieve for my younger self – I wish I could go back in time and put my arm around her.Because of everything that happened to me in those years, I never really got to be a teenager. I never did drugs, I never did the big clubs, the rebellion. To this day, I’ve never been off my face. Instead, that tragedy set me on a new path – one that made me want to go out and work. So that’s what I did. My accomplishments didn’t come from being the smartest; they came from working harder than anyone around me.By the time I was 48, I was on TV. The show was big – 3.5 million viewers. I would walk on to the street and people would say: “Hi Mary!” Suddenly, I was a public figure. I had my business and was constantly travelling for keynote speaking. I had two kids, and was starting to become wealthy. But I was doing too much. I was exhausted.A friend said: “Why don’t you come away to this retreat? Relax for a bit?” I am not one for time off, and had never really prioritised self-care. I had grown up watching my mother slap on face cream, so I just did the same, and thought that was enough indulgence. But I agreed to go, and on that trip I met a spiritual leader. Anyone could go in and talk to him. He would point to a seat, and get me to speak. One day he handed me the Vedanta Treatise: The Eternities by Avula Parthasarathy, a manual for life and self-realisation, based on one of the ancient philosophies of India. I didn’t understand a fucking word. But I kept reading, and something was changing. Every time I did yoga, I’d start crying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I would seek out teachers and philosophers, and became more drawn to reading about great thinkers than streaming the latest TV series. It wasn’t quite an awakening, but a realisation that so much of my life had been running – moving on to the next thing constantly. The stress and the energy never connected me to my soul.I wouldn’t consider myself a yogi but I meditate every day. And it’s changed how I approach work. So much of business and consumerism has been terrible for society. I have to accept that I’ve played my part in that. Plus, we were taught that being good at business was about aggression, but if you put out bad energy and anger, anger comes back. It doesn’t mean that I don’t like earning money; I just like to do it with a conscience.When I was younger, nobody ever said to me: “Here’s a kid who’s got some spark!” Even when I became display manager at Topshop at 25, I never felt like I was in a place of success. During the Harvey Nichols days, when the press had given me the moniker Mary Queen of Shops, nobody internally said I was important. Because of that, and because of who I am fundamentally, I have never truly felt like I “made it”.To me, success isn’t achieving career goals. It’s in moments like when my fabulous PA, Bean, once said: “The thing I always admired about you is that you can talk to the CEO or the cleaner. And there aren’t many people who can – or will – do both.” Or it’s when I’m at home with my kids, cooking or simply talking around the table. The other day my brother came over and cut our hair. Those small, ordinary family moments are the ones that feel the most meaningful.Despite everything that’s happened, I have this belief that everything will always be OK. It doesn’t mean I don’t experience pain. In the last few years, I have been through divorce. The end of a relationship is an extraordinarily difficult thing to navigate. But she and I both celebrated our son’s birthday recently. We are in a good place. And that’s the thing: there have been periods of extreme challenges, but also joy. I’ve had such a rich life. If someone had said to me when I was a little girl that this would be adulthood, I’d have gone: “I’ll tick that box – thank you!”Explore more on these topicsMary PortasFlashbackFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer, meanwhile, is clearly gripped by panic, now identifying Reform UK as his “enemy” and opposing some of Farage’s most terrifying plans, but still sometimes getting dangerously close to a polite version of the same language. Recent immigration, hewrote in the Telegraphlast week, was caused by “a hyper-liberal free-market viewpoint”. It has been “too easy” for people to enter the UK, and remain here illegally. Above all, he and his colleagues must use “every possible measure to deter migrants from entering British waters”.Along with the digital ID the government seems set to callthe “Brit card”, this is where we are: alarmingly close to the imaginings of all those dystopian films and TV shows –Children of Men, or the TV seriesYears and Years– but seemingly yet to fully comprehend it. And clearly, this is not just a matter of rhetoric and political noise. In the real world, you can see where we are heading, with sights that are deeply troubling, but that quickly settle into ordinariness.Ten days ago, I wasrecording an episodeof the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast in Kent, where I came across the most strange combination of scenes imaginable, like some scaled-down English version of the old east and west of Berlin. We were in the coastal town of Folkestone. On one side of a huge expanse of land was a symbol of what politicians call aspiration: a pristine new-build housing development, where a four-bedroom family home goes for about £350,000. But its grid of streets suddenly stopped at a crude wooden fence. I had to get close to see what lay beyond: serried lines of long, low brick buildings, surrounded by a fence whose entire length was covered in frayed blue fabric, seemingly put there so no one can see either in or out.This is Napier barracks: a Ministry of Defence sitestill being usedto house people seeking asylum. In 2020, the Home Office began using it as a “contingency” accommodation for single men. A year later,the high court saidthe facilities there did not meet “minimum standards”. In March of this year, there werereports that it would soon shut, before news that the so-called small boats influx meant it would have to remain open. For now, it stands as the embodiment of a belief shared across politics: that in the face of myths about people waiting for decisions from the Home Office living in pampered luxury, their lives must be made aspinched and deprivedas possible.More than anywhere else I have been,Kentis full of symbols of how politics and policy are being reshaped by the west’s growing hostility to outsiders. Dover is more spruced up than the last time I visited, but still feels neglected. Here, you can join in the grim local sport of watching from the cliffs for illicit new arrivals. During an hour of vox-popping, it was not hard to find people who expressed at least some sympathy for people who come to the UK across the Channel. “My first thought is whether they’re safe,” said one woman, who had seen lifeboats rescuing people at least twice. “There’s women and children … what they’re fleeing must be horrendous.” But it was equally easy to fall into conversations full of unabashed hostility. “I’ve no sympathy at all for ’em,” one man told me. “They come to the UK ’cause it’s an easy ticket, and they’re guaranteed money.”I went home, to one of Labour’s safest seats, and it felt like a newly minted Reform constituency | Kirsty MajorRead moreIn May, Reform UKwon 57 of the 81 seatson Kent county council. Its new leader is a former BBC journalist called Linden Kemkaran, who defected to Farage’s party from the Conservatives. She agreed to talk to us at her office in the county town of Maidstone, where the traditional fixtures and ornaments have been joined by signs of regime change.The local aspects of her job are focused on what she calls “efficiency savings”, but she has a habit of eagerly talking about policy areas way beyond her brief: part of her role, she says, is to generate noise and be a “nuisance”. For what it’s worth, she and her colleagues recently “undeclared” the climate emergency. And if she had complete control of asylum policy in Kent, she told me, “we’d stop the boats. People’s feet would not touch English soil.”I glanced at a small pile of Make Britain Great Again caps on a table near her desk, while she rhapsodised about her party’s mission. “We’re trying to undo the damage of 25 or 30 years of this ridiculous globalist progressive mindset … people will start to see that finally, somebody is in charge who has theballsto say uncomfortable things and make unpopular decisions, because they actually have conviction in their own beliefs.”That kind of talk worried me, I told her. Like a lot of people, I fear it’ll make society more divided and overheated. “I would say we were in that place already,” she said.Perhaps we are. In Faversham, Kent’s oldest market town, there were recently far-right protests outside a small facility used to house unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Writing in the Guardian,one witness described people“chanting ‘Sieg Heil’, hanging St George’s flags from lamp-posts, and crudely daubing roundabouts and zebra crossings with red crosses.”In other parts of the county, there is something you can almost feel as a physical sensation. It is stifling and prickly: a sort of social humidity, keenly felt by people who have come here from abroad. One woman I met had fled from Eritrea to war-torn Sudan, and then made it into the UK by hiding in a lorry when she was just 17. Having been given asylum, she is now an NHS nurse, and she feels a profound sense of alarm about what she hears people say about immigrants. “I do feel fear,” she told me. “Those people talk about me without my permission … I had to learn the language, and integrate with the country. I’m not against the flag. I’m not against anyone who feels proud to be British … But do you know my journey? Do you know my story?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether they like it or not, our politicians have given permission for old hatreds and prejudices to be given a 21st-century refit: if you are not white, or speak with a different accent or in a foreign language, you may find yourself at the cruellest intersection of politics, the online world and everyday life, being filmed for a TikTok video, shouted at in the street, or attacked. But precious few frontline politicians talk about any of that.Is it naive to wonder how little space our discourse now leaves for common humanity, charity and generosity? For the last week, I have thought a lot about Folkestone, the barracks, and that border between middle-English comfort and threadbare privation, and a question that ought to haunt us all.

Here are some surefire winnersSun 28 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 12.47 EDTShareTo the surprise of no one with internet access, surely, we’re still in a birthrate crisis. What with ecological collapse, incipient fascism, geopolitical instability, the lack of support for new parents, childcare costs and more, bringing new life into the world requires a radical act of hope. And who’s feeling that these days?Plus, even if you do want children, pregnancy feels kind of risky at the moment. In parts of the US and beyond, pregnant people are being viewed, and treated, as functional vessels, valued only as a sort of Le Creuset for precious life delivery. Even popping a paracetamol when you’re pregnant is out now; just “tough it out” or you’ll make your kid autistic, Trump claims.Yet the oblivious bro-ocracy (Vance, Musk, variousSilicon Valley typesand podcasting “alphas”) remain deeply troubled by plummeting birthrates. AsI’ve said before, unless you’ve solo wrangled multiple children with a postpartum core and undercarriage, you have no business having an opinion on anyone’s womb. But I’m also disappointed by the lack of imagination shown by people who are supposed to be disruptors and paradigm shifters. Pronatalist projects are so unambitious, mostly revolving around offering parents derisory sums of money. Polish tycoon Władysław Grochowski recently announced avaguely innovative schemethat offered to throw a party for guests who have conceived in one of his hotels. But, the thought of having to prove you’ve had sex to a mustachioed hotelier feels pretty creepy.Instead, it falls to me to suggest genuinely innovative ways to boost birthrates – ranked from eminently manageable to moonshot.Birth row mealForget the “push present” (ghastly expression): women need better rewards for repopulating the planet. For a start, everyone who has a baby should get a “birth row meal”: anything their heart desires, which the authorities are obliged to provide within 12 hours of delivery.Introduce – and upgrade – the Finnish “baby box”As a further incentive, we could give Finland’sbaby box system, where new parents are given a collection of essentials, a glow-up. I’m thinking: unlimited streaming and meal delivery services for the first 12 months, a voucher for a month in the Maldives, a cashmere (adult,notbaby) blanket, plus some goodies from Liberty?Contractual guarantees re themental loadA legally binding commitment from non-birthing parents to manage all child-related WhatsApp groups and be responsible for vaccinations, dental check-ups and holiday childcare arrangements, plus a blanket prohibition on asking “What’s for dinner?”, would make motherhood much more attractive. There would, of course, be criminal law consequences for any breach.No-questions-asked life leaveEvery parent gets one chance to run away from their life for a week. Call the government helpline and a team of professionals steps in to replace you on two hours’ notice. Get lost in a forest, go to Paris and flirt with waiters, take a Hunter S Thompson-worthy quantity of mind-altering substances. Or simply check in to a chain hotel, curl up in a foetal ball and sleep.Make babies cuterThey’re OK, but most infants don’t inspire strings of heart-eye emojis and “omgggggg dying of cuteness” comments. I tell you what does:Moo Deng. Baby long-tailed tits. Corgi puppies. Fluffy, blue-eyed kittens in baskets. I bet we’d have more babies if they looked like that. We’ve been making designer dogs for decades – what’s the hold-up?Foster independenceDo newborn horses, gazelles or giraffes lie around for months in a state of terrifying vulnerability and dependence? No. Human infants need to take a long, hard look at themselves and grow up faster.Disrupt birthThere’s no sugar-coating it: vaginal birth isn’t a five-star Tripadvisor experience. If they really want women to have more babies, rather than using their obscene resources trying to live for ever, tech-bro pronatalists need to start “disrupting” the science of human birth to make it sting less. Could we become oviparous (egg-laying)? Or is there a way for human infants to be born smaller and slither out painlessly into a kangaroo-style pouch (ideally not attached to the mother, which seems burdensome)? GetBryan Johnson’s people on it.Make parents’ lives easierFree universal childcare; strategies and infrastructures to combat parental isolation; properly funded, accessible early years psycho-social support; better support for flexible worki … Ha, no, silly me. Obviously, this one’s too out-there to ever work.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Must the UK remake our odious politicians?Dave SchillingA recent trip to Britain from my native California presented some worrying truths about our shared political futureSun 28 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 09.20 EDTShareI’ve always wanted to visit the UK. This might sound absurd to you, considering I’m from California – home of sunshine, half-naked bodies and the studio where they film Jeopardy. What could possibly pull me to the cold, damp, gray shores of England? The oppressively brown food? The dodgy colonialist history? Tesco? No, it was the glowing box that vibrated with whatever passed for culture in my small town: television.British TV was an obsession in my house, via those purveyors of affordable, exotic entertainment at PBS. We’d get classy fare through theMasterpiece Theatreseries, but also more downmarket comedies likeAre You Being Served?(a variety of sexually obsessed retail clerks trip over each other) orKeeping Up Appearances(lower-middle-class oafs desperately wish they were posh). I had no concept of what people were saying in their thick accents or most of the jokes meant, especially the double entendres.But even the dumb shows seemed smart. I learned more about European history from Rowan Atkinson, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton’sBlackadderseries than I ever did in school. British television, especially the comedies, assumed a certain futility to life. It probably won’t get better. In fact, it might get worse. Often. This is a tradition that carried over to other classic sitcoms such as I’m Alan Partridge and The Office, which I discovered in college. If it’s a small-town crime drama or a half-hour comedy, British TV is usually going to express something close to misery by the time the credits roll. In America’s land of good cheer and opportunity, this was like a salve of reality.Our research makes it clear: by capitulating to the right, Labour is driving voters to Reform UK | Tarik Abou-Chadi and Stuart Turnbull-DugarteRead moreMy obsession with all things British (even the food) carried on into adulthood, but despite that abiding interest, I had never visited the UK until this year. I seemed to have picked the worst year imaginable. Or maybe the best. The country is in the midst of a political upheaval. Nigel Farage’s far-right Reform party is on the march, commanding the polls. Obviously, the first thing I did when I arrived was turn on the television to see how it compared to American media, which feels at all times likeJurassic Park after the electricity went out.In the US, we are obsessed with remaking British TV shows – The Office, Steptoe and Son, Absolutely Fabulous. But the British would rather remake our politicians. They’re just not as good at it.Farage is the English Trump, but only in the sense that he is dangerously unqualified for leadership and therefore believes he is actually qualified. He recently claimed that migrants were “eating swans” in parks. I can imagine a TV executive angrily shaking their fist at the ham-handed adaptation of Trump’s infamous dog comment.“Who would actually eat a swan? You don’t even get it!”Nigel Farage is just not the showman that Trump is, any more than Doctor Who is as flashy as Star Wars or Star Trek. British news is less single-mindedly fixated on him than we are with Trump. Because Farage is so tacky and second rate, it’s been easier for the UK media to shoo him away like a fly up until now. When I was in London this summer, it was the opposite of the wall-to-wall Trumpathon that is America. Maybe that’s why I found ITV’s Good Morning Britain so relaxing to watch. The noticeable lack of screaming or partisan rancor. The reassuring presence of former Labour politician andex-Strictly Come Dancing competitor Ed Balls. Whatever it is, I came to love my daily dose of dry toast in TV form. One recent GMB episode featured a segment on anapp designed to identify and catalog butterflies around the UK. It was sweet, until the presenter reminded the audience that this is important because butterflies are dying off due to the climate crisis. Even cheerful news segments need to remind you that life is a series of tiny hells.I did a few things besides watch TV, though. The Tate Modern is easily the best contemporary art museum I’ve ever been to. I think reading a newspaper in a pub at 11am is as civilized as life gets. I can’t tell if Waitrose is posh or a Trader Joe’s equivalent, but they had everything I needed, plus delicious cheeses I’ve never heard of.The Barbican Estate, where I stayed, is an architectural marvel that could never exist in a place like California. It’s purposefully difficult to get around, has an art gallery and a movie theater, and people crush bottles of wine openly in the courtyard long past bedtime. I found that people took tube etiquette so seriously that I wondered if not giving up your seat for an elderly person was now punishable by stoning. I’m sure there’s plenty of horrendous behavior in London, but I was so eager to enjoy myself that I didn’t even notice. And almost no one I met in London asked me, the dumb American, about Donald Trump. Almost.The face of populism is the frozen scowl of Trump, the vacuous grin of FarageMy one conversation about Trump took place in Whitechapel, a neighborhood known for a series of murders attributed to Jack the Ripper that is now home to a significant immigrant population – particularly people from Bangladesh. A sign was added to the Whitechapel tube station in Bengali, whichupset Elon Musk(who is definitely not British) and assorted rightwing politicians obsessed with fighting multiculturalism. I was eager to have a proper British curry experience before flying back to LA and was given a recommendation for a restaurant in Whitechapel by my friend and co-creator ofThe Inbetweeners, Iain Morris (who is definitely British). I was asked very specifically not to name the restaurant, lest it become discovered by more brutish American tourists like myself. That’s whatDishoomis for, after all.After settling the bill for my meal, the waiter/proprietor asked me what I thought of “him.”The movie had not come out yet, so I realized “him” meant Trump. I said I was generally not a fan, that he would not be fond of a place like the restaurant we were in, and that I definitely did not vote for him. He chuckled, as though I had read him a joke written on a popsicle stick. “Every time an American comes in here and I ask if they voted for him, they say no,” he responded. I surmised that that’s because the people who did vote for him aren’t stopping into a curry house in Whitechapel on their UK vacation.The British and American political dilemmas can sometimes look eerily similar. Trump and Farage have both stuck around far longer than anyone expected. Anti-immigrant and anti-trans sentiment animate the right wings of both nations. The“unite the kingdom” rallyfeels like a hyper-charged Maga gathering. But, like the quality of our respective cheeses, we couldn’t be more different. Nihilism and a crazed impulse to start over from scratch animates both of our cultural schisms, but while in the US the face of populism is the frozen scowl of Trump, in Britain, it’s the vacuous grin of Farage. Arecent feature in the New Yorkerdescribed the mood of the Reform party conference as jubilant. Farage is always smiling, which is either comforting to his sympathizers or terrifying for his detractors. Regardless, Reform is capturing Britain’s imagination precisely because of that smile.Labour and the Tories bumble around desperate to prove that they are the most serious, when what the nation seems to want is someone who admits that things aren’t great, but that the country (and the world) have a future. The future Reform offers is a terrifying one that looks a lot more like the worst aspects of modern America, but it’s a vision nonetheless. What afflicts both the US and the UK is a feeling of emptiness, of futility, and a growing realization that we’re all stuck. Technology, grand economic forces we don’t understand, and a dwindling social safety net have left the average citizen in a state of abandonment and isolation. The Democratic party and the Labour party just want things to go back to a mythical state of normalcy, hopelessly nostalgic and out of touch. This has pushed the dreamers, the malcontents and the futurists to the fringes. Maga and Reform seem nostalgic, but what they offer is not a return to anything, but a radical reshaping and perversion of the system that keeps our society functioning.When faced with the grim reality of British TV every day on my trip, I yearned for a bit of good ol’ Yankee razzle-dazzle – a dose of mindless optimism. I think maybe the most potent similarity between our two countries is that we could both use some of that right now.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpNigel FarageTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Suddenly, it all feels a bit 1939Simon TisdallForget the US president’s seeming volte-face on Ukraine this week: he and Putin fundamentally agree that European liberal democracy is the problemSun 28 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 11.54 EDTShareFor many people in easternEurope, August 1939 may not feel that long ago. That was the moment Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union secretly agreed to partition Poland and forcibly subsume the sovereign Baltic republics and Finland into their totalitarian “spheres of influence”. The world knows what came next.Now the question arises: is it happening again? This time around, it’s Donald Trump’s United States and Vladimir Putin’s Russia making the big geopolitical power-play – and, once again, all of Europe is potential prey. Notwithstandinglast week’s sparringover Ukraine, the two leaders’ core aims appear closely aligned.Physical subjugation of the European continent is not a Trump objective (unlike, perhaps, in Venezuela, Canada or Greenland). But US efforts to dominate the continent through political interference, ideological subversion, economic blackmail, unregulated big-tech predation and the projection of conservative,Christian nationalist culturalbeliefs amount to much the same thing.Putin’s methods are cruder, yet his agenda mirrors Trump’s. He will not let go of Ukraine. He isintensifying, and leveraging, the Russian military threat, from the Baltic states to the Black Sea, including in Moldova, Romania andGeorgia.Russian hybrid warfare– sabotage, cyber-attacks, online trolling and disinformation – is now a fact of daily western European life.Trump, failed coup leader, and Putin, indicted war criminal, are not in formal alliance, yet. They have not agreed a 1939-style Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact. But there is extensive common ground. Both despise European liberal democracy, equal rights and multiculturalism. Both are viscerally hostile to the EU. Both hanker for past imperial glories; both reject UN “globalism” and international law. Their anti-democratic ultranationalism nurtures foul ideas of ethnic and racial supremacy that most Europeans had long consigned to history.Trump makes no secret of his desire to normalise US relations with Russia. This, he claims, would lead to vast, mutually beneficialmoney-making opportunities. When he complained last week that Putin has“let me down”, he was not so much talking about his embarrassingAlaska peace summitflop but about the Russian president’s refusal to cut a deal and cash in.Trump’s supposed pro-Kyiv shift typifies his pinball policymaking, which ricochets randomly from one wacky idea to another. It will not endure. His warning thatRussia faces“big economic trouble” was his way of pushing Putin into doing business while leaving Ukraine and European Nato members to manage the long-term Russian threat alone.The US president is urging others to cut off Russian oil, but the US itself does nothing. Promised tougher sanctions are all talk. He refuses to resume direct military aid to Kyiv, or punish Russian incursions into Nato territory. In this context, his prediction that Ukraine willsomehow regain all its lost territoryis cruel mockery.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin meets Donald Trump meets in Alaska, 15 August 2025.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersTrump and Putin’s political pressure campaigns are mutually reinforcing. Both support European hard-right, populist-nationalist parties and politicians. In February, the US vice-president, JD Vance, directly intervened in Germany’s election,siding with the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland. Trump’sbacking for the Polish presidential candidate Karol Nawrockimay have helped the conservative nationalist score a narrow victory.Similar Russian influence campaigns, plus dirty tricks and alleged vote-buying, have marred electionsin Romaniaand Moldova, whichgoes to the pollsthis weekend. Will Trump and Putin conspire to ensure a hard-right populist succeeds Emmanuel Macron as French president in 2027? It’s a legitimate worry.Both leaders exploit Europe’s open societies, stirring political pots and promoting favourites. In Trump’s case, one such is Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s rightwing prime minister. Another is British anti-migrant populist Nigel Farage, the quintessential useful idiot. In Putin’s case, it’s pro-Moscow leaders such asHungary’s Viktor OrbánandSlovakia’s Robert Fico.The most obvious manifestation of hostile US economic pressure is Trump’s unilateral tariffs, which foreshadowed the summer’s risibly lopsided EU-US trade deal. American big-tech’s £31bn UK investment, announced during Trump’s quasi-regal state visit, carries awhiff of neocolonialism. Buying British is fine.

Deniable cyber-attacks cripple key European industries and institutions. An undersea communications cable or gas pipeline mysteriously ruptures. Dronesforce the closure of airports. Undocumentedmigrants are directedacross EU borders. Online scams proliferate. Methods vary. Yet the economic warfare waged on Europe in tandem by Moscow and Washington is real.A disturbing report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) and European Cultural Foundation claims the US is waging a broadculture war against Europe. Yet its central finding – that Trump is promoting political and ideological allies while simultaneously trying to sideline and divide the EU – applies with equal force to Putin’s Russia.The defence of “free speech”, mounted by Vance during his infamous Munichsecurity conference attackon Europe’s supposed retreat from “some of its most fundamental values”, is a key cultural battleground. And here is another convergence. For Trump and Putin, speech is free – if they agree with the speaker. But not otherwise. (Ask Jimmy Kimmel, or the late Alexei Navalny.) Trump and Putin: two clowns resembling Laurel and Hardy – except their gags are not jokes.The ECFR report optimistically suggests the dual assault from east and west is drawing Europeans together. Yet, as ever in Europe, what’s lacking is urgency and strong, united leadership. What’s lacking is clear understanding that this US administration, no longer a trusted friend, is turning into an outright enemy; and that the Russian bear, a species once thought extinct, is back with a vengeance.The evidence grows. So does the threat. Planned or not, Trump and Putin – like-minded, amoral, authoritarian apex predators – are working together, or at least in parallel, to undercut European democracy, security, prosperity and progressive values. It looks like a concerted pincer movement. It feels like 1939.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeSecond world warcommentShareReuse this content"

Encountering occasional racism has been a fact of life for people of colour in most countries in the west. Emboldened by the far-right movements, racist voices are now becoming louder and moving into the mainstream.One of the emergent themes within the therapy room has involved a resurgence of racial trauma, especially for those who have previously experienced significant such harm.Every migrant or person of colour has a different relationship with race and the culture around them, but certain themes predominate when navigating life as a cultural minority, including seemingly innocuous “othering” (“oh, how is your English so good?”), unspoken discrimination in employment, stereotypical beliefs (all south Asians are truck drivers), deliberate ignorance, scapegoating (house prices are rising because of immigrants) and outright hatred (“go back to where you came from”). Many people of colour have also experienced frank and outright abuse and violence because of racism.Breaking free from resentment: the hidden cost of revenge and the healing power of forgiveness | Gill Straker and Jacqui WinshipRead moreAisha* was one of these people. She is a young woman of Pakistani origin and had been seeing me for therapy to manage some difficulties with her family. Aisha said she had also experienced an assault in adolescence by Caucasian peers from school, and believed that this was racially charged, though the school denied this at the time. She had initially started seeing a psychoanalytic practitioner but stopped seeing them when they tried to interpret her reaction to a racist comment by her manager as a transference reaction deriving from childhood. Her experiences with therapy had been mixed and she struggled with the quick injunction to “put up boundaries” she had received from Caucasian therapists, with limited recognition of the cultural context she resided in. While therapists from any background can work very successfully with people of colour, it does require a level of sensitivity, willingness to learn, and to incorporate an understanding of structural issues such as colonialism and discrimination into therapy.Within the context of increasing anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, Aisha found she was hypervigilant and anxious about the possibility of another assault. She said she had nightmares about the attack and was starting to perceive danger in her daily life. She worked as a nurse and was subject to a lot of racism from clients, and much subtler racism from colleagues and management. She said her typical manner of smiling and ignoring it was becoming difficult to continue. She found herself so angry that she was clenching her teeth at night and was diagnosed with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ).My first therapy task was to understand her culture instead of making assumptions. I also needed to reflect the reality of what Aisha had experienced and to sit with her in her distress, instead of moving into a glib intervention such as reframing her thinking. Exploring the disempowerment and fear she felt and normalising this in the context of the changes in the world was important, before we could move into more active interventions.My client attended therapy because he was mandated to. Making progress to stop his use of child exploitation material was vital | Ahona GuhaRead moreI noticed that Aisha’s threat perception was heightened, which is a typical response for those who have experienced trauma. I had to walk a fine line of helping her to see this without dismissing her understandable fear. We worked on some basic psychological techniques such as controlling what you can and letting go of the rest, but I made a point, as I do for all my clients experiencing structural harms, that describing the technique in this way might feel like slapping a Band-Aid on a broken leg. We utilised eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), a trauma treatment to reduce her anxiety about the assault, and additionally worked on some basic lifestyle interventions to ensure she had the building blocks of mental health in place.Learning to respond assertively to racist comments and behaviour was also an essential part of our work, and Aisha identified that racism from colleagues was much worse than racism from patients – though the latter was more overt. We worked on building some interpersonal effectiveness skills and rehearsing self-talk to support Aisha with combating these difficulties.While therapy was a tiny part of the puzzle, feeling understood and supported in her experience of disempowerment was important to Aisha. She was able to externalise the racism and see it as a reflection of the people engaging in this behaviour, rather than as a personal failing. She acknowledged this was sadly the reality of life for many migrants, but she now felt more empowered to make changes for herself and other people of colour in her workplace.*All clients are fictional amalgamsDr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

We think he’s done a fantastic job. Like us, he inherited a mess.” Donald Trump gave his enthusiastic endorsement to Javier Milei’s radical economic experiment when the pair met in New York last week.The US has declared itself ready to offer more than rhetorical support to the chainsaw-wielding Argentinian president in the coming days, as Buenos Aires stands on the brink of a fresh financial crisis.The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the US was “ready to do what is needed”. He suggested the Federal Reserve could offer Buenos Aires a $20bn (£15bn) dollar swap line – a crucial crisis-fighting tool – or the US could even buy the country’s bonds directly.Would Javier Milei’s dollar plan for Argentina be an economic experiment too far?Read moreUS administrations have rallied support for Argentinian governments in the past – Bill Clinton was a fan of Carlos Menem’s 1990s reforms, for example. But Trump’s readiness to wade in directly is the latest example of his determination to use economic tools for political ends: in this case, propping up an ideological ally.Milei swept into power two years ago, on a wave of frustration and discontent with the economic status quo.Like Trump and Boris Johnson, he eschewed the usual conventions of politics and promised to smash up the establishment and remake the state on behalf of the people.But while Milei’s political playbook may echo Trump’s, with its embrace of chaos and showbiz, his economic policies owe something to another radical with big hair – Margaret Thatcher, whom the Argentinian president has called “brilliant”.Like the Thatcher governments in the UK, Milei sees slaying the dragon of inflation as an overriding priority. The challenge inArgentinais on a completely different scale to 1980s Britain, however: the inflation rate peaked at more than 25% a month soon after Milei came to power.But aspects of his approach, including a systematic onslaught on trade union rights, public spending cuts and a wave of privatisations, have echoes of Thatcherism.Despite lacking a parliamentary power base, Milei has succeeded in cutting deep into pensions and public sector wages – and more than 48,000 public sector workers have lost their jobs.He travelled to CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, in the US, to pose on stage next to a chainsaw-wielding Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) was partly inspired by Milei’s aggressive style.Argentina’s tough policies have won plaudits from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which granted a new $20bn lifeline to Argentina in April.On stage at the IMF’s meetings in Washington that month, its managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, proudly pinned on to her green jacket a tiny silver chainsaw badge, handed to her by Argentina’s minister for deregulation, Federico Sturzenegger.But while Milei’s “shock therapy” may have met with approval in Washington – and indeed in financial markets – the Argentinian economist and campaigner Lucía Cirmi Obón highlights its human impact.“The macroeconomic changes implemented by Milei have not shown – nor do I believe they will show – any positive impact on people’s quality of life. In practice, what we are seeing is an economic recession,” she told the Guardian.“The main reasons are that real wages fell, and the opening of imports also dismantled a large part of national industry. On top of that, there were cuts to the number of people receiving a pension, support for childcare, for people with disabilities who used to receive pensions. All of the policies the population used to receive from the state have been reduced.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Household debt is rising, and because many of the occupations targeted by cuts are female-dominated, the gender pay gap has widened, undoing six years’ worth of progress.Obón adds that while Milei’s approach was meant to unleash the corporate sector, to open the way for surging economic growth, investment as a share of GDP has actually fallen.Meanwhile, determined to squash inflation, Milei has maintained the peso’s link to the dollar – a trigger for so many crises in Argentina over the years.For several decades, the peso has been pegged – within limits – to the greenback, which circulates within Argentina as an alternative currency, in which many citizens like to hold their savings, especially in times of trouble.Milei had advocated full dollarisation during the election campaign – a policy that would leave Argentina without the right to set its own interest rates. When he came to power and allies rejected that plan, he insteaddevalued the peso by more than half, willing to wear the resulting inflation in the hope of stimulating exports.But the currency has nevertheless come under continued selling pressure – exacerbated by the political uncertainty unleashed when Milei suffereda disastrous showing in local legislative elections in Buenos Aires province, which he had himself called a “life or death battle”.Since those local elections, and amid a mounting clamour of corruption claims against Milei’s powerful sister, Karina, the peso sell-off has accelerated. The central bank burned through more than $1bn of reserves in a week trying to prop up the currency, before Bessent announced Washington was ready to step in.As well as political fellow feeling, some experts suggest geopolitics may have been another motivation for Washington’s intervention, with China becoming increasingly influential in Latin America.The peso rallied and the markets calmed after Bessent’s comments, but as the costs of “shock therapy” bite and Milei looks to crucial midterm elections in October, the Argentinian public face a volatile period ahead.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaEconomics viewpointCurrenciesEconomicsAmericasTrump administrationBondsJavier MileicommentShareReuse this content"

His administration unveiled contentious claims about the causes of autism – pregnant women taking Tylenol, also known as paracetamol – and pushed for research to find a “cure”. It got me thinking about how to cope psychologically, and my conclusion – and that of many of my friends in the autism community – is that you have to laugh or you’ll cry.There’s a saying that when you’ve met one autistic child, you’ve met one autistic child. I’ve never loved the “autism as superpower” narrative, and how it erases those with high-support needs and the challenges autistic people can face. Equally, Trump’s framing of autism as a tragedy and a disease in need of curing isdeeply problematic, so I feel it’s important to highlight some of the incredible, brilliant things about autism. The fact is that the autistic children I’ve met have more to teach a man like Trump, more than he is ever capable of learning. Things such as:A capacity for deep, intense focusNot a quality that has ever troubled Trump, whose scattergun approach to politics causes predictable chaos. Hyperfocus, or the ability to obsess intensely on one topic or problem, is a trait that has almost certainly advanced humanity’s onward progress in every field imaginable, and it’s one that many autistic people share. I know one autistic seven-year-old whose obsession with the Roman empire means he knows more about politics, history, colonialism and war than the current leader of the so-called free world.Adherence to facts and logicYes, one autistic kid’s devotion to facts may mean having to hear everything possible there is to know about sharks – at length and on an extremely regular basis (who doesn’t love sharks, though?) But know what else it means? There is no hiding, as many parents who have had to endure a thorough cross-examination about Father Christmas will well know. Some autistic people also say they find it difficult to tell lies or be dishonest. Meanwhile, Trump made 30,573false or misleading claimsduring his first term.Empathy and a strong sense of social justiceIt’s a myth that autistic people can’t feel empathy – whereas Trump is incapable of showing it. Many autistic people have talked about feeling empathy at such powerful, profound levels that the suffering of other people, or animals, can be deeply distressing. It can also be politically galvanising. A couple of friends’ autistic children have recently been showing intense concern for Palestine, and have been waving flags and banging pots in solidarity (my friend’s son is now taking a little break from thinking about it, because it’s making him “too sad”). Greta Thunberg’shorror at the climate catastrophe, and her deep empathy for people and animals, is what made her become an activist before she’d even left childhood. Meanwhile, Trump spends his timebullying the very people, such as Thunberg, who want to make a change in the world.Exceptional memoryOn the one hand, we have Trump’s unfinished train of thought, and on the other, you have some autistic children’s astonishing ability to remember whole train timetables, film scripts, books, dates or number sequences.JoyI’ve always thought that autistic joy is some of the purest joy. I’ll never forget another mum telling me how sad she was when her daughter stopped hand flapping – a way of showing excitement that autistic people call a stim. “She showed her joy with her whole body,” she said. My brother also hand-flapped, and other kids used to make fun of it (doingmocking impressionsof people with disabilities is ahobby they sharewith the US president). How sad that more of us can’t show our happiness while being entirely free of self-consciousness. My brother’s ability to find joy in a song, a waterfall, the movement of a shadow, is something that inspires me every day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My brother doesn’t, but while he doesn’t show his love through physical affection, he shows it in other ways. He can’t speak fluently, but one of the phrases (calledGestalts) he does say is: “Knock on the door, mum’s coming!” That’s because when she visits him at his care home, she always knocks on the door. My brother may be one of the autistic people who, according to Robert F Kennedy Jr, will never “write a poem” or “go on a date”, but I believe there is more love in that sentence than in any of the Republican party’s vile hate speech.

As a TUC manifesto argues, those affected must have a greater say in shaping the workplace of the futureSun 28 Sep 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 16.53 EDTShareInThe Making of the English Working Class, the leftwing historian EP Thompson made a point of challenging the condescension of history towards luddism, the original anti-tech movement. The early 19th-century croppers and weavers who rebelled against new technologies should not be written off as “blindly resisting machinery”, wrote Thompson in his classichistory. They were opposing a laissez-faire logic that dismissed its disastrous impact on their lives.A distinction worth bearing in mind as Britainrolls outthe red carpet for US big tech, thereby outsourcing a modern industrial revolution still in its infancy. Photographers, coders and writers, for example, would sympathise with the powerlessness felt by working people who saw customary protections swept away in a search for enhanced productivity and profit. Unlicensed use of their creative labour to train generative AI hasdeliveredvast revenues to Silicon Valley while rendering their livelihoods increasingly precarious.The wider public shares such concerns. According to newresearchby the Tony Blair Institute, a large plurality of Britons see AI as a risk to the economy, rather than as an opportunity. Viewed from the perspective of actual and future workers, it is not hard to understand why. Automating swathes of the labour force may become a growth machine when it comes to the size of shareholders’ dividends; it is less clear what the upside is for the human beings displaced.AI already appears to besqueezingthe number of entry-level jobs in white-collar occupations. Energy‑hungry datacentres championed in the UK-US prosperity deal will generate significant (and undiscussed) environmental costs, butlittlenew work. More broadly, there is public unease regarding AI’s cultural impact. The Post Officescandallaid bare the dangers of allowing anonymous tech to take charge of people’s lives at work and beyond. Opaque and insidious algorithms sow discord and fuel extremism and disinformation online, a social ill embodied in the sneering trollery of Elon Musk.Yet as it desperately scrambles to attract private investment to kickstart growth, Labour appears content to hand the keys to Britain’s tech future to the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft. Sir Nick Clegg, who shouldknow, haspointedout that this will mean the game is played on Silicon Valley’s terms, and risks hollowing out public capacity and oversight. When the stakes are so high, and the perception that power in society has been captured by remote, self-serving elites is already pervasive, that is a reckless approach.Last month, the Trades Union Congresspublisheda “worker-first” strategy for AI, noting that “unmanaged disruption is not inevitable or acceptable”. Its call for employees’ voices to be heard when new technologies are deployed should be heeded, not least from the perspective of growth. From the creative industries to social care, those who work in affected sectors are best placed to understand the societal benefits AI can bring, as well as the dangers its introduction may pose.As the economist Mariana Mazzucato hasargued, state investment drove many of the technological breakthroughs that launched us into the era of AI. It now needs to be managed in the interests of the common good, which means a public conversation that extends well beyond the commercially driven priorities of big tech. A Labour government should have no qualms about convening that wider debate, and it should start in the workplace.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingWork & careersSilicon ValleyTUCNvidiaMicrosofteditorialsShareReuse this content"

Back in the 1980s, when writers’ spats and affairs made headlines, the winning ceremony wastelevised by the BBC. It was the book world’s Oscars. Today, the idea of tuning in to watch the dinner-suited literati tuck into supper in London’s oak-panelled Guildhall seems preposterous. But the UK’s most prestigious literary prize still needs to reach as wide an audience as possible. How do you sell“posh bingo”, as Julian Barnes memorably dubbed it, to theBookTokgeneration?It is no longer enough to tell people what they should be reading. Readers expect to be part of the conversation – to be in the bingo hall. This year’s shortlist was announced live by the chair and former Booker prizewinner Roddy Doyle at an event at London’s Southbank Centre, with behind-the-scenes chat from thepanel. The event was also livestreamed.However, readers are not going to be allowed into the judging room anytime soon. “Michael Frayn: Curiously dull”; “Melvyn Bragg: To name only one defect, how grossly over-written,” the formidable Rebecca West, one of the first judges, wrote in her memos. There’s a reason the meetings are confidential. But West would surely have approved of this year’s rich and remarkably variedshortlist, which includesThe Loneliness of Sonia and Sunnyby the former Booker winner Kiran Desai,Fleshby David Szalay,The Land in Winterby Andrew Miller (both previous shortlistees),The Rest of Our Livesby Ben Markovits,Flashlightby Susan Choi andAuditionby Katie Kitamura. There are no debuts.But first-time writers will be well served by anew prizein memory of the double-Booker-winning Wolf Hall novelist Hilary Mantel. And, in a sure sign of a shifting cultural landscape,another awardwas also launched last week to recognise Bookstagram favourites, with titles submitted and judged by members of the online books community. Who needs expert judges in the era of bookfluencers? There is room for both. Far from abandoning the Booker, online readers have gravitated towards the prize as a focus for discussion through its rapidly growing TikTok following and lively digital book club.Amid dismayingreportsof a decline in reading for pleasure (and literacy), acrisis in literary festivalsand fears of the novel’s dwindling status, this is all cause for celebration. The Booker is still a cultural institution to be reckoned with, not just in Britain but globally. Following recent crowd-pleasers such as Douglas Stuart’sShuggie Bainand last year’sOrbitalby Samantha Harvey (the fastest-selling winner in Booker history), the prize has finally found a path between pomposity and popularity.With such a strong shortlist, the 2025 winner promises to be another hit. If Orbital was also one of the shortest winners ever, this year should quell anxieties about vanishing attention spans with one of the titles weighing in at a hefty 700 pages. As stories of how to live with – and love – other people, all six novels are“brilliantly human”, as Doyle put it, a reminder of the threat to creativity from AI. Reading might be a solitary pursuit, but the shared experience of a novel can bring us together in a profoundly intimate way. Prizes provide a meeting place. At a time of so much division, we can take comfort in what another of this year’s judges, Ayòbámi Adébáyò, called “the communality of fiction”.Explore more on these topicsBooker prizeOpinionAwards and prizesFictionKiran DesaiDavid SzalayAndrew Miller (Books)Hilary ManteleditorialsShareReuse this content"

We should all be careful what they wish for, 23 September). I fled the place after two years of a three-year contract because of the horrible way the emirate treats guest workers. I’ve returned three times on brief trips because of my work as a journalist or consultant (plus once because a storm cancelled my flight). On all those trips, the place appeared glitzy, but the nasty underbelly persisted.I’ve watched as bored local men bought heroin as the electric windows of their car slid open to permit an exchange on the roads. I’ve visited hospitals where the babies of maids raped by their employers waited for adoption. I’ve seen the stables where the locals house thoroughbreds in palatial conditions that the labourers who work on constructions in 45C heat would consider a paradise.I have watched rents skyrocket over the past two decades, in a city where vast numbers of apartments remain empty while owners wait for property prices to rise. I’ve travelled in the sweaty metro to avoid the monstrous traffic jams. I’ve heard the stories from friends about the way the ruling sheikhs control their daughters who desire freedom in a society where women remain second-class citizens. I could continue, but you get the idea.Name and address suppliedDubaiembodies what the Marxist geographer David Harvey calls the “spatial fix” of capitalism – the search for new urban spaces to absorb surplus capital and labour. Its rise from fishing port to global hub was not an organic process but a highly planned strategy of accumulation by dispossession. Land reclamation, mega-projects and speculative real-estate ventures are not simply architectural spectacles, they are instruments for financialising space and transferring wealth upward.Marxism frames cities as sites where the contradictions of capitalism are intensified. Dubai illustrates this vividly. Its luxury malls, artificial islands and glittering towers represent use-values only for elites and global investors. Beneath them lies an underclass of migrant workers living in segregated, precarious conditions – an echo of Marx’s reserve army of labour. This bifurcation allows the city to appear as a post-national “world city” while relying on tightly policed hierarchies of race, citizenship and class.Harvey’s concept of the “right to the city” also highlights what is absent in Dubai: democratic urban governance and collective claims over space. Public life is subordinated to consumption and spectacle; dissent, unionising and grassroots urbanism are tightly restricted. Far from being a neutral platform for cosmopolitan exchange, Dubai’s urban fabric reflects a deliberate strategy to attract global capital and manage labour in ways that keep the contradictions of accumulation out of sight.In Marxist terms, Dubai is a paradigmatic case of urbanisation as a class project. It converts oil rents and speculative finance into monumental infrastructure to secure future accumulation, while externalising social and ecological costs on to invisible populations and distant environments. Its promise of limitless growth is thus both a mirage and a warning about the planetary limits of the capitalist city.Lance GoodmanCarbis Bay, CornwallHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It was the cry to warn people that a potshare bowl (made of whinstone and weighing up to 50 ounces, or about 1.4kg) might be about to lay waste to their lower legs, having been thrawn, hoyed or houghed (propelled) by a “hardy knight of the black diamond” (pitman).I doubt that the hardy knights would have been impressed by the Irish lads using 28-ounce bowls and nor does the length of “hoy” look much more than about 80 metres. Geordie potshare “boolers” were used to nine “thraws” to cover the mile course on the Town Moor.What’s more, the Geordie lads did it in their underwear – their jackets and trousers being an encumbrance – on the Moor, in January, in the snow. Up to 6,000 would turn up and there was excitement, alcohol, gambling and, unsurprisingly, the occasional disagreement, sufficiently objectionable to the citizens that the council, which owned the land, banned potshare in 1880. That meant a substantial loss forNewcastlebusinesses (wives came from the coalfield to shop) and, according to a local newspaper, the “corporation held the fee simple of the soil, whilst the freemen were entitled to the grass and herbage”. All had business interests, now damaged. A compromise was reached and bowling resumed, but on a clearly defined course.Matthew Rogerson of Fatfield – now within Washington – started “boolin” in 1863 and ended in 1899.

I thought we had moved beyond the middle ages. Do ministers not realise that this is playing to the mob and the politics of revenge?People serving community sentences have already faced the courts and publicly carried out their sentencing. To name and shame adds to their humiliation and the sense that they are pariahs in society. It incites (to my mind, justifiably) resentment. How is this rehabilitation? How does it build a more cohesive and caring society? What builds confidence in community sentencing is that it can boost offenders’ sense of having something to contribute to their local community and society at large.Ruth WindleFrome, SomersetRe your editorial on criminal justice reform (20 September), I believe that the approach used for motoring crimes – a fine and points that accumulate, leading to a driving ban – could be readily adapted to other low-level criminal activity, with the number of points reflecting the seriousness of the offence, and 12 points garnered within, say, three years leading to a sentence of 12 months in jail.This sword of Damocles approach to sentencing would, as with motorists, serve to concentrate the minds of most petty offenders, by far the majority, and free up overstretched police and magistrates court resources.Peter FellowsBradfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The 15-13 success for the visitors at Bethpage Black came against the backdrop ofawful spectator behaviour, largely towards European players and their families. McIlroy confirmed his wife, Erica, was hit by a beer that was thrown during Saturday afternoon’s play.“I don’t think we should ever accept that in golf,” said McIlroy. “I think golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week. Golf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you very good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people. Sometimes this week we didn’t see that. So no, this should not be what is acceptable in theRyder Cup. We will be making sure to say to our fans in Ireland in 2027 that what happened here this week is not acceptable.Lowry sinks putt that retains Ryder Cup for Europe as they hold off US comebackRead more“Come and support your team. I think if I was an American, I would be annoyed … I didn’t hear a lot of shouts for Scottie [Scheffler] today, but I heard a lot of shouts against me. It’s like, support your players. That’s the thing.“It was a rough week for all of us. But at the same time, we shut them up by our performance and how we played. I chirped back a few times because it got to me a few times, but we tried to handle everything that came our way with class and poise, and for the most part, I felt like we did that.”Shane Lowry, McIlroy’s close friend, added: “I was out there for two days with Erica McIlroy and the amount of abuse that she received was astonishing. The way she was out there supporting her husband and supporting her team was unbelievable.”McIlroy replied in jest when asked what it was like playing Ryder Cup matches with policemen and dogs lining fairways. “I wish they had let the dogs off the leashes,” he said.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy celebrates with fans after Europe’s victory at Bethpage.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images“The police out there and the amount of security presence was insane. Look, nothing was going to happen. There wasn’t going to be physical altercation or anything like that but there was a lot of language that was unacceptable and abusive behaviour.“It should be off limits but obviously it wasn’t this week. Erica is fine. She’s a very, very strong woman. She handled everything this week with class and poise and dignity like she always has. I love her and we’re going to have a good time celebrating tonight.”The Masters champion was only slightly more serious when asked how it felt to fire an iron shot to close range after turning to ask spectators to “shut the fuck up” as they heckled him before he hit. “Very fucking satisfying,” McIlroy said.Keegan Bradley, the defeated US captain, criticised the rule whereby both the hosts and Europe received singles half points before a Sunday ball was struck. Injury sustained by Viktor Hovland meant Bradley had to remove one of his own players, Harris English, from the draw. This moved Europe to within two points of retaining the Cup.“It has to change,” said Bradley. “I think it’s obvious to everybody in the sports world, in this room. Nothing against Viktor but that rule needs to change by the next Ryder Cup.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When you get what you deserve at the end there’s no better feeling. I’m so proud of the team and the way we controlled our emotions and navigated through the different stages of the game. We showed the conviction, the courage the desire and the quality we need to get where we want to be.“To get to the next level you have to learn from the past and we have certainly taken some lessons from this ground. But today the team took our game to a different level and I’m very proud. Newcastle are a terrific team and it’s so difficult to play against them.”Eddie Howe, whose side have won only once in the league this season, described the nature of the last-gasp defeat as “intensely painful” but was most concerned about the second half knee injury sustained by his England full-back Tino Livramento.Although Newcastle’s manager could offer no definitive updates as to Livramento’s condition, he described the sight of the England defender – who, as a Southampton player, was sidelined for a year after suffering with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament – being taken off on a stretcher in evident pain as “really distressing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A nervy Europa League win over Bologna on Thursday offered a slim platform on which to build but this week Unai Emery reiterated thePremier Leagueremains Villa’s priority.The Villa manager informed his players they had to pick up three points and afterwards grinned as he acknowledged that while they are 16th in the Premier League, the table already makes better viewing.Aston Villa 3-1 Fulham: Premier League – live reactionRead moreFulham punished Villa for another flat start with Raúl Jiménez heading in from a corner inside three minutes but Ollie Watkins’ first goal of the season and two strikes across two second-half minutes, courtesy of John McGinn and Emiliano Buendía, earned a comeback victory.“Delighted but relieved,” was how McGinn put it afterwards and the Villa captain was naturally happy for Watkins after the striker ended his dry run. “He always has a spell in the season when it doesn’t quite click for him,” McGinn said. “Hopefully that shuts a few people up.”Prior to his 37th-minute goal, Watkins had had two forgettable touches – as many as Jiménez who was withdrawn nearly half an hour earlier with an injury sustained when he opened the scoring from Sasa Lukic’s corner – and Villa as a team failed to penetrate Fulham. That changed when Lucas Digne pinged a long pass between Calvin Bassey and Joachim Andersen and Watkins spied an opportunity to pounce, deftly looping a bouncing ball over Bernd Leno close to the penalty spot. Bassey charged towards the goalline to clear but his momentum left him tangled in the Fulham net and instead Watkins could finally celebrate his first goal since the second week of May.Now Villa were in their stride, McGinn clipping a breezy pass over the Fulham back line for Morgan Rogers, whose first touch denied him a one on one with Leno. “It is not an easy place to play when the crowd is on your back but then when you get momentum, what a place to play,” McGinn said.View image in fullscreenJohn McGinn scores Aston Villa’s second goal, early in the second half, as they earned a first Premier League win of the season.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesDigne saw a free-kick saved by Leno on the verge of half-time, at which point Emery introduced Buendía in place of the former Fulham midfielder Harvey Elliott, who struggled to impose himself on his first Premier League start for Villa. Emery praised Buendía’s energy and commitment. “He had the possibility to leave [in the summer], but he wanted to stay,” the Villa manager said.Buendía immediately busied himself and had a hand in McGinn’s strike that gained Villa the lead. Lamare Bogarde, preferred to the fit-again Boubacar Kamara at the base of midfield, harried Adama Traoré, who had replaced Jiménez, and then Buendía shifted the ball to McGinn. The Villa captain had eyes only for goal and buried a left-foot shot into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Buendía added another, prodding in after reading Watkins’ cutback from the left. Emery punched the air incessantly, the frustration flooding out with each celebration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traoré located Lukic, whose goal-bound shot was kept out by a desperate Ezri Konsa block.King was outstanding until Watkins’ leveller but was booked for simulation midway through the first half after he sought a penalty having nudged the ball past a panicked Martínez at the end of a scintillating break. King, who was booked for diving against Brentford last weekend in Fulham’s previous league game, appeared to head to ground before Martínez made contact. A minute later a shot was blocked by Matty Cash’s hand, though both Fulham claims were cleared by the video assistant referee, Matt Donohue.A seething Marco Silva was booked for his explicit protests against the referee, Andy Madley, and when asked about the calls afterwards he said: “They [the referees] can write what they want, they can call us and say what they want. I have watched the moments again and for me, they are incredible.” Silva later denied that King’s previous dive may have created a precedent. “They don’t have a story from Josh King in the Premier League, he’s just turned 18.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Red Roses had the same ingredients at this World Cup as they did three years ago: world-class squad, winning dominance and full support from their union. So what made England take the next step to win in 2025? As Ellie Kildunne said after thesemi-final win against France, a World Cup isn’t won in a week, it’s won over a cycle. The slight changes implemented under John Mitchell’s new coaching era since 2023 enabled them to be victorious at Twickenham.After the 2023 Six Nations Louis Deacon remained as forwards coach but Mitchell came in as head coach, Sarah Hunter was introduced in defence and Lou Meadows came in attack. Making the attack more unpredictable was one of the main things they wanted to alter.England squad ratings: how all the Red Roses performed at Rugby World CupRead moreThat’s because the main criticism levied at the Red Roses after they lost the 2022 final was their lack of attacking diversity. In New Zealand they relied heavily on their deadly rolling maul, a criticism underpinned by the statistics. Throughout that World Cup 30 tries came from forwards and just 13 were scored by backs.“It wasn’t necessarily lots of change, it was recognising the opportunities in the squad,” Meadows says. “I think we are fortunate in that we have extremely talented players who are highly skilled … I know it has gone across the media as ‘handbrake off’ but it’s no fear of failure. Don’t be worried to make those mistakes. Actually get after it because when it comes off it is brilliant. It might not come off every time but we want you to try and we want you to back yourself in those decisions, play what is in front of you.”View image in fullscreenFull-back Ellie Kildunne has helped the team to be more unpredictable in how they attack.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAttacking unpredictability is the biggest change fans have seen in England’s performances and it has taken players such as Kildunne and made them some of the most famous names in the sport. It also helped the Red Roses to win as, in this World Cup, 28 tries were scored by forwards and 20 by backs. Though more forwards are still scoring, there has been that shift of scorers across the team with the highest try-scorer this tournament the wing Jess Breach.Culture has also had a shift in the England camp with Mitchell at the heart of it. A key aspect is his clear communication, particularly around team selections with the head coach informing his players way ahead of time if they will be playing or not. It allows for individuals to deal with the situation that has been handed to them before the team gets into the week where the entire squad needs to be behind everything involved in trying to get a win.Mitchell’s communication skills extend to another crucial decision he made which not only gave England the best preparation for this tournament, but also set them up to win: a change in captaincy. Marlie Packer was the skipper when Mitchell took over but he made a change at the start of the World Cup year by giving the captaincy to Zoe Aldcroft, one of the first names on the starting team sheet, while Packer was fighting for her position in the back row.‘Kildunne and Dusted’: Red Roses dialled up to 11 for emotional World Cup victory | Robert KitsonRead morePacker is a world class player but the competition in the back row, particularly in her position of openside flanker, was incredibly high. Removing Packer as captain allowed for more versatility in the back row with players such as Sadia Kabeya and Maddie Feaunati gunning for positions. Kabeya, who was player of the final, started five games this World Cup, Packer started one and Feaunati was used as a versatile back row substitute in all but one match as she started at No 8 against Samoa.By freeing up the back row for selection based on form and opposition it made sure the best possible England team was on the pitch at all times. Packer also remained a player in the squad, meaning the team did not lose her valuable leadership and experience. When speaking to Packer pre-tournament it was clear her relationship with Mitchell was one of mutual respect and that the head coach had made her feel valued to this team, which allowed her to flourish behind the scenes and deal with her non-selections.View image in fullscreenSadia Kabeya was player of the match in the final as England outclassed Canada.Photograph: Molly Darlington/World Rugby/Getty ImagesMitchell’s communication around the pressures of a World Cup have been impactful too, according to Hunter, the defence coach. “Mitch has been really good around let’s not make it any bigger than it is,” she says. “I think that is really good in terms of bringing the girls back in around where we need to be, keep our feet grounded, stay present, stay in the here and now and the rest will take care of itself. From that perspective it makes it relatively easy to block out that noise.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But sometimes things can be thrown out of the window in final rugby and so how did England beat Canada? Simply put: scrums, kicks, attacking bravery and slowing down Canada’s game.That creative licence given to England over the past three years shone through with Kildunne’s solo try and some great intercepts by the centre Tatyana Heard. They also retained all of their forward brilliance, particularly at the scrum with a superb set piece.Mitchell detailed how they believed teams had attacked poorly against Canada throughout the tournament and so England wanted to “put them into a rugby contest and see what that does to them”. He also said in terms of tactics they wanted to “belt them off nine” which they certainly did with Justine Pelletier, who was unstoppable against New Zealand in the semi-final, muted and “put contestable kicks up to unstructure their back three.”View image in fullscreenTheir tactics were spot on and it was the difference in the final. The coaches set their team up with all they needed and the players executed the gameplan to a tee. It means England are world champions again and they have left a lasting impact on the game in the country. But now they have won it, do they think they can do it again? “We’re like all explorers,” says Mitchell. “We’ll find the next peak to climb.”This article is part of the Guardian’s print supplement celebrating England’s World Cup win, available with Monday’s newspaper.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

The game was won by that point but the sight of the wing at full bore, leaving Leicester’s defence for dust, was one to savour.‘They have changed my life’: John Mitchell open to staying as England coachRead more“I said to the guys: ‘Jeez, it would be nice to have that sort of speed’,” said Bristol’s director of rugby, Pat Lam. “I wasn’t sure when he first came how quickly he would fit into a new team and the way we play and getting back to rugby fitness. I’m really proud of him.“Every day he’s getting better because of the way we train. He had to go through a little bit of pain at the beginning. I remember the amount of time he had his hands on knees, which I don’t allow. But that will give him a lot of confidence. To be able to still sprint like that at the end – he knows he’s got that in the tank.”Rees-Zammit’s last appearance in the Prem – or the Premiership as it was then – came for Gloucester on 30 December 2023 at ­Twickenham – as it was then – in Big Match 15. The 24-year-old’s dalliance with ­American football thereafter ended in the summerwithout the NFL break he yearned forbut his return has been a welcome boost both for Bristol Bears and the league.After a first try in Bears’ colours in thePrem RugbyCup last week at Gloucester, Sunday’s score in his first complete 80 minutes was another sign that Rees-Zammit is back in his happy place. He did not have many opportunities but he took his chance in style when it came. Gabriel Oghre and the replacement Josh Carrington also touched down in the second half after Fitz Harding and Gabriel Ibitoye had scored tries before the break.View image in fullscreenJosh Carrington splashes down for a try on his Prem debut to give Bristol a bonus point.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockThe Tigers managed four tries, with two from the wing Adam ­Radwan, whose footwork must have impressed the watching England head coach, Steve Borthwick, plus one from Orlando Bailey and an early score from Jack van Poortvliet.Bristol had to fight their way back after a fast start from the Tigers that was something of a surprise given their buildup. Despite staying ­overnight in Bristol ahead of the game, they ended up scrambling to be ready for the start.“We arrived 45 minutes before kick-off and had to walk from the other side of the ground through the fans. The bus driver took not one wrong turn but two wrong turns. We actually started pretty well so no excuses,” said Leicester’s new head coach, Geoff Parling. “I thought we looked like a team that was still ­getting to know each other a little bit. But I can’t fault their effort.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will have been particularly frustrated with his side conceding 14 penalties. Tom ­Jordan, man of the match on an assured debut after his summer move from Glasgow, punished them with 14 points from the boot.Jordan was switched from full-back to stand-off 13 minutes in when AJ MacGinty tore his achilles. It was one of three serious injuries suffered by the Bears during the course of the game, with Harry Randall and Ibitoye departing with hamstring issues. It is MacGinty’s that is of most long-term concern. If it is as bad as feared it could be a long road back for the USA international at the age of 35.“Aaron Rodgers is older than AJ and he was back in 11 weeks after snapping his achilles so I’ll have to have a quiet word with Louis Rees-Zammit to see if he knows someone at the Green Bay Packers,” said Lam.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyBristolLeicesterRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

But Sociedad took the lead on the half-hour mark against the run of play through the former Real Madrid right-back Álvaro Odriozola, who was making his first start of the season after fellow defender Jon Aramburu got injured during the warmup. Ander Barrenetxea beat Koundé in the box and crossed to an unmarked Odriozola, who finished right-footed from the edge of the six-yard box.Barcelona equalised in the 43rd minute as Rashford’s corner found Koundé in the box and the French defender made no mistake with a header.A confident Barcelona pushed for the winner in the second half, and Lamine Yamal made an impact less than a minute after coming on as a substitute. The 18-year-old, who was returning from a groin injury, dribbled past a defender and crossed to Lewandowski, whose header went in off the post in the 58th minute to put the hosts 2-1 up. Lewandowski could have scored again a minute later but shot over the bar from Dani Olmo’s back-heel.Sociedad almost hit back when Aihen Muñoz found Oyarzabal with a through ball, but his shot was tipped over by the goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny. The visitors went close to an equaliser in the 84th minute when Takefusa Kubo’s shot hit the crossbar and a minute later, Lewandowski’s shot at the other end also came off the woodwork.Barcelona, who are on a five-match winning streak in all competitions, host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday, before continuing their LaLiga title defence at Sevilla next Sunday. “It’s good, but it’s a long road ahead … tomorrow we will start focusing all our attention on PSG,” Flick said.Milanheld on for a 2-1 win overNapoliat San Siro to go top of the Serie A standings on goal difference, after Christian Pulisic scored one and created the other before the home side went down to 10 men and conceded a penalty.Napolidropped their first points of the season in a game where Milan looked in control at half-time through goals from Alexis Saelemaekers and Pulisic but Pervis Estupiñán’s red card and Kevin De Bruyne’s penalty almost rescued the visitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only Juan Ayuso of Spain and Mexico’s Isaac Del Toro – both members of Pogacar’s UAE-XRG stable – could initially follow but Ayuso soon cracked and Del Toro was cast adrift 67km from the line, left to watch as Pogacar disappeared up the road for another memorable solo triumph.The 267.5km race marked a historic staging of the championships in Rwanda’s hilly capital, with the punishing circuit, peppered with cobbles, producing relentless climbing.

[We had a] real upshot of energy in the second half [but] the disappointing part for me was really that energy in the first half, very flat. You’ve got to be there in the duels.“We’re getting beaten too easily in one-twos, on the sides, and we effectively handed the game to them in the first half,” Taylor added after the 2-0 home defeat in St Helens.Liverpool’s German goalkeeper, Rafaela Borggräfe, made her first WSL appearance and started her second consecutive game in all ­competitions, despite being under investigation by the Football ­Association foran alleged racist commentthat was overheard by teammates and staff during pre-season.Borggräfe’s first real involvement in the game was to watch the ball fizz past her as United’s early pressure was rewarded with a fourth-minute opening goal. After good work down the right by Toone, Jess Park’s cross was met by a lethal, first-time left-footed shot from Miyazawa that was struck with precision and power to give the hosts’ goalkeeper no chance.The visitors looked sharper, faster and far more confident in possession as they dominated most of the first 45 minutes, going close to adding a second when another eye-catching Miyazawa effort hit a post. There had also been chances for Jayde Riviere, who swerved a near-post effort wide, and for Julia Zigiotti Olme, who headed wide from ­Melvine Malard’s cross.United doubled their lead just before the interval when Elisabeth Terland’s persistence was rewarded as she won the ball off Gemma Evans and fed Toone, who finished ­clinically, low into the corner.View image in fullscreenElla Toone (right) holds off Gemma Evans to score Manchester United’s second goal.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesMarc Skinner’s team were ­recycling possession very quickly on the rare occasions they did lose the ball, scarcely allowing Liverpool to keep it for more than a few ­seconds, and Skinner said afterwards: “In the first half, we were electric. We blew ­Liverpool away. Second half, I felt we dropped our ­intensity a ­little bit, [we were] probably a ­little too ­comfortable, and I’ve just reminded our players that our ­standards are to keep that level.”Just before the visitors’ second goal, a rare Liverpool attack ended with Ceri Holland’s deflected shot being touched on to a post by the Manchester United goalkeeper ­Phallon Tullis-Joyce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the hosts’ best chance.It has been a difficult and ­sombre week for Liverpool, who are ­mourning the shock death of theirformer manager Matt Beard, aged 47. Their away fixture against Aston Villa last Sunday was postponed.Liverpool had returned to action on Wednesday with an emotional 5-0 win over Sunderland in the League Cup when Beard’s brother, Mark, and his mother, Margaret, were in the stands. On Sunday, Beard’s wife, ­Debbie, was present. A ­fundraising page for Beard’s family, ­organised by the broadcaster Jacqui Oatley, has so far raised more than £52,000.On the pitch, there was a landmark moment as Liverpool’s Gemma Bonner became only the third player to make 200 WSL appearances, after Millie Bright and the division’s all-time leading appearance-maker, Jordan Nobbs, but there was very little else for Liverpool to celebrate.The only previous time that ­Liverpool have lost their opening three WSL matches, in the 2019-20 season, they went on to be relegated.

All, anybody involved in those events that offended him, they’re in real danger.”Cobb, a distant relative of the baseball legend with the same name, has become a vocal Trump critic sinceserving ashis liaison to special counsel Robert Mueller, and said his role as lawyer for the administration, not as a personal attorney to the president, allowed him to call “balls and strikes” now.He laid out why he thought the indictment against Comey, for allegedly lying to Congress, was fatally flawed; and assailed Trump’sappointmentof a White House aide with no prosecutorial experience to pursue the case, after he fired a federal prosecutor, Erik Siebert, when he declined to bring charges.“So, you have the rewriting history stuff. The US attorney that he appointed, his personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan, her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America had slaves, at the Smithsonian,” he said.“She was there to whitewash the Smithsonian and paint America as something that it isn’t. America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we’ve had, and one of the biggest mistakes that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.”Cobb’s front-row seat to the machinations of Trump’s first term has made him an in-demand commentator on the workings of the second, and he told CBS he does not like what he sees.“Former attorney general [Robert] Jackson, the Nuremberg prosecutor, highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the justice department when he was attorney general was that people not target individuals, that they merely pursue crimes,” he said.Trump says he expects charges for other adversaries after Comey indictmentRead more“Griffin Bellyears later said essentially the same thing [and] emphasized how politics and favor have no business at the justice department. It’s all about even-handedness.”Cobb said Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, has “wholly abandoned that and is now merely doing the president’s bidding when he says, ‘Prosecute my enemies, now’”.But the case against Comey, he said, was flimsy at best, and would almost certainly collapse.“The grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count, actually, in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23 in a process where there’s no defense attorney in the room, and the standard is merely probable cause,” he said.“The next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and there will be a vigorous defense. I don’t see any way in the world that Comey will be convicted. And I think there’s a good chance, because of the wholly unconstitutional, authoritarian way that this was done, that the case may get tossed out well before trial.”Separately, without mentioning Trump, his appointed FBI director Kash Patel contradicted a recent social media claim by the president that nearly 275 of the bureau’s agents were planted among the pro-Trump crowd that carried out the 2021US Capitol attack.Patelreportedlyissued a statement to Fox News Digital, according to the outlet, in which he said FBI agents at the scene of the attack were only sent to the scene after the mob attacked the Capitol in a desperate attempt to keep Trump in office despite his losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden.Issued Saturday night, the statement from Patel did make it a point to say that was not “the proper role of FBI agents”, among other things.In yet another bizarre social media episode for Trump, he posted – and then deleted – an artificial intelligence video in which his likeness was promoting magic medical beds that a far-right conspiracy claims can cure any ailment. The video depicted Trump touting a card guaranteeing access to new hospitals equipped with such beds.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJames ComeyLaw (US)Trump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Turnout was 49.55%, higher than expected.The narrow win will come as a relief to Switzerland’s main political parties, which had mostly supported plans for the e-ID. Both houses of the Swiss parliament had backed the measure with large majorities and the government had recommended a “yes” vote.But voters rejected an earlier version of the e-ID in 2021, largely over objections to the role of private companies in the system. In response to these concerns, the Swiss state will now provide the e-ID, which will be optional and free of charge.The referendum came soon after the UK governmentannounced plans for a digital ID card, which would sit in the digital wallets of smartphones, using state-of-the-art encryption.More than1.6 million people have signed a petition opposing e-ID cards, which would be mandatory for people working in the UK by 2029.The Swiss authorities said the e-ID would help people prove their identity online, making it easier to access government services or prove their age, for example when buying alcohol. The e-ID, which is linked to a smartphone, can also be used in bricks and mortar businesses, for instance, to open a bank account or prove age in bars and clubs. To ensure security the e-ID is linked to a single smartphone, users will have to get a new e-ID if they change their device.Starmer’s ID plan has caused upset, but in the EU the debate has long been settledRead moreSwiss people could still choose to use a physical ID card, which has been in place for decades. An ID card containing biometric data – fingerprints – will be available from the end of next year.Critics of the e-ID scheme raised data protection concerns and said it opened the door to mass surveillance. They also fear the voluntary scheme will become mandatory and disadvantage people without smartphones. The referendum was called after a coalition of rightwing and data-privacy parties collected more than 50,000 signatures against e-ID cards, triggering the vote.Political scientist Lukas Golder told Swiss public television, SRF, that since the Covid pandemic he had seen growing mistrust of state solutions, particularly in conservative regions.The government argued digital ID would boost the Swiss economy by bringing the non-EU country in line with its neighbours.By the end of 2026 all EU citizens should be able to have a digital wallet,allowing people to store ID cards, driving licences and university diplomas in one place online, so they can prove identity and have easier access to government and private business services. The digital wallet is voluntary, based on open-source code and is being tested by 550 public authorities and private companies in the EU, Norway, Iceland and Ukraine.Some countries havealready taken this path. For more than two decades, Estonians have had e-ID cards, which are used to vote, digitally sign documents, access public services and shop online. In Ukraine, 14 million people are said to usethe Diia app and website, which allows people to store digital documents, including passports and ID cards, and access state services, such as paying traffic fines and updating driving licences.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandIdentity cardsEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

They didn’t just hold back the economy, they crushed the dreams of families who couldn’t afford a decent home,” he said. “Well, conference, no more. We will fight the Tory blockers and give working people the key to a decent home they can afford to live in.”Build prefab homes to address harm to ‘generation of homeless children’, says Labour MPRead moreReed, who came on stage wearing a red “Build, baby, build” hat, added: “I will do whatever it takes to get Britain building again, and we won’t just build homes, we’ll build communities. And not just communities but entire towns.”The housing secretary paid tribute to his predecessor, Angela Rayner, who resigned after a scandal over underpaid stamp duty tax. He said she was a “true working-class hero” for her work on workers’ rights, council funding and housebuilding. Reed received a standing ovation for his tribute to the former deputy leader.In a separate interview with GB News, Reed acknowledged that the pace of housebuilding had not been fast enough over the last year, blaming that on a lack of permissions given under the Conservatives.He could not give a figure for how many new homes had been completed out ofthe 1.5m the partyhas promised to build this parliament. Given the total of 120,000, he said the government was “currently dealing with the tail end of what the Conservatives are doing, because it takes more than 18 months from application to the home being built”.He said the government was changing the rules to “speed up planning so that the problem we’re seeing now won’t happen again in future”.James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, dismissed the plans for new towns. “They could promise a free unicorn for every child and it would have more credibility than these new towns that they’re promising,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was headed north at 7mph (11kph) and its maximum sustained winds were 40mph (65kph).The center said the system was expected to move across the central and northwestern Bahamas on Sunday and turn east-northeastward, away from the southeastern US, by the middle of the week.A tropical storm watch was in effect for the east coast of Florida from the Palm Beach-Martin county line to the Flagler-Volusia county line, the center said, urging residents along the south-east US coast to monitor the system. A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours.South Carolina’s governor, Henry McMaster, urged people to monitor the weather closely and stay alert.

Shipping and power generation are also being affected by low water levelsAjit Niranjanin the SpreewaldSun 28 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 16.10 EDTShareCrumbling a fistful of sandy soil by his dried-up sunflower field, Thomas Goebel pointed to one of the many casualties of this year’s drought: a bright green machine that resembles a tractor crossed with a biplane.TheGurkenflieger(cucumber plane) used to roll proudly through his fields with farmhands in the wings plucking vegetables to make salty-sweet-sour Spreewald gherkins. Goebel stopped using it for production five years ago – his pickles could not compete with supermarket prices – and a recent experiment letting tourists ride inside generated enthusiasm but little profit.Now, theGurkenfliegerjoins the ranks of ageing machines and four hectares of woodland that Goebel has sold off to manage a lack of liquidity as bank loans and employee salaries collide with volatile weather. This year’s drought has dried out his crops and cut yields by 40-75% of the average for the last two decades.“It makes your heart pound,” said Goebel, a self-described optimist who chairs the south Brandenburg farmer’s association, about the hot and dry weather that withered his plants this year.“Every day on the way from home to the fields I had to watch the sunflowers and corn curl up and shrink,” he said. “I had to drive with blinders on. I couldn’t look left or right.”Stories such as Goebel’s are becoming more common across the continent. Drought has cost Europe a staggering €11.2bn (£9.8bn) a year over the last few decades, astudyfound earlier this summer, and losses are set to mount as fossil fuel pollution clogs the atmosphere.Annual drought losses in the EU, the UK, Norway and Switzerland are projected to rise to €13bn (£11.3bn) if global heating reaches 2C (3.5F) above pre-industrial – an optimistic outcome based on current policies – and €17.5bn (£15.3bn) if it hits a catastrophic 3C (5F).Droughts projected to worsen in the south and west of Europe as a result of climate change chartThe food system is the most vulnerable. Lilian Guzmán, a farmer just outside Berlin, said the drought had led to a “total failure” of her rapeseed crop and left her and her employees wishing for rain as the harvest edged closer.“It was a huge stress,” said Guzmán, who like Goebel has sandy soils that struggle to hold water. “We were watching from the window like children waiting for the first snow.”Adam Beer, an organic farmer in south-west England, said he hadn’t seen proper rain for months when he planted cabbages and cauliflowers in the wake of the heatwave that scorchedEuropein early July. He made sure to irrigate his field once before and twice after placing the four-inch shoots in the frail soil.But within a week, he said, the young green plants had turned “either completely invisible, or so dry you could crumble them into dust.”Beer had expected to lose half the crop to the hot and dry weather but instead found 95% had been wiped out. “Your heart just drops,” he said. “It’s devastating.”From the UK, which saw its driest spring in over a century, all the way through to Ukraine, a breadbasket facing desertification, the lack of water has also caused pain across lesser-known parts of the European economy.“It is indeed stressful,” said Martin Staats, president of the German inland shipping association. Low water levels were restricting movement and stopping companies from loading their ships full of cargo, he said. In the driest periods, ships have been forced to sit idly in harbours.“If I compare it to Covid or with other economic challenges we face in the shipping industry, the drought is the biggest problem,” said Staats. “It’s not forecastable, it’s not foreseeable, and we cannot adapt the vessels.”The economic fallout of drought has been seen most clearly on the Rhine, which links Germany’s industrial heartland with Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest port. In 2018, the river was too hot to cool industrial facilities and water levels were too low to ship raw materials or goods. The drop in production cost German chemical firm BASF €250m (£218m).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The loss of crops across Europe has raised the question of how the industry will prepare for the future.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyOther sectors are struggling to adapt. France and Switzerland were forced to shut down nuclear power plants during the June heatwave because of a lack of water cold enough for cooling. At the same time, power-generating dams across the continent have been left with reservoirs that are far emptier than last year.Europe’s hydropower generation typically peaks in May, as snow melts and spring showers fill streams and rivers, but in 2025 output fell to its lowest level for the month since 2017, according to data from thinktank Ember. In July, British energy company SSE blamed “unfavourable weather conditions across April and May” for a drop in total production that included a year-on-year fall in springtime hydropower generation of 40%.Some regions have seen a respite from recent rains, while others are still on edge. One-third of Europe was under orange drought warnings at the end of June, and by August red alert conditions had set in across large parts of south-west France and the Balkans.The lack of rain has squeezed farmers across the continent who are weighed down by other burdens and have little room to breathe. Svitlana Lytvyn, chief analyst at the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, said the weather this year has been “particularly disappointing” for Ukrainian farmers. There would still be enough food to meet domestic demand, she said, but it may lead to a fall in agricultural exports – a key pillar of the war-torn country’s economy.For Beer, the organic vegetable and crop farmer in England, this year’s losses also raise the question of how to prepare for the future. He said the death of his cauliflowers and cabbages this month will cost him 5-10% of the farm’s yearly income – a hit that comes on top of a dip in harvest yields for other crops, and which is set to be compounded by further losses this winter.“The result of this is potentially less money to pay ourselves, but it definitely means less money for investments,” he said. “It means we can’t build resilience.”Explore more on these topicsDroughtFarmingWaterGermanyEuropeFoodShipping industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It kills livestock, ruins harvests, and has knock-on effects across the economy that force people to flee their homes. How worried should we be about drought – and can we do anything about it?What is drought?Droughts are long spells of unusually dry weather. They are defined based on local conditions – drought in a rainy country looks very different to drought in an arid one – and where in the water cycle the deficit hits.Meteorological drought means a lack of rain. That can lead to hydrological drought (low water levels in streams and reservoirs) and agricultural drought (plant stress from low soil moisture) depending on factors such as how much water evaporates or runs off.How bad are droughts?Droughts can be extremely deadly. In Somalia, one of the countries most scarred by drought in recent history, doctorsestimate71,000 people died because of drought between January 2022 and June 2024, with children under the age of five making up more than one in three deaths. Droughts are also thought to have contributed to several armed conflicts in Africa and the Middle East.In rich countries, droughts are unlikely to kill people but do staggering damage to the economy. In Europe, a recentstudyfound drought has cost an average of €11bn (£9.6bn) a year over the past few decades. Farmers are hit hardest, but the effects stretch to hydropower dams and nuclear power plants, as well as inland shipping companies and the businesses that rely on them for trade.Are droughts getting worse?The share of the Earth’s land affected by drought has roughly doubled since 1900, according toanalysisby the OECD, with dry spells becoming more common and more intense on all continents. Since the 1950s the picture has been mixed, with some regions having dried out, such as the Mediterranean and the Amazon, while others, such as large parts of North America, have grown wetter.Is climate change making drought worse?Fossil fuel pollution has warmed the planet by about 1.4C since preindustrial times, disrupting stable weather patterns and making many extremes more violent. The extra heat makes more water evaporate – a recentstudyblamed the atmosphere’s growing “thirst” for 40% of the increase in drought strength since 1981 – but the effect on rainfall is more complicated, as atmospheric currents shift water from one region to another.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global heating will cause more and more regions to suffer from agricultural and ecological droughts, with the severity increasing at higher levels of warming.View image in fullscreenPeople displaced by the 2021-23 Somalia drought.Photograph: Hassan Ali Elmi/AFP/GettyWhat can be done to survive drought?Managing water supplies is crucial in regions that are drying out. This could mean shifting away from water-intensive industries, using water more efficiently, and reducing waste through leaky pipes. Restrictions on water use – such as hosepipe bans – are becoming increasingly common tools to deal with emergencies.Farmers and scientists are also experimenting with drought-resistant crops that can better survive long periods without rain.How can I help?The average water consumption in rich countries can run to hundreds of litres per person per day, with people in water-scarce countries such as Spain and Israel using far less than northern Europeans and Americans.The average person can save far more water through their consumption habits – such as eating less meat or buying fewer clothes – than actions such as turning off the tap when brushing their teeth. Still, experts in drought-stricken regions recommend taking shorter showers and filling dishwashers and washing machines before turning them on.Explore more on these topicsDroughtWaterEuropeClimate crisisexplainersShareReuse this content"

Even though he poses as something else, he is now part of a global network of the far right, a global network of billionaires like Elon Musk who want to take away people’s rights, take away people’s freedoms, and we need to have that argument.”Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, has been criticised for failing to crack down on misinformation on the platform and evensharing fake news himself.He recently appeared via video link at a far-right rally in London organised by the convicted criminal Tommy Robinson and called for a “change of government”, adding: “Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”Elon Musk’s xAI accuses OpenAI of stealing trade secrets in new lawsuitRead moreMiliband said of Musk: “He called for the overthrow of our government. He incited violence on our streets. His platform,X, promotes disinformation. He’s a dangerous person.”Asked if that meant the government should leave X, he said: “It’s possible.”Last year, after riots spread in his area, theLabourmayor of the Liverpool city region, Steve Rotheram, said people should consider leaving the platform. “The time is approaching where we’ve got to all examine whether we should, en masse, withdraw from it and for there to be a different platform,” he said.Labour MPs have alsobegun quitting X.When asked whether he was disheartened by the rise of Reform and the proliferation of climate denial, Miliband said: “I lost the election in 2015 right? I could have gone away.“But the point of politics is about ideals. The point of politics is to go out and argue your case, and you let the chips fall where they may, and maybe you win, and maybe you don’t … The point of it all is you believe in things, you go out and argue for things. You win the argument.”He said Reform was sticking up for “the frackers who want to frack our country” and that the opposition to net zero had come from “massive economic interests”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her twin, Dorothy Sivyer, died in July 2022.The pair – who called themselves “the Twinnies” – were born on 28 August 1920.The siblings were Britain’s oldest identical twins and claimed their long life was down to balancing wine and chocolate with exercise and healthy food – and having a big group of female friends.They had just turned 19 when the second world war was declared in 1939 and both sisters worked during the conflict. Whitehead, the eldest by a few minutes, worked as a radar operator during the war.Whitehead had wanted to go to art college, but instead obeyed her father’s instructions and went to work for an advertising company in London.She later took up teaching and worked at the then Delce Junior school in Rochester, and primary schools in Gillingham, Kent, until her retirement.In her later years, she rekindled her love of art and had numerous oil paintings around her home.The widowed Sivyer, a radiographer who treated members of the armed forces returning from the Normandy beaches, had three children, six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.After the war she became a physicist assistant and worked for the health service until she was 64.The sisters lived together in their childhood home, built by their grandparents, during the Covid lockdown. The pair celebrated turning 100 together in 2020 and revealed they never had sibling squabbles.Sivyer said at the time: “We haven’t come to blows or anything. I don’t mind turning 100. Nobody has got this old in our family before.”She added: “Our teenage years were our favourite time. You’re free to do what you want and go where you want. We’ve always got on very well. We’ve never quarrelled.”Whitehead was once engaged but never married. She lived in the same house from the age of 12.Revealing the secret to the twins’s longevity, Whitehead said: “We do have naughty food but we also eat very healthily as well. We’ve never smoked but we do have the occasional glass of wine.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

The body of the teenager, who was believed to have fallen from a dinghy, was discovered on a beach in northernFranceon Sunday.The death follows those of three other people on Saturday who were trying to reach the UK –two Somali womenwho were reportedly crushed in a boat, and a man whose body was recovered from a canal in the town of Gravelines, near Dunkirk.According to UK government figures, 895 people crossed the Channel in 12 boats on Saturday, taking the number making small boat crossings this year to more than 33,300. The large number of crossings on Saturday was due to an improvement in the weather after poor conditions had led to a pause over the previous six days.The body of the child was discovered on a beach in Saint-Étienne-au-Mont. The child had been onboard a crammed dinghy from which another 48 people fell into the sea, who were later rescued.An investigation into the latest death has been opened, led by the Boulogne-sur-Mer public prosecutor.According to the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, Laurent Touvet, since Friday evening there have been 41 maritime incidents relating to failed departure attempts or completed crossings. He said the authorities had provided care for 223 shipwrecked people since Saturday morning.“Faced with these deadly crossings organised by unscrupulous criminal networks, the state remains fully mobilised. Police officers, gendarmes and all emergency services continue their efforts day and night to save lives,” Touvet said.Aposton X by the French association Utopia 56, which supports migrants in northern France, said: “The body of a child was found this morning on a beach south of Boulogne-sur-Mer, even as attempts to cross the English Channel have been multiplying since the day before yesterday. This is the fourth death announced this weekend, all victims of deadly policies carried out at this border.”In the past fortnight, Britain and France have introduced a “one in, one out” deal under which seven people have so far been returned to France in an attempt to deter further crossings. A family of three asylum seekers including a small child have come to the UK.The UK government has installed signs in English and French around Calais and Dunkirk warning that people who cross the Channel to the UK will be at risk of being returned to France. Figures since the deal was announced include 1,072 people crossing the Channel in 13 boats on 19 September.Explore more on these topicsFranceImmigration and asylumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The transport ministry said all civilian use of drones would be banned to ensure security while Denmark hosts an EU summit on Wednesday and a meeting ofthe European Political Community, a wider gathering of leaders from across the continent, on Thursday.It said the move would “remove the risk that enemy drones can be confused with legal drones and vice versa”, and it said any violation of the ban could result in a fine or two years’ imprisonment.There has been a spate of drone incursions in recent weeks inDenmark,PolandandRomania, as well as the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets, while Russia continues its deadly bombardment of Ukraine.On Sunday a German air defence frigate, FSG Hamburg, arrived in Copenhagen to contribute to “strengthening Denmark’s airspace surveillance” during the summits, Danish armed forces said.The frigate is part of Nato’s “Baltic Sentry” mission, which the alliance said this weekend it intended to strengthen. A Nato spokespersonsaidthere would be “even more enhanced vigilance” in the Baltic Sea region, including Denmark.Baltic Sentry – deployments of Nato frigates, aircraft and drones to protect infrastructure – was launched in January after a series of incidents in whichpower cables, telecoms links and gas pipelines on the Baltic Sea floor were damaged.View image in fullscreenThe frigate Hamburg (F220) of the German Navy is docked at the harbour in Copenhagen as defence is bolstered.Photograph: Emil Nicolai Helms/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty ImagesNato launched “Eastern Sentry” earlier this month to bolster the defence of Europe’s eastern flank in response to Russian drone incursions of Polish airspace.In neighbouring Norway, airport operator Avinor said late on Sunday that drone “activity” had been observed at Bronnoysund Airport, one of four airports in northern Norway where air and land restrictions for drones had been extended to 10km as “a precautionary measure”.Norway was already investigating “possible sightings of drones” on Saturday near its biggest military base, Orland, where its F-35 fighter jets are parked.Writing on X on Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he had spoken to Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, about the “increasing incidents with Russian drones over Europe”, adding: “The unity of Europeans will definitely provide an answer to this threat.”Russia launchedhundreds of drones and missilesat Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities overnight in a 12-hour bombardment that killed at least four people.Russia has denied deliberate targeting of Nato countries with drones. The Kremlin accused Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, of “unfounded allegations” last week after she said authorities were still investigating who was behind adrone incursionthat shut Copenhagen airport for several hours but could not rule out Russia.Drone incursions have also affected Norway, with Støre accusing Russia of violating Norway’s airspace three times over spring and summer.After a two-day meeting of Nato military chiefs in Riga, the chair of Nato’s military committee, Adm Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, said on Saturday: “Every threat to Nato’s air, land and sea space will be dealt with a resolute and proportionate response.”Asked whether Nato’s air policing mission in the Baltic could be upgraded to air defence, Cavo Dragone stressed that the origin of the drones was still being investigated but “this could be an option, depending on what will be the final assessment”.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkDrones (military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is not just with us; it is with everyone.“It could be a motorbike that is now hit, or a table with a small bit of metal on it or window frames.“The issue is if we still have a number of things that are not clear, if you have one side expanding through these lists of derivatives, it is very difficult to claim we have certainty.”The UK government, which secured its lower steel tariff before a deal with the EU, has said it is seeking clarification from Washington about what extra steel products will be affected.Fearing another wave of redundancies in a sector already hit by overcapacity and cheap foreign imports, the Community trade union and British Steel said they wanted the UK’s industrial sector to sign a pledge backing the country’s steel sector.“With the industry facing unprecedented challenges, the pledge seeks to galvanise support for UK-made steel and reinforce the long-term resilience of the sector, its workforce, and the infrastructure it sustains,” the two organisations said.Eurofer, the European steel trade representative body, said: “The latest developments make even more evident the need for a strong new trade measure to preserve not only the viability of the EU steel sector but EU manufacturing as a whole, and the millions of quality jobs they sustain in Europe.”Steel tariffs went up from a punitive 25% to 50% in June. It was part of Trump’s attempt to revive the US industry but also to ringfence it not just against Chinese imports but also products that include steel, be they stainless steel sinks, kettles or cranes.The German MEP and chair of the European parliament’s influential international trade committee, Bernd Lange, said the derivative list was already “really harming a lot of industries” including the motorcycles sector.He told how he had recently visited a motorcycle factory in Germany, where he learned the owners were unable to produce a definitive paper trail for the quantity of steel and aluminium used in their vehicles, down to nuts and bolts that could have an element of Chinese steel in them.Under the rules the tariffs are payable on the value of their steel and aluminium content.“They know they are between 30% and 50% but because they are unsure, they declare 50% because otherwise they are in danger of getting tariffs of 200%,” Lange said in reference to customs penalties for non-declaration of all goods subject to duties.He told MEPs that the new tariff regime and the prospect of the inclusions of products expanding meant it was not easy to “explain to the workers” that the EU-US deal was a good one.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionSteel industryTariffsEuropeDonald TrumpTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

But as the Beatles and Led Zep showed in the past, more scenic routes can pay offEamonn FordeSun 28 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 16.50 EDTShareAs the mania around them was erupting in early 1963, the Beatles toured the UK supporting Helen Shapiro, including shows in Wakefield, Taunton and Hanley (now amalgamated as part of Stoke-on-Trent). In late 1971, as their untitled fourth album was released, Led Zeppelin roared around the country, including stops in Preston, Bournemouth and Salisbury. Gathering a head of steam in 1994, Oasis performed in Tunbridge Wells, Derby and Newport. Promoting his debut album in 2011, Ed Sheeran stopped off in Keele, Falmouth and Aberdeen.But over the decades, most of these regional cities and towns steadily fell off the touring map as focus turned to the bigger cities, often those with large student populations. By the early 2000s it was contracting further due to a mix of rising costs, venue closures and tour support from record labels drying up as CD sales collapsed.Opportunities to see grassroots acts are shrinking: in October, the Music Venue Trust (MVT) reported that acts played on average 11 shows when touring smaller venues in 2024, compared with 22 three decades earlier. But, speaking to live music business publication IQ earlier this year, Denis Desmond, chairman of Live Nation UK & Ireland, said that the touring map was expanding: “Compared to 2015, we’re hosting events in 40% more towns across the UK – showing that demand really is nationwide.”A curious bifurcation now appears to be reshaping UK touring. Acts over a certain size frequently over-supply a handful of major cities (mainly London, Manchester, Glasgow and Leeds), or tour the regions as a novelty – Jake Bugg’s recent Your Town tour, CMAT’s pre-Glastonbury warm-up run – while smaller acts venturing deeper into the provinces can often only do so under straitened conditions.View image in fullscreen‘Off the map’ … Esquires in Bedford.Photograph: Neil McCartyAs part of the Delgados’ 2023 reunion tour, Emma Pollock played Brighton, London, Manchester, Sheffield and Glasgow. She is also touring as a solo act in October and will visit Hull, Perth, Aberdeen and Sale as well as several of the major touring cities. “To be as profitable as possible means that you play in front of as many people on the one night as you possibly can – and that pushes you into the cities,” she says. “As a bigger artist, you will stick to the cities; but as a smaller artist, you are sticking to the clubs.” That means venturing off the beaten track – venue capacities may be smaller, but audiences are often hungrier and more appreciative.Calum Miller is owner of the 350-capacity PJ Molloys in Dunfermline. “Bands are finding it better to just do one large headline show than 10 Scottish shows,” he says. “Once a band gets to a [certain] level, they would rather do Barrowland [in Glasgow].” But this may be a short-sighted move when it comes to nurturing a fanbase: doing “nothing for six months before that in Scotland [is] putting all their eggs into one basket”.The brutal truth behind this is often economic, with associated costs such as crew, petrol and accommodation currently going through the roof. Confining tours to the biggest cities theoretically seems the less risky option, but could be a false economy. “Booking agents have responded to that cost pressure by reducing the length of tours – in some ways in quite a nonsensical way,” argues Beverley Whitrick, COO of MVT. “Accommodation in major cities is more expensive than in smaller towns and cities.”Some agents and promoters have been accused of targeting short-term gain over the kind of long-term development that acts can gain from honing their craft in smaller venues. “It’s profit that’s prized above the cultural experience,” Pollock says with a sigh. Agents, who negotiate fees for their acts from promoters who often front most of the risk to put on the shows, “are pretty guilty of just chasing the moneyevery single time”.MVT says that 25 grassroots venues closed last year and 200 were at serious risk of closure. New venues are opening, but it takes time to become established, while others need to reclaim lost ground. Gareth Barber took over the running of Esquires in Bedford a decade ago when it had, he says, “fallen off the map slightly” and wasn’t seen as a main touring venue. He has rebuilt its standing to draw in more tours, including a pre-Glastonbury CMAT and upcoming dates from Ibibio Sound Machine and former Kraftwerk member Wolfgang Flür.“I don’t think that touring provincially is particularly risky,” he argues. “The audiences actually want it that little bit more.” Catering to under-served audiences can be good long-term business. Both Ed Sheeran and Sam Fender, in their early touring days, played small clubs and beach bars in Cornwall, for example, and built up enviable fan loyalty there. Plus, Barber says, “we hear from tour managers that merchandise sales on the shows here are much higher than they are in some of the cities.”View image in fullscreenWorth squeezing in … Squid performing live at the Cornish Bank in Falmouth.Photograph: Brian Robinson/The ObserverWill Greenham is bookings manager at the 260-capacity Cornish Bank in Falmouth. He says the team opened the venue four years ago, in part as a way of getting promoters and agents to take their acts further west than Bristol (almost 200 miles away). “Some agents just don’t bother answering the email,” he says of the regular frustrations and challenges of getting acts to play there. “If they came, we would sell out and the venue would do even better. If they come to somewhere like Falmouth, they will get the most real experience. You’re so far from London. People down here will give you the best night.”The venue also has flats “with amazing sea views” for touring acts to use: Squid are among the acts to have done residencies there. “They were Airbnbs before we took the building on, so we quickly demolished that with loud music!” Greenham laughs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Sybil Bell, founder and chief executive of Independent Venue Week, says small venues around the country are going through a quiet revolution to make things better for touring acts. “They really take care of the artists,” she says. “There are so many cases [in the past with venues] where people [running them] just become a bit complacent. It would be a damp, shitty, horrible dressing room. People have really upped their game.” She cites Mal Campbell, who runs the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge, as an example of a venue owner going the extra mile for acts, helping them load in and ensuring they are properly fed and looked after.View image in fullscreenRichard Hawley at the Trades Club, Hebden Bridge, in 2017.Photograph: Visionhaus/Corbis/Getty ImagesMVT is lobbying to have £1 from each ticket for UK arena and stadium shows go to support small venues, but involvement so far, from acts like Enter Shikari and Sam Fender, has been voluntary. Whitrick says one of MVT’s plans for the money is to keep helping venues (many of them regional) renovate to become materially better for touring acts. “If money is invested in grassroots music venues to put in a self-contained flat, that would help touring artists,” she says. “So much money goes on hotels, buyouts [of meals] and all the other costs. An initial investment could have a massive impact on so many artists in the longer term, enabling more touring because you’ve immediately taken down some of those cost lines.”Independent promoters in the regions are diligently working to extend the touring circuit, but it also requires the backing of the bigger names in the live industry. “It’s just about agents being more open to putting in more shows,” says .Notably, a variety of acts are putting in the hard yards regionally. Richard Hawley’s latest tour has stops in Weston-Super-Mare, Margate and Worthing. Snapped Ankles will perform in Saint Leonards, Bradninch and Gloucester. The Unthanks will visit Kingston, Worcester and Colne.One supposed “risk” of this strategy is ticket cannibalisation: some in the live business fear that playing two nearby towns might see the larger venue pull ticket sales away from the smaller venue, not believing the two can coexist.Miller insists this is a damaging myth that needs to be dispelled. “Would you rather play one night in Glasgow to 600 people or play to 500 people in Glasgow and 250 people the next night in Dunfermline?” he asks. “There’s a whole fanbase in Dunfermline that are not travelling to your Glasgow show.” Just ask the Beatles or Sheeran: it’s a leap of faith worth taking.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Belgian art historian and Rubens expert was visiting Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches museum for a conference in 1993 and had asked to see a van Dyck in the archives. On her way out she caught a glimpse of a vast, 2.7-metre by 3.5-metre oil painting of a wild and drunken parade writhing with naked bodies young and old.“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Van der Stighelen recalled. “I really know my way around Flemish paintings from the 17th century, but when I saw this picture I could not match it with anything I knew.” The archivist informed her of an intriguing fact: it was believed to be the work of a woman.Three decades later, The Triumph of Bacchus is no longer hidden away in the Kunsthistorisches’ archives but has been given top billing as the centrepiece of a new show – and its creator is no longer nameless. Opening on 30 September, the exhibition Michaelina Wautier, Painter for the first time gathers into one show all known works by an artist who is belatedly coming to be recognised as one of the old masters of her age.View image in fullscreenSelf-portrait, Michaelina Wautier, 1649.Photograph: Museum of Fine Arts, BostonIt includes monumental history paintings, portraits and still lives as well as allegorical treatments such as The Five Senses, a series of five paintings showing boys experiencing sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. The latter, assigned to Wautier only after a first retrospective in Antwerp in 2018, will be on display in Europe for the first time since Wautier’s rediscovery. Two studies – of a saint and a boy with a white cravat – will be shown for the first time carrying her name.“For female baroque artists to work on this scale and with this variety of subjects is completely unseen,” Van der Stighelen said. “You had excellent women artists at the time painting flowers or still lives, but in general they were much smaller than those produced by men, largely due to the fact that they didn’t have their own workshops. Wautier is a complete exception to the rule.”View image in fullscreenThe Five Senses: Taste, Michaelina Wautier, 1650.Photograph: Museum of Fine Arts, BostonLittle is known of Wautier’s biography beyond the fact that she was born in Mons in 1604, now the capital of Hainaut province in Belgium’s Walloon region, and that she had a brother five years her senior, Charles, who worked as a professional artist and was posthumously presumed to be the author of some of her paintings.Jonathan Fine, director general of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, said: “We know practically nothing about her from historical documents. Most of what we know, we know from her paintings.”Of the 35 works that are attributed to her, around half are dated and signed “Michaelina Wautier”, but the spelling of her name in inventories varies, including “Michelle”, “Wouteers” and “Votier”. A large number of these works ended up in the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, one of the great art patrons of his age, pointing to the Wautiers having some links to aristocratic circles.View image in fullscreenTwo Girls as Saint Agnes and Saint Dorothea, Michaelina Wautier, 1655.Photograph: Rik Klein Gotink/Kunsthistorisches MuseumWhile women at the time were not allowed to study at academies, the dexterity with which she wielded a brush makes it unimaginable that Wautier did not receive some formal training, possibly from her brother, experts say.The very existence of The Triumph of Bacchus also suggests that Michaelina was able to use Charles’s studio, and to study naked male models in the flesh there.“When you look at Wautier’s paintings, it’s immediately evident that she knew what the body was,” said von der Stighelen. “When you look at the variety of ages, skin colours and hair textures in the Bacchus painting, it’s impossible that she worked purely off plaster copies. She must have had the opportunity to draw and paint from life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others such as Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1653) have in recent years been reassigned a seat at the old master table for their contributions to baroque art. But The Triumph of Bacchus makes Wautier the first known female artist to have drawn the naked male body on a lifesize scale.Fine said mastery of technique was not the only attribute that merited the Vienna retrospective. Many of Wautier’s paintings express a bittersweet, melancholy, quintessentially modern sensibility.Her series portrays the five senses as providing pleasure and pain. There is beautiful music and fine food, but “Smell” has a boy pinching his nose while holding a rotten egg, and “Touch” shows its juvenile subject scratching his head after cutting his finger with a whittling knife.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Martino Martini, Michaelina Wautier, 1664.Photograph: Courtesy of The Klesch CollectionThe Triumph of Bacchus, too, is not triumphant in a straightforward way. In the far-right corner of the painting, starkly illuminated and accentuated by a brightly coloured half-toga, Wautier has painted herself as one of the revellers.Unlike those around her, she is not joyous: a man to her left appears to be grabbing her head in the same manner that the cherubim to her feet manhandle a goat. Yet the expression on her face is not one of intimidation but of confidence.“How she has painted herself into the picture is a sign of self-assertion”, Fine said. “She is being grabbed by the man next to her. But she resists and breaks away from him and the drunken revelry to look out of the picture plane.”Explore more on these topicsArtPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

Ringed by the Flat Horizon takes its title from TS Eliot’sThe Waste Landand its inspiration from a dramatic photograph of a thunderstorm lowering over the New Mexico desert. At 19 coruscating minutes, it’s surprisingly verbose for the famously terse Benjamin, but with Gardner’s meticulous blend of vitality and precision the sense of youthful inspiration rarely faltered.Clangorous chimes, acidic dissonances and an ominous rumble bookended elemental episodes featuring shrieking piccolos, the blare of muted brass and cymbals that flashed like lightning. It was the eerie silences and insistent cello solos, however, that lingered longest.Yefim Bronfman was the soloist in a textbook reading of Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto. The Israeli American pianist delivered an old-school performance in the very best sense, his secure muscularity assuring the audience that they were in the safest of hands. Gardner and the orchestra responded with a weighty yet elegantly sprung accompaniment, their mutual attentiveness creating a keen sense of dialogue. Bronfman was at his finest and firmest in the wide-ranging opening Allegro before showing off his poetic side in a generous encore: a spellbinding account of Schumann’s Op 18 Arabesque.The concert concluded with an edge-of-the-seat interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s Fifth Symphony. If the introductory march felt on the swift side, Gardner quickly justified his choices urging his forces on with elastic phrasing, white-hot dynamics and unfailingly convincing transitions. The protracted opening of the Andante cantabile was almost unbearably sad, with horn and clarinet solos conjuring a mood of bittersweet romance.Syncopated woodwind and skittering strings brought a bracing tang to the insouciant waltz before Gardner plunged resolutely into the finale. Ripping into the development section with a devil-may-care swagger, he gradually let the sunshine in, crafting the music’s major-key metamorphosis in a turbocharged celebration of victory over darkness.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Philharmonic OrchestraEdward GardnerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Calmness, softness of touch and introspection are among the Icelandic pianist’s widely admired trademarks. It helps make him a perfect performer for the AirPod age.But how does Ólafsson respond to a full orchestra in a large-scale work such as Beethoven’s third piano concerto? The answer, in this opening concert of thePhilharmonia’s season, is that he does it with enviable ease. It assured a distinguished start to the 80th birthday year of an orchestra whose founder, Walter Legge, had shamefully tried to kill it off when it had not even reached two decades old.Looking at times as if he might happily conduct the whole thing from the piano, Ólafsson’s characteristically clear playing went from imposing and lyrical in the grandly constructed opening movement, through rapt and contemplative in the largo, which he began in the 18th-century manner with a tiny decorative flourish of his own, to brilliant and witty in the rondo finale. If it felt in retrospect like a performance of three separate mood pieces rather than something more fully bound together, it was a sparkling rendition all the same.View image in fullscreenDelicately scored … Gabriela Ortiz, centre, takes the applause beside Santtu-Matias Rouvali for her new composition.Photograph: Mark AllanBefore the concerto, Santtu-Matias Rouvali conducted the UK premiere ofGabriela Ortiz’s Si el Oxígeno Fuera Verde, which the orchestra had premiered in Amsterdam the previous day. Described by the composer as a fragile green murmur of life, the environmentally inspired work is delicately scored as a bubbling forest of gentle arpeggios and trills, which eventually coheres into an insistent dance with echoes of John Adams and the Stravinsky of The Rite of Spring.Alongside Ólafsson, who stayed to listen to the second half of the concert, the evening’s star attraction was the Royal Festival Hall organ being played at full throttle. With Notre Dame cathedral’sOlivier Latryat the organ controls, and Rouvali neatly alive to the work’s overall architecture and colours, Saint-Saëns’s third symphony is a guaranteed crowd pleaser for a special occasion – and so it proved.Broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 29 September and then available on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe Philharmonia OrchestraVíkingur ÓlafssonSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

After the turbulence and uncertainty of recent years, English National Opera opened its first seasonsplit between the London Coliseum and its new home in Manchesterwith an energetic display of institutional confidence. Not to mention a clear commitment to all things fun.Like other variants, Rossini’s take on the Cinderella story – usually known as La Cenerentola– is a rags-to-riches tale featuring a downtrodden heroine, her dreadful stepsisters and their equally awful father Don Magnifico. Plus a prince, his valet and a fairy godmother character that Rossini and his librettist transformed into a male philosopher, Alidoro.Julia Burbach’s colourful, contemporary-ish stagingplays wittily with the story’s familiarity. A small team of uniformed mice equipped with clipboards, iPads and walkie talkies help Alidoro to keep the plot on track. Various shoes are handed around (although the operatic prince’s chosen form of bridal ID is a bracelet). And, instead of a pumpkin carriage, the stage is dominated throughout by a large metal-doored lift, which delivers the transformed Cinders to the party at the crucial moment.View image in fullscreenDeliciously horrid … Isabelle Peters, left, and Grace Durham as the stepsisters, with Simon Bailey’s Don Magnifico.Photograph: Mark DouetUnlike most versions of Cinderella, though, Rossini’s is adorned with lashings of virtuosic ornamentation: even the vocal lines sparkle. Making her ENO debut in the title role, Deepa Johnny seemed to breathe coloratura, producing cascades of notes with her light, luminous mezzo as if nothing could be easier. But such music is ferociously difficult. Although Isabelle Peters and Grace Durham were a deliciously horrid double-act as the stepsisters and David Ireland was a warm, likable Alidoro, both Aaron Godfrey-Mayes and Charles Rice sounded overstretched as the prince (Don Ramiro) and his valet. The former made an impact only in his highest register, while the latter struggled to keep pace with the orchestra in his patter songs. Simon Bailey’s Don Magnifico was all bluster, his own approximate ornamentation dramatically fitting.You shall go to the ball! Behind the scenes at ENO’s La CenerentolaRead moreMaking her ENO debut, conductor Yi-Chen Lin drove the pace throughout, the orchestra whirling along as a handful of dancers created near-constant movement on stage. Yet energy alone can’t carry Rossini’s score. More finesse and flexibility were needed, as well as neater coordination with the singers, who periodically parted ways with the pit as they laboured through the word-heavy English translation.But then there were the men of the ENO Chorus. Dressed as the prince’s ancestral portraits – a mix of vintage sportsmen, military bigwigs and historical queens complete with wigs and bustles – they enlivened every scene they were in, their physical comedy pitch-perfect, their singing world-class. As ENO continues its own rags-to-riches bid, the chorus is undoubtedly the jewel in its crown.Explore more on these topicsOperaEnglish National Opera (ENO)Classical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

She asks the audience to look across the traverse stage and lock eyes with a stranger. We do as she asks, smiling. “Would you fuck them?” she says, and scouts our averted gazes for an answer, pressing us for a response. Is she joking? Catching us out? Bullying us?What seems like a cuddly warm-up exercise gathers uncomfortable psychological undercurrents. “You understand I’m not asking you anything you haven’t thought about before?”That opening exudesMamet-esque vibes, as does the setting for the drama itself – the basement of a debt collection agency which might turn into a latter-dayGlengarry Glen Rossas two best mates competitively josh and confide to other about their ambitions, insecurities, love lives.But it takes an unexpected swing: this firm is owned by Nicole (Allison McKenzie), the ball-breaking businesswoman of the beginning, who has employed her son, Darwin (Ashley Margolis), who comes to work in sliders and shorts, while Richie (Nathan Clarke) bursts with plans to make it big in Silicon Valley one fine day. It becomes clear that he is also living with obsessive-compulsive disorder, having to fulfil urgent rituals and juggling dark fantasies with positive imaginings, all enacted on stage. Nicole doubles up as his inner voice, variously wheedling, seductive and scary.Will Lord’s arresting play does not pull away from high-wire theatricality: the inner voice swaggers on to cajole Richie or lies prone on a filing cabinet, on Janet Bird’s stage, waiting to sabotage him. Characters pop out of wardrobes while murderous fantasy and quotidian reality is seamlessly entwined.But its intention to do two things at once leaves it weaker and sometimes opaque. Alongside its portrayal ofOCDare ruminations on and critiques of the personal development and self-help industries, so it seems. Much of the latter aspect comes through Richie’s inner voice, which conflates his capitalist ambition with self-realisation and manifestation.View image in fullscreenJoshing behaviour … Ashley Margolis and Nathan Clarke.Photograph: Rich LakosMcKenzie, as this voice, sounds variously like a hippie, an ambassador for neurolinguistic programming (“Could you speak your happiness into future existence?”), and a Thatcher-era thug.

Writers remember his greatnessIan McMillan,Michael Billingtonand Edith HallSun 28 Sep 2025 09.50 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 09.51 EDTShareIan McMillan: ‘Tony Harrison gave me linguistic strength’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverPoet, playwright and broadcasterAs a young man in the 1980s I made my living going round libraries and community centres in South Yorkshire running poetry workshops for theWorkers’ Educational Association; at each workshop lots of older people turned up clutching their folders of verse and the poems usually rhymed and they were often in Yorkshire dialect.To my eternal shame I asked these people to take out the rhymes, to have a go at writing something that was “modern” and “contemporary”, and I jokingly threatened to chuck them out of the class if they brought another piece in dialect because I stupidly believed thatYorkshiredialect could only handle comic ideas, and that if it tried seriousness and gravitas it would just drown in a sea of Yorkshire pudding batter.And then I encountered the work ofTony Harrisonand my poetic life changed for the better. Here was a poet from not too far away from me; he was Leeds, I was Barnsley. In my mind, I had believed that places like ours were far from the literary centre of things and here was proof that that wasn’t the case. Here was a poet who used rhyme with skill and love. Here was a poet who used dialect to great effect, using it to deepen and strengthen the language rather than just standing at the side of it dealing out wisecracks in a flat cap and muffler.I read the poems from his School of Eloquence series of sonnets and was moved to tears by poems like Them and Uz with its battle cry of “and used mynameand my own voice: (uz) (uz) (uz) / ended sentences with by, with, from, / and spoke the language that I spoke at home” and its revelation to me that “All poetry (even Cockney Keats?) you see / ’s been dubbed by (az) into RP, / Received Pronunciation please believe (az) / your speech is in the hands of the Receivers.” Not any more! As he writes in the same poem: “So right, yer buggers, then. We’ll occupy / yer lousy leasehold poetry.” Harrison spoke to me directly as a grammar school lad who wanted to be a poet but was unsure about what his subject might be or what language he would use to write it in, or indeed, (and this seems preposterous now) whether someone could be a poetround here, wherever Round Here happened to be. He taught me that the way Ispeykis a fit and proper vehicle for poetry.The first time I presented a show on BBC Radio Sheffield someone came up to me in Barnsley bus station and said: “I heard thi. Tha can’t talk like that on’t wireless!” and I said: “But I were talking like thee,” and he said: “Ar. But tha can’t talk like that on’t wireless.” Which is more or less what a critic said when I had a series a few years later on Radio 4: “Ian McMillan, with his Eeee By Gum Ecky Thump, clogging up the airwaves like bindweed on an allotment.” Tony Harrison gave me the linguistic strength to reply to those accusations, and I’ll always be grateful for that.Mind you, once I’d discovered him I took some of his poems to a writing workshop in Rawmarsh near Rotherham and the class weren’t impressed. “He’s fromLeeds,” one of them said, putting his betting shop pen in his pocket. “They know nowt.”Edith Hall: ‘We have lost a towering wordsmith’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyClassics professor at Durham University and author of Tony Harrison: Poet of Radical ClassicismTony Harrison, my fierce, eloquent, sardonic, loyal friend of 35 years, who died last Friday, produced over his 88 years an abundance of plays and translations; it is scandalous that his pioneering film poems, especially Gaze of the Gorgon, The Shadow of Hiroshima and Prometheus, first broadcast on Channel 4, are not publicly available. He is most familiar as the author of poems about his working-class Leeds youth. Studying classics as a scholarship boy at Leeds Grammar School and Leeds University, he was hurt by the chasm that his widening intellectual horizons had exposed between him, his mother and his father, a taciturn baker. The pain is explored in his pivotal 1978 collection From the School of Eloquence.Hismost famous poem is V, written during the 1984-85 miners’ strike and representing the uncouth speech of an alienated skinhead; the 1987 televised version, directed by Richard Eyre, caused outrage. A Conservative MP tried to have the broadcast proscribed by tabling an early day motion entitled “Television Obscenity”. But the right’s real objection was to Harrison’s resolute support of the working class.His breakout 1970 collection The Loiners (residents of Leeds) won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial prize but offended many because it frankly discussed sexual relations with several women, and implied that political oppression was similar whether in England or behind the Iron Curtain.In 1981, when Peter Hall used Harrison’s extraordinary translation of Aeschylus’s Oresteia in a path-breaking production at the National Theatre designed by Harrison’s theatrical museJocelyn Herbert, they insisted on an all-male cast, as in the ancient theatre. Harrison believed this was the only way to apprehend the trilogy’s misogyny. Feminists complained that female actors had been deprived, as they saw it, of an opportunity. Supercilious critics deemed men wearing female costumes inappropriate to “high art”; they lambasted Harrison’s diction, designed to be delivered in a consonantal working-class Yorkshire accent by actors including his longtime collaborator,Barrie Rutter. As usual, unease with Harrison’s class politics masqueraded as aesthetic derision.Harrison’s profoundly class-conscious Trackers of Oxyrhynchus premiered in Delphi in 1988, featuring Rutter, Jack Shepherd and Juliet Stevenson. It incorporated fragments of a Sophoclean satyr drama — a genre requiring patricians to revel in asubversive musical-comedywith satyrs wearing semi-erect phalluses.View image in fullscreenThe Trackers of Oxyrhynchus revived at The Finborough Theatre in 2017.Trackersimpressed Alan Rusbridger, then features editor of the Guardian, who in 1991 invited Harrison to write about the Gulf war. Harrison responded with two celebrated poems, Initial Illumination and A Cold Coming. Harrison’s association with the newspaper continued, with gaps, for more than a decade. In September 1995, he witnessed the Bosnian war in person. He came under fire in an armoured vehicle, and the newspaper published his searing The Cycles of Donji Vakuf.It was at the time of Trackersthat I first met Tony, although I had seen the televised version of V and the Oresteiaand revered him. He was smaller than I expected, and quieter, but his electrifying presence changed the atmosphere in every room he entered. We clicked straightaway; I had recently finished my Oxford doctorate on what would now be called racist ideas in Greek tragedy, and felt alienated from the Oxford academic establishment. I had worked as a volunteer for the NUM during the miners’ strike and had become an ardent socialist. He could be trenchant, even rude to people who irritated him, but he always treated me the utmost respect, I think because we shared a dark and mordant sense of the absurd and a loathing for religious hypocrisy and the monarchy.We often met after that, always quaffing large quantities of good white wine, and eventually I edited his prose essays for publication and helped him research his brilliant radio play Iphigenia in Crimea. We went on an unforgettably riotous research trip to the ancient Greek sites in that peninsula, shortly before the Russian invasion, with his daughter Jane, his partner the actress Siân Thomas, and Black Sea archaeologist Professor David Braund. I later organised a conference and event at the British Academy for his 80th birthday, and was delighted by the queue of luminaries wanting to join in toasting him, including Andy Burnham, Lee Hall, Vanessa Redgrave and Melvyn Bragg.When Tony was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease a few years ago, he responded with grace, wit and courage, retiring completely from public life to be tenderly and selflessly nursed by his beloved Siân. She features in some of his most moving poems, especially the hilarious Fig on the Tyne and the valedictory Polygons. I visited as often as I could, and have the warmest memories of boozy lunches where we ranted at the corruption and egotism of those in power in the cosy kitchen and quiet garden of Tony’s modest Newcastle terraced house, with its bust of Milton greeting all who entered. He enjoyed even his last months, and could still recognise close friends as well as family. We have all lost a towering wordsmith, an inimitable poetic voice and a steadfast custodian of humane values, social justice and candour.Michael Billington: ‘His artistic manifesto should be required reading’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianTheatre critic and Guardian journalistPeter Hall once said of Tony Harrison: “We have a great poet back in the theatre.” What is impressive is that, in the late 20th century when prose was paramount, this learnedmetre-readerfrom Leeds should have proved so dramatically dominant. He did this through language that was robust, vigorous and direct and that always puts me in mind of a remark by Jean Cocteau that “theatrical poetry is not tenuous like gossamer but thick like the rigging of a ship and visible at a distance”.Harrison’s poetry had that high visibility but was also richly varied. Looking back over his work for the National Theatre I am struck by his capacity to encompass French comedy, Greek tragedy and medieval Mysteries with equal panache. He made a big impact in 1973 with his masterly version of The Misanthrope in a production whose dexterity – well, it was the work of John Dexter – I initially failed to grasp. But there was no doubting Harrison’s virtuosity in updating the text and matching the comic energy of Molière’s own verse. To take just one example, look at the way the heroine harpoons a friend’s fake rectitude: “She’d daub a fig leaf on a Rubens nude / But with a naked man she’s not a prude.”Harrison’s work on Phaedra Britannica and The Oresteia was no less impressive but it was in his version ofThe Mysteriesthat he showed an ability to match the earthy and the elevated that lies at the root of English drama. Realism and alliteration also achieved a perfect synthesis in a line like Judas’s self-justifying vaunt: “Bursar was I, balancing t’brethren’s budgeting book.” The Mysteries, among many other things, showed Harrison’s determination to heal the fracture between high and low culture.The great thing is that he was able to practise what he preached as proved by The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, first staged in Delphi in 1988 and two years later at the National. It showed two Oxford scholars discovering a lost Sophoclean satyr-play and then turning into its leading characters, Apollo and Silenus. My review was illustrated by a Nobby Clark photo showing three clog-dancing satyrs with prodigiously erect prosthetic phalluses: something that at the time caused a mixture of shock and delight. The published edition of the play came with a preface by Harrison that eloquently argued the case for a unified culture that ignored the divisions of class and category and that embraced the tragic and the comic, the mystic and the mundane. It was Harrison’s artistic manifesto and should still be required reading today.The Trackers marked yet another stage in Harrison’s multifarious career as he then increasingly directed his own work, made films for television and created live events in non-theatre spaces: one (Poetry or Bust) in a Yorkshire wool-combing shed, another (The Kaisers of Carnuntum) in a Roman stadium near Vienna, a third (The Labourers of Herakles) on an excavated site in Delphi. Harrison was always an explorer and pioneer pushing the boundaries of poetry in performance but I suspect he will be remembered theatrically for his ability to take classic texts and to prove that you could be erudite without being elitist and popular without being condescending. I got to know him a bit through having worked with Siân Thomas, his long-term partner and devoted helpmeet during his difficult final years of illness. My recollection is of a shrewd and kindly man who embodied, in his character, the unified sensibility that was always his aesthetic goal.Explore more on these topicsTony HarrisonPoetryTheatreLeedsYorkshirePolitical theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Certainly the most memorable; I used it myself as an epigram in my novel Bag of Bones.Daphne du Maurieralso wrote what may be the best first line in a tale of the uncanny and outre. Her classic story The Birds opens with this: “On December the third the wind changed overnight and it was winter.” Short, chilly and to the point. It could almost be a weather report.It works so well at the outset of the gripping tale that follows, in which every species of bird attacks humankind, because it’s flat, declarative and realistic. Du Maurier can gin up horror when she wants – seeThe Doll, The Blue Lenses and the shocking final two pages of Don’t Look Now – but knows that what’s wanted here to instil belief (and suspense) is a tone that’s closer to reportage than narration.Thefilm version of The Birds, overloaded with a love match between Hollywood pretty people (Rod Taylor as Mitch, Tippi Hedren as Melanie) to go with the bird attacks, bears almost no resemblance to Du Maurier’s story. The setting is California’s sunny Bodega Bay instead of cold and overcast Cornwall, England, and the number of characters has been expanded. The only real similarity between the story and the movie lies in their endings. In the film, Mitch and Melanie escape while thousands of roosting birds are resting between attacks. What happens later is up to the viewer to guess. The conclusion of the Du Maurier story is even more chilling in its flat narration. After smoking his last cigarette, Nat tries the wireless and finds it silent. “He threw the empty packet on the fire, and watched it burn.”What happens at the end? We don’t know. Du Maurier doesn’t care. This is the essence of her unsettling geniusThis final line is as quietly terrible, yet as matter-of-fact, as the one that opens the story. What happens to Nat, his wife and his children? We don’t know. Du Maurier doesn’t care, and she’s right not to care. What she gives us is that last cigarette, which carries its own freight of firing-squad symbolism, and the burning packet. She tells us, in effect, decide for yourself. This is the essence of her unsettling genius.I am impatient with the idea of “spoilers”, a term that’s come into vogue along with other unpleasant side-effects of the internet in general and social media in particular. I find “You spoiled it!” to be, typically, the cry of spoilt people. I’d argue you can rarely spoil a good story, because the joy is in the journey rather than the arrival. Du Maurier’s stories are a notable exception to that rule. To talk about any of them at length would destroy their effect. Suffice it to say that you are in the hands of a master storyteller. Adiabolicalone, at that.The line-by-line quality of Du Maurier’s writing is astonishing, given how prolific she was: 17 novels, six biographies, three plays and dozens of short stories. She is particularly good at quick-sketch characterisation. Midge, from The Apple Tree, is a masterpiece of passive-aggressive behaviour, a woman whose chief talent seems to be making her husband’s life miserable. Not in any big way – she’s not a thief, drug addict or adulterer – but in a series of small nips that draw trickles of blood. She may or may not be aware of what she’s doing. Either way, consciously or unconsciously, she is exerting control.View image in fullscreenDaphne du Maurier in the 1930s.Photograph: Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/AlamyThe narrator of The Apple Tree (unnamed, like so many of Du Maurier’s characters, including the second Mrs de Winter of Rebecca) is a gentleman who gives his wife the newspaper first. She returns it crumpled and folded and out of order. The birth of a child to mutual friends is noted by Midge with dismay, whether a boy or a girl; she sees the drawbacks to both sexes. Although the couple have a maid, Midge “would labour past him, stooping under the weight of the laden tray”.The sighing, martyred Midge passes away, but her widowed husband remains in her thrall, associating an ugly apple tree with “poor Midge”, and the smaller, more shapely apple tree in its shadow with a laughing, cheerful farm girl named May, who Midge’s husband once kissed (and who died in a motorbike accident). Du Maurier describes the “Midge-tree” this way: “The moon shone upon the withered branches, and they looked like skeleton’s arms raised in supplication. Frozen arms, stiff and numb with pain.”Poor Midge, indeed!Is the ugly apple tree, with its sour, mealy fruit, a kind of revenant, or does the narrator – a bit of a fussbudget, far from perfect himself – simply find it psychologically impossible to escape his dead wife’s influence? Du Maurier doesn’t say. She is deft enough to have it both ways, which is the case with many of her stories.A few, like Monte Verità, feature doomed romance; at least one (The Breakthrough) deals with telepathy, telekinesis and even envisions our current fixation with AI; the best of them inhabit a murky borderland between what may be supernatural or could be no more than overactive imaginations stressed into malignancy. In The Blue Lenses, following an eye operation, Marda West begins seeing people with the heads of animals that reflect the personalities of the people to whom those heads belong; the revelation that her husband has the head of a vulture is especially creepy. In The Pool, a young girl believes she sees a whole other plane of existence, guarded by a woman commanding a turnstile at the bottom of a scummy woodland pool.Even when things seem relatively innocuous, you sense the shadows gathering. This is a gift few writers haveI love Du Maurier’s stories. I love their clarity, I love their often grim view of human nature, I love her prodigious talent and narrative ability. There is a reason why collections of short stories are, as a rule, less popular than novels. With a novel, you settle in with a cast of characters for what may be a day or two (if you’re a fast reader, like my wife) or a week or more (if you’re a slow reader, like me). When it comes to short stories, the reader has to create a fictional world in his or her imagination, then disassemble it, move on to the next fictional world and build that one. That can be hard work. It’s not with these stories.Entering these worlds is a pleasure rather than an effort. Sometimes the buildup can be slow, but “there are violins”, as some critic or other said about Robert Bloch’sPsycho. (That is certainly true of Bernard Herrmann’s music for the film version, which is almost all violins.) Meaning that even when things seem relatively innocuous, you sense the shadows gathering. This is a gift few writers have.Some stories have a sexual tingle. The most overtly sexual isThe Doll, where a woman named Rebecca (thatRebecca? Who is to say it’s not?) fascinates another of Du Maurier’s unnamed narrators. Rebecca is frightening, with her “great wide fanatical eyes like a saint, the narrow mouth that hid [her] teeth, sharp and white as ivory, and [her] halo of savage hair, electric, dark, uncontrolled”. I am particularly taken with that halo of savage hair, which should not work (hair cannot be savage, any more than waves can be angry) but somehow does.Rebecca has a secret lover named Julio. The narrator describes Julio, who seems to be about 16, this way: “His face was the most evil thing I have ever seen. It was ashen pale in colour, and the mouth was a crimson gash, sensual and depraved. The nose was thin … the eyes were cruel, gleaming and narrow, and curiously still. They seemed to stare right through one – the eyes of a hawk.” Du Maurier doesn’t come right out and say that Rebecca is having a sexual relationship with Julio, but it’s strongly implied … and the narrator clearly believes it. What makes this particularly perverse is the fact that Julio is not human (at least probably not), but a mannequin.‘Trump is a horror story, isn’t he?’ Stephen King on villains, dark secrets and dreamsRead moreThere. I have given away, at least in this story, a secret that should have been Du Maurier’s to impart, but only because the title allows the reader to see it coming. Written in 1928, The Doll was for many years presumed lost. Because of the subject matter, Du Maurier, then just 21 years old, may have been persuaded to hold it back, lest it damage her reputation at a time when sexual matters were best left sub rosa. Although it had been published in 1937, in a book of previously rejected stories aptly titled The Editor Regrets, it was notrediscovered until 2011.I have said quite enough. It’s time for you to take Daphne du Maurier’s hand and let her lead you into the dark. Her talent is a bright light that will guide you. Her remarkable stories await. I envy your discoveries.

How did we all miss the bacteria taking over her body?I write about nature, but when Milly got sick with a mystery illness, it never occurred to me that a long-forgotten tick bite could be the causePatrick BarkhamSun 28 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareThere are many reasons to feel guilty. I’m a nature writer who preaches about the importance of wild childhoods, and my daughter has been made chronically ill by one trip to the countryside. I’m a journalist whose job it is to interrogate information and yet I didn’t demand better answers for her from NHS doctors. But the guilt is most painful when I remember a freezing wet day in October 2021.Milly’s U10s football club were playing the league’s top team. Milly, player of the year the previous season, a whirl of blond energy across the pitch, had lost her enthusiasm for the beautiful game. That morning, she really didn’t want to play: she was tearful and exhausted. There was nothing obviously wrong: no cough, sickness, temperature. Her twin, Esme, was playing but without Milly the team were a player short. I told Milly they needed her. Stoic, she staggered off but couldn’t step on to the pitch. Instead, she curled into a ball of misery and fatigue beside her coach. The rain fell. Her team lost 15-1.I cringe when I flick through the notebook where I recorded my daughters’ football matches (I was tragically keen). Below most results from the 21/22 season, I’ve written “Milly ill” or, worse, “Milly played ¼” or “Milly played ½”. All the time, cajoled or compelled to lead her “normal” life, Milly was getting sicker and sicker. We had no idea what was wrong. Every morning she looked terrible, dark circles beneath her eyes. She complained of perpetual tiredness, talked of being “disconcentrated” – she later learned to call this “brain fog” – and mentioned strange stabbing pains, mostly in her feet when she walked. Soon, she was too ill to go to school. Lockdown was over but it had become a permanent state for Milly, my wife, Lisa, and me.What we didn’t know then, and wouldn’t discover until this spring, was that Milly’s body was being invaded by an insidious bacterium,Borrelia burgdorferi, which hides in connective tissue, confounding immune systems, wreaking havoc. Milly hadLyme disease, which takes its name from Old Lyme, a coastal town in Connecticut. This bacterial infection is not contagious but is transmitted by a tick, a tiny, blood-sucking insect that hops on to human skin in the countryside, where it is transported by other mammals, particularly deer. There are 476,000, and rising, annual cases in North America alone. Global heating is making ticks, their bacteria – and human illnesses – much more prevalent.In North America, where there’s even a tick species carrying another bacteria thattriggers a bizarre allergy to meat, awareness is rising. Numerous American and Canadian celebrities have spoken out about their years-long struggle with Lyme, fromBella HadidandAvril LavignetoJustins BieberandTimberlake. But for many years it has been a disease mired in controversy, particularly when it comes to the idea of a long-term, treatment-resistant form of the disease. Most established medical thinking questions the existence of so-called “chronic Lyme disease”. The numbers of people diagnosed with Lyme disease tell their own story. The UK Health Security Agency logged1,581 confirmed cases of Lymein 2024. But according toJack Lambert, consultant in infectious diseases at the Mater hospital in Ireland, France records 70,000 cases a year. “In both the UK and France, 5-10% of ticks are found to carry borrelia. So ticks only like to bite French people?” Lambert says. “Or maybe the UK is under-reporting. Ticks are all over the place. We have all these people with mystery illnesses – summer flu, migratory arthritis, funny neurological problems. And for GPs, neurologists, rheumatologists and infectious disease experts asking why, Lyme disease is at the bottom of the list.”How did we and everyone else miss the bacteria silently taking over Milly’s body? Back in 2021, Lisa took her to the GP. It was a relief when blood tests ruled out various life-threatening possibilities – it wasn’t cancer, thank goodness. On account of the stabbing pains, we had an appointment with a neurologist, who was unhelpful and never considered Lyme. Our requests for a second opinion from a general paediatrician were rejected.Nine-year-old Milly was not only a footballer; she also adored dance and swimming, and loved school. We still joke she is one of those annoying people who excels at whatever they do (she doesn’t get that from me). Her uncle nicknamed her “Mensa Milly” because she was laser-quick at maths and English. She was also dreamy and creative, sociable, angelically kind and possessed of a very silly sense of humour and the most infectious giggle. We don’t hear that so much now.Milly was increasingly exhausted and attended school less and less. Lisa is a youth counsellor, which came in handy, and we both juggled jobs so someone could be at home with Milly. We tried to create a restful and positive environment. Milly had plenty of sleep and healthy, home-cooked food. She was not bedridden but rose with tousled hair after 11am each day. She filled her bedroom with fluffy blankets, a Jellycat Snow Dragon and plants. Our dog, Betty, was another source of comfort, licking her hands daily, as if she needed healing. She read, listened to audiobooks and watched telly. When Esme and her younger brother Ted returned from school, Milly would play Minecraft with them.We needed a formal diagnosis – for Milly and for ourselves, but also to explain her increasing absence from school. The headteacher was understanding. We were lucky that healthy Esme attended primary school every day, so we weren’t suspected of being one ofthosefamilies blamed for fostering school avoidance.View image in fullscreenMilly with parents Patrick and Lisa, sister Esme and brother Ted.Photograph: Ali Smith/The GuardianNot everyone was so understanding. I don’t blame them. We didn’t understand Milly’s illness either. As time went on, she became more and more withdrawn. What was wrong with her? Was she just anxious? Was it all in her head? Could we encourage her to get up and go out? We clung to our reality: Milly was a vibrant, energetic girl who loved life and got sick.Eventually, the NHS diagnosis came through: ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome). This was frustrating. Milly had become unwell just after a global pandemic. Occam’s razor – the principle that the simplest explanation is probably the correct one – suggested she had long Covid. We believed she caught the virus in the summer of 2021, but was undiagnosed. Shortly after, we were refused an antibody test, then Milly definitely got Covid with the rest of her family in early 2022.We consoled ourselves that there seemed no great advantage in being attached to a long Covid clinic. The NHS help for both long Covid and ME/CFS, in our region at least, is minimal. There is no cure and no monitoring. The expert assigned to Milly moved jobs; we have not been offered an appointment with the specialist clinic since February 2024. We were given the usual advice about pacing – gradually increasing exercise – which is challenged by some ME patient groups.As a diagnosis without a treatment pathway, ME/CFS is a dangerous predicament. The syndrome is clearly an umbrella term for different illnesses that are poorly understood by modern medicine. We met people who had recovered thanks to talking cures. One told me his ME disappeared when he took a course of psychological treatment in his 20s and understood what he had to gain from being “tired” all the time: respite from being under pressure and daunted by the world. What did Milly have to gain from being tired, we wondered? Why would a nine-year-old decide to be ill? Were we, without meaning to, putting her under too much pressure?We tried to remain open-minded. We tried a type of talking cure called the MindBody Reconnect which had revitalised a friend. Milly didn’t enjoy the expensive online sessions but doggedly stuck with it. I’m sure it works for some sick people. For Milly, it was a disaster. She became convinced she was responsible for her illness because she could not think herself well. More guilt for us. Lisa sourced alternative treatments: gut biome studies and nutritionists, mushroom tinctures, reiki, biodynamic massage, healers and even a psychic, who dispatched 17 spirits who were apparently haunting our house. None of it cured Milly, although we continued the massage because that gave her a weekly lift.During her final year at primary school, the most Milly could manage was half a late morning. We would walk her there, hoping the gentle exercise would help. She’d shuffle along, hidden in her coat. When she moved up to high school, we and the super-nice Send staff devised a part-time schedule. Milly managed a week. We had to stop school. Lacking easy social connections, Milly felt too anxious or tired to sustain her friendships.“How’s Milly?” people would ask. Same-same, we’d reply. Actually, she was slowly becoming more fatigued and more withdrawn. “So you home-educate her?” Not exactly, we’d reply. She was too exhausted most of the time. On the two days I was off work, I planned little educational trips – to theCastle Museum in Norwichor to the coast to see erosion in action – but she was too ill. Even minuscule walks were too much. She just about managed an hour of weekly maths with a teacher friend.By autumn 2024, Milly had spent more than a quarter of her life sick, and a year completely out of school. She developed a keen interest in Japanese food and cooked, a lot, at home. She attended a Dungeons & Dragons group every fortnight and loved its deep fantasy worlds. She was still empathic, sensitive and, on occasions, unexpectedly physically strong.As she turned 13, it was Milly who took the decisive step to discover what was really wrong with her. After hearing about Miranda Hart’s health struggles, she bought her audiobook. InI Haven’t Been Entirely Honest With You, the comedian writes of her 30-year battle with debilitating fatigue and disbelieving doctors, with the eventual revelation that she was suffering from Lyme disease. Unusually, Milly asked me and Lisa to read Hart’s book. She really identified with her.“Did we get Milly tested for Lyme?” I asked Lisa. It had crossed our minds before. Lisa checked the GP’s blood tests and found everything was looked at in the early stages. Milly was negative: she had no Lyme antibodies.What we didn’t know then was that there are so many medical shibboleths around Lyme. These, the few real experts in the disease believe, are almost certainly causing thousands of cases to be missed in Britain alone. We only knew what most people understand about Lyme: if you’re bitten by a tick, look out for a bull’s-eye rash (it can also be solid red). If you find one, take an antibiotic called doxycycline and you will be cured.This is all true for many people but, unfortunately, this disease is much more complex. You may not be aware you’ve been bitten by a tick. Asurvey by the Lyme Resource Centrefound that 41% of people diagnosed with Lyme disease could not recall receiving a tick bite at all. This is not carelessness: even a tick’s grain-of-sand-sized aphids can transmit the disease. Once you’re bitten, you may not develop a rash at all. If you’re treated with antibiotics, you may not get better. And if you have an NHS blood test,known as Elisa, it gives false negativesabout 50% of the time. It looks for antibodies – but Lyme bacteria hides, and can fool the body into not producing them. This is what happened to Milly.Around the time we read Hart’s story, Lisa heard on aLong Covid Kidscharity discussion group about a private doctor having good results with some patients. After waiting probably far too long, we paid for a second opinion from him. In December we attended a London clinic that felt more like a spa. Dr Ben Sinclair is a personable former prison doctor in his 40s. He caught long Covid and successfully treated himself; later he discovered he also had Lyme disease. Since April 2024, he and his small team have held consultations with 2,500 patients who present with symptoms of long Covid or Lyme or both. There may be a link: in many sufferers, Sinclair told us, Covid suppressed their immune system, allowing Lyme bacteria lurking at unproblematically low levels within the body to rapidly multiply (a study found that13.5% of people in western Europehave serological evidence of the bacteria in their bodies).View image in fullscreenMilly in 2021, on the day in the Lake District when she probably contracted Lyme.Photograph: Patrick BarkhamHe questioned us closely, in particular about a holiday we took to the Lake District in Whitsun 2021. I’d forgotten this but Lisa remembered Milly was bitten by a tick. It was not a dramatic experience. In 2020 I wrote a book calledWild Child, about the importance of nature in children’s lives. Our kids all attended forest school, where we learned to be tick-aware. We’d successfully removed ticks from Esme’s head and Ted’s skin, and monitored for the telltale rash that suggests infection.That holiday, Milly and her siblings played in the bracken. Then we found a tick on her neck. I extracted it cleanly, almost immediately. No rash developed. Photos show Milly glowing with health. There were no obvious symptoms afterwards, though Lisa remembers Milly feeling weary that summer. At the end of our consultation, Sinclair said he thought she had Lyme disease. I remember being surprised he was so confident.Rather than the Elisa test, Sinclair recommended a T-spot test, measuring the T-cell interferon response (a type of white blood cell) to bacterial antigens. It’s the gold standard for testing for tuberculosis, a bacteria that similarly creeps around the body, hiding in tissues and organs. The tests are not available on the NHS and we would have to dispatch bloods to a German lab. We stepped out of the consulting room in a daze and treated Milly to a quick look at the Jellycats of Selfridges before getting the train home. I felt like crying. Later, I did.It took two months to get the blood tests done, partly because Milly had developed a phobia of needles. The results were dramatic. Milly’s body showed a high level of borrelia activity, the bacteria the NHS blood test had missed. She had co-infections of babesia and bartonella, bacteria that are also believed to be spread by ticks and can cause severe illness. These were making her sicker. Her exhausted immune system couldn’t fight them off. Her borrelia infection was tracked with a baseline measurement: 430.50. Only later did Sinclair tell us it was one of the highest he had seen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I write about how beneficial nature is for children, in mind and body. In this instance, nature had made my daughter very sick. And why hadn’t I been more proactive in seeking answers? At least Lisa made it an unceasing quest. I can only say in my defence that I adapted to meet Milly’s needs. Together, Lisa and I had undertaken a big, loving job of care: giving Milly food, time, belief, comfort and, most of all, acceptance.It is harder to accept mainstream medicine’s denial of the disease. In Britain, the NHS and National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice) do not recognise “chronic Lyme disease” (though they do acknowledge some people treated for Lyme can experience lingering symptoms, which the NHS calls “post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome”). Many infectious disease experts don’t believe borrelia can survive blasting by doxycycline, which is usually – but not universally – effective.The NHS had failed Milly. Its misdiagnosis allowed her to struggle with a chronic illness for a quarter of her lifeProfessor Jack Lambert was treating patients in New York in the 1980s before there was a test to diagnose HIV and Aids. He contrasts the willingness then of doctors to try novel treatments for HIV with the apparent lack of interest in Lyme. These days, based in Dublin, he has several thousand Lyme patients on his books and sees five new sufferers each week. Many, he says, are the victims of years of “medical gaslighting” by doctors who refuse to take their symptoms seriously or consider Lyme. “The strange thing about Lyme disease is the medical community have spent all their time denying its existence and its complexity,” he says.Nevertheless, over the last decade Lyme has become better understood, particularly in North America. Monica Embers, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, has shown that borrelia can survive treatment with doxycycline, as part of more than two decades of research into the Lyme bacteria acrossdozens of peer-reviewed studies. “This assumption that doxycycline is the be-all, end-all antibiotic is flawed. We need to do better,” Embers says. “No single one antibiotic is going to do the trick for everyone.”Her researchbacks up what doctors are finding: that a combination of antibiotics can get on top of the disease.Another recent, albeit small, studyfound combined antibiotics effective at providing “complete remission” from severe neurological symptoms. Doctors report a 60-70% success rate after treating hundreds of patients with a combination of antibiotics. But in the UK, Nice’s guidance – from 2018, so not including recent advances in medical science – states: “The evidence available for treating ongoing symptoms did not show benefit from prolonged treatment with antibiotics.”‘We need hope, not platitudes’: what I’ve learned as the parent of an ill childRead more“What evidence does the NHS have that people are cured after three weeks of doxycycline?” Lambert says. “None. I treat people for infections all the time. If, after two weeks of antibiotics, they’re not better, I treat for longer. But with Lyme, you say, ‘Oh, it’s post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. We can’t give more antibiotics.’ Where’s the medical science there? It doesn’t make sense.”The medical establishment doesn’t recognise chronic Lyme disease, Embers says, because it is so tricky, with symptoms that can be autoimmune issues, inflammation or persistent infection. Lambert says doctors must treat all three, and while medical guidelines caution against using antibiotics over the long term, some doctors are willing to consider treatment for up to a year – if the patient is improving.Similarly, Sinclair says 60–70% of his patients make a good recovery with a combination of antibiotics. “I’ve never made the claim that I can cure people,” he says. “But what I try to do is restore function, reduce symptoms and get people into a balance where their immune system should do the work.”We’ll take those odds with Milly. But our quick-smart daughter has developed a profound scepticism about all treatments after experiencing the failure of NHS doctors and alternative remedies. It took weeks of careful discussion before she would try a combination of antibiotics. We didn’t yet tell her these antibiotics make some patients feel sicker. The Jarisch Herxheimer reaction – diarrhoea, extreme nausea, inflammation – is triggered when the body’s immune system responds to the toxins released as antibiotics start to kill borrelia. Some people can’t tolerate this treatment.In May she began Sinclair’s protocol of two antibiotics, alongside herbal supplements to support her gut health which would be compromised by the strong drugs. Those Nice guidelines mean none of this is available on the NHS. We returned to our GP with Milly’s blood test results and asked if the NHS could undertake ongoing monitoring of her heart and blood during her treatment. We were met with a firm no. The NHS had failed Milly. It had made a misdiagnosis, allowed a child to struggle with a chronic illness for a quarter of her life – and wouldn’t pick up the pieces now.Private treatment is beyond the reach of most people. We used cheaper herbal medicines provided via the not-for-profitClaid Clinicbut the initial T-spot blood tests cost £2,000. The first three months of treatment, including drugs, supplements, consultations and tests, cost an additional £3,884.50. We are incredibly fortunate to be able to meet these bills – just.View image in fullscreenMilly in July 2021, before she fell ill, with Esme and their football trophies.Photograph: Patrick BarkhamOver the summer, Milly continued to rise late, look pretty ghostly and feel extremely tired. But was she a tiny bit stronger? We took her to a music festival and she didn’t crash afterwards. Was it just the holidays, having sunshine and siblings around? In August we got her blood test results after three months of antibiotics. We were stunned. Her borrelia levels had dropped from 430.50 to 6. The treatment had obliterated the infection.Now we are filled with hope, and caution. The numbers still need to reduce to 0.5, says Sinclair, who has tweaked the antibiotic regimen. We continue with herbal medicines, too. School has started again, without Milly, and she remains seriously fatigued. “Sometimes the physical recovery comes later,” Sinclair says. “That’s the hard thing about this. You often reach this period where you go: ‘We’ve done everything, all the figures look good, but the person in front of me is not feeling it.’” Certain types of Milly’s natural killer cells, markers of her immune system health, are still much too low. Sinclair likes a military analogy: “Imagine a battlefield after a war. It takes six to 12 months to clear away the burnt-out tanks. It’ll probably take a while to get back to full function when you’ve removed the enemy.”What is the future for all those people who unknowingly have Lyme or who will contract it over the coming years? In the US, the Steven & Alex Cohen Foundation has invested more than$50m in Lyme research projectsover the last decade. Embers is encouraged that US government agencies are taking tick-borne disease much more seriously. She is developing an improved blood test called Lyme Seek which she hopes will reach the market next year. “Our sensitivity and specificity is over 90%,” she says.In Europe, Lambert is struck by the lack of EU or government funding for Lyme research. “It’s a disease waiting for compassionate physicians to acknowledge these patients’ condition, give them treatment and investigate better diagnostics, better treatment,” he says. “At present, the medical community is so against the whole idea that Lyme disease is complex. It deserves investment in scientific funding to better understand it.”And what’s the future for Milly? “Because I’ve tried loads of things, it’s hard to believe this will really work,” she says. “I’ve lost faith in medicine and practitioners. I’m not feeling much better either. It’s difficult to think of the future right now – where my life might lead.”The mental scars run deep. But we hope Milly will physically recover. If her immune system can be repaired and conquer the borrelia, she could live an active, “normal” life. We are not sure whether she will ever reintegrate into school. And yet I collect stories of how childhood sickness has been a font of creativity for the person who recovers in adulthood, and I hope.We have a diagnosis, we have treatment and we have hope. Most hopefully of all, occasionally, in early evening, Milly starts mucking about with her brother. I hear an explosion of infectious giggling. The Milly giggle. She’s still here. She’s still Milly. How lucky are we to have her in our lives.People can get free advice and support from charities includingLyme Disease UKand theLyme Resource Centre.Explore more on these topicsLyme diseaseMedical researchHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then something curious happened ...Grace DentSun 28 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 07.41 EDTShareOver a lunch atBrasserie Constancein Fulham, west London, eating my main course claypot chicken with barley while surrounded by smiling diners at other tables, I got a glimpse of how it must feel to beKim Jong-un. My journey to Fulham Pier had been odd enough, but now I was in my Great Dictator era.Actually, maybe I should wind back a little. Even finding Brasserie Constance had been a bit of an issue, not least because this new “neighbourhood restaurant” from the well-loved chefAdam Byattis not quite what’s advertised. Constance, the website says, is on the banks of the Thames, “where the river’s beauty is on full display”. It is a restaurant named in tribute to the mid-20th-century florist, potter and cookConstance Spry, a doyenne of domestic bliss who is the inspiration for this classy brasserie where coronation chicken paté en croute, potted duck with damson andDevon splitwith mead and greengages are on offer. So far, so dreamy.View image in fullscreen‘A showstopper’: Brasserie Constance’s crab vol-au-vent with coronation remoulade.I had not previously heard ofFulham pier, but this sounded like a joint designed to snare the long-lunch, deep-pocket River Cafe faithful with the likes of day-boat skate wing with lovage and baked alaska for afters. One thing Brasserie Constance certainly does not mention on its dreamy, quasi-pastoral website is that it is essentially a souped-up corporate box inside Craven Cottage, Fulham Football Club’s ground. In fact, your first clue to that fact will probably be when the taxi driver turfs you out by the ticket kiosk. Signage guiding you from there to Brasserie Constance itself, however, is non-existent. Nada, zilch – not even a timely Post-it note stuck to the ticket office door; even the Craven Cottage staff seemed not to have heard of the new restaurant’s existence.My lunch companion and I wandered around inside the club’s marketing suites, opening doors into corporate boxes and just looking for lunch. Eventually, we found an opulent, no-expense-spared room that looked for all the world like the private dining option on a luxury liner. Why not just say upfront that Brasserie Constance is a fancy restaurant designed for the prawn sandwich brigade whom Roy Keane onceso famously scoffed at?View image in fullscreenBrasserie Constance’s claypot chicken for two, with a herby, beery barley sauce.We sat at our table in a deserted restaurant. The warm, knowledgeable staff seemed rather shocked to see us – two actual midweek lunchtime guests. Soon, a flurry of management huddled in a corner, no doubt mumbling to each other that a critic was on the premises. We ordered a bowl of hot, crisp fried skate knobs with tartare sauce and a round of delightful corn and green chilli tarts. Both lovely. We demolished an outstanding Dorset crab vol-au-vent with curry remoulade, a showstopper of sweet, flaky pastry with beautifully dressed crab meat. We waited for a slice of that coronation chicken paté en croute, which was a tad dry by the time it arrived, because its sauce had all but evaporated into the cold, pastry-encased chicken. Brasserie Constance is everything you’d expect of an Adam Byatt restaurant: fine produce, meticulously deliberated over and, largely, cooked with serious aplomb.Then something odd happened. The table next to us filled up with a group of twentysomethings and, soon after, another table did likewise, then another, until there were five jam-packed tables around us, all merrily going through the motions of having lunch, although, curiously, none of them seemed to have been offered menus or had orders taken. In fact, on closer inspection, not much food was on those tables, either. It was almost as if they were miming having a meal.The claypot chicken, a sharer for two, was presented to us in its pot for inspection, then whisked away, carved, shredded and mixed with a herby barley sauce. A side of carrots in sunflower seeds had crunch and vigour, while a Russian salad was a joyous cacophony of new potatoes and green beans. We moved on to a hulking-great slice of delightful and moist treacle, date and walnut tart, complete with a generous jug of pouring cream, at which point the penny finally dropped.View image in fullscreenBrasserie Constance’s ‘hulking-great slice of delightful, moist and sating’ treacle, date and walnut tart with pouring cream.“They’re not having lunch!” I said, pointing at the next table. “They’re just pretending to for us!”“Oh my god, yes!” my guest replied. “They’re probably all from the marketing teams who work on this floor.”We stared at the fake customers, who studiously pretended not to see us. As we finished dessert and I paid the bill, each table emptied one by one, all seemingly chuntering “Rhubarb, rhubarb” as the extras – sorry, diners – wandered back to their offices after a fictitious lunch. “This is how Kim Jong-un must feel every time he leaves the house,” I said.Brasserie Constance is easily the weirdest restaurant experience I have had in spring/summer 2025.

Indeed, so good is it that, though the dish is native to the southern region of Casamance, it’s popular on menus as far afield as neighbouring Gambia. Ifpoulet yassais new to you, however, you have a real treat in store: a braised dish of chicken marinated in sweet onions, tangy citrus and warm chilli, it tastes, asLerato Umah-Shaylorputs it so beautifully, like “sunshine on a plate” – and certainly, as my parents observed when I introduced them to it, far more than the sum of its parts. Simple ingredients, complex flavours – and a guaranteed crowdpleaser.The meatAlexa Weibel, who adapted chefPierre Thiam’s recipefrom The Fonio Cookbook for the New York Times, says that though Thiam uses chicken legs, “in southern Senegal, where the dish originated, you might be served other chicken parts, fish yassa or even lamb yassa”.View image in fullscreenStart with a whole chicken, then joint it, advises food writer Jessica Harris. All thumbnail images by Felicity Cloake.Legs are the most popular cut, with Umah-Shaylor also suggesting thighs in her book Africana, though both Gabonese chef and food writerAnto Cocagneandfood historian and authorJessica B Harrisstart with whole birds, and joint them. I think the juiciness of legs makes them the superior choice, but go with whatever you prefer, leaving the skin on and the bones in, ideally – the skin will help keep the flesh moist and render fat into the sauce, while the bones provide flavour. (Note that, if you don’t eat meat, this sauce also works well with tofu or roast squash.)The marinadeThe common factor here is citrus juice, be that lemon or lime, though I prefer the richer, fruitier tang of the latter. Cocagne and Umah-Shaylor put in the zest as well, a nice idea that I’m going to save for the sauce, because I don’t think the flavour really transfers to the chicken while it’s marinating. Most recipes also add chopped or pureed onion (though Thiam and Dakar-bornKhadim Mbamba,the chef behind London’sLittle Baobab, both prefer the green spring onion variety). Other possible additions include thyme, bay and parsley, none of which my testers and I can really pick up in the meat – like the citrus zest, then, such aromatics are also better deployed later in the process, as are Mbamba and Cocagne’s ginger and mustard.The latter makes a Senegalese red pepper paste,nokoss, to go in the marinade, which as well as the ingredients already mentioned features chilli, red onion, tomato, celery andsoumbalapowder, which is made from the fermented seeds of the néré, or African locust bean tree. I suspect peppers and tomatoes in the UK are more watery and less intensely flavoured than those in Senegal, because my version turns out noticeably paler and more liquid than the one in the photograph, and sadly doesn’t add much flavour when deployed in such a small quantity.View image in fullscreenAnto Cocagne’s chicken yassa has ‘a marmalade-like flavour of lemon zest’.Mbamba’s green pepper version is far punchier, but I’ve elected to keep things very simple indeed and stick to salt, citrus and onion, and the same ingredients that flavour the sauce. Rather than adding all the onions to the marinade, as many recipes suggest, I’ve kept most of them back to speed up the browning process when it comes to making the sauce.The cookingWeibel explains that “the cooking method is flexible: the chicken develops the best smoky char when grilled, but will still be delicious seared in a grill pan or cast-iron skillet”. The consensus online seems to be that while yassa traditionally involves barbecued meat, these days home cooks are more likely to fry it indoors, though you could roast it, too, as Mbamba recommends, with similarly delicious results. Indeed, roasting or using a grill pan are both great options, as is Umah-Shaylor’s overhead grill, but I’ve chosen to fry them, as recommended by Cocagne’s book Saka Saka and Amethyst Ganaway’srecipe for Serious Eats, to render as much fat, and therefore flavour, as possible from the skins for use in the sauce. (My only caveat with roasting the meat is that it doesn’t leave the chicken quite as juicy as frying, grilling, or griddling to colour, before braising it with the sauce. Whichever method you choose, pour any fat or juice that’s escaped the chicken into the sauce when you add the meat to it.)The sauceOnions and citrus, with a backbone of chilli heat, are the building blocks here – pretty much everything else is an optional extra – so it’s essential to take the time to brown the onions properly, so they offer a caramelised contrast to the tangy juice. My testers and I also really like the sweetness Harris’ that carrots bring to proceeding (though you may prefer to use red pepper or Thiam’s green version, though they will, of course, be less sweet), as well as the saltiness of the olives that she and Mbamba both pop in.View image in fullscreenKhadim Mbamba pops olives into his sauce.Olives and dijon mustard, the probable legacy of three centuries of colonial occupation by France, are not obligatory, but the flavours do work really well. Orléans-based caterer Mamy Cocotoldfood blogger and author Bernard Laurance in 2014 that in her native Casamance, poulet yassa tends to be less citrussy and mustardy than the versions now found in places such as Dakar, concluding that it was thus “for you to judge the level of acidity that best pleases your tastebuds”. I’d echo this, while urging you not to be too shy; this recipe sings at full volume.We love the almost marmalade-like flavour that the lemon zest gives Cocagne’s dish, and the complementary warmth of thyme and ginger with the obligatory chilli. Which variety you use, and in what quantity, depends similarly on the pleasure capsaicin brings your tastebuds. I like the fruitiness of scotch bonnet, pricked so it gently infuses the sauce with its heat (and can be whipped out when it hits your specific sweet hotspot), but any red chilli will do, depending on availability and preference. If you’re not keen on chilli heat, use a milder variety and go big on black pepper instead – Thiam adds two whole teaspoons of the stuff to his version.If you’ve barbecued or roasted the chicken, you might want to dilute the sauce with chicken stock, as Umah-Shaylor and Ganaway recommend, but if you’ve fried it, it should be rich enough without. (That said, though none of the recipes I try calls for it, a dash ofMaggi seasoningis a common addition, so a pinch of MSG wouldn’t go amiss, if you feel so moved.)View image in fullscreenPierre Thiam adds all of two teaspoons of ground black pepper to his version.To eatRice is the most common serving suggestion, but couscous is mentioned by Ganaway,“creamy mashed potatoes and green beans”by Umah-Shaylorand fluffy, nuttyfonio,an ancient variety of millet that’s a staple in West Africa, by almost everyone else. Erica Turner tells readers of America’s Test Kitchen that “braised hibiscus leaves (widely eaten in Senegal) are a traditional accompaniment, but cooked spinach seasoned with lemon juice is a fine alternative”.Perfect chicken yassaThis can be made ahead of time, because it reheats very well indeed.Prep20 minMarinate4 hr+Cook55 minServes42 lemons, or 3 limesFine salt and black pepper4 skin-on and bone-in chicken legs4 medium onions2 tbsp groundnut oil, or other neutral oil2 carrots, thinly sliced at an angle, or 1 red pepper, thinly sliced1 tbsp grated fresh ginger1 tbsp thyme leaves, or 1 tsp dried thyme1 tbsp dijon mustard1 scotch bonnet, or other warm red chilli pepper80g green olivesFinely grate the zest of half the citrus fruit, set the zest aside, then juice all the fruit into a bowl and stir in a teaspoon of salt.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 28 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareGavin, 48Because I haven’t slept with anybody else for decades, my sexual skills don’t feel transferable; they are specific to LisaLisa and I met at university in 1996, when we were 19. Since I’ve known her, she’s grown from a willowy teenager into a middle-aged woman – and I’ve become a middle-aged man with a belly and a bad back. But a 30-year relationship isn’t about how you look. She’s the person I’ve latched my life on to. I still see shades of younger Lisa – in her eyes, her face, the sounds she makes when we have sex.Because I haven’t slept with anybody else for decades, my sexual skills don’t feel transferable; they are specific to Lisa. And although we don’t have loads of sex now, when we do – once or twice a month – it’s better quality and more meaningful than it was in our 20s.I snore, so we don’t sleep in the same bed, meaning sex has become less spontaneous. We have to schedule it, or Lisa might say: “Let’s turn the telly off and go to bed.” A look is often enough. Lisa has a double bed in the main bedroom, whereas I have a single bed in the attic, so we have sex in her bed. Or sometimes I’ll lead her to another room in the house, like the bathroom, and we’ll do it in the shower.I snore, so we don’t sleep in the same bed, meaning sex has become less spontaneous. We have to schedule itWe have three kids (aged six, 15 and 17) and while having them didn’t really affect our sex life, we try not to do it when they’re awake and we’ll stop when we hear them, pretending to be asleep if they walk in on us. Whenever we have the house to ourselves, we take advantage. But the last time we did this, a couple of weeks ago, the eldest came home, so we had to stop.For me, intimacy is reserving a space for someone, whether that’s a bedroom or an emotion, beyond the perimeter that you put up for the rest of the world, because you trust them. I see myself as part of a whole, a bigger picture. I haven’t lost sight of myself within that picture, but it’s not just me, it’s us.The thrill is different now – it’s less new and exciting and more of a familiar excitement. But the thrill still exists in the familiar. In the future, I want more of the same. We know what works, what doesn’t, and what the signals are. That familiarity is part and parcel of intimacy.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I have friends for whom sex isn’t an important part of their relationship, but it has always been important to us. I know how to make an impact – by putting on makeup or wearing tops that fall off one shoulder. I catch Gav’s eye in a certain way or walk up the stairs in front of him, and he knows. In our 20s, that would have been mortifying, but now it’s just how I signal I’m up for it.Even though in some ways I feel more confident as I get older, I struggle with my body changing after three pregnancies, and as I start menopause. I have to tell myself to believe Gav when he tells me I’m sexy. There’s a disconnect between how he makes me feel and my reflection. My Spotify is stuck in the 90s, and so is my head. I look in the mirror and think, “Oh, look, I’m 48.” Compared to the attention I got in my teens and 20s, I feel invisible now. But there’s a freedom and confidence that comes with not having to constantly think about what I look like.Sex hasn’t always been a priority. When I was pregnant with our youngest, I had prenatal depression and was in a constant state of fight or flight. Intimacy came in the form of cuddling and breathing together then. When we’ve felt more like housemates, we’ve had to make an effort by making each other laugh, putting on music and dancing in the kitchen.I believe Gav when he says he still thinks I’m sexy. But there’s a disconnect between how he makes me feel and my reflectionI worry there will be a time when sex, intimacy and laughter will fizzle out if we let them. But I comfort myself with the fact that we still have that spark, and when it has dimmed a little in difficult times, we’ve always got it back. When we’re at the pub, I’d still rather sit with Gav, hold his hand and put my head on his shoulder, than sit with anyone else.We have shared memories and histories, like a song or a joke that’s still ours 20 years later. There’s an intimacy in history. Intimacy is an accumulation of all the years we’ve been together. I love Gav’s attitude to life – he thinks, he cares, he cries, he feels. We can fall out spectacularly, but we still make each other very happy, which is something to be celebrated.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what kind of support do dads have?“You go to doctor visits and quite literally, no one asks the dads: ‘How are you feeling? You all right, today? You good?’ It’s like: ‘Mom, you’re good. The baby is good,’” Holden Jr said.Earlier this year, Holden Jr decided to start his own group of fathers and their kids that meets bimonthly at different coffee shops around Los Angeles for about 90 minutes. He calls it Dads Coffee Club.View image in fullscreenRon Holden Jr and one of his daughters in a photograph taken by fiancee Sara Sanei.Photograph: Sara SaneiThere’s no agenda. Fathers and their children can come whenever they want. The men usually feel more comfortable in group settings with their children than by themselves, he said. Usually 25 to 30 dads show up with their little ones, and there’s a range. Some are new fathers. Others have kids in college, and all are of various races and ethnicities, experiencing fatherhood and their own children’s lives differently.“It’s a safe space for you to just embrace your child being your child, exuding their energy and all that in the coffee shop and experiencing it,” Holden Jr said.Holden Jr said it’s important to have safe spaces like this because so often men may feel tons of pressure when it comes to providing for their families and societal stress to fit the image of masculinity, so they won’t be vulnerable with sharing their personal lives.“Maybe they feel like they’re losing their masculinity or the lifestyle they used to live or the friends they used to hang out with, because now they’re a father and they have a child who they love, adore and appreciate being a father,” he said. “But then there’s still these small moments of their life before that they may miss and not be connected to anymore.”Holden Jr said he is looking forward to expanding his group by getting out of the coffee shop environment and encouraging fathers to be more present with their kids. Last month’s outing was to the Broad Museum, whereAntoine J Girard, a Black art curator, led a tour and hopefully inspired some kids to be artists. Their next group outing will be 4 October at the David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles.“It’s just a wild world,” Holden Jr said. “I really enjoy being a dad. It’s so fun, it’s rewarding. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done. There’s the full spectrum of dads who feel that way, and then there’s dads who are quite literally scared or worried, and we can hopefully help everybody get into a space where they feel comfortable and supported. We can make being a father look and feel natural, fun and cool.”For Desmond Carter, having a safe space for mental health for Black men is why he started Mental Health Is Real Wealth. Carter, who began the organization to honor a friend who died by suicide, said that he also struggled with his mental health and credits being a father to his seven-year-old daughter as what saved him.“If I’m being honest, she’s in some cases, kept me alive,” he said. “I look at her and I think about her. I can’t be the one who crashes out. She keeps me grounded, she keeps me on my toes. She surprises me often with just like her growing, and it’s just her growing into herself or the energy she has. I would never change anything about it at all.”View image in fullscreenDesmond Carter, who started Mental Health Is Real Wealth, and his daughter in a 2021 photograph.

He is also a mental health facilitator forWalkGood LA’s YouGood?, which is another space for men to practice self-care, fathers included. The monthly healing circles include meditation, yoga, a sound bath, journaling and group discussions.“I think a lot of the time, we get asked the question: ‘How are you?’” Davis said. “That’s just a filler to get to the next thing, versus really being like: ‘Yo, how are youactuallyand: ‘How’s your vibe, how’s your energy?’”View image in fullscreenIan Davis, a mental health facilitator, leads a healing circle for WalkGood LA’s You Good?.Photograph: Kavi Peshawaria/Courtesy of WalkGoodDavis often leads the men in a series of body-movement exercises and empowering words or affirmations.“It’s powerful because it’s a vulnerable space,” he said. One of his affirmations that he leads with the men is something that he actually does with his children.“I make them repeat: ‘I’m whole. I’m complete. I’m lacking nothing. I’m the embodiment of infinite possibilities. Anything and everything is possible. All things are working for my good,’” he said.Davis added that he has cultivated his own space with a dad chat with his friends: “We have to do more of that for the people we care about, the people we love, and even those we don’t know. But I also think it’s paramount to do that for the Black men, other Black fathers, etc.“It’s something that can only be understood once you’re into it. It’s different once you actually not only are responsible for somebody, but are there through the process and the formation of that life coming to be.”He also has a golfing club calledDads Link and Golfthat meets regularly.Donnie Scantz, 49, from Houston, Texas, has two sons, Noah, 25 and seven-year-old Asa, and a three-year-old daughter, Ava. He considers YouGood? a space where men can come out of their shells and be vulnerable about how things make them feel. He remembers attending a YouGood? session on Father’s Day that really stood out to him; he’d taken his seven-year-old son.Etienne Maurice, the founder of WalkGood LA, was leading the session. He put the dads and their children in groups during a journal-writing session after a meditation. The question that was posed to the fathers was: What is something that you would tell your younger self?He remembers reading his letter to his child about not caring what other people think, speaking up and using your voice, and his son having a glow in his eye.View image in fullscreenEtienne Maurice, the founder of WalkGood LA, leads a session with dads and their children.Photograph: Kavi Peshawaria/Courtesy of WalkGood“It created a space for our kids to see us in a different way,” Scantz said. “My son looked at me and said: ‘Dad, you should try to be a counselor.’ I’m like: ‘Why did you say that?’ He was like: ‘You should do this for a lot of other kids because your words are powerful.’ And that just floored me. Where can we find somewhere that has the tools and resources to unlock certain things that Black men are specifically dealing with as fathers that we might not be able to unlock themselves?”“It’s a comforting space, because Black men, we have walls that are maybe even unintentionally put up,” Scantz said. “Society has created our defense system to put up these walls in ways in which we don’t even know.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingMenWest CoastCaliforniaBlack US cultureFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her daughter was my bridesmaid, and after we emigrated when she was a teenagerI becamea distant mentor– cheering on her ambitions and inviting her to spend apost-unigap year using our home as abase. Shehas a great independent streak andquickly found her feet,and became close with my own children, some of whom now live near her in the UK. We all get togetherregularly when I visiteach summer. She’s always had access to our holiday cottage, and we let her stay rent-free in our daughter’s university flatwhile she was saving for a mortgage.I was delighted when shegot engaged, butheard nothing for months apart from a note fromher mumto saythey were looking forward to the wedding.It later transpired that she had decided tohave an intimate affair. I was sad, of course, butas theydidn’t have a big budgetI understood, and watched the date come and go.I thought I wasOK about it, but then she sent mephotosshowingall the trimmings ofa “proper” wedding, with a gushing account ofher wonderfuldaywith “family and close friends”. Ifelt absolutely bereft.I have been trying to rationalise my emotional response. Ifeelfoolish for investingtime, effort and goodwillin someone who doesn’t “appreciate” it enough to include me in their life’skey moments. I don’t feelas if I was evertransactional in being there for her, and she hasvoiced her appreciation, but something about it has deeply hurt and upset me.I had to edit your longer letter so some of the softer edges are missing.Weddings, more than any other gathering, seem to bring out something in people, perhaps because it’s a union of two people and that can seem quite excluding as they go into their new life. Maybe you worry you won’t be so important to your cousin’s daughter now?You said it wasn’t transactional, but I wonder if you’re being totally honest with yourself? I too have been very generous with extended family and I too have been left upset and disappointed. For me, these younger members didn’t seem to “get” family the way I felt they should. It made me miss my parents and the way things were. It made me feel taken for granted and invisible, and it made me realise how I’d taken older members of the family for granted too. I wonder if any of this chimes with you? Not being invited seems to have triggered feelings of real loss.Your cousin’s daughter took pains to send you photos of the wedding and to include you in her enthusiasm. She clearly values your relationshipI went to psychotherapist Chris Mills, who said: “One of the hardest things is to find that values we believed we shared with someone turn out not to be – or they are expressed in a different way.” I think this is key: we don’t always get back what we give – or at least from the same people. “It can feel like a punishing rejection, a betrayal,” said Mills.I don’t think your younger cousin was excluding you; she just didn’t invite you. She could have handled it better and been more upfront, but she may have worried about your reaction – with good reason, it seems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Should I say something? | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead more“I’m guessing,” said Mills, “that your cousin’s daughter would have invited you to her wedding if she and her husband had opted for a big all-inclusive party. For their own reasons, they didn’t. But she took pains to send you photos and to include you in her enthusiasm. She clearly values her relationship with you, and probably sees it as far more than something symbolised just by what happened on one day.”Mills also said: “You now know your cousin’s daughter better in a certain way than you did before. If all this could lead to you having a no less loving and supportive, but perhaps more equal adult relationship with her in the future, it would probably be the best outcome for you both, as well as the best balm for your hurt.”You are entitled to feel as you feel.

Bullion has hit a series of record highs in 2025, putting it firmly on track for its strongest annual performance since 1979, when revolution in Tehran rocked the global economy.Why is gold in such demand?The short answer is that gold is acting as a haven and a store of value, a role it’s played for thousands of years, since the kingdom of Lydia started churning out gold coins in the sixth century BC. Investors can be a jumpy lot, and there are plenty of reasons to shift money out of riskier assets today – from fears of economic slowdown to rising geopolitical tensions between Russia and Nato.As well as traditional valuation drivers such as interest rates, the dollar and inflation, concerns overDonald Trump’s attacks on the US central bank, his trade war, and his tax and spending plans are also pushing gold higher, analysts say.Why can’t other precious metals play the same role as gold?Gold’s role as a store of value comes, in part, from its scarcity. According to the World Gold Council, if all the gold ever mined was gathered into a single cube, it would measure approximately 22 metres on each side.Total supplies are rising by an estimated 1.7% per year. That means “no policy, no discovery, no quantitative easing of geology” can debase gold, says Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.That makes it attractive when investors worry that governments are losing their grip on the public finances – finding it politically unpalatable to raise taxes, and impossible to cut spending.Copper, in contrast, can’t operate as a store of value as huge quantities are used, and consumed, each year, with demand set by the health of the global economy.Platinum and palladium fail this test too, despite an ounce costing over a thousand dollars as new supplies are quickly swallowed up by industry.How much has the precious metal risen by – and are we at peak gold?Since 1 January, the spot price of gold has risen by a blistering 43% to $3,760 per ounce. That outpaces all other leading asset classes this year.Gold hasn’t had such as strong year since 1979, when it jumped by 126% as Iran’s revolution led to a surge in the oil price, crushing investors’ hopes that inflation could be tamed.A line graph showing the price of gold steadily rising since the 1970sData from Bank of America (BofA) on Friday shows that $5.6bn flowed into gold last week. Over the past four weeks, the bank says there were record inflows of $17.6bn.BofA cautions that gold is tactically “overbought”, but structurally “under owned” – as it only represents 0.4% of private client assets under management. It is maintaining a long position on gold, indicating it expects the price to keep rising.Gold has further to rise, analysts predict. Arnab Das, global macro strategist at Invesco, for example, says the gold rally still “has legs”.“We see no true alternative to gold as a hedge against US risks and expect central banks to keep buying gold … In my view, central banks are buying gold because they see no fiat alternative to the dollar,” Das says.Who is buying it, and why?The World Gold Council says western investors and speculators have been the drivers of the recent price gains.They cite two reasons. First,evidence that a slowing US economywill allow the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further. That means the interest on cash reserves will be lower, making it less attractive compared with gold (which doesn’t provide a yield).Second, increased rhetoric against the Fed and its independence from the Trump administration is leading to concerns about the stability of the US dollar and the Treasuries market.A bar chart showing how much the price of gold has grown since the late 1970sCentral banks have also been adding to their gold reserves in recent years. Notably China. Bloomberg reported this week that China aims to become custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves in an attempt to strengthen its standing in the global bullion market, and become less dependent on the dollar and western centres like the US, the UK and Switzerland.What about the Trump effect?Overall, markets have not been badly hit by the jump in US tariffs this year to the highest level since the 1930s. But the most obvious vehicle of trade war worry has been the US dollar.M&G fund manager Eva Sun-Wai told M&G’sBond Vigilantesforum last week that this has led to a “broader de-dollarization trend, which has caused angst in markets”.“And I think it’s a big reason why gold, for example, has become the safe haven choice,” Sun-Wai added, as investors go for gold when they don’t want to buy the dollar or expose themselves to the risk of interest rate moves by holding bonds.The greenback is enduring a bruising 2025 – down more than 9% so far this year, amid concerns about Fed independence and those trade war concerns. That mechanistically lifts the value of gold in dollar terms.Should I buy gold?“Caveat emptor” certainly applies, given the edginess among investors thatasset prices might generally have risen too high. But some experts do see more value in gold – earlier this month, Deutsche Bank raised its gold price forecast for 2026 by $300, to $4,000 per ounce.You can buy physical gold, perhaps from the Royal Mint which sells gold coins and bars. The bulk buying chainCostco even stocks gold bars, which often sell out, perhaps because of the precious metal’spopularity with doomsday preppers. But “such investments come with extra costs and complications, however, like insurance and storage,” says Jemma Slingo of Fidelity International.Alternatively, you could put money into a gold exchange traded fund (ETF), which closely mirror movements in the gold price.Another option is to buy shares in gold miners, such as Fresnillo, whose share price is up 250% so far this year.There is a risk, though, of a pullback in gold after such strong gains, or a more sizeable drop, perhaps if inflation falls back towards central bank targets, or geopolitical crises ease.Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesexplainersShareReuse this content"

Bottom line: don’t send money to someone you’ve only met onlineShane HickeySun 28 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 07.27 EDTShareAfter months trawling the dating apps, you’ve finally met someone you feel you can connect with. Alas, they are working on an oil platform offshore, or perhaps serving in the military overseas doing sensitive work that demands discretion.Wherever they are in the world, your new romantic interest has endless excuses for why they can’t have a video chat, let alone meet you in person. But they are not so shy about asking for money.Romance scams are nothing new. Lonely people who are looking for someone to spend their time with have long been the target of criminals – but the fraud is on the increase among older people.Red flags: how to avoid falling victim to a ‘money mule’ scamRead moreThere was a 52% rise in scams among people aged over 55 in the past year, according to research by Lloyds bank. Also increasing are the sums of money that victims are being scammed out of.It is not just happening on dating sites – fraudsters stalk vulnerable people on social media or gaming forums, says the bank.Typically the criminal will ask for money for medical emergencies. They might claim they or a relative have been involved in a car accident, or they need travel expenses to visit the crash victim.View image in fullscreenTypically the scammer will ask for money for medical emergencies.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAThe average loss for romance fraud victims of all ages is £5,219, but older people tend to lose more. Lloyds’ figures show 75- to 84-year-olds lost £8,068 each on average.The scammers can be convincing and manipulative. When one customer was blocked from transferring £10,000 to a person he met online, he bet the bank worker who stopped him £20,000 that the recipient was genuine. The bank refused to put the money through, saying the money would be going to a fraudster.In another example from the bank, an 80-year-old woman met “Freddie” while she was playing a wordgame on Facebook. He said his son had died working on an oil platform in Germany, and he had to go and take over the job. He told her he had been hit with a tax bill on his return that he did not have the money to pay. She ended up losing £11,000 to the fraud.Meanwhile, Keith, 86, met “Stephanie” on a dating site, but she would only communicate via text. She convinced him to help with travel costs so she could retrieve an inheritance in Australia. He lost £2,260.The frauds are often very complex, says Det Supt Oliver Little of the City of London police. “Romance fraudsters are highly manipulative and often operate with chilling precision – coercing victims through emotional control, false urgency and elaborate lies.”What the scam looks likeCriminals will often post fake profiles on dating sites to attract victims.While pictures – usually fake – may be exchanged, the fraudsters will typically make excuses for avoiding video calls or in-person meetups. Their story may have inconsistencies or change over time. They can also be quick to profess their love to the person they are talking to.View image in fullscreenThe likelihood that you are speaking to a female oil rig worker is very low, Lloyds says.Photograph: KENDALL/AlamyLloyds highlights that the vast majority of the UK military (96%) are based in Britain. The chances of speaking to a female oil rig worker are also very low as women represent just 3.4% of Britain’s offshore oil and gas workforce.The scammers will often ask victims to send money via bank transfer or to purchase online gift cards, which are easy to sell on. They may use a sense of urgency or guilt when asking for moneyWhat to doStay on a dating app’s messaging system (where scammers can be monitored and have less anonymity) and speak to family and friends before making any decisions, says Little.“Criminals will try to isolate you – don’t give them the opportunity. Remember, if you haven’t met them in person, you don’t owe them anything,” he adds.Be wary of people who contact you on social media, and of those who will not meet up.Liz Ziegler, the retail fraud and financial crime director at Lloyds, says scammers will often make obvious mistakes, so it is important to reflect on what they are telling you and judge whether it sounds believable.“Never, in any circumstances, send money to someone you’ve [only] met online. No good relationship starts off in this way,” she says.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchRelationshipsConsumer affairsSocial mediaDigital mediaOlder peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Formerly the design director for womenswear at Miu Miu, he is the first creative director outside the Versace family.Following thePrada group’s acquisitionof Versace in April, Donatella Versace – who held the creative reins after her brother Gianni’s death in 1997 – stepped back into a chiefbrand ambassador role. She was, however, noticeably absent from Friday night’s show.View image in fullscreenVitale was informed by Gianni Versace’s personal archive.Photograph: VersaceIt was, in any case, not Donatella’s take on the Versace man and woman that Vitale mined for inspiration, but the Gianni years. “I remember my mum wearing Versace in the 1980s and 1990s – she was one of his best clients,” said the 42-year-old designer. “[I remember] the bold attitude and very Italian fierceness but always in control.”It translated to high-waisted Miami Beach-ready denim, muscle T-shirts, harlequin sequined dresses, patchworked leather bomber jackets and power shoulders that impressed a front row of famous faces that included Bianca Jagger, Hyunjin and Jon Hamm.“Growing up as a kid in the 80s and 90s you couldn’t escape the Versace name and so I’m glad to see Dario getting back to what Gianni had done – it’s very cool,” the Mad Men star said post-show.View image in fullscreenPower shoulders impressed a front row of famous faces.Photograph: VersaceGranted access to Gianni Versace’s personal archive, Vitale said he focused more on objects than collections to inform his new direction.“When I went to the Gianni archive, I wanted to find the spirit of Versace. I didn’t want to look at clothes, more the letters [Gianni] was writing, the ephemera that he had, the artwork he was collecting … the paper he used to send letters. I got to know him more by his belongings than his actual clothes.”Clearly invested in conjuring a world around the clothes he designs, Vitale staged the collection across several rooms at the art gallery Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. Micro sets comprising writing desks, unmade beds, powder rooms, and grand dining rooms were deliberately imperfect, inspired by Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1969 thriller Teorema, in which a mystery guest disrupts the perfect lives of a bourgeois Milanese family.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following in the footsteps of Matthieu Blazy, who is waiting to make his own debut at Chanel next week, Trotter went back to the beginnings of the brand that was founded in 1966.“This show was really about the journey and life of Bottega Veneta and I wanted to talk about the journey the house has been through,” she said backstage.View image in fullscreenBritish designer Louise Trotter’s ready-to-wear debut at Milan fashion week, spring/summer 2026.Photograph: NOWFASHION/ShutterstockView image in fullscreenTrotter evoked a period between 66-77 for Bottega Veneta spring/summer 2026 collection.Photograph: NOWFASHION/ShutterstockTrips to the archive in Veneto identified a clear period between 1966 and 1977 that Trotter wanted to focus on which she said “included a liberation of women at that time” alongside a celebration of the brand’s signature woven intrecciato leather technique.On the catwalk it played out in oversized tailoring with glossy leather lapels, nappa leather trench coats, and romantic figure-contouring dresses that the brand is well known for. Later, came more innovation, with huge sweaters crafted from recycled fibreglass in bold primary hues that bounced down the catwalk.Previously creative director of Joseph and Lacoste, this is the first time that 56-year-old Trotter has had access to the resources that a superbrand such as Bottega Veneta can provide.“I’m in the candy box,” she said backstage. “It’s been unbelievable to me, it’s the most wonderful entrance to this house to discover the hands, the craft, the willingness to always say let’s try.

This is where Vincent Van Gogh was a patient in the Saint-Paul de Mausole psychiatric hospital after cutting off part of his left ear. It is where he painted The Starry Night, among other works, and there’s a signposted tour around town, taking in landscapes that inspired the artist.Back at Le Moulin, its Italian restaurant Tutti Quanti dishes up fresh pasta beneath the pergola, while for more variety Graveson, 15 minutes’ walk away, has a handful of restaurants on its long central square.Doubles from€75room-only, breakfast about€18,hotel-moulindaure.comSleepy, leafy NormandyView image in fullscreenBreakfast at Trama en Perche.Photograph: Maurine ToussaintIn the Orne region of Normandy, Le Perche nature park is the kind of rural idyll Parisians decamp to in order to explore sleepy villages and quiet forests. Just half an hour by train from the French capital to L’Aigle, then a 30-minute taxi to Mortagne,Trama en Percheis the new four-bedroom guesthouse of two former Parisian restaurateurs, Marion Trama and Paul Hayat.Breakfast is a highlight, served in the garden when the sun is out. Local produce (sheep’s milk cheeses, freshly baked bread, fruit jams) feature alongside brioche French toast and blinis with crab remoulade.Much of the decor at Trama en Perche has been sourced from the area’s antique and brocante shopsMarion and Paul are also a fount of local knowledge, and can arrange bike hire (an autumnal favourite includes a detour to family-run cider producer La Maison Ferré) or recommend walkable restaurants, such asLa Biscuiteriefor salads and cakes orLa Vie en Rougefor natural wine and small plates.Much of the decor at Trama en Perche has been sourced from the area’s antique and brocante shops, and there are numerous stores around Mortagne to rummage in.Doubles from about€170 B&B,tramaenperche.frBeachlife in Zeeland, the NetherlandsView image in fullscreenStrandhotel sits on a sand dune overlooking the Zeeland coastThere’s a quiet, wild beauty to coastal towns in autumn, and with its wide beach looking out to the North Sea, Zeeland’s Cadzand is a perfect example.Strandhotel, on a dune just back from the golden sands, is a lovely vantage point to watch whatever weather rolls in. It’s a great time right now for kite- and windsurfing offshore, or stick to dry land and beachcomb at low tide for the fossilised shark teeth that part of the coast is famous for.Back at the hotel, there’s an indoor pool and saunas to unwind inJust a couple of miles north of the Belgian border, the easiest route here is via Brussels, changing for a direct train to Knokke-Heist (about 1½ hours), where you can pick up a taxi across to Cadzand (30 minutes). This being the Netherlands, there are excellent cycle paths, and bike hire across the street from the hotel. The nearbyZwin nature reserveoffers good birdspotting – you can also explore the salt flats and polder behind the dunes.Back at the hotel, there’s an indoor pool and saunas to unwind in, while the three restaurants range from Michelin-starred Demain to laid-back Beach Boy, which overlooks the marina and serves Zeeland oysters.Doubles from€212 B&B,strandhotel.euFamily-friendly forest fun near ParisView image in fullscreenFallow deer in the Forêt de Rambouillet.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyA former royal hunting estate on the south-west fringes of Paris, the 14,000-hectareForêt de Rambouilletsprawls across the capital’s commuter belt.

In among it all,Le Barnis a modern country house for city-weary citizens (train to Dourdan or Rambouillet from Paris; from there it’s a 15-20 minute taxi).The hotel shares an estate with the renowned Haras de la Cense horsemanship schools and equine activities are a big part of the appeal. They include children’s first rides, proper hacks through the woodland (riding from about £13) and horse whispering sessions (complimentary on daily activity schedule).

A former medieval farm, it’s now a 12-bedroom eco-minded yoga hotel.A large part of the gardens is turned over to permaculture, growing produce that makes its way on to plates in the Petits Éléments restaurant. In autumn that might include Jerusalem artichoke, pumpkin and butternut squash, alongside eggs from Indrani’s chickens, honey from its bees and apple juice from its orchards.There are numerous yoga classes each day (iyengar, vinyasa, hatha), as well as retreats and twice-monthly Sunday Slow Days, which include two classes, brunch and a workshop (ceramics, flower arranging).

In 2005 he set off from New York and rode 12,000 miles to Rio de Janeiro in search of the perfect meal. After writing a book about his experience, he settled in Burgundy and added wine to the equation, turning a derelict 17th-century water mill in the village of Auxey-Duresses intoThe Hungry Cyclist Lodge. Guests can set off each day to pedal around the surrounding vineyards, winding between tastings and lunches, and relax back at the lodge (which has a swimming pool).Bring a bike on the train (TGV from Paris to Dijon), then a short connection to Beaune and a 10km bike – or taxi – ride from the station. Or rent one when you get there (€22 a day for a hybrid). Next door to the lodge is a small vineyard of Gamay, where Tom’s family produce around 500 bottles a year of their Vin Du Moulin.

Leaning back in my seat, I watch birds on the mudflats: swans, gulls, oystercatchers and scampering red-legged turnstones.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Exmouth is a compact, walkable seaside town, easily reached by train on the scenicAvocet Linefrom Exeter. No need for stressful motorway driving and, once you’re there, everything is on tap: beaches, hotels, pubs, shops and cafes, alongside gentle green spaces and ever-changing seascapes.View image in fullscreenExmouth’s art deco-style seafrontPremier Innis 10 minutes’ stroll from the station, through flower-filled squares and gardens, and will store bags if you turn up early. A decade of sea air has battered the building’s exterior, but the restaurant’s floor-to-ceiling windows mean breakfast comes with a view of the sea and dune-backed estuary. Theopen-top 95 busto Sandy Bay stops almost outside.I drop my luggage and wander the few steps down to Exmouth beach. The soft tawny sand is crisscrossed with gull footprints. It’s a warm day and I get in the water straight away. The temperature is perfect, though I feel a strong current. I keep close to shore, looking out at the neogothic tower of Holy Trinity church and the seafront’s big wheel.View image in fullscreenLunch at the River Exe Café.Photograph: Ed Schofield/The ObserverAfterwards, a walk around town morphs into a cafe crawl. Lured by the smell of baking scones, I start with a mug of tea outsideBumble and Beein Manor Gardens, with its begonia baskets. Nearby, along a wide path with a waterwheel, lily pond and magnolias, a baby T rex and protoceratops are hatching out of reptilian eggs.They are part ofExmouth’s Dinosaur Safari, featuring 17 life-sized models that were unveiled in 2016. The town’s striking fossil-rich red sandstone cliffs are part of the Jurassic Coast, which has been feted by palaeontologists for centuries.The smell of fresh bread wafts from several bakeries and bacon is being fried at the butcher and deliLloyd Maunder. In a former stables and cottage nearby, the volunteer-runExmouth Museumis one of those packed and atmospheric troves of musty local stuff: clay pipes, Edwardian capes, butter pats, bramble scythes.Near the marina, the fishmonger is shelling whelks outsideFish on the Quay. “Best whelks in town. We cook them ourselves,” he tells me.“Only whelks in town,” laughs his colleague. I chew some by the water’s edge before heading toLand and Seafor grilled mackerel with pickled samphire.I stop for a while at a free afternoon concert outside Exmouth Pavilion, dozing in a deckchair among palms and pale Michaelmas daisiesJust being here is a tonic, slowly exploring the flower-hung gardens and two-mile long beach. I stop for a while at a free afternoon concert outsideExmouth Pavilionand doze off in a deckchair among palms and pale Michaelmas daisies. I wake sufficiently rested to visit the National Trust’sA la Ronde, a 16-sided house on the edge of the town, designed by cousins Jane and Mary Parminter in the mid-1790s. The57 bustakes just a few minutes to drop me at Courtlands Cross, close to the house with its oak-framed views of the Exe.View image in fullscreenA la Ronde is an 18th-century, 16-sided cottage full of souvenirs and decorative fantasies.Photograph: Hugh Williamson/AlamyA la Ronde is stuffed with souvenirs and decorative fantasies: a seashell-covered gallery that took 10 years to create, an ornate frieze made from feathers, walls full of sketches and silhouettes. There is a secondhand bookshop and the gardens offer playful diversions: croquet on the lawn, shell-themed board games on the orchard tables and a sign that says “Lie down. Look up at the clouds”.I decide to walk the couple of miles back to town. A signed path leads down through meadows to theExe Estuary Trail, a popular cycle ride with tunnels of butterfly-magnet buddleia and a maritime smell of stranded seaweed. “Tea garden open” says a chalkboard by the path atLower Halsdon Farm. The scones are warm and come with clotted cream from Langage Farm near Plymouth. I notice how quiet it is. Four times an hour, trains hoot and hurtle past on the waterside railway. Otherwise, there’s little sound save the plaintive cries of seabirds on the sandbanks and susurrating poplars overhead.Next morning starts with a radiant early dip in gold-lit water and a short seaward stroll to buzzingHeydaysand the neighbouringHangtimebeach cafe, which serves bowls of granola heaped with berries and bananas, and bagels full of rocket, chilli jam and halloumi. A few steps inland, I cross theMaer nature reserve. It’s a big, sandy, grassy area, sprouting clumps of silvery sea holly and yellow cups of evening primrose. There’s a long-necked brachiosaurus on the far side of the field (that dino safari again). I sit nearby, in the low branches of an evergreen holm oak, and listen to a chiffchaff singing overhead. Heading through parks and well-signed leafy pathways, there are flowers everywhere, from clifftop agapanthus to a bank of pink cyclamen under a sycamore.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, a train crosses the River Clyst at TopshamFor a long, relaxing lunch I head to theRiver Exe Café, a floating restaurant in the middle of the estuary, reachable only by boat (I take the bespoke hourly ferry from Exmouth Marina). Surrounded by gently rocking waves, I eat sea bream with capers and buttery new potatoes. The cafe is only open from April until the end of September and there’s a waiting list for reservations, but you can get lucky – as I did – with occasional cancellations.‘I’ve lived here 14 years. Travelled the world all my life … and I love this place more than anywhere else’Cormorants stand guard on a wrecked boat nearby. Local poetJennifer Keevillcompares them to “menacing dinner guests, all in black”. Her poems evoke Exmouth’s waterscapes: seabirds, sunsets, crumbling cliffs, kite surfers, Christmas Day swimmers. I head back to the beach for an evening dip and supper in the Premier Inn’s own restaurant. I’d usually look for somewhere more distinctive, but I’m tired and it’s right here. The hotel’s seafront terrace, with tubs of lavender and French marigolds, turns out to be a good place to watch the sun set over the sea and eat plates of inexpensive pub-style grub.Coves, caves and Agatha Christie – a car-free tour along the English Riviera in DevonRead moreNext day, inspired by Keevill’s poem Ferry to the Other Side, I take theseasonal boat across to Starcross(April-end of October) andwalk a circuitpast the brackeny deer park atPowderham Castle, up through groves of sweet chestnuts and down past marshes full of water mint and warblers. From the ferry, there are distant views of Exmouth and its “landmark buildings / a clock tower, a cafe, a row of old houses”. Back on the east bank, I stop at Land and Sea for a valedictory half of maltyOtter Aleand then a crisp beer fromTeignworthy breweryon the glass-walled balcony ofThe Grove. Looking out across the sunlit water, I feel any trace of tension slip away.It’s my last evening and I’m loath to leave. Local resident Geoff Crawford is enthusiastic about Exmouth: “I’ve lived here 14 years. Travelled the world all my life … and I love this place more than anywhere else.” He suggests more eateries to sample: “hidden gem”La Mar, a bistro abovethe Beach pub, and tiny backstreetLoluli’s Fire and Fish, “a take away cooked-over-coals fish shop”.An easy escape and seafood-lover’s paradise, Exmouth is a restful place to decompress beside the water. There are walks, boats and buses on the doorstep if you need them, but it’s also ideal for just being. Sit back, relax and watch the sun set.This trip was supported byGWRandPremier Inn(rooms from about £50 a night).

So when I set off in the 1980s to backpack through the US, I was warned about the country’s high crime rate and made to fear this big, scary place.I had my 21st birthday while I was in Los Angeles, and I’d been out having a few beers. Tired and ready to go home, I jumped on a public bus. The moment I stepped off I realised I’d left my camera on the seat – a disaster, as it was very precious to me.Luckily the bus had set me down right next to a phone booth, so I found the number for LA public transport, rang them and told them I’d left my camera behind. After putting me on hold for a couple of minutes, the lady on the other end of the line told me to wait at the bus stop and they’d get the camera back to me.The kindness of strangers: a man let me share his hotel room when I was locked out in ParisRead moreJust a few minutes later, the bus I’d been on did a U-turn, pulled up and the driver handed me my camera. This was totally unexpected – I thought I’d have to go and fetch the camera myself from some far away bus depot, if someone hadn’t already pocketed it.I profusely thanked the driver, who was a warm, friendly guy. “It’s my birthday today, and this is the best birthday present ever,” I told him. Without missing a beat, the driver got on the microphone and said: “Hey folks, it’s this guy’s birthday today” – and then got everyone on the bus, about 50 people who were probably on their way home from work, to join him in singing me happy birthday.I was happily beside myself. The memory still puts a smile on my face. My only regret is that I didn’t think to take a photo of that jolly bus driver!What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceFrom making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Photography byAlessio MamoSun 28 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 04.32 EDTShareOn a sunny afternoon this week the beach in the frontline Ukrainian city of Sloviansk was busy. Bathers paddled in a lake, sunbathed and sipped tea. At 3.30pm there was a sudden thunderclap. An artillery shell had crashed nearby, sending up a plume of twisting grey smoke. Ducks took off in panic. The swimmers glanced nonchalantly upwards and carried on bobbing in the salty water.“After three years of fighting we’ve got used to booms. They don’t bother us any more,” Alyona, a pensioner in a swimsuit, explained. She pointed to a concrete box beyond a row of wooden changing cabins and outdoor showers. “If the bombs are close we’ve got a shelter,” she said. Alyona and her friend waded into the shallows. A man selling grapes sat engrossed reading a book.View image in fullscreenSwimmers paddle in a lake in the frontline Ukrainian city of Sloviansk. The resort is popular in sunny weather, despite the constant threat of Russian drones and airdropped bombs.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianSloviansk’s residents have lived with explosions since 2014, when Vladimir Putin first began his imperial campaign to conquer Ukraine. Recently the war has become harder to ignore. Earlier this month Russian kamikaze drones reached the M-03 highway, 2km [1.2 miles] outside the city for the first time. They haveswooped on buses and cars. One person has been killed and 10 injured.On Friday workers were hanging nets between slender pine trunks and installing electronic warfare systems. This anti-drone corridor will cover the road connecting four cities in the northern part of Donetsk oblast: Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka and Kostyantynivka. IfUkrainewere to lose this hilly fortress belt, Russian forces could race across a flat steppe landscape, north to Kharkiv and west to the capital, Kyiv.Sloviansk’s mayor, Vadym Liakh, said those who predicted a Kremlin breakthrough in eastern Ukraine were wrong. In August, Russian soldiers seized a string of villagesaround the town of Dobropillia, advancing 10 miles [15km] in two perpendicular lines. Ukrainian forces have since retaken most of these settlements, killing and capturing enemy troops – proof, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said,that Moscow isn’t winning. In other parts of the frontline the Russians are making gains.View image in fullscreenThe mayor of Sloviansk, Vadym Liakh, in his office.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianLiakh said: “If they carry on at this pace it will take a year and a half to reach Sloviansk. Maybe longer. After that we will see what happens.” He described himself as an optimist, despite the fact the Russians are 15 miles [25km] away. “Of course we have a future,” he said. He pointed out that Moscow launched a big offensive last year to capture the city of Pokrovsk, still the scene of intense fighting. So far it has been unable to do so.The mayor didn’t put much faith inDonald Trump’s latest apparent pivot towards Ukraine, made after talks with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York. “How can you take it seriously when Trump changes his mind every day?” he wondered. He said Sloviansk needed missiles and long-range weapons to shoot down hostile drones and to knock out oil refineries deep inside Russia. “It’s about results, about our own objectives, and not what they say over there.”During hisAlaska summitwith Trump, Putin reportedly agreed to stop fighting if Ukraine surrendered all of Donetsk oblast including Sloviansk. The mayor said the offer was a KGB information operation to demoralise Ukraine’s defenders. In reality, Putin would take concessions and keep going, he said. “No one is going to give up Sloviansk. Not me, not our soldiers. Since when has Putin kept his word about anything?”Liakh acknowledged that a small number of civilians – known aszhdunior those who wait – support Putin. They include some of the 6,000-odd residents who remain in Kostyantynivka, which Russia is trying to encircle, living under withering fire. Many are poor and uneducated. Some collaborate and betray Ukrainian positions, the mayor said. Others refuse to leave their homes because they are elderly and have nowhere to go.Sloviansk mapThis month Sloviansk celebrated its 380th anniversary. The city – known since the 17th century as a producer of salt and surrounded by ancient oak forests – is a symbolic Russian target. In 2014, a Russian militiaoccupied Sloviansk for nearly three violent and chaotic months. Itmurdered local politiciansandkidnapped foreigners, before eventually retreating to the oblast capital of Donetsk after a Ukrainian counterattack.Some believe Moscow wants to recapture Sloviansk for propaganda purposes: to avenge the defeat of its earlier covert invasion. There are practical reasons as well. Occupied Donetsk has run out of water. The Kremlin’s long military campaign to annex the industrial Donbas region – “historical” Russia, according to Putin – damaged a Soviet-era canal network. It connects the Siverskyi Donets river with urban settlements.Water continues to flow in Ukrainian-controlled areas. The mayor said the Russians could fix their self-created problem by repairing pumping stations in wrecked cities such as Bakhmut, which they took in 2023, and by investing in infrastructure. “They don’t rebuild anything. They just smash everything up and plant a Russian flag on top of piles of rubble,” he said.View image in fullscreenChildren play in a park in the frontline Ukrainian city of Sloviansk, 15 miles from Russian forces. The authorities have yet to order families with school-age children to leave.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianResidents left Sloviansk after Putin’s full-scale invasion. Many later came back. Today’s population is 50,000. The number is swollen by soldiers and people displaced from nearby areas swallowed up by fighting. The city has the region’s last maternity hospital, where 40 to 50 babies are born each month. Schools remain shut, working online. The authorities have not yet ordered families with children to leave. “Life goes on,” the mayor said.The local economy is booming, thanks to an influx of well-paid military personnel. Real estate agents rent two-bedroom flats to soldiers for $35 (£26) a day. They hire them for when wives and girlfriends come to visit. New shops and cafes have opened up. Sloviansk boasts a bakery and an Italian restaurant, Palermo, serving pasta and Milanese soup.There are even weddings. In Sloviansk’s park, a wartime couple, Petro and Olena, posed for photos on a picturesque bridge and under a willow tree. Petro, a soldier, said he and his new bride had dated for a year. “I have a week’s leave. Then I go back to the front,” he said. Nearby, small children played on a slide. A football match was under way in a five-a-side pitch, with six players. Teenagers strolled down an avenue of white mulberries.View image in fullscreenA petting zoo in Sloviansk. Families and off-duty soldiers feed animals including horses, donkeys and goats.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianThe park has a rusting ferris wheel, a collection of parrots and a petting zoo. Sofia Karasova said she had come to feed carrots to the donkeys with her soldier boyfriend Oleksandr. “I believe in my country and my people. We have right on our side. The Russians are bad,” she said. She added: ‘I’m hopeful. Mostly they occupy smaller places than Sloviansk. For sure they are trying to squeeze us. We need more help from western countries.”Parts of the city have been badly damaged. In Polyova Street, a Russian airdropped bomb flattened two houses. Inna Valentinovna said she was at home with her dog on 14 August when the strike took place. Several cottages burned down. “There was a ginormous bang. My windows blew in. For now I don’t want to leave,” she said. Down the road was school number 18, boarded up after a previous rocket attack.View image in fullscreenInna Valentinova walks past the ruins of a house in Sloviansk’s Polyova Street, hit on 14 August by a Russian missile. “I was at home next door with my dog. The windows blew in,” she said.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianIn July two bombs demolished Sloviansk’s cake factory,killing 17-year-old Gleb Plokhoi who lived in the house next door. His mother was badly injured. Another missile struck Sloviansk’s Hotel Ukraine. The city was once home to eight sanatoriums, offering therapeutic mud treatments. All have been hit. The Slovianskyi spa complex has been shredded. An ambulance minus wheels is propped up outside its mangled entrance. A woman was injured in this week’s strike near the lake.In between bombardments, Sloviansk enjoys moments of magical calm. At night residents switch off lamps to avoid attention from marauding drones. With no light pollution millions of stars illuminate a dark velvet sky. Dawn begins with the cooing of collared doves; dusk brings a pulsing symphony of cicadas and a choir of doleful yapping dogs. In summer, sand martins flit above the city’s lakes, framed by an old salt factory and a tall brick chimney.The war has become so routine that nobody pays attention to air raid sirens. Alarms are broadcast from speakers on the roof of Sloviansk’s city administration building, once – in 2014 – the redoubt of trigger-happy Russian gunmen. It is unclear if they will return. Svitlana Vunichenko, an adviser to the mayor, said in the meantime people had to work, bring up their families and enjoy themselves. “You have to live,” she said."

Night-time record highs caused spikes in air conditioning use, overwhelming the electricity grid and causing protracted power outages as people struggled to keep cool.The blazing heat had come earlier than usual. One big Delhi hospital opened up a specialist heat ward equipped with two large tubs filled with ice. Other medical facilities scrambled to buy ice packs as heat-related emergencies surged. Over the months to come, many Indians would wrestle with power cuts amid the back-to-back deadly heatwaves that are becoming more frequent, longer and brutal.Access to reliable energy is still patchy, with daily outages and blackouts disrupting work, school and every aspect of home life for rural villages, low-income neighbourhoods – and even middle-class suburbs, where residents often rely on diesel-guzzling generators to keep their fridges cool and elevators running.Two-thirds of Indian households experience some form of energy poverty,according to one study, a lack of safe, reliable and affordable energy for lighting, cooking, heating, and other daily activities fundamental for human health and economic prosperity. Now the demand for life-saving cooling among the growing minority lucky enough to afford it is adding further strain on India’s generation capacity and distribution infrastructure – and contributing to the 7% to 8% annual increase in electricity demand.View image in fullscreenAir coolers, fans and other cooling equipment  on sale in Srinagar.Photograph: Nasir Kachroo/NurPhoto/ShutterstockIndia needs to generate more electricity every year to cope. Tackling the energy access gap is a critical step in meeting the country’s economic and social development ambitions, and it has been a top priority for successive Indian governments.At the same time it is on the frontline of the global climate crisis, coping with worsening drought, floods, desertification, sea level rise, melting glaciers and extreme heat, which are exposing and exacerbating existing inequalities and development needs among its 1.45 billion people.And yet the country simultaneously faces criticism for not doing enough on climate mitigation from the international community, particularly the industrialised western countries historically most responsible for global heating.India is in absolute terms the third biggest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the US, but the country rejects this measure as unfair. “This is not a valid metric, which is why India has argued for a long time about historic responsibility from the perspective of cumulative emissions and a fair share of the carbon budget,” said one person with knowledge of India’s climate negotiations.big emitters graph“Of course a country the size of India cannot say that we will not do anything because we did not cause the problem, that would be borderline climate denial. We will contribute our fair share, but on the basis of equity and fairness. That’s absolutely how the negotiators come at it.”Per capita emissions are less than half the global average, and while India’s per capita income or GDP is rising, it remains one of the poorest countries in the world.energy use per capita graphEven before the 2015 Paris accords made it a legal obligation, India insisted that the historical polluters whose populations had benefited disproportionately from the planet’s carbon budget such as the US, UK, Germany and Canada must lead the way on phasing out fossil fuels and providethe means of implementation– finance, technology and capacity building – to poorer, developing countries. This principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) was first formalised in the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) at the 1992 Earth summit in Rio, and has been the bedrock for India’s negotiating position in international climate talks.“Equity and CBDR has always been the foundational principle for India, and they have stood up to the bullying from the rich west that constantly paints them as the scapegoat,” said Meena Raman, a climate policy expert and Cop veteran from the Third World Network (TWN). “India’s per capita emissions are very low, and its development needs are very high – including huge energy challenges.”This, she says, is why an Indian minister stood up and fought over the coal debate in Glasgow at Cop28 in 2023, when India and China were highly criticised by some representatives from the EU, US, UK and some island nations because they insisted on the phase-down rather than phase-out of coal in the final agreement. Coal is undoubtedly the dirtiest of fossil fuels, but India remains heavily reliant on its abundant domestic supply of coal for energy security and economic growth, accounting forabout 70% of total electricity generation currently and halfof its overall energy capacity.For the Indian government the focus on coal is another example of the west’s hypocrisy. The UK, US, Germany and other formerly coal-centric nations switched to fracked gas only after exhausting cheap domestic supplies and exporting manufacturing to developing countries such as India and China. India on the other hand relies mostly on costly gas imports, making it unviable as an alternative to coal for reliable base-load capacity – the minimum continuous electricity a power grid needs to meet steady demand, which is particularly crucial for its industrial and economic growth, the Indian government says.But coal mining and production – like all industries in India – also contribute to an array of public health harms including air pollution. The development justification fails to take into account the devastating health tollassociated with every stage of the fossil fuel cycle.View image in fullscreenEmissions bellow from smokestacks at a coal-fired power plant in Badarpur, Delhi.Photograph: Kuni Takahashi/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe seasonal heat misery is made worse by outdoor air pollution from heavy industry, fossil fuel power plants, burning crops, vehicle emissions and unpaved dusty roads –13 of the most polluted cities in the worldlast year were in India. But research suggests that indoor air toxins from burning wood, animal dung, and crop waste for cooking cause more deaths and illness, as that is where people spend most time. Twenty-seven of every 1,000 babies and children die due to exposure to dirty cooking fuels in India, according toresearchers at Cornell University.“Based on health science alone, expanding fossil fuels goes against the human right to development because of the multigenerational harm caused to human health and food systems,” said Elisa Morgera, the UN special rapporteur on climate change. “These impacts in and of themselves worsen climate impacts on human wellbeing and economies, on top of the direct harm to the climate system caused by fossil fuels.”But India is not just depending on coal. It is also investing aggressively in nuclear, green hydrogen, hydro and renewables, particularly solar and wind. “India’s energy transition goals have always been an ‘all of the above’ approach, to increase capacity from fossil and non-fossil sources as part of its broader economic growth aspirations – and in response to growing demand,” said Ashwini Swain, an energy transition expert at the Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative. “So far the approach has mostly been ad hoc and supply-centric rather than targeted to end users, because it comes from a scarcity mindset. This has worked out so far, but India has reached a stage where we need a much more strategic whole systems approach to energy transition.”In a recent speech to mark India’s 79th independence day, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who no one would describe as an environmentalist, said energy independence was “essential” for achievingViksit Bharat, the government’s goal to make India into a fully developed nation by 2047. He promised a tenfold expansion of nuclear energy capacity from 9 to 100 gigawatts capacity by 2047, which will mark 100 years of independence from British colonial rule, a target experts say is unrealistic given current infrastructure expansion.The government recently announced major investments and incentives for public and private green hydrogen and ammonia projects, witha target of producing 5m metric tonnesby 2030. This would almost meet the current supply needs of the fertiliser industry and oil refineries, the largest end users that currently rely on grey (fossil gas) hydrogen, another example of a more targeted energy transition policy.India is also expanding wind and solar at breakneck speed. Earlier this year it surpassed Japan to become the third largest solar energy producer and fourth in the world for wind, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.Large-scale renewable energy projects (solar, wind and dams) are not subject to environmental impact reviews and have led to land and social conflicts. And while commercial solar installations still dominate, residential rooftop solar with battery storage is slowly growing thanks to subsidies and other government schemes. In July, the government announced that non-fossil fuel sources now make up half of India’s installed electricity capacity, five years ahead of its 2030 mitigation target set out in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) outlined under the Paris agreement.View image in fullscreenWorkers at Enercon India working on a generator for wind turbines in the city of Daman.Photograph: Joerg Boethling/AlamyFor now, however, India remains dependent on fossil fuels.TheClimate Action Tracker, an independent scientific project that monitors government actions against the Paris agreement’s 1.5C goal, rated India’s targets and policies – including the 50% non-fossil capacity target – as “highly insufficient”. The country’s progress report to the UNFCCC on its current NDC is expected before Cop30 in Belém, Brazil. The new NDC covering 2030 to 2035 has been submitted by the technical team and is now under review by ministers.“The climate problem has to be embedded in development. You need reliable energy for building hospitals and mass transit, and we cannot ignore the immediate realities for people living without cooking fuels and lighting,” said a negotiations insider.“Even if India shuts down all of its coal tomorrow, if the US keeps drilling and the EU keeps expanding their fossil fuels, we are going to face an increasing frequency of extreme events anyway. For us, the most urgent requirement then becomes adaptation. We have to invest in early warning systems and shelters to make sure that people are protected, especially vulnerable populations.”Whatis at stakeat Cop30 in Brazil?India’s delegation to the UN climate talks is relatively small considering the country’s size, diversity and challenges, with only a dozen or so top-level negotiators. The negotiators are regularly replaced due to India’s bureaucratic system, a legacy of British rule, which means the delegation can lack negotiating capacity and institutional history. They rarely brief journalists or release statements during the annual climate talks, another symptom of the bureaucratic hierarchy and Modi’s hostility towards civil society and the media.But the delegation includes experienced, skilled scientific and technical experts, and India is an active member of several negotiating coalitions including the G77 plus China bloc. It has a track record of pushing for unity among developing nations, which was key to securing the loss and damage fund in Egypt, according to Raman from the TWN.India is also a big player in the increasingly influential like-minded developing countries bloc, coordinating finance for the 24-member coalition that includes Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Kuwait, Pakistan, China and Mali.Modi appears likely to attend Cop30 in Belém this November after missing last year’s talks in Baku, not least because it will provide another stage to show Donald Trump, who recently slapped 50% trade tariffs on India and Brazil, that he has other friends and allies.India will push to table a new agenda item to discuss the provision of climate finance, specifically article 9.1 of the Paris agreement, which says that developed countries shall provide climate finance for the poorest countries. In the new finance goal agreed in Baku last year, developed countries tried to shift focus away from provision to article 9.3, which is about mobilisation.“While wealthy countries want to focus on mitigation and net zero targets, India and all the like-minded countries will keep pushing on climate finance as an obligation because this is not charity, it’s premised on this legal regime,” said Raman. “Fair finance for adaptation and loss and damage is so important particularly when the US plan is to ‘drill, baby, drill’ and pressure everybody else to also ‘drill, baby, drill’.”India has received morethan $1bn in UN funds for climate projects, but most mitigation and adaptation efforts are financed domestically.India has submitted its national adaptation plan to the UNFCCC, and the negotiators will be pushing for progress on finalising concrete indicators for the global goal on adaptation that are both measurable and financed.Loss and damage is not just an issue of the small island states. India, which has about 1,000 islands, as well as deserts, glaciers, forests and coastlines, is also very vulnerable and is stepping up efforts to assess its own loss and damage.Pledges to the historic fund have stalled at about $750m (£560m)since it was agreed in Dubai in 2023, which amounts to less than 0.2% of the irreversible losses developing countries are facing from global heating every year. And while no one is under any illusion that India will get money from the loss and damage fund, the government recoils at suggestions that it should be contributing to the pot, though ithas channelled billions intoclimate finance through multi-development banks.India will hold the line on finance at Cop30, but is also realistic, according to observers.“India will keep the pressure on for finance for developing countries but they know they are not getting anything, so are buying time and just doing things on their own,” said Harjeet Singh, an Indian climate activist and strategic adviser to the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.“Coal will be phased down and not out until there’s technology for heavy industries, but the transition is going to happen. India wants to become a green, clean country. There are typical developing country challenges, too much bureaucracy and lack of capacity. But the intent is there. The writing is on the wall.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaThe big emittersClimate crisisEnergyCoalPollutionCop30Fossil fuelsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The storm was causing disruption in the Bahamas and Cuba on Sunday, and a tropical storm watch was posted in parts ofFlorida.Meanwhile,HurricaneHumberto weakened very slightly but remained a strong category 4 storm in the Atlantic, threatening Bermuda.At about 2pm ET, Imelda was located about 95 miles (152.89km) west-north-west of the CentralBahamasand about 370 miles (595.46km) south-east of Cape Canaveral in Brevard county, Florida, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said. It was headed north at 7mph (11kph) and its maximum sustained winds were 40mph (65kph).The center said the system was expected to move across the central and northwestern Bahamas on Sunday and turn east-northeastward, away from the southeastern US, by the middle of the week.A tropical storm watch was in effect for the east coast of Florida from the Palm Beach-Martin county line to the Flagler-Volusia county line, the center said, urging residents along the south-east US coast to monitor the system. A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours.South Carolina’s governor, Henry McMaster, urged people to monitor the weather closely and stay alert.

La Luz del Mundo now reportedlyoperatesin all 50 US states and approximately the same number of countries, boasting 5 million members worldwide.However, new filings in Manhattan federal court have alleged that La Luz’s patriarchs passed down much more than leadership at the helm of this evangelical megachurch.Former priest who served under two Louisiana governors arrested for allegedly raping disabled childRead moreArecently unsealed indictmentcharges Naasón – and five other defendants, including his mother – in a sprawling sex-trafficking conspiracy. Prosecutors allege that each generation carried out a “deeply disturbing tradition” of abuse against vulnerable devotees.“The defendants engaged in a racketeering enterprise that exploited the LLDM Church and persisted for decades to facilitate the systemic sexual abuse of children and women – including the creation of photos and videos of sadistic child sexual abuse,” prosecutors said in announcing the charges.Eva García de Joaquín, Samuel’s wife and Naasón’s mother, “groomed for her husband’s sexual abuse and directly herself sexually abused minors and young women” for years, prosecutors also said.Naasón, who is serving a state-level sentence in California for the sexual abuse of minors, was brought toNew YorkCity to face these charges. He pleaded not guilty on Tuesday.The alleged culture of abuse started with Aaron and continued by his descendants. He, Samuel, and Naasón tricked girls and young women by telling them they could get a “special” blessing by serving them. This frequently included sexual activity, prosecutors said.Church doctrine set the stage for abuse. The church leader was known as an “Apostle”. Members were told that the sole way to reach eternal salvation was “to follow the teachings of the Apostle”, prosecutors said.They were also warned that “God will punish and eternally damn anyone who doubts the Apostle, fails to follow the Apostle’s teachings, or defies the Apostle.”As the church’s Apostle, Samuel abused “numerous” girls and women. Samuel’s actions “served as a model” for his Naasón – who is still the church’s Apostle. Naasón’s victims include the daughters of girls and women his father abused, prosecutors allege.Samuel couldn’t carry out this abuse without the help of a coterie of women. His wife, Eva, allegedly helped “to identify girls and women for sexual abuse and to ‘groom’ them … by exploiting their ages and vulnerabilities.”Eva set the stage for one victim’s abuse by “slowly exposing her to sexually explicit reading material and pornography, which was strictly forbidden according to the doctrine propagated by Samuel”. When the girl was around 16, Eva allegedly helped Samuel assault her, prosecutors claim.All the while, they allegedly used church coffers as their personal bank to fund abuse. Naasón allegedly used members’ donations on masks, costumes, and sex toys to make child sexual abuse images. He also told others to use this money, dubbed “love offerings”, to buy cleaning supplies meant for eliminating evidence of abuse.The family also bankrolled a high-rolling lifestyle with “love-offerings”, buying “luxury cars, watches, designer clothing, and first-class travel around the world”. Samuel and Eva allegedly took advantage of congregants free labor to build a sprawling home in Los Angeles, California.“The house was adorned with so many luxurious items, such as gold leaf lining the house’s molding, that LLDM Church members refer to it as the ‘Versace’ house,” prosecutors said.When federal agents searched Naasón and Eva’s adjacent homes on 10 September, they found still more evidence of wealth – including more than $1m in US currency as well as Canadian dollars and Euros. They allege to have also found “numerous” gold pieces and coins.Eva’s house even featured a “trap door hidden underneath a bed”, court papers contend. The alleged trap door gave way to an underground area with a safe that contained a cache of $220,000 and jewellry.Prosecutors pointed to Eva’s apparent wealth in paperwork arguing against her release on bail. Witnesses told authorities that there are hundreds of thousands in US dollars “hidden beneath” La Luz’s churches in Mexico. And with her access to multiple properties abroad, Eva “could comfortably live in hiding should she flee”, prosecutors said.Naasón and Eva both face charges that carry a maximum life sentence, including racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking conspiracy.Neither Naasón nor Eva’s attorneys could immediately be reached. Alan Jackson, Naasón’s defense lawyer in Los Angeles, previously told NPR: “We categorically deny these charges.”Jackson alsosaid: “We reject the grotesque portrait painted by the government and its allies.”In the US, call or text theChildhelpabuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visittheir websitefor more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

Now a remarkable discovery following a devastatinghurricanehas enhanced its position as a global leader in another distinctive field: ancient canoes – some even prehistoric.State archeologists have just completed a painstaking preservation of anancient wooden canoediscovered by a resident of Fort Myers during the cleanup from Hurricane Ian in 2022.It joins 450 other log boats or canoes dating back thousands of years recorded or preserved by the Florida division of historical resources. But this one is unusual, officials say, because it is the first they have seen made of mahogany, and probably the first to originate outside Florida, possibly in theCaribbean.‘The first eyes to see this’: Florida workers find 19th-century shipwreckRead moreThe age of the fragile 9ft (2.7 meter) canoe is under analysis through carbon dating and other scientific processes. Investigators are pursuing a theory that it might be a dugoutcayucocrafted by Spanish invaders who settled in the region during the 16th century.“We compared it to canoes that we have in our collection and previously recorded, and it’s a very unusual form, so that was the first hint it was not necessarily fromFlorida,” said Sam Wilford, Florida’s deputy state archeologist.“On the surface there’s tool marks made by iron tools, and we know that that is a historical date because that’s when the Europeans introduced iron tools into theAmericas.”Wilford said efforts to further narrow down a date through examination of fragments of the canoe were so far inconclusive.“We sent in two samples for radiocarbon dating and unfortunately those dates we’re still working with, because they came back earlier than what we’d expect,” he said.“Somebody could have put something like a bitumen on the surface that is interfering with the radiocarbon dating, or the actual date we’re seeing is the date of the tree’s death, so it’s not dating the canoe, it’s dating the wood.“The tree may have died much earlier than when the canoe was constructed from it. It might have been driftwood, or stored somehow before it was made as a canoe.”Hurricane Iancaused “catastrophic” damage when it slammed into south-west Florida in September 2022 with 150mph winds and a storm surge of 18ft. The canoe is believed to have been pulled from a riverbed and ended up in the yard of a Fort Myers resident, who discovered it as he cleaned up after the storm and alerted state officials.“It had been clearly submerged in water; there’s lots of stain marks on it, [but] it was dry when we received it,” Wilford said, adding that it was then lightly vacuumed and cleaned with soft brushes, and that each stage of its careful conservation was photographed.Florida has had morediscoveries of old canoesthan any other placein the western hemisphere, and more than 200 separate sites have been recorded, officials said. Many of the canoes were made and used by Native American tribes, including the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes, who inhabited large swathes of the state, particularly the wetlands of the Florida Everglades.The oldest, Wilford said, is a canoe discovered near Orlando, estimated to come from the middle Archaic period up to 7,000 years ago.With about one-fifth of Florida covered by water, the prolific use of canoes by its residents throughout history is unsurprising.“It’s because of the environment,” Wilford said. “Native Americans and then later on Europeans needed canoes to get around, and then the wet environment also led to preservation.”Canoes collected in the state’s historical resources division are stored in what Wilford said was a central archeological collections facility that is not open to the public. But the department operates an artifact loan program, with 26 canoes currently on display at museums across the US.“It’s incredibly exciting,” Wilford said. “Every canoe, and every fragment of a canoe, tells a story, and each one is unique.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaArchaeologyHurricane IanNative AmericansHistoryHurricanesCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

A previous Guardian investigation reported historical allegations in civil suits of“gross negligence” and “egregious” security failuresrelating to two US facilities, and a US$5.2m (A$8m) settlement in 2019 over a Mississippi state government bribery scandal.People banished to Nauru by Australia face hostile reception as $2.5bn cost of deal revealedRead moreIn September 2022, MTC Australia won a contract through limited tender to provide “reception, garrison and welfare services” for asylum seekers held on Nauru, for $47m over two months.The initial two-month contract was extended for another two months, increasing to $69m in December 2022. In January 2023, the government announced MTC would continue in the contract for another three years for $422m.On 1 October, the latest amendment to MTC’s contract will commence, lifting the contract’s value by $365m to $787m – more than 16 times its original value – and extending it out to 2027.At the end of July, 105 adult male asylum seekers were held on the island: 15 within the RPC1 processing centre and 90 in Nauruan community accommodation.At the current rate, MTC’s contract on Nauru is worth $157m a year: to hold 105 people on the island, at nearly $1.5m per person per year. If the contract does not increase further in cost before its expiry, Australian taxpayers will have paid $430,512 a day to process asylum seekers offshore.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe series of amendments also offers no details about the reasons behind the extension of MTC’s services for more than $350m.The contract for the previous garrison services provider, Canstruct, underwentnine amendmentswith limited competition over five years, expanding from $8m to $1.8bn.MTC’s amendment will come into force just weeks after Australia announced a separate $2.5bndeal with the government of Nauruover 30 years for the island nation to accept non-citizens forcibly removed from Australia.Geoffrey Watson SC, a director at the Centre for Public Integrity, described the contract’s increasing costs as “absurd”.“Instead of locking them up on Nauru, they could have given each of them a suite at the Intercontinental hotel and $500 bucks a week to spend, and it would have cost half,” he said.“This is insane. There comes a time when – it’s unfortunate, but true – good policy gives way to economics. So why shouldn’t a shit policy give way to economics?“It’s plainly run out of control – either through poor administration or a lack of oversight. The government’s got to look at it again ASAP.”The Greens senator David Shoebridge said the department’s process of dramatically escalating the contract price was a “gross breach of public trust, using the first contract as a Trojan horse to ramp up the charges later without any public tender or scrutiny”.“It costs a fortune to be systemically cruel and this is playing out here as contracts double and double again.”Shoebridge said the Albanese government was aware that handing a $787m contract to a US private prisons operator with a controversial history to run offshore processing would be a “hard sell” to the Australian public, “so they try to hide it from public view in every possible way”.The independent ACT senator David Pocock said the contract raised “questions of gross mismanagement”.“This is a particularly egregious example of a recurring federal government procurement process I’ve been raising concerns about for some time where contracts are executed then significantly expanded without a return to market,” he said.“These contract blowouts, added to the cost of the latest MOU with Nauru, sends the total taxpayer-subsidised figure of dealing with a small number of people into the millions of dollars per head.”A department spokesperson said the amendments occurred as part of the contract’s “scalable operating and commercial model”, saying it afforded “operational flexibility and value for money”.The spokesperson said while MTC’s work had not expanded since the original $47m contract for two months was entered into, the cost increase was “primarily related to the two-year extension of the contract”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This includes operational fluency, fitness for purpose, performance, integrity, risk, financial and legal considerations to inform value for money.”A2023 reviewof Australia’s handling of offshore detention contracts led by the former defence chief Dennis Richardson suggested the department improve the contract’s integrity by identifying “foreign bribery and corruption as risks in certain environments”. The review had found “no evidence” that home affairs officials conducted security or criminal checks when considering MTC Australia’s bid for the Nauru contract.“Considering the issues that had been raised in previous contracts for regional processing and the previous allegations, the review expected to find greater levels of due diligence,” it said.However, Richardson ultimately concluded “the government could have confidence in the existing contract”.A Guardian investigation in 2022 found parent company MTC had beenaccused in historical civil suits in the US of “gross negligence” and “egregious” security failuresthat allegedly led to the gang-rape of a woman in detention, the murder of two retirees by escaped prisoners, and themonths-long solitary confinement of a US citizenwrongfully held in immigration detention.MTC paid the state of Mississippi US$5.2m (A$8m) in 2019 to settle a bribery case. Mississippi alleged MTC engaged in “a conspiracy scheme” of kickbacks, fraud and money laundering, paying bribes to state officials in exchange for contracts.Home affairs officials said MTC had disclosed the case during the bidding process for the lucrative Nauru contract in an answer to a question on notice in March.More recently, in 2023, MTC was forced to repay Mississippi more than US$5m (A$7.6m) for falsely billing the state for thousands of prison guard shifts never actually worked.Allegations of corruption within Australia’s offshore processing regime on Nauru predate MTC’s contract.A2016 reportby the Australian National Audit Office identified “serious and persistent deficiencies in … procurement activity … which reduced competitive pressure and significantly increased the price of the services without government authority to do so”.The former Nauruan president Sprent Dabwido said the offshore processing deal had “turned our country upside down”.“Lives have been lost, corruption and greed, and it’s overtaken my island.”In 2023, Senate estimates heard that the Morrison government continued topay millions of dollars to a businessmanto provide offshore processing services on Nauru, even after he pleaded guilty to bribing Nauruan government officials.TheRichardson reviewidentified Nauru as a “high-risk integrity environment” and was told cronyism, bribery and other corrupt behaviours were prevalent. In 2024, the then assistant minister for defence Matt Thistlethwaite accused the Morrison government in parliament of having overseen an “offshore processing regime that was basically beingused as a slush fund by suspected criminals”.And last year, a former assistant secretary of the home affairs department, Derek Elias, alleged in aworkers’ compensation casethat the department had signed “broken, unfit-for-purpose contractsat extraordinary expense to the … taxpayer” within Australia’s offshore detention system.He alleged the department was engaged in contract negotiations involving “large amounts of money” that were “illegal” and a “waste of public money”, and claimed the department had “lied to Senators” in parliament. Home affairs had denied Elias’s allegations.Explore more on these topicsNauruAustralian immigration and asylumAustralian politicsMigrationPacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

This will involve tearing up parts of the course, despite being told there is “a high probability” of burial sites 1.5 metres underneath the grass.Sign up: AU Breaking News email‘Most precious thing in the desert’: the fight to protect sacred sites against the NT’s largest water licenceRead moreSeveral academics and Indigenous elders have told the government the southern section of the course contains a “substantial archaeological record” of a large-scale ceremonial precinct, known as Pirltawardli, which was a gathering place for the Kaurna people.Government documents show Pirltawardli has been recognised as playing a “central role in the history of South Australian race relations” and once hosted an Indigenous language school, a colonial store and the first Christian mission in the state.The course upgrade has not been finalised. But the government has conceded bones could be disturbed. A report by the Attorney-General’s Department outlines the plan to deal with human remains that “cannot be avoided”. They would be removed by an archaeologist.“This is quite distressing,” said Mitzi Nam, the chair of the Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation, the native title owners of the Pirltawardli.“This is really making our community very anxious as there has been no consultation. We know there’s a need for development, but there should be more compassion about what this land means to us”.View image in fullscreenSusan Dixon, a Kaurna custodian and a member of the state’s First Nations voice to parliament, and Mitzi Nam, chair of the Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation at Piltawodli memorial in North Adelaide.Photograph: Sia Duff/The GuardianNam said she had an informal discussion about the site with the state’s minister for Aboriginal affairs, Kyam Maher, but that there had been no formal consultation about the course design. Under the state’s Heritage Act, the site cannot be disturbed without ministerial permission.A government spokesperson said there had been consultation with tradition owners and the Indigenous community about the application, including a public meeting. A deadline for submissions was extended to facilitate more feedback.“Consultation on the application has closed and a report is currently being prepared for a decision,” the spokesperson said.“It just makes me feel sick,” said Lynette Crocker, the chair of the Kaurna Nation Cultural Heritage Association, who has also recently discussed the proposal with Maher.Crocker said more than 1,500 of her ancestors had already been removed from burial sites along the River Torrens and stored in museums. In recent years, Kaurna elders have sought to rebury their ancestors to“bring dignity to every one of them”.“I have said on numerous occasions to state government, if you don’t do anything else for Kaurna people, return their ancient ones to where they come from. They are spiritually angry with successive governments.“It’s not only frustrating, it is demoralising and shows a total disrespect for Kaurna people and our elders and ancient ones.”Susan Dixon, a Kaurna custodian and a member of the state’s First Nations voice to parliament, said her people had a deep spiritual and historical link to Pirltawardli.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our history falls into the bucket of disposables as it doesn’t carry a dollar alignment.”The state government has highlighted analysis from consultants Vision Insights, which claims the LIV tournament brought $81m to the state in 2025, with 86,000 “visitor nights” from tourists.The City of Adelaide’s reconciliation council wrote to the state government earlier this month and said the site should be preserved to demonstrate respect for Kaurna custodianship.“Any redevelopment must ensure the site is safeguarded, honoured and interpreted in ways that support cultural continuity and broader community understanding,” a letter to the state government said.North AdelaideGolfCourse was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansGolfAdelaideSouth AustraliaAustralia sportIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

Counting was expected to continue late into the night before full results were announced.Stanislav Secrieru, Sandu’s national adviser, wrote on X that Moldovans were voting “under massive pressure fromRussiaand its proxies”. Russia has repeatedly rejected claims of meddling in Moldova and dismissed the allegations last week as “anti-Russian” and “unsubstantiated”.Secrieru said that bomb threats had been called into voting stations in Brussels, Rome and the US. The ballots of Moldova’s sizeable diaspora, which tends to back closer ties with Europe,were expected to play a decisive role in the outcome.Dodon, who heads the Patriotic bloc opposing Sandu’s pro-European course, said his allies had documented electoral violations and were gathering evidence. He called on all opposition parties to join a peaceful protest outside parliament on 29 September.Casting her ballot in Chișinău, Sandu warned voters of the stakes. “Moldova, our dear home, is in danger and it needs the help of each one of you. You can save it today with your vote. Tomorrow may be too late,” she said. “The fate of our country must be decided by your vote, not by bought votes.”View image in fullscreenMaia Sandu warned voters of the staeks while casting her ballot in Chișinău.Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/ShutterstockSince gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova has oscillated between building closer ties with Brussels and clinging to Soviet-era relations with Moscow.Sandu is a former World Bank official who waselected as president in 2020 on a wave of anti-corruption sentiment. Her government oversaw a referendum last October in which Moldovans narrowly voted to enshrine EU membership as a constitutional goal. On the same day, Sandu was re-elected as president for a four-year term.In Moldova, power is shared between the directly-elected president and a prime minister appointed by parliament.This year’s parliamentary campaign was overshadowed by mounting allegations of Russian interference. Moldovan authorities accuse Moscow offunnellingbillions of dollars into pro-Russian parties, vote-buying schemes and propaganda campaigns aimed at stoking anti-western sentiment.A Reuters investigation revealed on Wednesday how Moscow recruited and paid dozens of priests in the deeply religious country to urge congregations to vote against PAS.View image in fullscreenPeople vote at home during a visit from members of a local electoral commission in Durlesti.Photograph: Vladislav Culiomza/ReutersTwo pro-Russian parties were barred from the race on Friday over financing irregularities, a move that angered the opposition and drew sharp criticism from Moscow.Moscow has denied interfering in Moldova’s affairs but it continues to shelter the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, who is under US and EU sanctions and is widely believed to be orchestrating campaigns aimed at destabilising the country.Ahead of the vote, a western diplomat in Moldova said: “It’s a small country but the consequences are disproportionately big for Europe. If Moldova turns back to Russia, it will be a massive headache for European security.”A separate western intelligence official told the Guardian that Moscow had made Moldova its “key foreign policy priority after Ukraine” in recent months, noting that the Kremlin had reshuffled the team handling Moldova earlier this year to pursue a more aggressive strategy.View image in fullscreenPeople dance as they queue outside a polling a station located in the embassy of Moldova.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersSandu’s main vulnerability is the economy. Inflation remains stubbornly high, emigration continues and GDP growth has been modest.Her supporters argue the problems stem largely from external shocks: Russia’s war in Ukraine plunged the country into turmoil, cutting off key trade routes, triggering an energy crisis and forcing Moldova to absorb tens of thousands of refugees.Sandu’s stronghold lies with Moldova’s diaspora, which has traditionally backed PAS, as well as younger urban voters.But her party remains far less popular in regions with strong pro-Russian leanings: Transnistria, where Moscow still stations about 1,500 troops after a brief separatist war in the 1990s, and Gagauzia, a semi-autonomous area where pro-Russian sentiment runs deep.Explore more on these topicsMoldovaRussiaEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Turnout was 49.55%, higher than expected.The narrow win will come as a relief to Switzerland’s main political parties, which had mostly supported plans for the e-ID. Both houses of the Swiss parliament had backed the measure with large majorities and the government had recommended a “yes” vote.But voters rejected an earlier version of the e-ID in 2021, largely over objections to the role of private companies in the system. In response to these concerns, the Swiss state will now provide the e-ID, which will be optional and free of charge.The referendum came soon after the UK governmentannounced plans for a digital ID card, which would sit in the digital wallets of smartphones, using state-of-the-art encryption.More than1.6 million people have signed a petition opposing e-ID cards, which would be mandatory for people working in the UK by 2029.The Swiss authorities said the e-ID would help people prove their identity online, making it easier to access government services or prove their age, for example when buying alcohol. The e-ID, which is linked to a smartphone, can also be used in bricks and mortar businesses, for instance, to open a bank account or prove age in bars and clubs. To ensure security the e-ID is linked to a single smartphone, users will have to get a new e-ID if they change their device.Starmer’s ID plan has caused upset, but in the EU the debate has long been settledRead moreSwiss people could still choose to use a physical ID card, which has been in place for decades. An ID card containing biometric data – fingerprints – will be available from the end of next year.Critics of the e-ID scheme raised data protection concerns and said it opened the door to mass surveillance. They also fear the voluntary scheme will become mandatory and disadvantage people without smartphones. The referendum was called after a coalition of rightwing and data-privacy parties collected more than 50,000 signatures against e-ID cards, triggering the vote.Political scientist Lukas Golder told Swiss public television, SRF, that since the Covid pandemic he had seen growing mistrust of state solutions, particularly in conservative regions.The government argued digital ID would boost the Swiss economy by bringing the non-EU country in line with its neighbours.By the end of 2026 all EU citizens should be able to have a digital wallet,allowing people to store ID cards, driving licences and university diplomas in one place online, so they can prove identity and have easier access to government and private business services. The digital wallet is voluntary, based on open-source code and is being tested by 550 public authorities and private companies in the EU, Norway, Iceland and Ukraine.Some countries havealready taken this path. For more than two decades, Estonians have had e-ID cards, which are used to vote, digitally sign documents, access public services and shop online. In Ukraine, 14 million people are said to usethe Diia app and website, which allows people to store digital documents, including passports and ID cards, and access state services, such as paying traffic fines and updating driving licences.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandIdentity cardsEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

With photographs byAlessio MamoSun 28 Sep 2025 12.05 EDTFirst published on Sun 28 Sep 2025 02.18 EDTShareOne of the worst bombardments of Kyiv since the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainehas killed at least four people in what Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as a “vile and cowardly” attack.Russia launched nearly 600 drones and more than 40 cruise missiles in a bombardment that lasted more than 12 hours over Saturday night and into Sunday morning. The main targets were the Ukrainian capital and the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Odesa.Ukraine’s president noted that the onslaught came at the close of UN general assembly week in New York, during which Donald Trump had expressed support for Kyiv. Zelenskyy called on allies to stop all Russian oil imports and promised his country would “strike back”.Map of regions targeted“This is precisely how Russia shows its true position. Moscow wants to keep fighting and killing and deserves only the harshest pressure in the world,” he wrote on Telegram. “The Kremlin benefits from continuing this war and terror as long as energy revenues flow and the shadow fleet operates.”Earlier, Kyiv echoed with the sound of anti-aircraft fire as waves of drones arrived in a grey dawn sky. Residents scrambled to take cover amid air raid sirens. A missile wiped out most of a street in the Petropavlivska Borshchahivka district, sheering off roofs and blowing out windows.Damage in KyivA falling concrete slabcrushed and killed a 12-year-old girl, Oleksandra. Classmates left flowers and toys outside her gutted house. A neighbour, Liudmyla, described her as a happy and active girl who did sport and took English classes. She had just returned from Canada to go back to school in Kyiv. “A wonderful child. It’s such a shock,” Liudmyla said.Other victims included a nurse and a patient who died when Kyiv’s cardiology institute took a direct hit. The body of another person was found under debris, officials said.“There was a huge explosion around 6am. Everything started falling on our heads,” Lolita Isakova, 24, said. “We started to run in panic. There were booms and we couldn’t understand what was happening. My neighbour was covered in blood. He was screaming, looking for his wife and daughter. They were downstairs and OK. An ambulance took him away.” She added: “Russia is a terrorist state. Fuck them.”Mark Serhiyiv, a 35-year-old army chaplain, said it was the second time Moscow had destroyed his home. “I still can’t believe that the children are alive. It’s such a blessing from God. They were right under the roof when it hit them. The roof was torn off right above my eldest son’s bed,” he said.“I’m from Melitopol. They occupied the city and took my property. I moved to Kyiv in 2024. Our Russian neighbour is crazy. They shoot and deliberately kill civilians. This is our reality.”Cleanup in KyivMore than 70 people were injured across the country, including three children whose high-rise apartment building was hit in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.On Sunday morning in Kyiv firefighters doused a burning car. Rescue workers and a digger shovelled up glass, masonry and twisted rebar.The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said: “Once again, residential buildings and infrastructure are being hit. Once again, it is a war against civilians.” There will be a response to these actions. But the west’s economic blows against Russia must also be stronger.”Cleanup in KyivThere was widespread international condemnation. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, said the bombardment had brought further death and destruction and showed that Putin was “committed to war”. He said Britain would step up its support for Kyiv in response to Moscow’s “illegal attacks”.Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, said Russia had again targeted civilians in cold blood. “This brutal attack … lays bare Russia’s false narratives of the war and again shows the world the true face of the aggressor,” he said. He called for additional EU sanctions against Moscow and for pressure to be put on its war machine.Poland’s military said it had scrambled fighter jets and put ground-based air defence systems on high alert in response to the strikes on Ukraine. The moves were preventive and intended to secure Polish airspace and protect citizens, especially in border areas with Ukraine, the military said.EU to move forward with plans for drone wall amid Russian incursionsRead morePoland closed the airspace near its southeastern cities of Lublin and Rzeszów, a key hub for aid to Ukraine, for several hours.Speaking on Saturday in Kyiv aftermeeting Trumpat the UN in New York, Zelenskyy had warned that Russia was preparing for a wider European conflict. “Putin will not wait for the war in Ukraine to end. He will open some other front. No one knows which one. But there is no doubt that he wants it,” he said.He made his remarks afterdrone sightings in Denmark, Poland and Romaniaand the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets. Denmark’s army said on Sunday that drones had been spotted flying over Danish military sites for the second night running.Zelenskyy suggested EU governments were struggling to deal with this new and dangerous threat. Ukraine spotted 92 drones flying towards Poland in a “choreographed” way earlier this month. It intercepted most of them, but 19 crossed into Polish territory where four were shot down.Russia claimed its strikes on Sunday were against Ukrainian military facilities. Earlier it denied it was responsible for drone incursions and said it had no plans to attack Nato member states. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told the UN general assembly: “Any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response.”Speaking to reporters later, Lavrov said that if any country downed objects still within Russian airspace, “they will very much regret it”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaPolandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The transport ministry said all civilian use of drones would be banned to ensure security while Denmark hosts an EU summit on Wednesday and a meeting ofthe European Political Community, a wider gathering of leaders from across the continent, on Thursday.It said the move would “remove the risk that enemy drones can be confused with legal drones and vice versa”, and it said any violation of the ban could result in a fine or two years’ imprisonment.There has been a spate of drone incursions in recent weeks inDenmark,PolandandRomania, as well as the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets, while Russia continues its deadly bombardment of Ukraine.On Sunday a German air defence frigate, FSG Hamburg, arrived in Copenhagen to contribute to “strengthening Denmark’s airspace surveillance” during the summits, Danish armed forces said.The frigate is part of Nato’s “Baltic Sentry” mission, which the alliance said this weekend it intended to strengthen. A Nato spokespersonsaidthere would be “even more enhanced vigilance” in the Baltic Sea region, including Denmark.Baltic Sentry – deployments of Nato frigates, aircraft and drones to protect infrastructure – was launched in January after a series of incidents in whichpower cables, telecoms links and gas pipelines on the Baltic Sea floor were damaged.View image in fullscreenThe frigate Hamburg (F220) of the German Navy is docked at the harbour in Copenhagen as defence is bolstered.Photograph: Emil Nicolai Helms/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty ImagesNato launched “Eastern Sentry” earlier this month to bolster the defence of Europe’s eastern flank in response to Russian drone incursions of Polish airspace.In neighbouring Norway, airport operator Avinor said late on Sunday that drone “activity” had been observed at Bronnoysund Airport, one of four airports in northern Norway where air and land restrictions for drones had been extended to 10km as “a precautionary measure”.Norway was already investigating “possible sightings of drones” on Saturday near its biggest military base, Orland, where its F-35 fighter jets are parked.Writing on X on Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he had spoken to Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, about the “increasing incidents with Russian drones over Europe”, adding: “The unity of Europeans will definitely provide an answer to this threat.”Russia launchedhundreds of drones and missilesat Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities overnight in a 12-hour bombardment that killed at least four people.Russia has denied deliberate targeting of Nato countries with drones. The Kremlin accused Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, of “unfounded allegations” last week after she said authorities were still investigating who was behind adrone incursionthat shut Copenhagen airport for several hours but could not rule out Russia.Drone incursions have also affected Norway, with Støre accusing Russia of violating Norway’s airspace three times over spring and summer.After a two-day meeting of Nato military chiefs in Riga, the chair of Nato’s military committee, Adm Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, said on Saturday: “Every threat to Nato’s air, land and sea space will be dealt with a resolute and proportionate response.”Asked whether Nato’s air policing mission in the Baltic could be upgraded to air defence, Cavo Dragone stressed that the origin of the drones was still being investigated but “this could be an option, depending on what will be the final assessment”.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkDrones (military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is not just with us; it is with everyone.“It could be a motorbike that is now hit, or a table with a small bit of metal on it or window frames.“The issue is if we still have a number of things that are not clear, if you have one side expanding through these lists of derivatives, it is very difficult to claim we have certainty.”The UK government, which secured its lower steel tariff before a deal with the EU, has said it is seeking clarification from Washington about what extra steel products will be affected.Fearing another wave of redundancies in a sector already hit by overcapacity and cheap foreign imports, the Community trade union and British Steel said they wanted the UK’s industrial sector to sign a pledge backing the country’s steel sector.“With the industry facing unprecedented challenges, the pledge seeks to galvanise support for UK-made steel and reinforce the long-term resilience of the sector, its workforce, and the infrastructure it sustains,” the two organisations said.Eurofer, the European steel trade representative body, said: “The latest developments make even more evident the need for a strong new trade measure to preserve not only the viability of the EU steel sector but EU manufacturing as a whole, and the millions of quality jobs they sustain in Europe.”Steel tariffs went up from a punitive 25% to 50% in June. It was part of Trump’s attempt to revive the US industry but also to ringfence it not just against Chinese imports but also products that include steel, be they stainless steel sinks, kettles or cranes.The German MEP and chair of the European parliament’s influential international trade committee, Bernd Lange, said the derivative list was already “really harming a lot of industries” including the motorcycles sector.He told how he had recently visited a motorcycle factory in Germany, where he learned the owners were unable to produce a definitive paper trail for the quantity of steel and aluminium used in their vehicles, down to nuts and bolts that could have an element of Chinese steel in them.Under the rules the tariffs are payable on the value of their steel and aluminium content.“They know they are between 30% and 50% but because they are unsure, they declare 50% because otherwise they are in danger of getting tariffs of 200%,” Lange said in reference to customs penalties for non-declaration of all goods subject to duties.He told MEPs that the new tariff regime and the prospect of the inclusions of products expanding meant it was not easy to “explain to the workers” that the EU-US deal was a good one.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionSteel industryTariffsEuropeDonald TrumpTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

Medics reported 16 more deaths in strikes on homes in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to at least 21. The Gaza health ministry said later that Israeli fire had killed at least 77 people in the previous 24 hours.Hamas’s armed wing urged the Israeli military to halt airstrikes temporarily and withdraw from part of Gaza City on Sunday to allow it to locate two Israeli hostages it said it had lost contact with there.“The lives of the two prisoners are in real danger and [Israeli] forces must immediately withdraw … and halt aerial operations for 24 hours … to allow attempts to rescue the prisoners,” the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement.There was no immediate response from Israel, where Hamas has previously been accused of exploiting the hostages to wage “psychological warfare”.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinian boys in Deir al-Balah.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is expected to visit the White House on Monday, told Fox News Sunday that Israel was working on a new ceasefire plan with the White House.“We’re working on it,” he said. “It’s not been finalized yet, but we’re working with President Trump’s team, actually as we speak, and I hope we can – we can make it a go.”Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday: “We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!”He promised at the start of his second term in office a quick end to the war but eight months later a resolution remains elusive.Speaking at the UN on Friday, Netanyahu vowed to “finish the job” against Hamas, days after Britain, France and other western powersrecognised a state of Palestine.Trump has floated a 21-point proposal for an immediate ceasefire that includes the release of all hostages within 48 hours, the disarmament of Hamas, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to news reports in the US and Israel.A Hamas official said the group had been briefed on the plan but had yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators.Israel is likely to come under new international pressure in the coming days as an international aid flotilla nears its territorial waters. The flotilla stopped for several days in Greek waters for repairs but set sail on Sunday for Gaza, where activists including Greta Thunberg intend to challenge Israel’s naval blockade and deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.On Sunday Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani,repeated a proposal made last week for the flotilla to take the aid to Cyprus for eventual distribution in Gaza by the Roman Catholic church. The flotilla, which was struck in international waters off Crete on Wednesday by drones armed with stun grenades and irritants, rejected the suggestion.Israel has previously said it will use any means to prevent the boats from reaching Gaza.The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 incursion into Israel during which militants killed 1,219 people, mostly civilians. Of the 251 people abducted during the attack, 47 are still held in Gaza, including 25 whom the Israeli military says are dead.The ensuing Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 66,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000. Much of the territory has been reduced to rubble and famine has been declared in parts of its some northern areas.In the occupied West Bank on Sunday, Israeli security forces shot dead an alleged attacker in a car-ramming incident in which an Israeli man was seriously injured at a junction near Nablus. Hamas praised the attack.Violence has surged in the West Bank, which alongside Gaza and East Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the six-day war in 1967 and which the Palestinians want as their future state.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Diplomacy can and should continue.”Russia made it clear it would not enforce the sanctions, considering them invalid.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the sanctions “finally exposed the west’s policy of sabotaging the pursuit of constructive solutions in the UN security council, as well as its desire to extract unilateral concessions from Tehran through blackmail and pressure”.Iran has long contended that it is not seeking nuclear weapons.The sanctions are a “snapback” of measures frozen in 2015 when Iran agreed to major restrictions on its nuclear programme under a deal negotiated by the former US president Barack Obama.The US has already imposed massive sanctions, including trying to force all countries to shun Iranian oil, in steps taken by Donald Trump when he withdrew from the deal in his first presidential term.Iran and the US had held several rounds of Omani-brokered talks this year before they collapsed in June when first Israel and then the USattacked Iranian nuclear facilities.Iran recalled its envoys from the UK, France and Germany for consultations on Saturday, state television reported.“The current [economic] situation was already very difficult, but it’s going to get worse,” said an Iranian engineer who asked to be identified only by his first name, Dariush.“The impact of the renewed sanctions is already evident: the exchange rate is increasing, and this is leading to higher prices,” the 50-year-old told Agence France-Presse, lamenting a standard of living that was “much lower” than it was two or three years ago.The dollar was trading at about 1.12m rials on the black market on Saturday, a record high according to several currency-tracking websites.The Brussels-based thinktank International Crisis Group said Iran seemed dismissive of the renewed UN sanctions as it had already worked out how to cope with the US ones.But it noted that the snapback was not easy to reverse as it would require consensus at the security council.“It is also likely to compound the malaise around an economy already struggling with high inflation, currency woes and deepening infrastructure problems,” it said.Explore more on these topicsIranUnited NationsNuclear weaponsIran nuclear dealMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Vijay, one of the most popular and successful actors in Tamil cinema, who entered politics last year, was addressing the crowd for his Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) party before state elections early next year.Tamil Nadu police launched the case, which is the first step toward potential charges, against three TVK party leaders, a senior official told Reuters. “TVK originally sought permission for a gathering of 10,000 people, but the actual crowd was more than double,” Tamil Nadu police officer V Selvaraj told the news agency. Vijay, whose birth name is Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar but who is widely known by the one name, was not included in the list of three people.Indian media reports, quoting local officials, said that as Vijay spoke to the crowd, a group of his supporters and fans had fallen while trying to get close to his bus, leading to the deadly crush. Supporters had gathered at the rally amid intensely hot temperatures and Vijay arrived hours late, officials said.View image in fullscreenPeople mourn the death of loved ones after the crowd crush at the rally.Photograph: Ragul Krishnan/EPAThe state’s head of police, G Venkataraman, said crowds had been waiting for hours under hot sun without sufficient food and water, having been informed that Vijay would arrive at the venue by noon.“The crowds started coming in from 11am. He came at 7.40 pm. The people lacked sufficient food and water under the hot sun,” he told reporters.He added that 10,000 people had been expected but approximately 27,000 turned up.Tamil Nadu’s health minister, Ma Subramanian, told the Associated Press that the victims were dead by the time they were taken to hospital and that the injured were stable.Vijay has drawn massive crowds since launching his party in February last year, after retiring from acting.View image in fullscreenA portrait of Vijay at the site after the rally.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe Press Trust of India news agency, quoting officials, reported that at least 30 people fainted while Vijay was addressing the rally from the top of his campaign vehicle and were rushed in ambulances to local hospitals.Videos on social media showed him tossing water bottles to supporters shortly before the panic broke out. He halted his speech midway when workers raised the alarm after noticing that people were fainting and falling down, the news agency said, adding that as they were taken to hospital, Vijay continued his speech.However, he ended his speech shortly after sensing an abnormal situation in part of the huge gathering, the news agency said.“My heart is shattered by this tragedy,” the 51-year old star wrote on social media. “I am writhing in unbearable, indescribable pain and sorrow that words cannot express.”The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said the “unfortunate incident” was “deeply saddening”.“My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. Wishing strength to them in this difficult time. Praying for a swift recovery to all those injured,” he said on social media.Tamil Nadu has appointed a commission led by a retired judge to investigate the causes of the crowd crush.Such tragedies are relatively common in India, where crowd safety measures at large gatherings are poor. In Januaryat least 30 people were killed and scores injured in crowd crushesat the Hindu Kumbh Mela festival.Reuters, Associated Press and Agence-France Presse contribute to this report.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

That was an increase from £2.8m the year before, when Pulp and The Chemical Brothers headlined the Friday and Saturday night lineups.The 2026 headliners will be The Cure, Lewis Capaldi and Calvin Harris, organisers announced on Monday.The festival began in 1968 and achieved worldwide fame –and notoriety– two years later when an estimated 600,000 people descended on an island whose permanent population numbered just 100,000.The 1970 lineup featured the Who, Miles Davis, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Jethro Tull and Sly and the Family Stone, as well as a set by Jimi Hendrix just weeks before his death, in which he played a heavily distorted version of God Save the Queen.One of the attenders that year was John Giddings, who has run the festival since 2002. Since 2017 the festival has been part of a sprawling corporate network of UK live music events all ultimately owned by the vast and sometimes controversial US events and ticketing business Live Nation.Accounts filed at Companies House show that Isle of Wight Festival Ltd paid a £2.6m dividend, up from £1.9m in 2023, to its immediate parent, UK Festival Holdings Ltd, a holding company that also runs festivals such as Reading.That company is too small to publish detailed accounts. The firm immediately above it in the ownership chain, LN-Gaiety Holdings Ltd, is a conduit for dividends from Live Nation’s UK events. LN-Gaiety Holdings has reported nearly £34m in dividend income over the past two years for which accounts are available.In 2023 it paid out nearly £49m in dividends to LNGH Ireland Ltd, a holding company in Ireland, where corporation tax rates are lower than in the UK.Los Angeles-based Live Nation, which also owns Ticketmaster, bought theIsle of Wight festivalin 2017 during a period of expansion. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) cleared the deal, saying the event was not a rival to the company’s portfolio of about 20 UK festivals including Reading, Leeds and Download.Live Nation is facing alawsuit in the USfor allegedly allowing ticket touts to make millions of dollars at fans’ expense. It is also the subject oflegal action from the US department of justiceover an alleged dominance of the live events industry that “suffocates” competition at the expense of fans.In the UK, the competition watchdog has forced Live Nation’s subsidiary Ticketmaster tochange how it advertisesconcert tickets, including ending “misleading” information about the seats they are buying, after a fan backlash over its handling of the Oasis reunion tour.Explore more on these topicsMusic industryIsle of Wight festivalMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2019, the average was below 800,000.Jobs site Indeed recently said graduates in the UK were facingthe toughest job market since 2018as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs.Healthcare and teaching continue to be among the hardest-hit areas of the labour market, with vacancies in the health sector down by 6.7% after a fall of more than 10% in July. Teacher vacancies fell by 6.4% in August, while hospitality was down 6.5%.Jobseekers’ prospects also varied significantly depending on where they were in the UK. In the south-west, there were 1.3 people competing for every job, with the south-east registering 1.46.But the picture in the north-east was much tougher. There, 3.36 people battled over each vacancy, followed by 3.25 in Northern Ireland and 3.14 in the West Midlands.Senior figures in the retail and hospitality industries haveraised concerns recently that job seekers face mounting challenges, citing factors including the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and higher costs for employers after last year’s budget.Unemployment remains at a four-year high of 4.7%, while Adzuna’s figures showed that the average number of job seekers per vacancy across the UK has risen slightly from 1.93 to 2.Overall, the number of available positions fell to 846,567 in August, 2.1% below both the figure registered in the previous month and 1.3% below the same month of last year.The year-on-year fall ended a five-month run in which the number of vacancies had risen year on year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, warehouse worker positions climbed to the top of the rankings.The fastest increase in vacancies came in the domestic help and cleaning sector, up 6.8%, followed by human resources and recruitment (5.1%) and retail (3.7%).Andrew Hunted, Adzuna’s co-founder, said the appetite for hiring was “uneven and increasingly shaped by a mix of sector-specific swings and the growing role of AI within the UK labour market”.He added: “It’s a reminder that the market is still finding its balance as emerging technologies, shifting skills demand, and macro-economic conditions continue to redefine where and how employers are hiring.”The average time to fill a role reached 37.3 days in August, almost a day longer than the previous month’s 36.3 days.Hospitality and catering roles were filled almost a week faster than the previous month, averaging 31.9 days compared with 38.4 days, while IT roles slowed sharply, taking 50 days compared with 40.3 days the month before.Employers also dialled down transparency over what prospective candidates would be paid. In August, 43.9% of job ads included pay details, down from 45% in July, reversing recent improvements seen earlier in the summer.Explore more on these topicsWork & careersHealthcare industryUK unemployment and employment statisticsUnemploymentJob huntingCouriers/delivery industryTeachingnewsShareReuse this content"

A consultation will be launched later this year.The proposals will be seen as a direct response to Nigel Farage’s announcement last week that Reform would scrap ILR for non-EU citizens and bar them from claiming benefits, including those who have already been granted the status. On Sunday Keir Starmer attacked Farage’s plans as“racist” and “immoral”.Labour said there was a clear dividing line between the government’s proposals and Reform UK’s pledge to scrap settled status for all people from outside the EU.At present, “indefinite leave to remain” is usually granted after five years when basic conditions are met. It is a key route to gaining British citizenship and allows people to claim benefits.In the immigration white paper published in May, the government announced that this standard qualifying period would be changed to a baseline of 10 years.Mahmood will set out a series of proposed conditions for gaining ILR including being in work, not taking any benefits payments, learning English “to a high standard”, having a “spotless criminal record” and giving back to local communities.Details will be developed in a consultation, but Mahmood is likely to want to set a low bar on which criminal offences have a bearing on ILR qualification, while excluding motoring offences.Some crimes would result in automatic disqualification while others could result in a penalty in terms of additional years before ILR is granted, sources said.Starmer calling Reform immigration policy ‘racist’ is the start of a risky wider argumentRead moreMahmood believes that after living in the UK for several years, the standard of English of people seeking ILR should be high.Some, based on their contribution or skills, could be granted settlement earlier, she will say. Others who have made a lesser contribution will only be given ILR later, or not at all.Mahmood will say she will be a “toughLabourhome secretary, fighting for a vision of this country that is distinctly our own”.Addressing fears among Labour members that Starmer’s party should not attempt to take on Reform’s hard-right policies, she will warn that if the government does not succeed, “working people will turn away from us – the party that for over a hundred years has been their party – and seek solace in the false promises of Farage”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials in No 10 and in Mahmood’s office believe the Reform leader made a strategic mistake in saying last week that people who have already been granted ILR would have to reapply for new visas with tougher rules, a policy they believe would be unpopular and unfair.Mahmood, in a personal section of the speech, will touch on her parents’ experience arriving in the UK, and why the acceptance of migrants depends on their contribution to local communities. She will talk about her own experiences as a victim of shoplifting while working behind the till of her family’s corner shop as a child, and why that inspired her to crack down on street-level crime.Reform said it would abolish ILR and require people to reapply for visas every five years. That would include hundreds of thousands of those who are already in the UK. Applicants would also have to meet certain criteria, including a higher salary threshold and standard of English.The Conservatives plan to ban those arriving from settling indefinitely in the UK if they claim benefits or social housing, or have a criminal record.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said Labour’s plans to penalise those who claimed benefits risked building more barriers for refugees.“We know that refugees want to feel part of, and give back to, the country that has provided them with safety,” he said. “It is much harder for a refugee to find their feet straight away without relying on benefits at all – especially if they have been given less than 30 days to find somewhere to live. Almost all people seeking asylum are not allowed to work and are forced to rely on state support.“By punishing refugees for needing help, we are saying to them that no matter how hard you work in the future, you’ll never have a safe permanent home in Britain. This is the opposite of encouraging integration.”A YouGov MRP polling projection released on Friday, based on a sample of 13,000 people taken over the last three weeks, suggested a general election would result in a hung parliament, with Reform UK winning 311 of the 650 seats, 15 short of the 326 required for a majority.Explore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025Shabana MahmoodImmigration and asylumLabourReform UKNigel FarageHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

One in seven primary schools in the UK do not have a library, according to the National Literacy Trust, rising to one in four for disadvantaged areas.Children’s authors including Cressida Cowell and the Gruffalo illustrator, Axel Scheffler, welcomed the scheme. “A school library is more than just a room full of books,” Scheffler said. “It’s a place where imaginations grow, confidence builds, and a lifelong love of reading takes root.”Reeves, for whom educational opportunity is a personal priority, will make the announcement in her speech to theLabourparty conference, where she will also unveil plans to get thousands of young people back into work.Young people on universal credit who have been out of work or education for 18 months will be guaranteed an offer of paid work. “I can commit this government to nothing less than the abolition of long-term youth unemployment,” she will say.Claimants will face sanctions such as losing their benefits, however, if they refuse to take up jobs under the scheme without a reasonable excuse. It has echoes ofGeorge Osborne’s “workfare” schemein 2013, which brought in tighter benefits sanctions.The chancellor will make the case in her speech for a society founded on “contribution”.She will say: “I believe in a Britain founded on contribution, where we do our duty for each other, and where hard work is matched by fair reward. I believe in a Britain based on opportunity, where ordinary kids can flourish, unhindered by their background.”The focus on “contribution” comes amid concerns among some in Labour that the government needs to offer voters a clearer vision of its agenda.Keir Starmer told the BBC on Sunday that he hoped that by the end of the conference, people “can’t say they don’t know what we stand for, what this government is trying to achieve”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will not stand by while a generation is consigned to benefits almost before they’ve begun.“We will not accept that school pupils full of promise become adults full of frustration. We cannot, we will not, allow wasted talent to become Britain’s story. The youth guarantee is how we will offer every young person a chance to get up and get on.”Reeves is expected to place strong emphasis on economic responsibility in her speech, despite pressure from some in the party to rethink her fiscal rules. Labour sources suggested, however, that she was unlikely to start rolling the pitch for inevitable tax rises at the budget.The chancellor faces the prospect of having to find up to £30bn in tax rises or spending cuts on 26 November if, as expected, the Office for Budget Responsibility cuts its forecast for future productivity growth to match the consensus of other experts.Explore more on these topicsLabour conferenceLabourRachel ReevesEducation policyPrimary schoolsUnemploymentEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field,” Mamdani said. “But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too. And we beat you by 13 points. Looking forward to doing it again on November fourth.”Earlier on Sunday, Mamdaniposted videoon Instagram of an influential Black pastor welcoming him to address the congregation of a Black Christian megachurch in East New York earlier this month. The pastor, A R Bernard, pointed out to congregants that, if elected, Mamdani would not be the first democratic socialist mayor of the city, since the late David Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor, was also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.Sliwa, the Republican nominee, said last week that he had turned down multiple offers of millions of dollars to end his own campaign.Recent polls of the four-way contest have shownMamdani leading Cuomoby more than 20 points, with Sliwa and Adams far behind. When pollsters asked likely voters for their preferences in a race without Adams, Mamdani still led Cuomo by a double-digit margin.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkEric AdamsUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The post on Sunday morning came after Saturday night protests and arrests at an immigration detention center in Broadview, Illinois.For the preceding few days, federal officials havearrested protestersat the Broadview facility asIce operationshave escalated in Illinois.Durbin, along withIllinoisrepresentative Delia Ramirez and other Democrats, have been pressing for a congressional oversight visit to the Broadview facility for weeks in connection with reports of poor conditions.Chicago organizers say city needs support, not politicalization by Trump: ‘This is not a serious solution’Read moreAccording to a letter written by Durbin and Ramirez on Friday, Democratic members of Congress have been unable to access the Broadview facility nor meet with immigration officials, as they have requested.Durbin and Ramirez informed Ice earlier in September of an upcoming oversight visit to the facility, which members of congress are allowed to do. But Ice in Chicago told Durbin and Ramirez they were “unable to support a visit”, according to the letter, and instead offered a meeting to the Democratic delegation. Ice on Fridaypostponed that meeting“to an unconfirmed date in October”, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.The Democratic pressure on Ice comes as protesters have clashed with officials at the Broadview site in recent days. On Saturday night, officials deployed pepper spray and rubber bullets and arrested a number of protesters outside the controversial immigration jail.In onevideo posted onlineon Saturday night, US border patrol officials, who have been dispatched to the area to assist in the Ice operations, can be seen deploying what is colloquially referred to as teargas on protesters standing outside the facility.On Sunday afternoon, a CBSChicagoreporter posted on Instagram that an Ice official “took a direct shot” at her car, saying that the official deployed gas into her open window. “Been puking for two hours,” the reporter said, adding that there were no protesters at the time and that she was just driving by the facility to check out the scene.Another local reporter in Chicagoposted on Xthat the village of Broadview has opened a criminal investigation into that matter.View image in fullscreenDick Durbin speaks at the Capitol in Washington DC on 16 September.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThe Trump administration has called the protesters “rioters”, accusing them of inciting violence. On Saturday afternoon, Icepostedon X: “Rioters will not deter Ice from its law enforcement mission. All those assaulting or obstructing will be held accountable. Full stop.” In anotherposton Sunday morning, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said 11 people were arrested outside the Ice facility – and that officials had confiscated two guns during the arrests.In response, the Illinois governor,JB Pritzker, decried the force used by federal officials at the site. He also called on protesters and bystanders to “document what you see with your phones and cameras”.“The suggestion that chemical agents like tear gas or pepper spray could be used indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators, or even first responders, is unacceptable and not normal,” Pritzkerpostedon X. “By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.”Tensions in the Chicago area have been escalating in recent weeks after the Trump administration and DHSlaunchedan operation they dubbed Midway Blitz. The operation led to an increase in the number of federal officials in the area targeting immigrants.Federal agents use teargas and pepper balls to break up Chicago Ice protestRead moreAlready, the operation has led to a number ofscandalsfor Ice and the Trump administration.

When that mission is taken away, when they’re scapegoated, when their job security is uncertain, and when their tiny semblance of work-life balance is stripped away, they leave,” a longtime employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) told the Guardian. “That’s why I left.”The total resignation program is set to cost$14.8bn, with 200,000 workers paid their full salary and benefits while on administrative leave for up to eight months, according to a Senate Democrats’ report in July.Trump officials argue this outlay is worth it. The Office of Personnel Management claimed the one-time costs lower longer-term spending by the federal government. It also criticized job protections of federal civil servants,claimingthe government should have a “modern, at-will employment framework like most employers”.A spokesperson for the White House claimed there was “no additional cost to the government” as employees would have received their salaries regardless of the program. “In fact, this is the largest and most effective workforce reduction plan in history and will save the government $28bn annually,” they added.The total number of expected departures through the delayed resignation and voluntary separation programs, attrition, and early retirement programs is about 275,000 employees, the spokesman said.Several thousands of additional federal workers have been fired as part of reduction in force mandates ordered by the administration. The mass exodus is thelargestsingle-year decline in civilian federal employment since the second world war.Federal employees who took the deferred resignation offer requested to speak anonymously in hopes of returning to the federal government in the future and to protect future job prospects.They are entering alagging job marketas the unemployment rate in August 2025 ticked up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021, and only 22,000 jobs were added amid disruptions and uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs.“It’s a huge grieving process,” said a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee who took the deferred resignation offer. “Myself and many others that I know really hoped that we would finish our careers with the government. We felt very tied, especially in the VA, to the mission.“Many of us thought we could do better for our clients, for our veterans outside of the VA, and a lot of us were so burnt out from the six months before the deferred resignation that it was actually a mental health decision for many as well.”Communicating why they left has been challenging while searching for a new job, the VA employee said. “The job market stinks right now,” they said. “It’s great to not be working 60 to 70 hours a week any more, but you also lose your support system from those that stayed, and from those that may judge you for leaving.”An archaeologist at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and military veteran, said they “loved” their job, but took the deferred resignation out of fear and pressure from the administration. “I was forced to accept the resignation plan. “Not physically, or through any legal means, but through fear and intimidation,” they said.They citedcommentsfrom Russell Vought, Trump’s head of the Office of Management and Budget, who said of federal workers last October: “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down … We want to put them in trauma.”“This is exactly what happened,” the USDA worker said. “I was scared to go to work. Scared that the next day would be the day I would get fired, or barred from future service, scared I would wait too long to leave and not find a job, and just living everyday like a raw nerve.”The public vilification of federal workers has pushed many to take the resignation program, the archaeologist suggested, as they were constantly inundated with threats of cuts and firings.Another employee at the US Department of Agriculture was fired in February as a probationary employee, reinstated in April only to take the deferred resignation offer.“At that point, I felt they could terminate me at any time,” they told the Guardian. “It’s hard to focus on your work when they can just send you an email and you can be gone, and they completely changed the terms of my work. I was hoping things would stabilize and there would be an opportunity to go back, but now it doesn’t look like there will be an opportunity.”The American Federation of Government Employees and other labor unions representing federal workersfiled a lawsuitthat isstill ongoingover the deferred resignation program earlier this year, alleging the buyout circumvents congressional authority, undermines statutorily required functions of government agencies in losing employees en masse, and was enacted with the threat of firings.“Purging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,” said AFGE president Everett Kelley in February. “This offer should not be viewed as voluntary.“Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration’s goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS economyUS unemployment and employment dataUS politicsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

More than half of young US consumers claimed in onesurveythat they hadn’t touched alcohol in six months.But they’re not turning away from wine, industry leaders insist: just drinking it differently.The focus is on less strength, and more flavor, according to Lily Taggart, 21, aNew YorkCity chef. “It’s hard to forge connections if you’re drinking high [alcohol by volume] ABV and can’t remember conversations the next day.”“Gen Z is taking the pretentiousness of wine away and it’s all about intentionality over status,” she said. “There is this European shift of sipping a drink, bonding with friends and wanting more authentic connections.”According toresearchby IWSR, a drinks industry data provider, Gen Z is gravitating toward sustainable, natural wines and embracing innovative styles like chilled reds and orange wines. They want bottles that are fun, more sessionable and easier to enjoy in social settings.“This young consumer doesn’t want to get hammered,” said Steve Riboli, president and CEO of the Stella Rosa wine label. “They want to be able to socialize for five hours.”Stella Rosa’s lineup spans from black cherry and strawberry to more adventurous flavors like pineapple chili and watermelon chili.When the label noticed Gen Z’s predilection towards cocktails, Riboli explained, it launched Spritz Del Conte: a ready-made Aperitif cocktail label.Much of the traditional wine industry seems out-of-reach and too “elitist” for this generation, Taggart said. “The whole white tablecloth [culture] of wine is really expensive, and the language feels really inaccessible,” she said. “If you can describe flavors you’re interested in food, I think you can describe flavors you’re interested in wine. But I still think people are scared to.”The Brooklyn wine bar Sauced has become a Gen Z favorite, with a rustic lowkey vibe, natural wines and nonalcoholic offerings – and no need to know the difference between tannins and terroir. With no menu, patrons simply tell the waiters the vibe or tastes they would like, and receive a personalized recommendation.“You don’t need to speak the language of wine to go to Sauced,” said Mira Hobbs, 26, founder of On CloudWine, a New York–based wine social club. “It makes wine feel fun and intuitive, not intimidating.”Wine clubs like On Cloud,ChardonngayandWine for Meare cropping up across the city, geared around this younger wine culture. Their common goal: making wine approachable, fun and social.Kristin Olszewski, founder of wine label Nomadica, noticed Gen Z’s different habits when she was a sommelier at Michelin-starred restaurants. “Young consumers would come in the restaurant and drink so much orange wine and chilled red, and I asked them why,” she said.“The answer was always ‘I don’t need to know anything about orange wine to enjoy it’,” Olszewski added. “The grape riddles between different reds and different whites are confusing so orange wine feels less pretentious, but still high quality and fun.”Nomadica specializes in canned and boxed wine. Its range – which includes the classics, along with an orange wine and a Rose Yuzu spritz – is zero-sugar and low calorie. A QR code on the packaging brings consumers to a playlist curated to set a complementary mood.“I wanted to invite the [consumer] into the wine world,” Olszewski said. “A major misconception is that Gen Z and younger millennials don’t care, but they actually care so much and they’re so interested to learn more. They just don’t want to be talked down to.”Nomadica has branched out into different spaces to reach younger consumers, engaging Gen Z on social media, at music festivals and organic markets like Whole Foods.Price point is also important, according to Olszewski “It’s all about making wine more accessible and a ‘good-for-you’ wine that fits in this generation’s health conscious mindset,” she said.Take Hoxie Spritzer: a low ABV, no added sugar, sustainable wine-based beverage. Josh Rosenstein, its founder, wanted to create a spritz that consumers found “easy to drink while being social, and still being able to go on a run the next morning”.Hoxie has tried to develop intriguing flavors, mixing a familiar taste like grapefruit and a unique ingredient like elderflower. Gen Z wants “an experience,” suggested Rosenstein. “By drinking Hoxie with your friends, I want you to feel like you’ve gone on vacation in St Tropez or by a lakeside in upstate New York.”Times are changing, according to Rosenstein and Olszewski, who say the traditional wine industry needs to adapt to the tastes and values of this new era of wine drinkers, rather than cling to the established wine culture.For Taggart, Gen Z is redefining what a wine drinker is. “Before I thought a wine drinker would be like my grandma [with a] dark red. It felt like you had to be either old or really rich to enjoy,” she said. “Now, I think of someone young and hip, like [someone who] lives in Brooklyn and has patchwork tattoos.”Explore more on these topicsWineFoodNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two miserly points from 11 matches. So easy to say, much harder to actually accomplish. Anybody in any doubt about that need only askLuke Donald.ARyder Cupbroke out under the blaring sun at Bethpage Black on Sunday. The competitive spirit summoned by the United States of America ultimately was not enough to rip the 17-inch trophy back from Europe’s grasp but wow, did they give Donald and his players a shuddering fright. A singles session that started with the visitors eyeing a procession and record breaking was dominated by Keegan Bradley’s US team. Donald surely feared one of the worst sporting capitulations of our time. How would they recover? How would Europe’s golfers ever recover?Ryder Cup 2025: USA 12-14 Europe as Lowry helps visitors retain trophy after epic singles finale – liveRead moreThey have been spared that nightmare. It was notRory McIlroy, Justin Rose or Tommy Fleetwood who carried Europe over the line at Bethpage. Instead, Donald and his players collapsed in an exhausted heap as Shane Lowry holed out from 6ft on the final green of match eight to ensure at least a draw. The record books will show a European win, 15-13. They will not depict the breathlessness.For Lowry, this was as epic a moment as when he won the 2019 Open Championship. A golfing continent exhaled as Lowry danced across the putting surface with unbridled joy. “That was the hardest couple of hours of my whole life,” a tearful Lowry said. “ I can’t believe that putt went in. The Ryder Cup means everything to me.”How precarious this situation was can be explained by the fact that when Lowry took to the 18th tee, Europe held no lead in the four games left on the course. The Irishman was one down. Russell Henley hit a glorious bunker shot to set up a chance of sealing his point. Henley, incredibly, left his putt short. Cometh the hour, cometh the Offaly man.This was, eventually, a triumph for Donald’s diligence and planning. It should also, though, serve as a reference point for spectator behaviour. Too much of what transpired in New York, largely towards the visiting team, should never be seen at a Ryder Cup again.Golfshould be proud of its failure to embrace a yobbish culture. It should recoil at the abuse dished out to Europe as they rampaged towards victory. Adare Manor in 2027 has to and surely will be totally different. McIlroy’s defeat by Scottie Scheffler was due in no small part to the mental exhaustion suffered by the Masters champion. The treatment of McIlroy over three days here was disgraceful.View image in fullscreenEurope captain Luke Donald celebrates after Tyrrell Hatton halves his match on the 18th hole during the singles to win the Ryder Cup.Photograph: Paul Childs/ReutersThere was an on-course ruckus to add to the mix. Bradley became irritated by the drop given to Rose – or the time taken to decide on it – on the 13th, the Englishman’s second shot to the par five having found a road. After a delay of about 15 minutes, with Bradley still chuntering in the ear of a referee, Rose played from scrubland at the back of a spectator stand; quite wonderfully, as it transpired. Rose’s shot finished within 6ft of the hole, from where he converted to pull one back against Cameron Young. As Rose won the 14th as well, Young’s lead was suddenly under threat. Bradley continued to mump and moan. Young lightened his captain’s mood with an 11ft putt on the final green to snatch a point from game one.Justin Thomas backed up Young by seeing off Fleetwood, again on the last. Bryson DeChambeau had been five down after seven to Matt Fitzpatrick but rescued half a point. “I love my country,” said DeChambeau, in typically understated fashion. Scheffler’s game with McIlroy also went the distance, the world No 1 signing off from what was overall a disappointing tournament on a high.“This has been a really special team and it’s been a lot of fun,” Scheffler said. He is, however, clearly far more at home in individual battle. Light relief for Donald was supplied by Ludvig Åberg, who beat Patrick Cantlay 2&1. Half a point needed. Half a point!Red was added to the leaderboard by Xander Schauffele, who defeated Jon Rahm, and JJ Spaun’s success over Sepp Straka. Europe were now firmly in squeaky bum territory. Rasmus Højgaard was struggling against Ben Griffin in the battle of the Ryder Cup rookies and Tyrrell Hatton was locked in a tense battle against Collin Morikawa. Could match 11 of 11, where Robert MacIntyre was taking on Sam Burns, really be pivotal? Lowry ended that notion. Griffin prevailed, Hatton halved with Morikawa, before Burns three-putted the last for the same result. Europe won just one singles game to the US half-dozen.Europe’s Sunday task had been simplified further by the removal of Viktor Hovland from the singles because of a neck injury. In what was a rare example of the Ryder Cup’s envelope rule, the US player pre-determined by Bradley to sit out in a scenario such as this was revealed as Harris English. Both teams took half a point. In keeping with the tone of this competition, US fans heckled Hovland as he watched his teammates from the fairways. And, one assumes, between his fingernails.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupLuke DonaldRory McIlroyJustin RoseUS sportsGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

But, until the thrilling denouement, the lasting memory of this Ryder Cup threatened not to be a single swing of the club so much as the ugly backdrop: galleries that drifted from partisan into venomous and the organizers who let the line slide until it snapped.It didn’t happen all at once. For the first day and a half of golf’s most intense rivalry, it was New York-loud without being unruly. Then Saturday afternoon arrived and the tenor shifted.Rory McIlroy, the visiting lightning rod, kept stepping off shots as volleys of abuse landed in the quiet of his pre-shot routine. Shane Lowry played teammate and minder. Justin Thomas, not exactly a shrinking violet, began shushing his own end of the grandstand so his opponents could putt.Ryder Cup MC apologises and steps down over foul-mouthed McIlroy chantRead moreThere’s a difference between atmosphere and interference, and Bethpage spent too much of the weekend blurring the two. Boos during practice swings and the sing-song “YEW-ESS-AY! YEW-ESS-AY!” after a European miss were tiresome, but survivable. What crept in on Saturday was different: insults aimed at players’ wives, homophobic slurs, cheap shots at McIlroy’s nationality dripping with tiresome stereotypes, gleeful reminders of Pinehurst the moment McIlroy crouched over anything inside five feet.Europe answered with performance. So much for home advantage: for two years the Bethpage sales pitch was the snarling, uniquely American cauldron that would rattle Europe. Message received, but the idiots took it literally. Add the optics of Donald Trump’s fly-in on Friday – fist bumps, photo-ops, galleries dotted with Maga hats and a certain politics of humiliation playing to its base – and the swagger slid easily into license. That doesn’t make the Ryder Cup a referendum. It does explain how quickly the rope line starts to feel like a boundary you’re invited to test.1:53Next one will be a ‘little bit nicer’, says Lowry after sinking putt to retain Ryder Cup – videoGiven the guest of honor’s well-known aversion to losing gracefully, it was hardly a shock that the worst behavior broke out just as America’s chances were slipping away. But the tournament’s response to the ugly crowd conduct on Saturday was woeful. Extra security and a phalanx of New York state troopers materialized around McIlroy’s match at the turn. A couple of spectators were ejected near the main grandstands. The PGA of America said it bolstered policing and pushed more frequent spectator etiquette messages on the big screens. Fine, as far as it goes. But once a thousand people have decided a backswing is their cue, you can’t manage it with a graphic and a frown. Enforcement has to be swift, visible and consequential or it becomes permission by another name.Sunday brought a tacit admission that the line had been crossed. The first-tee master of ceremonies, the comedian Heather McMahan, stepped down from her role after videoshowed her leading a chantof “Fuck you Rory!” on Saturday morning. The PGAannounced her departureand apology before the singles. If the MC is amplifying the worst instincts in the building, that’s not “energy”; it’s an institutional failure.Luke Donald chose his words carefully as he praised his team’s “anti-fragile” temperament and drew a firm boundary between “raucous” and “personal”. Keegan Bradley, the USA captain, bristled at any suggestion the US room had licensed the excess. Hecalled the fans passionateand pointed – not incorrectly – to his team’s flat play as a trigger for their restlessness. But that defense only goes so far. You can be partisan without being toxic. You can fill a grandstand without emptying your standards.It’s also true that many Americans tried to keep the thing on the rails. Thomas kept waving for hush. Cameron Young never took the bait. Plenty of fans actually supported their own rather than savaging the other lot. Too often, though, they were drowned out by the performative tough guys in flag suits and plastic chains who treat theRyder Cuplike a tailgate with better lawn care.But framing Bethpage as a one-off misses the larger point. What happened here didn’t invent the tone of American life so much as reflect what’s been an incremental breakdown in public behavior. The country now lives in all-caps, from school-board meetings that sound like street rallies and comment sections that have spilled into the street. The algorithm bankrolls outrage, the put-down is political vernacular and the culture applauds “saying the quiet part out loud”. In 2025 you can say almost anything in public and be cheered for it (unless you’re Jimmy Kimmel). Put a rope line and a microphone in front of that mix and you get exactly what you got at the Ryder Cup: people testing boundaries not because the moment needs them to, but because they’ve been told volume is virtue. Some might argue golf, in the US particularly, has always been a sport for white conservatives, but it’s hard to remember galleries calling opposing players “faggots” and openly deriding their wives until recently. What could have changed?Europe didn’t need rescuing. They rescued themselves. That could be seen on Saturday, when McIlroy and Lowry won their afternoon match two up in the eye of the storm. Rose and Fleetwood then dispatched Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau 3&2 after a tense exchange about who had the stage; then they took the stage and won. Donald’s players came to New York expecting a test of nerve and got it at full blast.Sunday gave us a memorable finish. But this week will also be remembered for the noise that wasn’t passion, the hostility that wasn’t edge and the adults who mistook the difference. Next time the Cup crosses the Atlantic, at Hazeltine in 2029, whether during Trump’s third term or not, the hosts will have a choice to make about what kind of event they want to run – and what kind of country they want it to reflect.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfUS sportsDonald TrumpRory McIlroyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cooper Rush played the rest of the way for the Ravens, who suddenly find themselves in a dire situation just four weeks into the season. Only five teams in the 14-team playoff era have started 1-3 and made the postseason.Los Angeles Chargers 18-21 New York GiantsJaxson Dart shone in his NFL starting debut, leading theNew York Giantsto victory over the previously undefeated Los Angeles Chargers (3-1). Dart threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score, helping the Giants (1-3) secure their first win of the season. The excitement was tempered by an injury to wide receiver Malik Nabers, who was carted off with a knee injury in the second quarter. The Giants’ defense also played a crucial role, with Brian Burns sacking Justin Herbert late in the game.Indianapolis Colts 20–27 Los Angeles RamsTutu Atwell caught an 88-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford with 1:33 to play, and the Los Angeles Rams (3-1) rallied to end the Indianapolis Colts’ unbeaten start. Daniel Jones passed for 262 yards for the Colts (3-1), but Indy couldn’t overcome receiver Adonai Mitchell’s mind-boggling fumble right before he crossed the goalline with what should have been a 76-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter. Stafford passed for 375 yards and three touchdowns for the Rams.New Orleans Saints 19-31 Buffalo BillsJosh Allen threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score, and the Buffalo Bills (4-0) shook off a sloppy first three quarters to stay undefeated, beating the winless New Orleans Saints (0-4). James Cook had 117 yards rushing and a touchdown in a game that wasn’t decided until midway through the fourth quarter. The Bills never trailed, but were clinging to a 21-19 lead when Allen hit a wide-open Dalton Kincaid for a 28-yard touchdown pass with 7:07 left. The five-time defending AFC East champion Bills are 4-0 for the 10th time in team history and first since 2020. The Saints are 0-4 for the first time since 2012.Steelers beat Vikings in Dublin after Pittsburgh’s Thompson injured in robberyRead moreCleveland Browns 10–34 Detroit LionsJared Goff threw two touchdown passes to Amon-Ra St Brown, Kalif Raymond returned a punt 65 yards for another score and the Detroit Lions beat the Cleveland Browns. The Lions (3-1) took advantage of Joe Flacco’s two interceptions in the first half and scored 20 straight points, giving them a 13-point lead at halftime. Detroit forced Flacco to fumble in the fourth, setting up another touchdown. The Browns (1-3) opened with an 88-yard, 13-play touchdown drive, then had 44 yards with three punts and two turnovers the rest of the half.Philadelphia Eagles 31–25 Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe Philadelphia Eagles (4-0) used a fake tush push, another special teams touchdown and a late defensive stop to stay undefeated. Jalen Hurts tossed two touchdown passes, Sydney Brown returned a blocked punt for a score and the Eagles beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-1) for their 20th victory in 21 games. The only loss in that span for the reigning Super Bowl champions was against Washington last December in a game Hurts left with a concussion in the first half. Chase McLaughlin’s 65-yard field goal for Tampa Bay on the final play of the first half was the longest inNFLhistory in an outdoor stadium.Jacksonville Jaguars 26-21 San Francisco 49ersParker Washington scored Jacksonville’s first punt return touchdown in eight seasons, leading the Jaguars to victory over the San Francisco 49ers (3-1). The Jaguars’ defense delivered four takeaways, including a strip-sack by Arik Armstead that sealed the win. Jacksonville (3-1) have generated at least three takeaways in all four games this season. They turned those into 17 points against the 49ers, highlighted by Travis Etienne’s 48-yard run. Trevor Lawrence threw a four-yard TD pass to Hunter Long, helping the Jaguars achieve just their second 3-1 start in the past 18 seasons.Chicago Bears 25–24 Las Vegas RaidersJosh Blackwell blocked a 54-year-old field-goal attempt by Daniel Carlson in the final minute to preserve a fourth-quarter rally led by Caleb Williams, and the Chicago Bears stunned the Las Vegas Raiders. After D’Andre Swift’s touchdown run with 1:34 left put the Bears (2-2) in front, Geno Smith led the Raiders into position for Carlson’s kick with 38 seconds left. Blackwell came in nearly untouched from the left side, dived and deflected the ball. Chicago had four takeaways for the second game in a row, including three interceptions of Geno Smith. The Raiders (1-3) have lost three straight.Minnesota Vikings 21-24 Pittsburgh SteelersKenneth Gainwell ran for 99 yards and two touchdowns and the Pittsburgh Steelers held on to beat the Minnesota Vikings (2-2) in Ireland’s first regular-season NFL game. DK Metcalf had five catches for 126 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown for the Steelers, who improved to 3-1 going into their bye week.

It’s the third time the Texans have shut out a team and the first time since blanking the Titans 29-0 in 2010. The Titans were shut out for the first time since a 16-0 loss at Denver in 2019. CJ Stroud threw for 233 yards and two touchdowns as the Texans scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter Sunday to put the game away and match their TD total in the previous three games combined.Washington Commanders 27–34 Atlanta FalconsMichael Penix Jr. bounced back from his worst NFL start, Bijan Robinson had a career-high 181 yards from scrimmage and the Atlanta Falcons beat the short-handed Washington Commanders. The Falcons were coming off a 30-0 loss to the Panthers in which Penix and the offense were totally ineffective. Against the Commanders, Penix completed 20 of 26 passes for a career-high 313 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Robinson had 75 rushing yards on 17 carries and four catches for 106 yards. Marcus Mariota threw two TD passes for the Commanders, who were missing starting quarterback Jayden Daniels and top receiver Terry McLaurin. Both teams are 2-2 this season.Carolina Panthers 13–42 New England PatriotsMarcus Jones had an 87-yard punt return for a touchdown, Drake Maye added two touchdown passes and ran for another, and the New England Patriots (2-2) rolled to a 42-13 win over the Carolina Panthers (1-3). TreVeyon Henderson and Antonio Gibson added touchdown runs and Jones had a 61-yard punt return that set up another TD to help the Patriots avoid their fifth straight 1-3 start.

That was the only thing manager Carlos Mendoza’s fading team could still control in their bid to reach the postseason. But those hopes dissipated in one decisive inning.New York could not overcome a four-run fourth by the Marlins, and the Mets were eliminated from the playoff field with a 4-0 loss.“Pissed, sad, frustrated – you name it,” Mendoza said when asked how he felt about the end of his team’s season.The Mets missed the postseason a year after reaching the National League Championship Series and after holding the best record in the majors in mid-June – a stunning collapse for the star-studded club with a major league-high $322.6m payroll on opening day.The robots are (almost) coming: MLB players allowed to challenge balls and strikes in 2026Read moreNew York’s loss meant the Cincinnati Reds earned the final NL wildcard spot despite falling to the Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 on Sunday.The Reds and Mets entered the day with the same record, but because Cincinnati owned the head-to-head tiebreaker – the Reds won four of six meetings with New York this season – they’re heading to the playoffs for the first time since 2020.Mendoza had been adamant during the series in Miami that the Mets put themselves in that position with their poor second half of the regular season.New York had the best record in the majors at 45-24 – a season-high 21 games over .500 – after beating Washington 4-3 at home on 12 June.But starter Kodai Senga injured his hamstring in that game, which seemed to mark a turning point in the Mets’ season. They lost their next seven games and 10 of the next 11. Unable to overcome a series of pitching woes, they went 38-55 the rest of the way.View image in fullscreenA disgruntled Mets fan makes his feelings clear after Sunday’s game.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APThe collapse was an all-too-familiar outcome for many Mets fans, who endured similar endings in 2007 and 2008.In 2007, New York failed to hold a seven-game division lead with 17 games left in the season, and in 2008, they wasted a 3.5-game advantage with 17 games remaining. Their playoff fate then was also pushed to the last game of the season, when losses to the Marlins ended their hopes.“It’s a failure,” star outfielder Juan Soto said. “Anytime you don’t make it to the playoffs or win a championship, it’s a failure. That’s how we’re going to look at it, and that’s how we’re going to go through things in the offseason.”It was also a reversal from last season, when the Mets got into the postseason as a wildcard on a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Arizona Diamondbacks. New York then knocked Milwaukee out of the playoffs with a thrilling comeback in the decisive Game 3 of their NL Wild Card Series.Before a sellout crowd Sunday of 34,660 that included plenty of New York fans, the Mets were in position to mount a comeback in the fifth when they loaded the bases with two outs on three walks. But Pete Alonso lined out to left field, and that was New York’s best threat.With runners on first and second in the eighth, Francisco Alvarez struck out to end the inning and snapped the bat over his knee in frustration as many Mets fans headed for the exits.MLB wildcard seriesAmerican League:Detroit Tigers v Cleveland Guardians; Boston Red Sox v New York Yankees.National League:San Diego Padres v Chicago Cubs; Los Angeles Dodgers v Cincinnati Reds.Explore more on these topicsNew York MetsBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He departed for Real Sociedad without offering ­Tynesiders more than a few glimpses of his best work but, when Merino trotted on as a 70th-minuteArsenalsubstitute here, Eddie Howe had reason to be fearful.At that stage Newcastle were ­leading thanks to Nick Woltemade’s second goal for the club but their manager did not need telling that Mikel Arteta’s reincarnation of Merino as an emergency forward last season proved one of the triumphs of his north London tenure.Arsenal stare down their Newcastle demons and a VAR curiosity to make title statement | Jonathan WilsonRead moreSure enough, the newcomer soon jogged a few memories. Seven years after leaving Newcastle, his headed equaliser not only showed ­Arsenal’s expensive new striker ­Viktor ­Gyökeres precisely how to make a penalty area impact but reminded locals of what might have been.Moreover Merino’s goal ­created the springboard for the 96th-minute ­winner from Gabriel that, in ­ending Arsenals’s run of three straight defeats at St James’ Park, went an awful long way to restoring ­Arteta’s hitherto rapidly ­deteriorating humour.Not to mention suggesting that maybe, just maybe, Arsenal are made of the stuff of potential champions after all. An earlier version of Arteta’s team might have surrendered in the face of Newcastle’s ferocious press but, this time, they finally refused to be defeated.If the Spaniard’s knack of making smart substitutions was further emphasised by the late impact of Merino, Martin Ødegaard and Myles Lewis-Skelly, his team’s status as set piece wizards was further reinforced by two goals from corners.View image in fullscreenMikel Merino jumps for joy after scoring Arsenal’s equaliser.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAInitially though it looked as if Nick Pope’s defiance might make it Newcastle’s day. The tone was set when, with Arsenal starting well, the home goalkeeper ­performed wonders to turn Eberechi Eze’s half volley around a post.Pope sound found himself one on one against Gyökeres and, in real time, appeared to have conceded a clear penalty after sending the ­Sweden striker crashing. Yet when VAR intervened and the referee, Jarred Gillett, spent an unusually long time watching the incident on repeat on the pitch-side monitor, doubt crept in.Slow motion replays indicated Pope had got an initial touch on the ball before his intervention inevitably prefaced the collision that brought the forward down. The incident divided opinion but Arteta detected no shades to grey; to say he was aggrieved seems an understatement. Crucially though, his players retained their poise, ­refusing to become distracted by perceived injustice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eze, operating as a No 10, was enjoying plenty of room for manoeuvre.Then Newcastle won a 34th-­minute corner. They played it short with Sandro Tonali exchanging passes with Anthony Gordon before crossing for Woltemade to head in.As David Raya pointed to the fallen Gabriel and complained of a foul from Woltemade in the preamble, Eddie Howe and his assistant Jason Tindall congratulated Martin Mark, their new(ish) set piece coach for a dead ball routine evidently well rehearsed on the training ground. Arteta was left to make a forlorn plea for a VAR review but replays indicated the 6ft 6in Germany striker’s little nudge had been of the lightest touch, most fleeting variety.At this juncture, with a visceral, almost feral, energy rolling down from the stands, Newcastle were pressing their guests into submission and Howe’s decision to start with a back four featuring Dan Burn’s reincarnation as a left-back looked inspired. The only question was how long could Howe’s side keep the relentless pace up? When would they burn out? How long could they shut Eze down for?View image in fullscreenMikel Merino heads home to start Arsenal’s comeback against Newcastle.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesNot for too many more minutes it ­transpired. As the England winger suddenly began ghosting into space again and the crowd grew edgy, ­Newcastle’s lead looked almost ­painfully slender. When Eze ­wrongfooted Howe’s backline and Martín Zubimendi dinked a clever pass towards Jurrien Timber, it took another strong save on Pope’s part to keep the full back’s header out.Howe immediately switched to a back five but that quintet soon required re-­staffing when the England full-back Tino Livramento was carried off in tears after sustaining a nasty looking knee injury.Newcastle’s remodelled ­rearguard certainly had no answer when ­Arsenal played a short corner routine of their own and Declan Rice swung a cross in the direction of Merino who, ­having dodged Sven Botman, directed an unstoppable header past Pope. Although Howe demanded a penalty when Anthony Elanga’s cross struck Gabriel’s arm a VAR review concluded the opposite and the force seemed, almost inexorably, with Arsenal.Confirmation came when, with Arteta having released the handbrake by introducing almost every available visiting attacker, Gabriel struck at the 11th hour. For once even Pope was left wrong footed as the defender headed Ødegaard’s corner home and Arsenal celebrated as if they had just won the title itself.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was an incredible experience and a successful week.”When Pogacar surged on Mount Kigali with 104 km remaining, throwing caution to the wind, the script felt familiar. Only Juan Ayuso of Spain and Mexico’s Isaac Del Toro – both members of Pogacar’s UAE-XRG stable – could initially follow but Ayuso soon cracked and Del Toro was cast adrift 67km from the line, left to watch as Pogacar disappeared up the road for another memorable solo triumph.The 267.5km race marked a historic staging of the championships in Rwanda’s hilly capital, with the punishing circuit, peppered with cobbles, producing relentless climbing. Evenepoel initially showed his frustration as he waited for a bike change after being distanced but soon regrouped to lead the chase.View image in fullscreenRemco Evenepoel kicks a water bottle in frustration as he waits for a replacement bike.Photograph: Zac Williams/SWpix.com/ShutterstockThe Belgian was part of a group that hovered around one minute behind the leader but never managed to close the gap, allowing Pogacar to cap a glittering 2025 season in style.The 27-year-old claimed a fourth Tour de France crown in July, dominating Jonas Vingegaard, and added Spring Classics triumphs at Strade Bianche, the Tour of Flanders, La Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège.With two Monument titles already this year, Pogacar further cemented his versatility across one-day and stage races.

But today the team took our game to a different level and I’m very proud. Newcastle are a terrific team and it’s so difficult to play against them.”Eddie Howe, whose side have won only once in the league this season, described the nature of the last-gasp defeat as “intensely painful” but was most concerned about the second half knee injury sustained by his England full-back Tino Livramento.Although Newcastle’s manager could offer no definitive updates as to Livramento’s condition, he described the sight of the England defender – who, as a Southampton player, was sidelined for a year after suffering with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament – being taken off on a stretcher in evident pain as “really distressing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A nervy Europa League win over Bologna on Thursday offered a slim platform on which to build but this week Unai Emery reiterated thePremier Leagueremains Villa’s priority.The Villa manager informed his players they had to pick up three points and afterwards grinned as he acknowledged that while they are 16th in the Premier League, the table already makes better viewing.Aston Villa 3-1 Fulham: Premier League – live reactionRead moreFulham punished Villa for another flat start with Raúl Jiménez heading in from a corner inside three minutes but Ollie Watkins’ first goal of the season and two strikes across two second-half minutes, courtesy of John McGinn and Emiliano Buendía, earned a comeback victory.“Delighted but relieved,” was how McGinn put it afterwards and the Villa captain was naturally happy for Watkins after the striker ended his dry run. “He always has a spell in the season when it doesn’t quite click for him,” McGinn said. “Hopefully that shuts a few people up.”Prior to his 37th-minute goal, Watkins had had two forgettable touches – as many as Jiménez who was withdrawn nearly half an hour earlier with an injury sustained when he opened the scoring from Sasa Lukic’s corner – and Villa as a team failed to penetrate Fulham. That changed when Lucas Digne pinged a long pass between Calvin Bassey and Joachim Andersen and Watkins spied an opportunity to pounce, deftly looping a bouncing ball over Bernd Leno close to the penalty spot. Bassey charged towards the goalline to clear but his momentum left him tangled in the Fulham net and instead Watkins could finally celebrate his first goal since the second week of May.Now Villa were in their stride, McGinn clipping a breezy pass over the Fulham back line for Morgan Rogers, whose first touch denied him a one on one with Leno. “It is not an easy place to play when the crowd is on your back but then when you get momentum, what a place to play,” McGinn said.View image in fullscreenJohn McGinn scores Aston Villa’s second goal, early in the second half, as they earned a first Premier League win of the season.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesDigne saw a free-kick saved by Leno on the verge of half-time, at which point Emery introduced Buendía in place of the former Fulham midfielder Harvey Elliott, who struggled to impose himself on his first Premier League start for Villa. Emery praised Buendía’s energy and commitment. “He had the possibility to leave [in the summer], but he wanted to stay,” the Villa manager said.Buendía immediately busied himself and had a hand in McGinn’s strike that gained Villa the lead. Lamare Bogarde, preferred to the fit-again Boubacar Kamara at the base of midfield, harried Adama Traoré, who had replaced Jiménez, and then Buendía shifted the ball to McGinn. The Villa captain had eyes only for goal and buried a left-foot shot into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Buendía added another, prodding in after reading Watkins’ cutback from the left. Emery punched the air incessantly, the frustration flooding out with each celebration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traoré located Lukic, whose goal-bound shot was kept out by a desperate Ezri Konsa block.King was outstanding until Watkins’ leveller but was booked for simulation midway through the first half after he sought a penalty having nudged the ball past a panicked Martínez at the end of a scintillating break. King, who was booked for diving against Brentford last weekend in Fulham’s previous league game, appeared to head to ground before Martínez made contact. A minute later a shot was blocked by Matty Cash’s hand, though both Fulham claims were cleared by the video assistant referee, Matt Donohue.A seething Marco Silva was booked for his explicit protests against the referee, Andy Madley, and when asked about the calls afterwards he said: “They [the referees] can write what they want, they can call us and say what they want. I have watched the moments again and for me, they are incredible.” Silva later denied that King’s previous dive may have created a precedent. “They don’t have a story from Josh King in the Premier League, he’s just turned 18.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They knew how to play and it was hard work, but we deserved it,” said theBarcelonacoach Hansi Flick.Mikel Oyarzabal headed wide from Gonçalo Guedes’s pass in the 10th minute as Sociedad looked to capitalise on the rare chances that came their way, while Barcelona controlled the game with 87% possession in the first half.A minute later, the Sociedad keeper Álex Remiro made a diving save to deny Marcus Rashford’s attempt from inside the box, and kept out Roony Bardghji’s left-footed shot in the 24th minute. But Sociedad took the lead on the half-hour mark against the run of play through the former Real Madrid right-back Álvaro Odriozola, who was making his first start of the season after fellow defender Jon Aramburu got injured during the warmup. Ander Barrenetxea beat Koundé in the box and crossed to an unmarked Odriozola, who finished right-footed from the edge of the six-yard box.Barcelona equalised in the 43rd minute as Rashford’s corner found Koundé in the box and the French defender made no mistake with a header.A confident Barcelona pushed for the winner in the second half, and Lamine Yamal made an impact less than a minute after coming on as a substitute. The 18-year-old, who was returning from a groin injury, dribbled past a defender and crossed to Lewandowski, whose header went in off the post in the 58th minute to put the hosts 2-1 up. Lewandowski could have scored again a minute later but shot over the bar from Dani Olmo’s back-heel.Sociedad almost hit back when Aihen Muñoz found Oyarzabal with a through ball, but his shot was tipped over by the goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny. The visitors went close to an equaliser in the 84th minute when Takefusa Kubo’s shot hit the crossbar and a minute later, Lewandowski’s shot at the other end also came off the woodwork.Barcelona, who are on a five-match winning streak in all competitions, host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday, before continuing their LaLiga title defence at Sevilla next Sunday. “It’s good, but it’s a long road ahead … tomorrow we will start focusing all our attention on PSG,” Flick said.Milanheld on for a 2-1 win overNapoliat San Siro to go top of the Serie A standings on goal difference, after Christian Pulisic scored one and created the other before the home side went down to 10 men and conceded a penalty.Napolidropped their first points of the season in a game where Milan looked in control at half-time through goals from Alexis Saelemaekers and Pulisic but Pervis Estupiñán’s red card and Kevin De Bruyne’s penalty almost rescued the visitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[We had a] real upshot of energy in the second half [but] the disappointing part for me was really that energy in the first half, very flat. You’ve got to be there in the duels.“We’re getting beaten too easily in one-twos, on the sides, and we effectively handed the game to them in the first half,” Taylor added after the 2-0 home defeat in St Helens.Liverpool’s German goalkeeper, Rafaela Borggräfe, made her first WSL appearance and started her second consecutive game in all ­competitions, despite being under investigation by the Football ­Association foran alleged racist commentthat was overheard by teammates and staff during pre-season.Borggräfe’s first real involvement in the game was to watch the ball fizz past her as United’s early pressure was rewarded with a fourth-minute opening goal. After good work down the right by Toone, Jess Park’s cross was met by a lethal, first-time left-footed shot from Miyazawa that was struck with precision and power to give the hosts’ goalkeeper no chance.The visitors looked sharper, faster and far more confident in possession as they dominated most of the first 45 minutes, going close to adding a second when another eye-catching Miyazawa effort hit a post. There had also been chances for Jayde Riviere, who swerved a near-post effort wide, and for Julia Zigiotti Olme, who headed wide from ­Melvine Malard’s cross.United doubled their lead just before the interval when Elisabeth Terland’s persistence was rewarded as she won the ball off Gemma Evans and fed Toone, who finished ­clinically, low into the corner.View image in fullscreenElla Toone (right) holds off Gemma Evans to score Manchester United’s second goal.Photograph: Matt McNulty/Getty ImagesMarc Skinner’s team were ­recycling possession very quickly on the rare occasions they did lose the ball, scarcely allowing Liverpool to keep it for more than a few ­seconds, and Skinner said afterwards: “In the first half, we were electric. We blew ­Liverpool away. Second half, I felt we dropped our ­intensity a ­little bit, [we were] probably a ­little too ­comfortable, and I’ve just reminded our players that our ­standards are to keep that level.”Just before the visitors’ second goal, a rare Liverpool attack ended with Ceri Holland’s deflected shot being touched on to a post by the Manchester United goalkeeper ­Phallon Tullis-Joyce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the hosts’ best chance.It has been a difficult and ­sombre week for Liverpool, who are ­mourning the shock death of theirformer manager Matt Beard, aged 47. Their away fixture against Aston Villa last Sunday was postponed.Liverpool had returned to action on Wednesday with an emotional 5-0 win over Sunderland in the League Cup when Beard’s brother, Mark, and his mother, Margaret, were in the stands. On Sunday, Beard’s wife, ­Debbie, was present. A ­fundraising page for Beard’s family, ­organised by the broadcaster Jacqui Oatley, has so far raised more than £52,000.On the pitch, there was a landmark moment as Liverpool’s Gemma Bonner became only the third player to make 200 WSL appearances, after Millie Bright and the division’s all-time leading appearance-maker, Jordan Nobbs, but there was very little else for Liverpool to celebrate.The only previous time that ­Liverpool have lost their opening three WSL matches, in the 2019-20 season, they went on to be relegated.

The hosts capitalised on this reprieve to equalise through Mo Sylla after the break, leaving Rangers staring at the prospect of a sixth league game without a win.Scottish roundup: Hearts go top as Celtic stumble against Hibs after protestRead moreBut the substitute Aarons popped up in the dying moments to elevate Rangers from 11th to eighth in the table and ensure some form of reprieve for Martin, who was again the subject of vociferous calls for his sacking throughout the afternoon from a huge travelling support in West Lothian.TheLivingstonmanger, David Martindale, made three changes to the side that started the 3-2 defeat at Dundee as Andy Winter, Stevie May and the debutant Mo Susoho – on loan from Manchester City – replaced Shane Blaney, Tete Yengi and Robbie Muirhead.There were also three changes to the Rangers side followingThursday’s Europa League defeat by Genkas Connor Barron, Oliver Antman and Bojan Miovski started in place of Mohamed Diomandé, Mikey Moore and Youssef Chermiti.The visitors had an early opportunity when Djeidi Gassama cut in from the left and saw his shot blocked behind for a corner. Livi soon cranked up the intensity, though, and Lewis Smith shot wide from just outside the box before May burst into the box and saw a low shot from a tight angle saved by Jack Butland.View image in fullscreenRussell Martin was berated by away fans throughout the game.Photograph: Kirk O’Rourke/Rangers FC/ShutterstockSmith then curled an effort just wide from the edge of the box as the hosts continued to ask questions of their vulnerable visitors. Rangers had a great chance to open the scoring in the 12th minute when Nico Raskin cleverly flicked John Souttar’s pass in behind the defence, but Miovski blazed wastefully over the crossbar with just Prior to beat.That opportunity aside, Gers were generally struggling to impose themselves and the first chants of “Martin get to fuck” and “Russell Martin, get out of our club” went up in the 16th minute. With tension rising in the stands, the under-fire Englishman would have been mightily relieved to see his side go ahead in the 23rd minute.Gassama’s cross from the left was cushioned back into the danger area by Antman at the back post, and Tavernier hooked home an acrobatic volley from the edge of the six-yard box.Rangers were presented with an opportunity to double their lead five minutes later when they were awarded a penalty after May grabbed Raskin’s jersey in the box following a Tavernier corner, but the captain’s well-struck spot-kick was superbly saved by Prior, who went on to deny Barron and Miovski with smart stops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He admits that 2024 was probably the right time to leave from his perspective too.Welcome to West Ham, Nuno, the crisis club with no vision and no structure | Jacob SteinbergRead moreHis successor at the London Stadium, Julen Lopetegui, was sacked after 22 games while his replacement, Graham Potter, wasreplaced by Nuno Espírito Santoon Saturday having presided over six wins in 25 matches. But the Everton manager insists the instability and lack of direction at West Ham gives him no satisfaction.“I think sometimes at football clubs everyone thinks the grass can always be greener but I had a great time at West Ham, I really did. A hugely enjoyable time,” said Moyes, who was speaking before Potter’s dismissal. “I got on great with everybody but if people want to keep changing all the time, I don’t know if that is the best way for clubs.“I think clubs need to build, get stability, and there are a few clubs like that. I think one isEverton, at the moment, who for different reasons badly need stability in building and moving things in the right direction. West Ham was also a club like that.“Twice when we came in, [West Ham] was a club that had to avoid relegation which was just like Everton. Whatever you say about the pressure of the job, that is the worst part of it, trying to deal with a team near the bottom of the league,” Moyes added. “I think the biggest thing is that West Ham is a huge club with a great support and they want success as well.“It is very difficult. The modern game makes it very difficult for teams outside the real big boys to do it. But I think for West Ham to play three years in a row in Europe and sell the most expensive player in British football at the time [Declan Rice], you would have said is a statement of where they are and what they have done.“At West Ham, we were spending £40m [on one player] and that was because European football takes you to another level in terms of what you can entice and the money you can bring in. I think it was a great time at West Ham but it was probably the right time for me to move on as well as West Ham.”Potter was sacked after losing five of six games this season and Moyes believes strong leadership is required to resist the regular calls for change at West Ham.“I think if clubs are always going to keep jumping because of what is probably a minority of supporters then it is going to be difficult for them,” Moyes said. “I think you need to have strong people, who don’t budge and stick with it all the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was not only a record for the women’s game, but also made it the most watched rugby game of the year.View image in fullscreenMarlie Packer takes a selfie with fans during the celebrations.Photograph: Morgan Harlow/RFU/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesAs the England players celebrated, the Red Roses winger Abby Dow urged those in power to ensure the momentum of the past few weeks was nurtured and built upon. “We’ve got the ball rolling and I don’t want it to stop,” she said. “What is so important is the influence we will have towards grassroots right now. Rugby has the influence to change anyone’s life.“It is quite stereotyped, especially with boys, that it can be a middle-class sport, but it’s not,” she added. “It really isn’t. I want to see rugby move up to the north, I want to see it flourish across the country, because look at what football has done in the women’s game. It’s got so many girls questioning why they are not doing it and why the boys are getting their knees muddy.”Dow also put the Red Roses’ victory in wider context, adding: “The most important thing is realising not that we’ve won a medal, but we’ve won for women’s sport and women’s rugby,” she said.View image in fullscreenNatasha Hunt bangs a drum in delight at the World Cup party.Photograph: Tom Dulat/RFU/The RFU Collection/Getty Images“What we are trying to prove is that, actually, it’s not just a one-off with football. It’s women’s sport as a whole and it is here to stay. I hope that kids will never be limited by it and we are proving that.”The Rugby Football Union, which runs the game in England, has set the ambitious goal of having 100,000 women and girls actively playing by 2027 – 40,000 more than now.It has also pledged to create more investment opportunities across the women’s game with the goal of becoming the first union globally with a fully self-sustaining women’s game by 2031.Another England player, Natasha Hunt, said it was time that other rugby nations followed the RFU’s lead by investing more in the women’s game to help raise standards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The challenge for everyone now is to build on this.”View image in fullscreenThat is certainly true.

The game was won by that point but the sight of the wing at full bore, leaving Leicester’s defence for dust, was one to savour.‘They have changed my life’: John Mitchell open to staying as England coachRead more“I said to the guys: ‘Jeez, it would be nice to have that sort of speed’,” said Bristol’s director of rugby, Pat Lam. “I wasn’t sure when he first came how quickly he would fit into a new team and the way we play and getting back to rugby fitness. I’m really proud of him.“Every day he’s getting better because of the way we train. He had to go through a little bit of pain at the beginning. I remember the amount of time he had his hands on knees, which I don’t allow. But that will give him a lot of confidence. To be able to still sprint like that at the end – he knows he’s got that in the tank.”Rees-Zammit’s last appearance in the Prem – or the Premiership as it was then – came for Gloucester on 30 December 2023 at ­Twickenham – as it was then – in Big Match 15. The 24-year-old’s dalliance with ­American football thereafter ended in the summerwithout the NFL break he yearned forbut his return has been a welcome boost both for Bristol Bears and the league.After a first try in Bears’ colours in thePrem RugbyCup last week at Gloucester, Sunday’s score in his first complete 80 minutes was another sign that Rees-Zammit is back in his happy place. He did not have many opportunities but he took his chance in style when it came. Gabriel Oghre and the replacement Josh Carrington also touched down in the second half after Fitz Harding and Gabriel Ibitoye had scored tries before the break.View image in fullscreenJosh Carrington splashes down for a try on his Prem debut to give Bristol a bonus point.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockThe Tigers managed four tries, with two from the wing Adam ­Radwan, whose footwork must have impressed the watching England head coach, Steve Borthwick, plus one from Orlando Bailey and an early score from Jack van Poortvliet.Bristol had to fight their way back after a fast start from the Tigers that was something of a surprise given their buildup. Despite staying ­overnight in Bristol ahead of the game, they ended up scrambling to be ready for the start.“We arrived 45 minutes before kick-off and had to walk from the other side of the ground through the fans. The bus driver took not one wrong turn but two wrong turns. We actually started pretty well so no excuses,” said Leicester’s new head coach, Geoff Parling. “I thought we looked like a team that was still ­getting to know each other a little bit. But I can’t fault their effort.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will have been particularly frustrated with his side conceding 14 penalties. Tom ­Jordan, man of the match on an assured debut after his summer move from Glasgow, punished them with 14 points from the boot.Jordan was switched from full-back to stand-off 13 minutes in when AJ MacGinty tore his achilles. It was one of three serious injuries suffered by the Bears during the course of the game, with Harry Randall and Ibitoye departing with hamstring issues. It is MacGinty’s that is of most long-term concern. If it is as bad as feared it could be a long road back for the USA international at the age of 35.“Aaron Rodgers is older than AJ and he was back in 11 weeks after snapping his achilles so I’ll have to have a quiet word with Louis Rees-Zammit to see if he knows someone at the Green Bay Packers,” said Lam.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyBristolLeicesterRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The 15-13 success for the visitors at Bethpage Black came against the backdrop ofawful spectator behaviour, largely towards European players and their families. McIlroy confirmed his wife, Erica, was hit by a beer that was thrown during Saturday afternoon’s play.“I don’t think we should ever accept that in golf,” said McIlroy. “I think golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week. Golf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you very good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people. Sometimes this week we didn’t see that. So no, this should not be what is acceptable in theRyder Cup. We will be making sure to say to our fans in Ireland in 2027 that what happened here this week is not acceptable.Lowry sinks putt that retains Ryder Cup for Europe as they hold off US comebackRead more“Come and support your team. I think if I was an American, I would be annoyed … I didn’t hear a lot of shouts for Scottie [Scheffler] today, but I heard a lot of shouts against me. It’s like, support your players. That’s the thing.“It was a rough week for all of us. But at the same time, we shut them up by our performance and how we played. I chirped back a few times because it got to me a few times, but we tried to handle everything that came our way with class and poise, and for the most part, I felt like we did that.”Shane Lowry, McIlroy’s close friend, added: “I was out there for two days with Erica McIlroy and the amount of abuse that she received was astonishing. The way she was out there supporting her husband and supporting her team was unbelievable.”McIlroy replied in jest when asked what it was like playing Ryder Cup matches with policemen and dogs lining fairways. “I wish they had let the dogs off the leashes,” he said.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy celebrates with fans after Europe’s victory at Bethpage.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty Images“The police out there and the amount of security presence was insane. Look, nothing was going to happen. There wasn’t going to be physical altercation or anything like that but there was a lot of language that was unacceptable and abusive behaviour.“It should be off limits but obviously it wasn’t this week. Erica is fine. She’s a very, very strong woman. She handled everything this week with class and poise and dignity like she always has. I love her and we’re going to have a good time celebrating tonight.”The Masters champion was only slightly more serious when asked how it felt to fire an iron shot to close range after turning to ask spectators to “shut the fuck up” as they heckled him before he hit. “Very fucking satisfying,” McIlroy said.Keegan Bradley, the defeated US captain, criticised the rule whereby both the hosts and Europe received singles half points before a Sunday ball was struck. Injury sustained by Viktor Hovland meant Bradley had to remove one of his own players, Harris English, from the draw. This moved Europe to within two points of retaining the Cup.“It has to change,” said Bradley. “I think it’s obvious to everybody in the sports world, in this room. Nothing against Viktor but that rule needs to change by the next Ryder Cup.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Europe won just one of the 11 matches. “It’s been the most stressful 12 hours in my life,” said Donald. “Shout-out to the Americans, Keegan [Bradley] and his captaincy. I knew it would be tough. I didn’t think they would be this tough, they fought so hard, and all respect to them.View image in fullscreenCaptain Luke Donald gets stuck into the celebrations late into the night at Bethpage after Europe’s victory.Photograph: David Davies/PA“But this means a lot obviously to me and the team. We came here knowing that the task was very difficult. I couldn’t be more proud of these guys and what they have gone through, how they have come together, how they are playing for history, how they are playing for the people that came before them. Now there will be talk for generations to come as they go down in history. I couldn’t be more proud.“I was just fortunate to have a team that knew me and trusted me. All I have ever tried to do is just be the best prepared I can be. So many different things went into this to deal with; the environment, the communication with the players. I’m so, so, happy for them.”Jon Rahm joined McIlroy by heaping praise on Donald. “Luke has set the bar for captaincy so extremely high,” said the Spaniard. “What he’s done these four years is absolutely astonishing. He has been so professional, so dedicated, so incredibly meticulous, and well organised in doing everything that he needs to do and that’s why you’ve seen the two performances you’ve seen from us.”Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupUS sportsGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

The man who’d won everything wanted to win this more than anything. It had been on his mind ever since the last one at Marco Simone, when he startled the media, his captain, and his teammates by launching into a speech about how he was targeting victory here at Bethpage.“I’ve said this for the last six years to anyone that will listen: I think one of the biggest accomplishments in golf right now is winning an awayRyder Cup,” McIlroy said back then, “and that’s what we’re going to do”.Lowry sinks putt that retains Ryder Cup for Europe as they hold off US comebackRead moreAnd in the end McIlroy was just about as good as his word. And if anyone was starting to doubt the truth of exactly how hard it all was after the beating the USA took during the first two days’ play here, Sunday’s singles were all the evidence they needed to see just how right McIlroy was.The weathermen said it was the hottest day yet at Bethpage, but in other ways it felt like the temperature had dropped in the morning. The fever that had gripped the place on Saturday had broken. McIlroy still had to step away from the ball while playing the first hole. Somebody shouted out “Fuck you!” in the silence that fell before his putt. But this time a couple of burly policemen waded into the gallery and the crowd around the heckler started chanting “Get him out! Get him out!”For all Keegan Bradley’s talk about how his team could still win even though they were trailing by seven in the morning, no one here seemed to be buying it, and while this European team, and McIlroy in particular, still had to put upwith plenty of abusethere wasn’t the same vicious edge there had been the day before.1:53Next one will be a ‘little bit nicer’, says Lowry after sinking putt to retain Ryder Cup – videoMaybe there was a collective acceptance that the abuse was out of hand on Saturday, maybe it was the extra effort made by the PGA of America to police the bad behaviour, or maybe it was just that it’s harder to scream “You suck!” and mean it when you’re team’s on the wrong end of a beating.McIlroy won’t care either way now his team have won. He gave everything he had to give to his team here, and by the end he seemed so drained by everything he has been through that he didn’t have anything much left for his singles match againstScottie Scheffler. The emotional, mental, and physical effort of playing four games in two days, and dealing with all the abuse that came his way while he was doing it, had left him running on fumes.It was a strange game. World No 1 v World No 2, the man who won this year’s Masters against the man whowon this year’s Open, the last winner of the career grand slam champion against someone who will, most likely, be the next winner of the career grand slam.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy has had his heart set on this even in the moments after winning the career grand slam.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesMaybe it was because the match was so heavyweight that it never really got off the ground. It ought to have been a game for the ages, but it ended up more like a game for the aged. The two greatest players of their generation turned in some pretty creaky golf, and played a handful of shots that made everyone watching feel a lot better about the state of their own game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It still wasn’t as bad as the one Scheffler served up from the middle of the 10th fairway, when he blew his approach 40 yards left after finishing his swing one-handed. Amazingly, Scheffler still won the hole with a bogey, since McIlroy wasn’t doing too much better and ended up duffing his own chip a couple of feet and making a double. It went on like this until Scheffler eventually won 1 up on 18.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler will remember this Ryder Cup as one of the most disappointing weeks of his career.Photograph: Corey Sipkin/UPI/ShutterstockOne down on the day, but three and a half up on the week, McIlroy will be able to look back and know he showed the best of himself, and that he got what he wanted out of playing here. Scheffler, though, will remember it asone of the most disappointingweeks of his career. He became the first player in history to play all four pairs matches for his side and yet lose every one. He’s putted this week like a sea-legged sailor squeezing a round in during shore-leave.Scheffler is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a Texas golfer. He is by all accounts, a grand team man, who even helped organise the USA’s practice camp at Napa last week because he was so determined to win here. “Scottie has been the best teammate in our team room this week, without question, period,” insisted Bradley.You guess he’s not going to be the last US captain to tie himself in knots trying to figure out how to get the best out of Scheffler in this competition. If anyone ever figures it out, the near impossible job McIlroy took on this time around will be that much harder again.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Rory McIlroyRyder CupGolfScottie SchefflerUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

She tried to persuade them to join her in a chorus of “Scottie! Scottie! Scheffler!” to the tune of Queen’s We Will Rock You but was booed into abandoning the effort. “Fuck you Rory!” was more popular, and became a persistent chant throughout the day. McIlroy responded by blowing the crowd kisses when he came to the tee.It set the tone of an ugly day at Bethpage, when the atmosphere around McIlroy in particular became so toxic that the PGA of America brought in squads of state police and park police to walk the course with his group midway through their round. Several spectators were evicted.McIlroy was repeatedly targeted with personal abuse and grew so exasperated with people shouting out during his backswing that at one point he turned around and told the crowd to “shut the fuck up”. The PGA of America repeatedly posted spectator etiquette warnings on the screens around the grounds.

I took every opportunity to talk about it: pitching it in meetings, sketching it out on a whiteboard for anyone who was interested, even drawing the web in the snow with a ski pole for my friend on what was meant to be a peaceful day out.I relentlessly petitioned bosses at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern), where I worked at the time, who initially found the idea“a little eccentric”but eventually gave in and let me work on it.I was seized by the idea of combining two pre-existing computer technologies: the internet and hypertext, which takes an ordinary document and brings it to life by adding “links”.I believed that giving users such a simple way to navigate the internet would unlock creativity and collaboration on a global scale. If you could put anything on it, then after a while, it would have everything on it.But for the web to have everything on it, everyone had to be able to use it, and want to do so. This was already asking a lot. I couldn’t also ask that they pay for each search or upload they made. In order to succeed, therefore, it would have to be free. That’s why, in 1993, I convinced my Cern managers to donate the intellectual property of the world wide web, putting it into the public domain. We gave the web away to everyone.Today, I look at my invention and I am forced to ask: is the web still free today? No, not all of it. We see a handful of large platforms harvesting users’ private data to share with commercial brokers or even repressive governments. We see ubiquitous algorithms that are addictive by design and damaging to our teenagers’ mental health. Trading personal data for use certainly does not fit with my vision for a free web.On many platforms, we are no longer the customers, but instead have become the product. Our data, even if anonymised, is sold on to actors we never intended it to reach, who can then target us with content and advertising. This includes deliberately harmful content that leads to real-world violence, spreads misinformation, wreaks havoc on our psychological wellbeing and seeks to undermine social cohesion.We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual.Solidis an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.You generate all this data – your actions, your body, your preferences. You should own itSharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered by it.Somewhere between my original vision for web 1.0 and the rise of social media as part of web 2.0, we took the wrong path. We’re now at a new crossroads, one where we must decide if AI will be used for the betterment or to the detriment of society. How can we learn from the mistakes of the past? First of all, we must ensure policymakers do not end up playing the same decade-long game of catchup they have done over social media. The time to decide the governance model for AI was yesterday, so we must act with urgency.In 2017, I wrote a thought experiment about an AI that works foryou. I called itCharlie. Charlie works for you like your doctor or your lawyer, bound by law, regulation and codes of conduct. Why can’t the same frameworks be adopted for AI? We have learned from social media that power rests with the monopolies who control and harvest personal data. We can’t let the same thing happen with AI.So how do we move forward? Part of the frustration with democracy in the 21st century is that governments have been too slow to meet the demands of digital citizens. The AI industry landscape is fiercely competitive, and development and governance are dictated by companies. The lesson from social media is that this will not create value for the individual.I coded the world wide web on a single computer in a small room. But that small room didn’t belong to me, it was at Cern. Cern was created in the aftermath of the second world war by the UN and European governments who identified a historic, scientific turning point that required international collaboration. It is hard to imagine a big tech company agreeing to share the world wide web for no commercial reward like Cern allowed me to. That’s why we need a Cern-like not-for-profit body driving forward international AI research.I gave the world wide web away for free because I thought that it would only work if it worked for everyone. Today, I believe that to be truer than ever. Regulation and global governance are technically feasible, but reliant on political willpower. If we are able to muster it, we have the chance to restore the web as a tool for collaboration, creativity and compassion across cultural borders. We can re-empower individuals, and take the web back.

But for some death is no longer considered an inevitability …Aleks KrotoskiSun 28 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 12.48 EDTShareImagine you’re the leader of one of the most powerful nations in the world. You have everything you could want at your disposal: power, influence, money. But, the problem is, your time at the top is fleeting. I’m not talking about the prospect of a coup or a revolution, or even a democratic election: I’m talking about the thing even more certain in life than taxes. I’m talking about death.In early September, China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin were caught on mic talking about strategies to stay young. “With the development of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, and people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality,” Putin said via an interpreter to Xi. “There’s a chance,” he continued, “of also living to 150 [years old].” But is this even possible, and what would it mean for the world if the people with power were able to live for ever?Over the centuries, we have used ever more sophisticated technology to heal ourselves into unprecedented longevity. In the 20th century, it was innovations in public health and medicine that effected this transformation, allowing today’s children to live longer, healthier lives than at any time in history. Yet that’s still not enough for some.I got curious about the growing cadre of billionaire investors coming from Silicon Valley who wanted to live for ever. What world were they imagining?I’ve been a technology reporter for 25 years, chronicling the rise of the web from its early days. I have reported on how it has transformed our social world, and I’ve railed against overzealous developers pushing disruptive innovations that inevitably come into conflict with society at large. I got curious about the growing cadre of billionaire investors coming fromSilicon Valleywho wanted to live for ever. What world were they imagining and building, and how would the rest of us fit into it? I’ve met people who have tried radical life-extending experiments and biohackers who swear the numbers will keep them for ever young, and seen inside Silicon Valley labs where technologists are planning a longevity revolution. I uncovered the motivations, ethical conundrums and doctrines that drive the belief that we are on the brink of eternal life, and that these immortalists are the people who will give it to us.There are several different types of immortality in this movement. There’s the literal live-for-ever kind, dominated by highly intelligent, mathematically minded computer scientists, philosophers and hopefuls who have an unwavering faith in the life-giving power of technology. They imagine that they will one day merge with artificial intelligence and become post-human, and will live for ever in a state of bliss and delight.Then there are the immortalists who want to reconstruct the infrastructure of the world we live in so that they can live for ever. Already, and in plain sight, they are restructuring sovereign nation states, pushing an agenda of technological acceleration at any cost. These powerful people aren’t searching for the fountain of youth – they’re building it.And still another version of immortality is parroted by people like Xi and Putin, who believe in the certainty of exponentially accelerating science and technology. Life will continue not by merging with tech, but by using it to slow down the onslaught of time, thereby allowing medical science to develop treatments that will heal us. They believe they are living proof of age reversal, physical rejuvenation and the ability to stop time.Imagine old age. What comes to mind? For many, it means losing faculties, and losing function. Ageing is something we all experience, at different rates and in different ways. In 2015, in the World Report on Ageing andHealth, the World Health Organization defined healthy ageing as “the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that maintains wellbeing in older age”. Key to this definition is functional ability, or “intrinsic capacity” – “the health-related attributes that enable people to be and to do what they have reason to value”.That’s because what you want to do when you’re 80 is not what you want to do when you’re 20, nor do you necessarily want to do the same things that someone else does. Say you want to go skydiving at 80, but can’t get on the plane because it’s become more difficult to get upstairs, your functional ability has declined. If you’re 80 and you have no physical trouble getting on the plane, but you have cataracts and you’d rather read than parachute, your functional ability has also declined. So it’s not just the presence, relative encroachment or absence of a disease, or even the absolute number of years of life that’s important, but the quality and the quantity of those years in the context of a range of other factors, such as lifestyle.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianThere is growing evidence that there is something biological underlying how we age – and some out-there researchers are trying to figure out how to tweak itThe term used for this in age research is “healthspan” – and the objective in most contemporary science in this field is to increase it. Healthspan means staying healthy for longer, and keeping the diseases of old age at bay. It means keeping your body young, intervening in the process of growing old, and considering the possibility of “rejuvenation”.This is where “respectable” science gasps: “the fringe of the fringe”, a doctor colleague said to me dismissively when I mentioned I was researching the topic. Yet there is a growing body of evidence that there is something biological underlying how we age – and some out-there researchers, funded by Silicon Valley, are trying to figure out how to tweak it, so that our bodies actually can go backwards in time.It started in the 1990s, when a young molecular biologist named Cynthia Kenyon and her postgrad student Ramon Tabtiang designed several landmark experiments with a tiny nematode calledC.elegans. Their findings suggested that tweaking a gene doubled the lifespans of these creatures.Kenyon gave a talk at Stanford University not long afterwards. “She looked like a super-young, very hip professor,” says Irina Conboy, who was there with her then boyfriend Mike, both PhD students at the time. “And she suggested that simply by changing the intensity of certain molecules, you can make an old animal younger.”When I meet Irina and Mike Conboy in their office – now married, they are both professors in the bioengineering department at the University of California, Berkeley – they are wearing matching tie-dye sweatshirts, and finishing each other’s sentences. They are charming, warm and a bit shambolic. Their tiny white pup is comfortably chewing on his leg on a saggy sofa, next to a sheaf of papers.The couple have one big question when it comes to ageing: “So why is it that all the tissues of the body seem to grow old together?” Mike asks. “It doesn’t matter whether they’re on the outside or on the inside, whether they’re exercised or going along for the ride. Everything seems to go to heck in a handbasket with age.” They wondered if there was some kind of signal in the body that changes the molecular structure of muscles, and ages them all simultaneously. They set out to find out what all tissues have in common.Think back to your biology class in school, and you might remember those hand-drawn anatomy posters with elaborate illustrations and labels for each part of the body: the skeletal system – the body’s framework of bones, ligaments, cartilage and joints that gives us structure and shape; the nervous system – the network that transmits electrical signals between our brain and the rest of our body; and the vascular system – the blood-vessel pipelines that take nutrients and oxygen to our muscles. Could it be that some sort of ageing alarm was passed through the body via one of these systems?“The ideal experiment would be, ‘OK, what if we transplanted a young nervous system into an old mouse,’” says Mike. “Well, we can’t technically do that. What if we put a young vascular system in an old mouse? We can’t do that, either.”Irina looks at me with a twinkle in her eye while Mike continues. “What if we put young blood into an old mouse?” he says. This would have to be more than a one-off injection – they would need to transfer a large proportion of blood from a young mouse to an old one to make sure there was an observable effect.“What if we connected the young and old mouse together? You can take an old mouse and stitch it to a young mouse, and instead of the skin healing edge to edge of the old mouse, it heals across edge to edge to the young mouse,” Mike explains, describing a technique known as parabiosis. “As that tissue heals, blood vessels re-form there. Now you have blood slowly trickling from one animal to the other and back and forth.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianThe Conboys had discovered a fountain of youth, but they had no idea why or how it workedBetween 2003 and 2004, they sutured three categories of mice together: young and old, young and young, and old and old. They let the blood flow for five weeks, and then gave each mouse an injury in its hind leg muscle. Five days later, the mice with the young blood – including the old ones – recovered “robustly”, unlike the untampered-with oldies, whose muscles regenerated “typical of aged animals”.The team tried again elsewhere, with injuries on other body parts. The liver, same thing. The brain, same thing. As the results began to trickle in over the lifespan of their conjoined rodents, the Conboys were able to conclusively say that the tissues of the old mice looked more like the tissues of a young mouse – whether they were in the muscles or in the liver or in the brain.Somethingin the young blood rejuvenated the old tissues. In 2005, theypublished their results in Nature.The Conboys had discovered a fountain of youth, but they had no idea why or how it worked.Scientific knowledge is more of a process than a single moment in time. The path to today is littered with old, disproven ideas that, perhaps, were actually the stepping stones that got us to where we are now. The road to longevity is no different.In 1889, in Paris,Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, a distinguished and celebrated physiologist and member of the Royal Society, stood before an esteemed audience of peers at the Société de Biologie and gave what became his most famous presentation. Sensing himself growing old at the age of 72, Brown-Séquard had started investigating loss of sexual function, and claimed to have found the right treatment: an injection into both of his arms of a mixture of blood taken from the gonads, semen and “juice extracted from a testicle” of a dog or a guinea pig.He was met with stunned silence. There had been research suggesting that something as yet unidentified in the sex organs was a salve for the effects of age (at least in men). After his treatment, Brown-Séquard reported improved energy levels, muscle rejuvenation, cognitive functioning, and heightened abilities and skills in the bedroom. Alas, it proved to be a potent form of placebo effect.However, one of Brown-Séquard’s apprentices was Serge “Samuel” Voronoff, also a student under the eugenicistAlexis Carrel, a Nobel laureate and pioneer of organ transplantation. Voronoff took his mentors’ two novel ideas – putting an organ from one body into another, and the mysterious rejuvenating power of testicles – and tested his own theory of rejuvenation: he transplanted sex glands from the young into the old. Specifically, he transplanted fragments of monkey testicles into older men’s scrotums. In 1923, he appeared before scientists at the International Congress of Surgeons in London, informing them that the procedure had been so successful that the Pasteur Institute had built him a chimpanzee-breeding compound in west Africa.Within two decades, more than 45 surgeons around the world used his technique more than 2,000 times; 500 men were operated on in France alone. Voronoff published books and papers, and was quoted as saying that life could span more than 140 years; the press described the outcomes as miraculous and life-changing. In Brazil, where he was a minor celebrity, Voronoff inspired carnival songs. But his celebrity faded when his methods were proven to be less effective than what appeared to be the enigmatic active agent: testosterone, isolated by Ernst Laqueur in 1935.Both men, learned and respectable, had pulled on a thread of scientific research that seemed logical. Yet both were off the mark. At the time, the gold standard of regulatory checks hadn’t yet been established to ensure that the treatment they were proposing was both safe and effective. Today, the equivalent treatments have been, and young blood is dancing around it.In 2016, Jesse Karmazin, a Stanford Medical School graduate, opened Ambrosia Health’s doors in a business park near a redwood forest in Monterey, California, to run an experiment testing the Conboys’ hypothesis, but in humans. There still wasn’t much to go on aboutwhyyoung blood appeared to reverse ageing – in the decade of research since their papers on parabiosis, only a few molecular and hormonal candidates had surfaced, but even in these the evidence for them was inconclusive, and all of it was in mice.Karmazin decided to run a human trialof his own as a private company, and charged an entry fee to anyone over the age of 35 who wanted to take part: $8,000 to have biomarkers measured, to receive a transfusion of one litre of young plasma from a donor between the ages of 16 and 25, and to have their biomarkers measured again for comparison.He phoned Irina Conboy to see what she thought; she declined involvement. She didn’t agree with the premise, she tells me – Karmazin’s study didn’t “fit very well”. There wasn’t enough evidence that positive effects would be reflected so broadly. Yet, even without her endorsement, the company and the trial got more than 100 press mentions in under two years.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The Guardian‘If the goal is to stop ageing, or to gradually become younger – we  don’t have it now. But if you invest correctly, we will have it soon’Jesselyn Cook was a tech reporter at the Huffington Post at the time. “Karmazin was quoted saying things like, ‘It works, it reverses ageing’, and ‘I’m not really in the camp of saying this will provide immortality, but I think it comes pretty close,’” she says. “It doesn’t matter if you were young, wanting to feel extra capable, or if you were old and trying to, in his own words, reverse your age,” Cook tells me. “It just seemed like no matter what the problem was, Ambrosia could help.”By 2019, Ambrosia Health had a total of five clinics around the US, and Karmazin was hinting he was looking to open another in Manhattan. Other private clinics, also claiming to carry out research studies, had popped up, offering paying clients young blood transfusions. Yet young plasma treatments for the physical and cognitive effects of age had never been approved by the FDA, which released a statement in February that year citing concerns that patients were being “preyed upon” by “unscrupulous actors” touting the treatments as “cures and remedies”. Ambrosia Health went dark within hours.When I exchanged emails with Karmazin in 2023, he told me: “The FDA never reviewed our data before making their announcement … I have no idea if they were ever aware of Ambrosia, in fact. It is entirely possible they were referring to our competitors, who acted with less diligence and respect for the rules.”“If you think that you can simply go and do the procedure and become younger – not yet,” Irina Conboy says to me when I bring up the Ambrosia Health story. “If the goal is to stop ageing and plateau, or start to gradually become younger, I would just say that, right now, we don’t have it. But if you invest correctly, your time and efforts and resources, we will have it soon. That is my feeling about it. Soon.”“Soon” is exactly what some longevity pioneers are banking on.When I spoke with “rejuvenation athlete”Bryan Johnsonin 2023, he was 45 years old. The biohacker and tech entrepreneur had used his Blueprint algorithm to help him “reverse” time, by devising a strict protocol of supplements, nutrition, and exercise that would bring his “biological” age significantly lower than his “chronological” age. He had also dabbled in young plasma therapy; his teenage son Talmadge had become what Johnson called his “blood boy” for a short time while Johnson’s medical team assessed whether there was any truth to the rumours of blood’s benefits. Johnson ultimately discontinued the treatment with his son, but still tweets about going to the clinic every few months to pick up several litres of albumin – the protein in plasma – like a regular longevity oil change.On Johnson’s 46th birthday, he tested his biological age again. His objective over the previous 12 months of the protocol was to see if Blueprint could help him stay the same biological age for a whole year. His computer appeared to be doing its job:his body was ageing at a rate of 277 days for every 365.Now, holding back time for one year may not seem enough to live for ever, but here’s why it might: think of it like a rocket leaving the Earth. It needs to reach a certain speed to overcome the pull of gravity. This is called escape velocity. Now imagine that through treatments, lifestyle changes and prayers you could stop yourself from ageing. The idea is that you would eventually reach the point where each age-related disease, such as dementia or diabetes, and those that we don’t know about yet, will have been cured before your body ages into them. You would escape the pull of mortality. This is called longevity escape velocity. Fundamentally, this isn’t living for ever; it’s not dying today.The escape velocity cusp is closer than most of us would imagine, maintains gerontologist Dr Aubrey de Grey, who coined the term in 2004 and now runs private research group theLEV Foundation. Two decades ago, he predicted that, as we are already so long-lived, “even a 30% increase in healthy life span will give the first beneficiaries of rejuvenation therapies another 20 years – an eternity in science – to benefit from second-generation therapies that would give another 30%, and so on ad infinitum”.Longevity escape velocity relies on a major mathematical assumption: that technology can keep up with the heterogeneity of human decline. The conditions that affect you when you’re young are – medically speaking – relatively simple. But the illnesses of old age could be said to grow in severity at an exponential rate. Johnson has to stay young, or an age-related disease that can’t yet be treated will kill him. If you are trying to age in reverse, you would need to be living in a time when treatments and technologies both improve at the same exponential rate. These people are literally racing against the clock.They believe in an idea calledMoore’s law– a widely held observation that predicts that every 18 months, computer technology gets twice as good. Moore’s law is the reason the phone that you have in your hand costs around the same as the last model (not taking into account inflation), but is twice as powerful.Everything from MRI scans to drug discovery to protein folding is now being regarded as a computational problem, therefore the idea goes that modern medicine, too, should be characterised by an exponential increase of capability. If every 18 months it gets twice as powerful at keeping you alive, what will medicine be like in 20 years’ time? And if you figure out how not to age in that time, you begin to understand why living to 200 years seems like something that could happen.Technofundamentalists believe that ever advancing technology should be able to solve the ever more complex problems we throw at it. So if the body can be expressed as data and we can figure out how to fix it when it goes wrong, why aren’t we already living for ever? Life – mortality – is complicated.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Carl Godfrey/The GuardianTruly, all of this radical technological and governance innovation will not help the rest of us live longer, healthier livesIn his2024 book Why We Die, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnandescribes “the characteristic arrogance that many physicists and computer scientists display toward biologists” that causes the engineers to miss something crucial. That something may by physical, but it’s more likely to be something impossible to break down into data. Seamus O’Mahony, the doctor and prize-winning author ofThe Way We Die Now, found this when he went to a longevity conference in 2025. “They are interested only in the biomolecular and the monetisable,” he says. “I heard a great deal over the four days about AI-designed drugs, glycans, the transcriptome ageing clock, but almost nothing on the complexity of death systems and the social determinants of death and dying. They seemed strangely uncurious about the enemy they have declared war on. Ageing to them is simply a technical problem that can, and will, be fixed.”The irony is that the mechanistic metaphor that served us so well is now dramatically impeding further progress. Too much faith in data and engineering overlooks the value of the unknown and the unknowable. In order to defeat ageing and death, we must bend to the technical tools that are supposed to serve us – from spreadsheets to large language models. We must become more like appliances. “This impulse, this motivation, this moral mandate to want to improve yourself means we must become like a machine,” says Dr Elke Schwarz, political theorist at Queen Mary University of London.Yet “we live an inconvenient life”, says Schwartz. “We are weird. We are messy. Our bodies are mortal. We die. Why can’t we be like products? Why can’t we be like the things that computer scientists make that they can improve and fine-tune?” Because we aren’t. Yet this is the starting point for how Silicon Valley intends to “fix” mortality, and their simple solutions – and what they need to achieve them – are on the radar of some of the most powerful people in the world.In 2025, Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office with bold ambitions to rework the US government. Flanking him at his inauguration were representatives of the largest tech companies in the world, all of whom have thrown their weight and their Silicon Valley wealth behind America’s AI future.In the months since January 2025, Trump has granted them access to finances and infrastructure that will ensure that AI is the driving force behind the US economy; it will also propel the technological search for eternal life. They believe it is a moral imperative to use technology to enhance the body and mind towards immortality.Regulation is standing in their way, and regulation is what Trump’s team is dismantling. In the early part of 2025, Elon Musk’s Doge implemented actions that significantlyaffected research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and regulatory oversight of the FDA. The department cancelled leases, reduced the workforce in the FDA’s Office of Digital Transformation, and terminated hundreds of research projects valued at billions of dollars.Techno-libertarianPeter Thiel, longevity investor and co-founder of PayPal, has assisted with the placement of former colleagues and staffers in positions where they can help dissolve government oversight. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – until recently RFK Jr’s right hand man – is Jim O’Neill, a longtime Thiel ally who in 2014 suggested reforms to the FDA “so that it’s approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety – and let people start using them, at their own risk, but not much risk of safety”, which might include unproven longevity treatments using “young blood”.The cost of giving so much to the technofundamentalist dream of AI immortality has been that resources have been allocated away from initiatives that support people who are getting older today. The administration proposed cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars to Medicare – the social support network for healthcare for millions of US citizens over the age of 65 – and cancelled the White House Conference onAgeing, a flagship event held every 10 years since 1961 to determine the strategic direction for policy to support older Americans.Truly, all of this radical technological and governance innovation will not help the rest of us live longer, healthier lives.It’s easy to roll our eyes at people like Xi and Putin who wish for immortality, and to dismiss their delusions of grandeur. They believe we are on the brink of radically extended life, and that they, uniquely in history, are the ones who will help build the machines that will get us there.‘People can get younger, perhaps even immortal’: Putin’s pursuit of longevityRead moreBut consider this: the technologists who fundamentally believe in the immortality project – whether they want to literally live for ever, or are building AI that they think will usher in the next enlightenment – are enjoying unparalleled political access to the leaders of the world, and they are once again building our future.For the immortalists of Silicon Valley and the rich and the powerful like Xi and Putin, death is not considered an inevitability. Although organ transplantation for eternal life is science fiction, they do have a head start in the race to longevity escape velocity, simply because they can afford cutting-edge treatments, personalised protocols, and as much young blood as they can morally handle. They can live on: as kingmakers, rulers of the world, or bits of computer code that carry their essence throughout the cosmos. But as they remodel the world in their image, they promote the myth that human beings are only as complex as computer code. These are the ideas that are laying the groundwork for an eternal for ever. But we do have a choice about whether to accept them – or to live in the here and now.The Immortalists by Aleks Krotoski is published by Bodley Head on 23 October at £22.

A small number of them were charged for offences related to their online activity.Their jail sentences – which ranged from 12 weeks to seven years – became a flashpoint for online criticism. The people behind theposts were variouslydefended, held up as acause célèbreand cast as “political prisoners”; their postsminimisedand repeated; their prosecutionmisrepresentedas an attack on free speech (the majority of those prosecuted for online offences faced charges of stirring up racial hatred).The posts themselves didn’t appear on corners of the internet more readily associated with the far right such as Telegram, Parler, Gettr, 4chan and 8kun – but on mainstream social media platforms including X and Instagram and the largest of them all,Facebook. And while most were posted on these individuals’ personal pages, others were posted in public groups.Which brought us to thinking: what kind of online communities did these individuals – and the people defending them – belong to? What was being shared in these spaces? And were the views so normalised in such environments that people felt emboldened to post material which the UK authorities and judiciary had deemed met the criminal bar?Our starting point was to trace the Facebook profiles of the people charged who we had identified for anearlier project, using publicly available information (police and media reports). Of around two dozen people we knew to have been charged with online offences in connection with the 2024 summer riots, we traced five to three public Facebook groups. We also found dozens of visually similar or duplicated posts defending those charged cross-posted in these groups.From there we mapped the wider network of other Facebook groups, connected not only by these posts, but by a common membership as well as shared moderators and admins.In doing so we uncovered a thriving ecosystem that is growing in membership and an online community bound together by a deep distrust of government and its institutions, trading in anti-immigrant sentiment, nativism, conspiracy and misinformation including content which experts have identified as far-right.But we also found people deeply disillusioned, who hold deep-seated concerns about the society of which they form a part and a genuinely held conviction that their freedom of expression is under threat.Identifyingthe groupsWhy these groups?The three groups that form the basis of our main analysis were chosen because they contained one or more current or past members charged in connection with the 2024 summer riots or had comments supportive of those involved in the riots, be that in-person or online.We subsequently found links between these and 13 other groups – all but three of which are also public groups – which have at least one shared moderator or administrators, both of whichplay important roles in these groups. Moderators can manage membership by approving requests or issuing bans and have the authority to remove posts or comments. Admins possess expanded powers, including the ability to adjust group settings, modify its description, and appoint additional administrators or moderators.What posts did we concentrate on?To get a sense of the kind of material people who join such groups share and consume, we set about capturing all posts hosted on three of the largest identified groups between the date the group was established and mid May 2025.We captured the links and text associated with 123,000 posts in all. However, as our categorisation process (below) was necessarily restricted to just text-based posts, the subsequent analysis concentrated on 51,000 of them.How many people are in these groups?We did not capture the names of individual group members (aside from moderators, admins and top posters); therefore when we speak about groups’ combined membership we are almost certainly double-counting individuals who are members of more than one group.CategorisationWe first established that the posts contained far-right content using established academic methods, categorising the posts via keywords and combinations of words that signal radicalisation. We then supplemented this with generative AI tools which had recently become available to the data team due to changes in the Guardian’s editorial policy around theuse of such toolsfor the purposes of journalism, categorising the posts into anti-establishment, anti-immigration, demonisation of migrants, nativism and far-right identity/denial.To classify these 51,000 social media posts we used ChatGPT 4.1 via OpenAI’s API, iteratively testing prompts on a randomised sample of posts over 12 rounds until we consistently reached agreement of more than 90% between the model and three human reviewers, at least two of whom had to be in agreement with the model to progress.Having satisfied ourselves with the model’s reliability in smaller batches, we based our final evaluation on a wider sample of randomly selected posts at which point the agreement between the human reviewers and the model stood at 93%.A sample of the final output was carried out on a statistically determined number of posts again reviewed by the same separate annotators.Tests concluded that the model performed very well – matching or even improving the consistency of human reviewers in most categories:Accuracy(percentage of correctly classified instances):94.7%.Precision(percentage of times the True labels assigned by GPT are correct):79.5.Recall(percentage of instances classified as True by the humans that were also classified as True by GPT):86.1%.F1(a single percentage that combines precision and recall, higher when GPT both finds the True cases and avoids false alarms):82.6%.The model’s performance was evaluated by in-house Guardian statisticians who concluded that the results were robust outcomes as benchmarked against similar academic studies.Despite the robust performance of the model, it is inevitable that some posts will have been misclassified within our analysis.We believe that the process of categorisation via the OpenAI API – while imperfect – is rigorous, defensible, transparent, and supports robust journalism.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

As a TUC manifesto argues, those affected must have a greater say in shaping the workplace of the futureSun 28 Sep 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 16.53 EDTShareInThe Making of the English Working Class, the leftwing historian EP Thompson made a point of challenging the condescension of history towards luddism, the original anti-tech movement. The early 19th-century croppers and weavers who rebelled against new technologies should not be written off as “blindly resisting machinery”, wrote Thompson in his classichistory. They were opposing a laissez-faire logic that dismissed its disastrous impact on their lives.A distinction worth bearing in mind as Britainrolls outthe red carpet for US big tech, thereby outsourcing a modern industrial revolution still in its infancy. Photographers, coders and writers, for example, would sympathise with the powerlessness felt by working people who saw customary protections swept away in a search for enhanced productivity and profit. Unlicensed use of their creative labour to train generative AI hasdeliveredvast revenues to Silicon Valley while rendering their livelihoods increasingly precarious.The wider public shares such concerns. According to newresearchby the Tony Blair Institute, a large plurality of Britons see AI as a risk to the economy, rather than as an opportunity. Viewed from the perspective of actual and future workers, it is not hard to understand why. Automating swathes of the labour force may become a growth machine when it comes to the size of shareholders’ dividends; it is less clear what the upside is for the human beings displaced.AI already appears to besqueezingthe number of entry-level jobs in white-collar occupations. Energy‑hungry datacentres championed in the UK-US prosperity deal will generate significant (and undiscussed) environmental costs, butlittlenew work. More broadly, there is public unease regarding AI’s cultural impact. The Post Officescandallaid bare the dangers of allowing anonymous tech to take charge of people’s lives at work and beyond. Opaque and insidious algorithms sow discord and fuel extremism and disinformation online, a social ill embodied in the sneering trollery of Elon Musk.Yet as it desperately scrambles to attract private investment to kickstart growth, Labour appears content to hand the keys to Britain’s tech future to the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft. Sir Nick Clegg, who shouldknow, haspointedout that this will mean the game is played on Silicon Valley’s terms, and risks hollowing out public capacity and oversight. When the stakes are so high, and the perception that power in society has been captured by remote, self-serving elites is already pervasive, that is a reckless approach.Last month, the Trades Union Congresspublisheda “worker-first” strategy for AI, noting that “unmanaged disruption is not inevitable or acceptable”. Its call for employees’ voices to be heard when new technologies are deployed should be heeded, not least from the perspective of growth. From the creative industries to social care, those who work in affected sectors are best placed to understand the societal benefits AI can bring, as well as the dangers its introduction may pose.As the economist Mariana Mazzucato hasargued, state investment drove many of the technological breakthroughs that launched us into the era of AI. It now needs to be managed in the interests of the common good, which means a public conversation that extends well beyond the commercially driven priorities of big tech. A Labour government should have no qualms about convening that wider debate, and it should start in the workplace.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingWork & careersSilicon ValleyTUCNvidiaMicrosofteditorialsShareReuse this content"

And while his skepticism of bad numbers may look cynical and political, there are reasons to look at the numbers cautiously.According tosome reports, staffing shortages “have forced the US federal government to scale back the price checks it uses to calculate the inflation rate” with the labor department reportedly admitting that it had to “cut back” on its price checking nationwide and even suspend its surveys in some cities due to manpower shortages.Manpower shortage or not, is the agency’s methodology even reliable?Arecent studypublished by the Petersen Institute of International Economics looked at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) – the most widely watched measure of the costs of goods and services.The CPI uses “weights” of different goods and services purchased that are out of date, according to the Petersen Institute, could be skewed by products that may not be well-represented (i.e. bought by more consumers than others) and may not adequately adjust for changes in product characteristics like quantities to reflect strategies like “shrinkflation”.Cynics might want to claim the stats are influenced by political bias but the authors of the Petersen study concluded that the basic methodology for calculatinginflationis “robust and defensible”. But still, they say, improvements – such as using alternative data sources, updating expenditure weights more frequently and constructing price indexes by income group, region, or other subpopulations – are neededSo where else can we look for evidence? Here’s five alternatives that give a rounder picture of the true rate of inflation.Truflation Price IndexThis research firmcombinesinflation data from 30 data partners that track prices in housing, transportation, food, durables and other areas.Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Price IndexThe ISM is known for measuring economic activity based on actual date reported by both itsmanufacturingandserviceindustry members each month. For me, this is a great leading indicator as the prices being paid by ISM members are ultimately going to find their way down to our pockets when their products and services are ultimately consumed.Adobe Digital Price IndexOnline digital tools provider Adobe publishesthis indexto track thousands of actual prices for everything bought online, including electronics, office supplies, groceries and toys.National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) PricingFor more than 50 years, the NFIB has been takingfinancial and narrative informationsubmitted by its members to determine overall small business optimism (which has been trending higher over the past few months). Like the ISM price index, this is another leading indicator I watch because part of this data gatheringincludes prices. This past month, the organization reported that the net percent of owners raising average selling prices fell three points from July to a net 21% (seasonally adjusted), the lowest reading of this year.Bloomberg Commodity IndexThisdaily indextracks futures contracts for 24 commodities across six sectors (energy, grains, softs, industrial metals, precious metals, and livestock) which include gold, Brent crude oil, natural gas, aluminum, copper, corn, soybeans, cotton, cocoa and live cattle.Zillow Rent IndexThisindex– which launched in 2020 – tracks the typical market rent for a given geographic area (national, state, metro, city or neighborhood) based on rental listings and data from public sources. It’s designed to track changes in asking rents over time, not just a sample of lease renewals. According to the company, their statistical models adjust for differences in property characteristics in an effort to capture the “true market rent trends” rather than just shifts in the mix of listed units.So what’s the takeaway?According to the BLS annualized inflation is currently running at2.9%. Truflation’s inflation rate is 2% (and down from 3% at the beginning of the year). Zillow’s index is 2.44 %. Bloomberg’s commodity index is up 3.6% since the beginning of the year. Adobe’s online price index has decreased 3% year over year. Even taking commodities into consideration, it seems like consumer prices are lower than what the BLS is reporting.But clouds are gathering. That’s because the ISM says that both manufacturing and service prices have risen more than 15% since the beginning of the year, despite a decline from last month, the NFIB’s members are saying that their price increases remain above the average of a net 13%, suggesting continued inflationary pressure.Are these numbers gospel? Of course not. But, taken together, I think they give a more impartial, data-driven view of inflation than what we’re seeing from the federal government. This tells me that inflation is going to rise in the coming months, mostly thanks to tariffs.Explore more on these topicsInflationUS small businessUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Must the UK remake our odious politicians?Dave SchillingA recent trip to Britain from my native California presented some worrying truths about our shared political futureSun 28 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 09.20 EDTShareI’ve always wanted to visit the UK. This might sound absurd to you, considering I’m from California – home of sunshine, half-naked bodies and the studio where they film Jeopardy. What could possibly pull me to the cold, damp, gray shores of England? The oppressively brown food? The dodgy colonialist history? Tesco? No, it was the glowing box that vibrated with whatever passed for culture in my small town: television.British TV was an obsession in my house, via those purveyors of affordable, exotic entertainment at PBS. We’d get classy fare through theMasterpiece Theatreseries, but also more downmarket comedies likeAre You Being Served?(a variety of sexually obsessed retail clerks trip over each other) orKeeping Up Appearances(lower-middle-class oafs desperately wish they were posh). I had no concept of what people were saying in their thick accents or most of the jokes meant, especially the double entendres.But even the dumb shows seemed smart. I learned more about European history from Rowan Atkinson, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton’sBlackadderseries than I ever did in school. British television, especially the comedies, assumed a certain futility to life. It probably won’t get better. In fact, it might get worse. Often. This is a tradition that carried over to other classic sitcoms such as I’m Alan Partridge and The Office, which I discovered in college. If it’s a small-town crime drama or a half-hour comedy, British TV is usually going to express something close to misery by the time the credits roll. In America’s land of good cheer and opportunity, this was like a salve of reality.Our research makes it clear: by capitulating to the right, Labour is driving voters to Reform UK | Tarik Abou-Chadi and Stuart Turnbull-DugarteRead moreMy obsession with all things British (even the food) carried on into adulthood, but despite that abiding interest, I had never visited the UK until this year. I seemed to have picked the worst year imaginable. Or maybe the best. The country is in the midst of a political upheaval. Nigel Farage’s far-right Reform party is on the march, commanding the polls. Obviously, the first thing I did when I arrived was turn on the television to see how it compared to American media, which feels at all times likeJurassic Park after the electricity went out.In the US, we are obsessed with remaking British TV shows – The Office, Steptoe and Son, Absolutely Fabulous. But the British would rather remake our politicians. They’re just not as good at it.Farage is the English Trump, but only in the sense that he is dangerously unqualified for leadership and therefore believes he is actually qualified. He recently claimed that migrants were “eating swans” in parks. I can imagine a TV executive angrily shaking their fist at the ham-handed adaptation of Trump’s infamous dog comment.“Who would actually eat a swan? You don’t even get it!”Nigel Farage is just not the showman that Trump is, any more than Doctor Who is as flashy as Star Wars or Star Trek. British news is less single-mindedly fixated on him than we are with Trump. Because Farage is so tacky and second rate, it’s been easier for the UK media to shoo him away like a fly up until now. When I was in London this summer, it was the opposite of the wall-to-wall Trumpathon that is America. Maybe that’s why I found ITV’s Good Morning Britain so relaxing to watch. The noticeable lack of screaming or partisan rancor. The reassuring presence of former Labour politician andex-Strictly Come Dancing competitor Ed Balls. Whatever it is, I came to love my daily dose of dry toast in TV form. One recent GMB episode featured a segment on anapp designed to identify and catalog butterflies around the UK. It was sweet, until the presenter reminded the audience that this is important because butterflies are dying off due to the climate crisis. Even cheerful news segments need to remind you that life is a series of tiny hells.I did a few things besides watch TV, though. The Tate Modern is easily the best contemporary art museum I’ve ever been to. I think reading a newspaper in a pub at 11am is as civilized as life gets. I can’t tell if Waitrose is posh or a Trader Joe’s equivalent, but they had everything I needed, plus delicious cheeses I’ve never heard of.The Barbican Estate, where I stayed, is an architectural marvel that could never exist in a place like California. It’s purposefully difficult to get around, has an art gallery and a movie theater, and people crush bottles of wine openly in the courtyard long past bedtime. I found that people took tube etiquette so seriously that I wondered if not giving up your seat for an elderly person was now punishable by stoning. I’m sure there’s plenty of horrendous behavior in London, but I was so eager to enjoy myself that I didn’t even notice. And almost no one I met in London asked me, the dumb American, about Donald Trump. Almost.The face of populism is the frozen scowl of Trump, the vacuous grin of FarageMy one conversation about Trump took place in Whitechapel, a neighborhood known for a series of murders attributed to Jack the Ripper that is now home to a significant immigrant population – particularly people from Bangladesh. A sign was added to the Whitechapel tube station in Bengali, whichupset Elon Musk(who is definitely not British) and assorted rightwing politicians obsessed with fighting multiculturalism. I was eager to have a proper British curry experience before flying back to LA and was given a recommendation for a restaurant in Whitechapel by my friend and co-creator ofThe Inbetweeners, Iain Morris (who is definitely British). I was asked very specifically not to name the restaurant, lest it become discovered by more brutish American tourists like myself. That’s whatDishoomis for, after all.After settling the bill for my meal, the waiter/proprietor asked me what I thought of “him.”The movie had not come out yet, so I realized “him” meant Trump. I said I was generally not a fan, that he would not be fond of a place like the restaurant we were in, and that I definitely did not vote for him. He chuckled, as though I had read him a joke written on a popsicle stick. “Every time an American comes in here and I ask if they voted for him, they say no,” he responded. I surmised that that’s because the people who did vote for him aren’t stopping into a curry house in Whitechapel on their UK vacation.The British and American political dilemmas can sometimes look eerily similar. Trump and Farage have both stuck around far longer than anyone expected. Anti-immigrant and anti-trans sentiment animate the right wings of both nations. The“unite the kingdom” rallyfeels like a hyper-charged Maga gathering. But, like the quality of our respective cheeses, we couldn’t be more different. Nihilism and a crazed impulse to start over from scratch animates both of our cultural schisms, but while in the US the face of populism is the frozen scowl of Trump, in Britain, it’s the vacuous grin of Farage. Arecent feature in the New Yorkerdescribed the mood of the Reform party conference as jubilant. Farage is always smiling, which is either comforting to his sympathizers or terrifying for his detractors. Regardless, Reform is capturing Britain’s imagination precisely because of that smile.Labour and the Tories bumble around desperate to prove that they are the most serious, when what the nation seems to want is someone who admits that things aren’t great, but that the country (and the world) have a future. The future Reform offers is a terrifying one that looks a lot more like the worst aspects of modern America, but it’s a vision nonetheless. What afflicts both the US and the UK is a feeling of emptiness, of futility, and a growing realization that we’re all stuck. Technology, grand economic forces we don’t understand, and a dwindling social safety net have left the average citizen in a state of abandonment and isolation. The Democratic party and the Labour party just want things to go back to a mythical state of normalcy, hopelessly nostalgic and out of touch. This has pushed the dreamers, the malcontents and the futurists to the fringes. Maga and Reform seem nostalgic, but what they offer is not a return to anything, but a radical reshaping and perversion of the system that keeps our society functioning.When faced with the grim reality of British TV every day on my trip, I yearned for a bit of good ol’ Yankee razzle-dazzle – a dose of mindless optimism. I think maybe the most potent similarity between our two countries is that we could both use some of that right now.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpNigel FarageTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

We think he’s done a fantastic job. Like us, he inherited a mess.” Donald Trump gave his enthusiastic endorsement to Javier Milei’s radical economic experiment when the pair met in New York last week.The US has declared itself ready to offer more than rhetorical support to the chainsaw-wielding Argentinian president in the coming days, as Buenos Aires stands on the brink of a fresh financial crisis.The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the US was “ready to do what is needed”. He suggested the Federal Reserve could offer Buenos Aires a $20bn (£15bn) dollar swap line – a crucial crisis-fighting tool – or the US could even buy the country’s bonds directly.Would Javier Milei’s dollar plan for Argentina be an economic experiment too far?Read moreUS administrations have rallied support for Argentinian governments in the past – Bill Clinton was a fan of Carlos Menem’s 1990s reforms, for example. But Trump’s readiness to wade in directly is the latest example of his determination to use economic tools for political ends: in this case, propping up an ideological ally.Milei swept into power two years ago, on a wave of frustration and discontent with the economic status quo.Like Trump and Boris Johnson, he eschewed the usual conventions of politics and promised to smash up the establishment and remake the state on behalf of the people.But while Milei’s political playbook may echo Trump’s, with its embrace of chaos and showbiz, his economic policies owe something to another radical with big hair – Margaret Thatcher, whom the Argentinian president has called “brilliant”.Like the Thatcher governments in the UK, Milei sees slaying the dragon of inflation as an overriding priority. The challenge inArgentinais on a completely different scale to 1980s Britain, however: the inflation rate peaked at more than 25% a month soon after Milei came to power.But aspects of his approach, including a systematic onslaught on trade union rights, public spending cuts and a wave of privatisations, have echoes of Thatcherism.Despite lacking a parliamentary power base, Milei has succeeded in cutting deep into pensions and public sector wages – and more than 48,000 public sector workers have lost their jobs.He travelled to CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, in the US, to pose on stage next to a chainsaw-wielding Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) was partly inspired by Milei’s aggressive style.Argentina’s tough policies have won plaudits from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which granted a new $20bn lifeline to Argentina in April.On stage at the IMF’s meetings in Washington that month, its managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, proudly pinned on to her green jacket a tiny silver chainsaw badge, handed to her by Argentina’s minister for deregulation, Federico Sturzenegger.But while Milei’s “shock therapy” may have met with approval in Washington – and indeed in financial markets – the Argentinian economist and campaigner Lucía Cirmi Obón highlights its human impact.“The macroeconomic changes implemented by Milei have not shown – nor do I believe they will show – any positive impact on people’s quality of life. In practice, what we are seeing is an economic recession,” she told the Guardian.“The main reasons are that real wages fell, and the opening of imports also dismantled a large part of national industry. On top of that, there were cuts to the number of people receiving a pension, support for childcare, for people with disabilities who used to receive pensions. All of the policies the population used to receive from the state have been reduced.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Household debt is rising, and because many of the occupations targeted by cuts are female-dominated, the gender pay gap has widened, undoing six years’ worth of progress.Obón adds that while Milei’s approach was meant to unleash the corporate sector, to open the way for surging economic growth, investment as a share of GDP has actually fallen.Meanwhile, determined to squash inflation, Milei has maintained the peso’s link to the dollar – a trigger for so many crises in Argentina over the years.For several decades, the peso has been pegged – within limits – to the greenback, which circulates within Argentina as an alternative currency, in which many citizens like to hold their savings, especially in times of trouble.Milei had advocated full dollarisation during the election campaign – a policy that would leave Argentina without the right to set its own interest rates. When he came to power and allies rejected that plan, he insteaddevalued the peso by more than half, willing to wear the resulting inflation in the hope of stimulating exports.But the currency has nevertheless come under continued selling pressure – exacerbated by the political uncertainty unleashed when Milei suffereda disastrous showing in local legislative elections in Buenos Aires province, which he had himself called a “life or death battle”.Since those local elections, and amid a mounting clamour of corruption claims against Milei’s powerful sister, Karina, the peso sell-off has accelerated. The central bank burned through more than $1bn of reserves in a week trying to prop up the currency, before Bessent announced Washington was ready to step in.As well as political fellow feeling, some experts suggest geopolitics may have been another motivation for Washington’s intervention, with China becoming increasingly influential in Latin America.The peso rallied and the markets calmed after Bessent’s comments, but as the costs of “shock therapy” bite and Milei looks to crucial midterm elections in October, the Argentinian public face a volatile period ahead.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaEconomics viewpointCurrenciesEconomicsAmericasTrump administrationBondsJavier MileicommentShareReuse this content"

Often associated with Enlightenment philosophers such as Locke and Rousseau and extremely influential with US founders, the social contract refers to the idea that the government requires the consent of the governed to be legitimate.Crucially, in exchange for this consent, the government accepts certain limits on what it can do. In other words, the government also has to follow the rules.The US has suffered crises of legitimacy before. Arguably, the 1964 Civil Rights Act emerged from just such a crisis. At a base level, the act conceded that to be legitimate, the government needed to actually recognize the rights of all its citizens – not just those of a certain race. It didn’t fix everything, but it was an important step in creating a stronger social contract for the next generation.The Trump administration, however, hasreversed course on civil rights, abandonedlimited governmentand eviscerated the social contract beyond recognition. Fromdefying courts, toattacking judges, tocapriciously revokinglegal immigration statuses, toexecuting suspected drug smugglers, there is no shortage of examples.One example that deserves a lot more attention than it is currently receiving, however, is the horror story of Trump’s collaboration with a megaprison inEl Salvador.To summarize, in March, the Trump administration forciblysent more than 250 people, mostly Venezuelans accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, to El Salvador to be detained in a paid arrangement with Salvadorian president Nayib Bukele. Investigative reporting quickly confirmed that the entire operation – ostensibly to target dangerous criminals – was based on lies: only a small percentage of the targets hadany criminal recordat all, accusations of gang affiliations came fromspurious evidence, and many of the detainees had followed the rules toenter the country legally.Nonetheless, instead of enjoying the rights guaranteed by US law, they suddenly facedimprisonmentand allegedtorture. Lowercourtstried to halt the flights, but the Trump administration acted anyway.All of this would be horrifying enough as an isolated incident, but the legal saga surrounding the case has further disturbing implications. At first, the administration justified its actions through acontroversial 18th-century lawallowing the government to expel “alien enemies” in times of war – even though the country was not at war, and these were not “alien enemies”.However, the administration soon switched to a different argument that might be described like this:it doesn’t matter how many laws we broke– as long as the victims end up in a prison in a foreign country,US courts have no powerto stop us. Also, we may do thesame to US citizens.When the Trump administration first made these claims, news agencies covered them with much alarm. However, commentators since have avoided stating an uncomfortable truth: the administration was right. Apparently, it didn’t matter how many laws they broke. No one stopped them, nor have they facedany consequences.Significantly, the supreme court has played a critical role in this legitimacy crisis, not only by giving the Trump administration an unprecedentedseries of wins– often employingmind-bogglinglogic and blatant distortions ofplain text– but also gutting the mechanisms that courts have to stop the executive branch when it gets caught doing illegal things.Here the battle over injunctions is revealing. In normal times, if the government gets caught doing something illegal, then judges have the power to issue an injunction to make the government actors in question stop. Government officials may appeal to a higher court, but in the meantime, the injunction prevents them from continuing to do harm while the case plays out.Now, think about a reality where injunctions don’t exist. If courts can’t issue an injunction to stop the government from doing illegal things, then no matter how blatantly the government is violating people’s rights, it can keep doing it unimpeded so long as the case stays tied up in appeals – a process that often takes years. In this scenario, law exists in theory, but there are virtually no limits to what the government can do in practice.This is shockingly close to the reality that the supreme court has now created. By rushing to overturn injunctions with no regard towho is being harmed, as well as creating seeminglyarbitrary technicalitiesto prevent future injunctions, the message from the supreme court is clear:It doesn’t matter how many laws they broke.Now that Trump is in office, courts are simplynot supposed to stopexecutive officials from putting Trump’s agenda into practice, regardless of how unlawful those practices might be.The extreme inability of our government to police itself becomes even clearer when it is placed alongside Brazil – the second-largest democracy in the Americas – where the former president Jair Bolsonaro was recentlyconvictedfor an attempted coup: after losing re-election in 2022, Bolsonaro tried a variety of tactics to stay in power, includingincitinghis followers toswarm government buildingsto physically stop the peaceful transfer of power. If that sounds familiar, that’s because it was, indeed, strikingly similar to what Trump did in theJanuary 6 riotsafter losing the 2020 election.Now, consider the difference in how our respective constitutional systems handled this. In the US, the supreme court not only blocked any potential trial for Trump’s role in the highly visible attempt to overthrow the government; it also took the opportunity to give himsweeping immunityfor just about anything else. According to the logic of themajority decision,it doesn’t matter how many laws he broke. Being president is hard, and it is even harder if he has to worry about getting in trouble for breaking the law. So he should just have a virtuallicense to commitcrimes. That way, he can take “vigorous, decisive” action.The Braziliansupreme courttook a strikingly different approach. Apparently, itdoesmatter how many laws Bolsonaro broke. Prosecutors presented strong evidence that he broke the law, so the supreme court decided that he should be prosecuted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Brazilian courts refused to back down, however, and the trial ultimately resulted in a conviction.After watching this play out, I can’t help but wonder: what would it look like if my country had the courage to hold a lawless executive accountable?Here I want to be clear that in posing this question, I am calling forpeacefulaction. People will have to decide for themselves what this peaceful action looks like, though there is strength in numbers, and I think those numbers exist. AsI have written previously, the nationwide protests against capricious and unlawful immigration raids are a testament to how many people are already fed up, and looking for ways to remind the government that it owes us rights.I also don’t think that questioning the government’s legitimacy right now is radical, partisan or even unpatriotic. In fact, nothing I am saying here contradicts what I was taught about legitimate government in my fifth grade social studies class at a conservative, patriotic public school in rural Texas. It is simply our civic duty to call out the government when it strays from the social contract.What’s giving me hope nowIn the classic Latin American protest anthemMe Gustan los Estudiantes, the celebrated Chilean composer Violeta Parra lauds the indomitable spirit of students. “Long live the students!” the song declares. They are the “garden of our joy” because they fearlessly defend truth, even when those in power try to force them to accept lies.Students give me hope as well.Overwhelmingly, the students that I have worked with over the years have shown themselves to be insightful thinkers with an unyielding dedication to truth, empathy, and solidarity. This is hopeful for many reasons, not the least of which being that this seems to terrify the people in power. Indeed, the same architects of our legitimacy crisis are also waging anaggressive campaignto squash campus protests, restrict institutional autonomy, and generally abolish academic freedom. Clearly, academic institutions have the potential to serve as a counterweight to government abuses. Otherwise, why would a lawless government be trying so hard to suppress us?Sadly, too many university leaders are now sacrificing academic legitimacy bycaving to government pressure. The situation is bleak on this front as well, yet the battle is far from over.Our best hope: we need to be as fearless as our students.Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationFighting BackUS constitution and civil libertiesBrazilTrump administrationAmericasJair BolsonaroUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Suddenly, it all feels a bit 1939Simon TisdallForget the US president’s seeming volte-face on Ukraine this week: he and Putin fundamentally agree that European liberal democracy is the problemSun 28 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 11.54 EDTShareFor many people in easternEurope, August 1939 may not feel that long ago. That was the moment Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union secretly agreed to partition Poland and forcibly subsume the sovereign Baltic republics and Finland into their totalitarian “spheres of influence”. The world knows what came next.Now the question arises: is it happening again? This time around, it’s Donald Trump’s United States and Vladimir Putin’s Russia making the big geopolitical power-play – and, once again, all of Europe is potential prey. Notwithstandinglast week’s sparringover Ukraine, the two leaders’ core aims appear closely aligned.Physical subjugation of the European continent is not a Trump objective (unlike, perhaps, in Venezuela, Canada or Greenland). But US efforts to dominate the continent through political interference, ideological subversion, economic blackmail, unregulated big-tech predation and the projection of conservative,Christian nationalist culturalbeliefs amount to much the same thing.Putin’s methods are cruder, yet his agenda mirrors Trump’s. He will not let go of Ukraine. He isintensifying, and leveraging, the Russian military threat, from the Baltic states to the Black Sea, including in Moldova, Romania andGeorgia.Russian hybrid warfare– sabotage, cyber-attacks, online trolling and disinformation – is now a fact of daily western European life.Trump, failed coup leader, and Putin, indicted war criminal, are not in formal alliance, yet. They have not agreed a 1939-style Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact. But there is extensive common ground. Both despise European liberal democracy, equal rights and multiculturalism. Both are viscerally hostile to the EU. Both hanker for past imperial glories; both reject UN “globalism” and international law. Their anti-democratic ultranationalism nurtures foul ideas of ethnic and racial supremacy that most Europeans had long consigned to history.Trump makes no secret of his desire to normalise US relations with Russia. This, he claims, would lead to vast, mutually beneficialmoney-making opportunities. When he complained last week that Putin has“let me down”, he was not so much talking about his embarrassingAlaska peace summitflop but about the Russian president’s refusal to cut a deal and cash in.Trump’s supposed pro-Kyiv shift typifies his pinball policymaking, which ricochets randomly from one wacky idea to another. It will not endure. His warning thatRussia faces“big economic trouble” was his way of pushing Putin into doing business while leaving Ukraine and European Nato members to manage the long-term Russian threat alone.The US president is urging others to cut off Russian oil, but the US itself does nothing. Promised tougher sanctions are all talk. He refuses to resume direct military aid to Kyiv, or punish Russian incursions into Nato territory. In this context, his prediction that Ukraine willsomehow regain all its lost territoryis cruel mockery.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin meets Donald Trump meets in Alaska, 15 August 2025.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersTrump and Putin’s political pressure campaigns are mutually reinforcing. Both support European hard-right, populist-nationalist parties and politicians. In February, the US vice-president, JD Vance, directly intervened in Germany’s election,siding with the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland. Trump’sbacking for the Polish presidential candidate Karol Nawrockimay have helped the conservative nationalist score a narrow victory.Similar Russian influence campaigns, plus dirty tricks and alleged vote-buying, have marred electionsin Romaniaand Moldova, whichgoes to the pollsthis weekend. Will Trump and Putin conspire to ensure a hard-right populist succeeds Emmanuel Macron as French president in 2027? It’s a legitimate worry.Both leaders exploit Europe’s open societies, stirring political pots and promoting favourites. In Trump’s case, one such is Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s rightwing prime minister. Another is British anti-migrant populist Nigel Farage, the quintessential useful idiot. In Putin’s case, it’s pro-Moscow leaders such asHungary’s Viktor OrbánandSlovakia’s Robert Fico.The most obvious manifestation of hostile US economic pressure is Trump’s unilateral tariffs, which foreshadowed the summer’s risibly lopsided EU-US trade deal. American big-tech’s £31bn UK investment, announced during Trump’s quasi-regal state visit, carries awhiff of neocolonialism. Buying British is fine.

Deniable cyber-attacks cripple key European industries and institutions. An undersea communications cable or gas pipeline mysteriously ruptures. Dronesforce the closure of airports. Undocumentedmigrants are directedacross EU borders. Online scams proliferate. Methods vary. Yet the economic warfare waged on Europe in tandem by Moscow and Washington is real.A disturbing report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) and European Cultural Foundation claims the US is waging a broadculture war against Europe. Yet its central finding – that Trump is promoting political and ideological allies while simultaneously trying to sideline and divide the EU – applies with equal force to Putin’s Russia.The defence of “free speech”, mounted by Vance during his infamous Munichsecurity conference attackon Europe’s supposed retreat from “some of its most fundamental values”, is a key cultural battleground. And here is another convergence. For Trump and Putin, speech is free – if they agree with the speaker. But not otherwise. (Ask Jimmy Kimmel, or the late Alexei Navalny.) Trump and Putin: two clowns resembling Laurel and Hardy – except their gags are not jokes.The ECFR report optimistically suggests the dual assault from east and west is drawing Europeans together. Yet, as ever in Europe, what’s lacking is urgency and strong, united leadership. What’s lacking is clear understanding that this US administration, no longer a trusted friend, is turning into an outright enemy; and that the Russian bear, a species once thought extinct, is back with a vengeance.The evidence grows. So does the threat. Planned or not, Trump and Putin – like-minded, amoral, authoritarian apex predators – are working together, or at least in parallel, to undercut European democracy, security, prosperity and progressive values. It looks like a concerted pincer movement. It feels like 1939.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeSecond world warcommentShareReuse this content"

His administration unveiled contentious claims about the causes of autism – pregnant women taking Tylenol, also known as paracetamol – and pushed for research to find a “cure”. It got me thinking about how to cope psychologically, and my conclusion – and that of many of my friends in the autism community – is that you have to laugh or you’ll cry.There’s a saying that when you’ve met one autistic child, you’ve met one autistic child. I’ve never loved the “autism as superpower” narrative, and how it erases those with high-support needs and the challenges autistic people can face. Equally, Trump’s framing of autism as a tragedy and a disease in need of curing isdeeply problematic, so I feel it’s important to highlight some of the incredible, brilliant things about autism. The fact is that the autistic children I’ve met have more to teach a man like Trump, more than he is ever capable of learning. Things such as:A capacity for deep, intense focusNot a quality that has ever troubled Trump, whose scattergun approach to politics causes predictable chaos. Hyperfocus, or the ability to obsess intensely on one topic or problem, is a trait that has almost certainly advanced humanity’s onward progress in every field imaginable, and it’s one that many autistic people share. I know one autistic seven-year-old whose obsession with the Roman empire means he knows more about politics, history, colonialism and war than the current leader of the so-called free world.Adherence to facts and logicYes, one autistic kid’s devotion to facts may mean having to hear everything possible there is to know about sharks – at length and on an extremely regular basis (who doesn’t love sharks, though?) But know what else it means? There is no hiding, as many parents who have had to endure a thorough cross-examination about Father Christmas will well know. Some autistic people also say they find it difficult to tell lies or be dishonest. Meanwhile, Trump made 30,573false or misleading claimsduring his first term.Empathy and a strong sense of social justiceIt’s a myth that autistic people can’t feel empathy – whereas Trump is incapable of showing it. Many autistic people have talked about feeling empathy at such powerful, profound levels that the suffering of other people, or animals, can be deeply distressing. It can also be politically galvanising. A couple of friends’ autistic children have recently been showing intense concern for Palestine, and have been waving flags and banging pots in solidarity (my friend’s son is now taking a little break from thinking about it, because it’s making him “too sad”). Greta Thunberg’shorror at the climate catastrophe, and her deep empathy for people and animals, is what made her become an activist before she’d even left childhood. Meanwhile, Trump spends his timebullying the very people, such as Thunberg, who want to make a change in the world.Exceptional memoryOn the one hand, we have Trump’s unfinished train of thought, and on the other, you have some autistic children’s astonishing ability to remember whole train timetables, film scripts, books, dates or number sequences.JoyI’ve always thought that autistic joy is some of the purest joy. I’ll never forget another mum telling me how sad she was when her daughter stopped hand flapping – a way of showing excitement that autistic people call a stim. “She showed her joy with her whole body,” she said. My brother also hand-flapped, and other kids used to make fun of it (doingmocking impressionsof people with disabilities is ahobby they sharewith the US president). How sad that more of us can’t show our happiness while being entirely free of self-consciousness. My brother’s ability to find joy in a song, a waterfall, the movement of a shadow, is something that inspires me every day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My brother doesn’t, but while he doesn’t show his love through physical affection, he shows it in other ways. He can’t speak fluently, but one of the phrases (calledGestalts) he does say is: “Knock on the door, mum’s coming!” That’s because when she visits him at his care home, she always knocks on the door. My brother may be one of the autistic people who, according to Robert F Kennedy Jr, will never “write a poem” or “go on a date”, but I believe there is more love in that sentence than in any of the Republican party’s vile hate speech. Forget paying taxes, or playing baseball (bizarre criteria from RFK for being a proper member of society, anyway).

Encountering occasional racism has been a fact of life for people of colour in most countries in the west. Emboldened by the far-right movements, racist voices are now becoming louder and moving into the mainstream.One of the emergent themes within the therapy room has involved a resurgence of racial trauma, especially for those who have previously experienced significant such harm.Every migrant or person of colour has a different relationship with race and the culture around them, but certain themes predominate when navigating life as a cultural minority, including seemingly innocuous “othering” (“oh, how is your English so good?”), unspoken discrimination in employment, stereotypical beliefs (all south Asians are truck drivers), deliberate ignorance, scapegoating (house prices are rising because of immigrants) and outright hatred (“go back to where you came from”). Many people of colour have also experienced frank and outright abuse and violence because of racism.Breaking free from resentment: the hidden cost of revenge and the healing power of forgiveness | Gill Straker and Jacqui WinshipRead moreAisha* was one of these people. She is a young woman of Pakistani origin and had been seeing me for therapy to manage some difficulties with her family. Aisha said she had also experienced an assault in adolescence by Caucasian peers from school, and believed that this was racially charged, though the school denied this at the time. She had initially started seeing a psychoanalytic practitioner but stopped seeing them when they tried to interpret her reaction to a racist comment by her manager as a transference reaction deriving from childhood. Her experiences with therapy had been mixed and she struggled with the quick injunction to “put up boundaries” she had received from Caucasian therapists, with limited recognition of the cultural context she resided in. While therapists from any background can work very successfully with people of colour, it does require a level of sensitivity, willingness to learn, and to incorporate an understanding of structural issues such as colonialism and discrimination into therapy.Within the context of increasing anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, Aisha found she was hypervigilant and anxious about the possibility of another assault. She said she had nightmares about the attack and was starting to perceive danger in her daily life. She worked as a nurse and was subject to a lot of racism from clients, and much subtler racism from colleagues and management. She said her typical manner of smiling and ignoring it was becoming difficult to continue. She found herself so angry that she was clenching her teeth at night and was diagnosed with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ).My first therapy task was to understand her culture instead of making assumptions. I also needed to reflect the reality of what Aisha had experienced and to sit with her in her distress, instead of moving into a glib intervention such as reframing her thinking. Exploring the disempowerment and fear she felt and normalising this in the context of the changes in the world was important, before we could move into more active interventions.My client attended therapy because he was mandated to. Making progress to stop his use of child exploitation material was vital | Ahona GuhaRead moreI noticed that Aisha’s threat perception was heightened, which is a typical response for those who have experienced trauma. I had to walk a fine line of helping her to see this without dismissing her understandable fear. We worked on some basic psychological techniques such as controlling what you can and letting go of the rest, but I made a point, as I do for all my clients experiencing structural harms, that describing the technique in this way might feel like slapping a Band-Aid on a broken leg. We utilised eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), a trauma treatment to reduce her anxiety about the assault, and additionally worked on some basic lifestyle interventions to ensure she had the building blocks of mental health in place.Learning to respond assertively to racist comments and behaviour was also an essential part of our work, and Aisha identified that racism from colleagues was much worse than racism from patients – though the latter was more overt. We worked on building some interpersonal effectiveness skills and rehearsing self-talk to support Aisha with combating these difficulties.While therapy was a tiny part of the puzzle, feeling understood and supported in her experience of disempowerment was important to Aisha. She was able to externalise the racism and see it as a reflection of the people engaging in this behaviour, rather than as a personal failing. She acknowledged this was sadly the reality of life for many migrants, but she now felt more empowered to make changes for herself and other people of colour in her workplace.*All clients are fictional amalgamsDr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

Keir Starmer, meanwhile, is clearly gripped by panic, now identifying Reform UK as his “enemy” and opposing some of Farage’s most terrifying plans, but still sometimes getting dangerously close to a polite version of the same language. Recent immigration, hewrote in the Telegraphlast week, was caused by “a hyper-liberal free-market viewpoint”. It has been “too easy” for people to enter the UK, and remain here illegally. Above all, he and his colleagues must use “every possible measure to deter migrants from entering British waters”.Along with the digital ID the government seems set to callthe “Brit card”, this is where we are: alarmingly close to the imaginings of all those dystopian films and TV shows –Children of Men, or the TV seriesYears and Years– but seemingly yet to fully comprehend it. And clearly, this is not just a matter of rhetoric and political noise. In the real world, you can see where we are heading, with sights that are deeply troubling, but that quickly settle into ordinariness.Ten days ago, I wasrecording an episodeof the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast in Kent, where I came across the most strange combination of scenes imaginable, like some scaled-down English version of the old east and west of Berlin. We were in the coastal town of Folkestone. On one side of a huge expanse of land was a symbol of what politicians call aspiration: a pristine new-build housing development, where a four-bedroom family home goes for about £350,000. But its grid of streets suddenly stopped at a crude wooden fence. I had to get close to see what lay beyond: serried lines of long, low brick buildings, surrounded by a fence whose entire length was covered in frayed blue fabric, seemingly put there so no one can see either in or out.This is Napier barracks: a Ministry of Defence sitestill being usedto house people seeking asylum. In 2020, the Home Office began using it as a “contingency” accommodation for single men. A year later,the high court saidthe facilities there did not meet “minimum standards”. In March of this year, there werereports that it would soon shut, before news that the so-called small boats influx meant it would have to remain open. For now, it stands as the embodiment of a belief shared across politics: that in the face of myths about people waiting for decisions from the Home Office living in pampered luxury, their lives must be made aspinched and deprivedas possible.More than anywhere else I have been,Kentis full of symbols of how politics and policy are being reshaped by the west’s growing hostility to outsiders. Dover is more spruced up than the last time I visited, but still feels neglected. Here, you can join in the grim local sport of watching from the cliffs for illicit new arrivals. During an hour of vox-popping, it was not hard to find people who expressed at least some sympathy for people who come to the UK across the Channel. “My first thought is whether they’re safe,” said one woman, who had seen lifeboats rescuing people at least twice. “There’s women and children … what they’re fleeing must be horrendous.” But it was equally easy to fall into conversations full of unabashed hostility. “I’ve no sympathy at all for ’em,” one man told me. “They come to the UK ’cause it’s an easy ticket, and they’re guaranteed money.”I went home, to one of Labour’s safest seats, and it felt like a newly minted Reform constituency | Kirsty MajorRead moreIn May, Reform UKwon 57 of the 81 seatson Kent county council. Its new leader is a former BBC journalist called Linden Kemkaran, who defected to Farage’s party from the Conservatives. She agreed to talk to us at her office in the county town of Maidstone, where the traditional fixtures and ornaments have been joined by signs of regime change.The local aspects of her job are focused on what she calls “efficiency savings”, but she has a habit of eagerly talking about policy areas way beyond her brief: part of her role, she says, is to generate noise and be a “nuisance”. For what it’s worth, she and her colleagues recently “undeclared” the climate emergency. And if she had complete control of asylum policy in Kent, she told me, “we’d stop the boats. People’s feet would not touch English soil.”I glanced at a small pile of Make Britain Great Again caps on a table near her desk, while she rhapsodised about her party’s mission. “We’re trying to undo the damage of 25 or 30 years of this ridiculous globalist progressive mindset … people will start to see that finally, somebody is in charge who has theballsto say uncomfortable things and make unpopular decisions, because they actually have conviction in their own beliefs.”That kind of talk worried me, I told her. Like a lot of people, I fear it’ll make society more divided and overheated. “I would say we were in that place already,” she said.Perhaps we are. In Faversham, Kent’s oldest market town, there were recently far-right protests outside a small facility used to house unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Writing in the Guardian,one witness described people“chanting ‘Sieg Heil’, hanging St George’s flags from lamp-posts, and crudely daubing roundabouts and zebra crossings with red crosses.”In other parts of the county, there is something you can almost feel as a physical sensation. It is stifling and prickly: a sort of social humidity, keenly felt by people who have come here from abroad. One woman I met had fled from Eritrea to war-torn Sudan, and then made it into the UK by hiding in a lorry when she was just 17. Having been given asylum, she is now an NHS nurse, and she feels a profound sense of alarm about what she hears people say about immigrants. “I do feel fear,” she told me. “Those people talk about me without my permission … I had to learn the language, and integrate with the country. I’m not against the flag. I’m not against anyone who feels proud to be British … But do you know my journey? Do you know my story?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether they like it or not, our politicians have given permission for old hatreds and prejudices to be given a 21st-century refit: if you are not white, or speak with a different accent or in a foreign language, you may find yourself at the cruellest intersection of politics, the online world and everyday life, being filmed for a TikTok video, shouted at in the street, or attacked. But precious few frontline politicians talk about any of that.Is it naive to wonder how little space our discourse now leaves for common humanity, charity and generosity? For the last week, I have thought a lot about Folkestone, the barracks, and that border between middle-English comfort and threadbare privation, and a question that ought to haunt us all. Do the people in the new-build homes ever empathise with the unfortunate souls just over the fence?

Writers remember his greatnessIan McMillan,Michael Billingtonand Edith HallSun 28 Sep 2025 09.50 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 09.51 EDTShareIan McMillan: ‘Tony Harrison gave me linguistic strength’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverPoet, playwright and broadcasterAs a young man in the 1980s I made my living going round libraries and community centres in South Yorkshire running poetry workshops for theWorkers’ Educational Association; at each workshop lots of older people turned up clutching their folders of verse and the poems usually rhymed and they were often in Yorkshire dialect.To my eternal shame I asked these people to take out the rhymes, to have a go at writing something that was “modern” and “contemporary”, and I jokingly threatened to chuck them out of the class if they brought another piece in dialect because I stupidly believed thatYorkshiredialect could only handle comic ideas, and that if it tried seriousness and gravitas it would just drown in a sea of Yorkshire pudding batter.And then I encountered the work ofTony Harrisonand my poetic life changed for the better. Here was a poet from not too far away from me; he was Leeds, I was Barnsley. In my mind, I had believed that places like ours were far from the literary centre of things and here was proof that that wasn’t the case. Here was a poet who used rhyme with skill and love. Here was a poet who used dialect to great effect, using it to deepen and strengthen the language rather than just standing at the side of it dealing out wisecracks in a flat cap and muffler.I read the poems from his School of Eloquence series of sonnets and was moved to tears by poems like Them and Uz with its battle cry of “and used mynameand my own voice: (uz) (uz) (uz) / ended sentences with by, with, from, / and spoke the language that I spoke at home” and its revelation to me that “All poetry (even Cockney Keats?) you see / ’s been dubbed by (az) into RP, / Received Pronunciation please believe (az) / your speech is in the hands of the Receivers.” Not any more! As he writes in the same poem: “So right, yer buggers, then. We’ll occupy / yer lousy leasehold poetry.” Harrison spoke to me directly as a grammar school lad who wanted to be a poet but was unsure about what his subject might be or what language he would use to write it in, or indeed, (and this seems preposterous now) whether someone could be a poetround here, wherever Round Here happened to be. He taught me that the way Ispeykis a fit and proper vehicle for poetry.The first time I presented a show on BBC Radio Sheffield someone came up to me in Barnsley bus station and said: “I heard thi. Tha can’t talk like that on’t wireless!” and I said: “But I were talking like thee,” and he said: “Ar. But tha can’t talk like that on’t wireless.” Which is more or less what a critic said when I had a series a few years later on Radio 4: “Ian McMillan, with his Eeee By Gum Ecky Thump, clogging up the airwaves like bindweed on an allotment.” Tony Harrison gave me the linguistic strength to reply to those accusations, and I’ll always be grateful for that.Mind you, once I’d discovered him I took some of his poems to a writing workshop in Rawmarsh near Rotherham and the class weren’t impressed. “He’s fromLeeds,” one of them said, putting his betting shop pen in his pocket. “They know nowt.”Edith Hall: ‘We have lost a towering wordsmith’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyClassics professor at Durham University and author of Tony Harrison: Poet of Radical ClassicismTony Harrison, my fierce, eloquent, sardonic, loyal friend of 35 years, who died last Friday, produced over his 88 years an abundance of plays and translations; it is scandalous that his pioneering film poems, especially Gaze of the Gorgon, The Shadow of Hiroshima and Prometheus, first broadcast on Channel 4, are not publicly available. He is most familiar as the author of poems about his working-class Leeds youth. Studying classics as a scholarship boy at Leeds Grammar School and Leeds University, he was hurt by the chasm that his widening intellectual horizons had exposed between him, his mother and his father, a taciturn baker. The pain is explored in his pivotal 1978 collection From the School of Eloquence.Hismost famous poem is V, written during the 1984-85 miners’ strike and representing the uncouth speech of an alienated skinhead; the 1987 televised version, directed by Richard Eyre, caused outrage. A Conservative MP tried to have the broadcast proscribed by tabling an early day motion entitled “Television Obscenity”. But the right’s real objection was to Harrison’s resolute support of the working class.His breakout 1970 collection The Loiners (residents of Leeds) won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial prize but offended many because it frankly discussed sexual relations with several women, and implied that political oppression was similar whether in England or behind the Iron Curtain.In 1981, when Peter Hall used Harrison’s extraordinary translation of Aeschylus’s Oresteia in a path-breaking production at the National Theatre designed by Harrison’s theatrical museJocelyn Herbert, they insisted on an all-male cast, as in the ancient theatre. Harrison believed this was the only way to apprehend the trilogy’s misogyny. Feminists complained that female actors had been deprived, as they saw it, of an opportunity. Supercilious critics deemed men wearing female costumes inappropriate to “high art”; they lambasted Harrison’s diction, designed to be delivered in a consonantal working-class Yorkshire accent by actors including his longtime collaborator,Barrie Rutter. As usual, unease with Harrison’s class politics masqueraded as aesthetic derision.Harrison’s profoundly class-conscious Trackers of Oxyrhynchus premiered in Delphi in 1988, featuring Rutter, Jack Shepherd and Juliet Stevenson. It incorporated fragments of a Sophoclean satyr drama — a genre requiring patricians to revel in asubversive musical-comedywith satyrs wearing semi-erect phalluses.View image in fullscreenThe Trackers of Oxyrhynchus revived at The Finborough Theatre in 2017.Trackersimpressed Alan Rusbridger, then features editor of the Guardian, who in 1991 invited Harrison to write about the Gulf war. Harrison responded with two celebrated poems, Initial Illumination and A Cold Coming. Harrison’s association with the newspaper continued, with gaps, for more than a decade. In September 1995, he witnessed the Bosnian war in person. He came under fire in an armoured vehicle, and the newspaper published his searing The Cycles of Donji Vakuf.It was at the time of Trackersthat I first met Tony, although I had seen the televised version of V and the Oresteiaand revered him. He was smaller than I expected, and quieter, but his electrifying presence changed the atmosphere in every room he entered. We clicked straightaway; I had recently finished my Oxford doctorate on what would now be called racist ideas in Greek tragedy, and felt alienated from the Oxford academic establishment. I had worked as a volunteer for the NUM during the miners’ strike and had become an ardent socialist. He could be trenchant, even rude to people who irritated him, but he always treated me the utmost respect, I think because we shared a dark and mordant sense of the absurd and a loathing for religious hypocrisy and the monarchy.We often met after that, always quaffing large quantities of good white wine, and eventually I edited his prose essays for publication and helped him research his brilliant radio play Iphigenia in Crimea. We went on an unforgettably riotous research trip to the ancient Greek sites in that peninsula, shortly before the Russian invasion, with his daughter Jane, his partner the actress Siân Thomas, and Black Sea archaeologist Professor David Braund. I later organised a conference and event at the British Academy for his 80th birthday, and was delighted by the queue of luminaries wanting to join in toasting him, including Andy Burnham, Lee Hall, Vanessa Redgrave and Melvyn Bragg.When Tony was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease a few years ago, he responded with grace, wit and courage, retiring completely from public life to be tenderly and selflessly nursed by his beloved Siân. She features in some of his most moving poems, especially the hilarious Fig on the Tyne and the valedictory Polygons. I visited as often as I could, and have the warmest memories of boozy lunches where we ranted at the corruption and egotism of those in power in the cosy kitchen and quiet garden of Tony’s modest Newcastle terraced house, with its bust of Milton greeting all who entered. He enjoyed even his last months, and could still recognise close friends as well as family. We have all lost a towering wordsmith, an inimitable poetic voice and a steadfast custodian of humane values, social justice and candour.Michael Billington: ‘His artistic manifesto should be required reading’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianTheatre critic and Guardian journalistPeter Hall once said of Tony Harrison: “We have a great poet back in the theatre.” What is impressive is that, in the late 20th century when prose was paramount, this learnedmetre-readerfrom Leeds should have proved so dramatically dominant. He did this through language that was robust, vigorous and direct and that always puts me in mind of a remark by Jean Cocteau that “theatrical poetry is not tenuous like gossamer but thick like the rigging of a ship and visible at a distance”.Harrison’s poetry had that high visibility but was also richly varied. Looking back over his work for the National Theatre I am struck by his capacity to encompass French comedy, Greek tragedy and medieval Mysteries with equal panache. He made a big impact in 1973 with his masterly version of The Misanthrope in a production whose dexterity – well, it was the work of John Dexter – I initially failed to grasp. But there was no doubting Harrison’s virtuosity in updating the text and matching the comic energy of Molière’s own verse. To take just one example, look at the way the heroine harpoons a friend’s fake rectitude: “She’d daub a fig leaf on a Rubens nude / But with a naked man she’s not a prude.”Harrison’s work on Phaedra Britannica and The Oresteia was no less impressive but it was in his version ofThe Mysteriesthat he showed an ability to match the earthy and the elevated that lies at the root of English drama. Realism and alliteration also achieved a perfect synthesis in a line like Judas’s self-justifying vaunt: “Bursar was I, balancing t’brethren’s budgeting book.” The Mysteries, among many other things, showed Harrison’s determination to heal the fracture between high and low culture.The great thing is that he was able to practise what he preached as proved by The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, first staged in Delphi in 1988 and two years later at the National. It showed two Oxford scholars discovering a lost Sophoclean satyr-play and then turning into its leading characters, Apollo and Silenus. My review was illustrated by a Nobby Clark photo showing three clog-dancing satyrs with prodigiously erect prosthetic phalluses: something that at the time caused a mixture of shock and delight. The published edition of the play came with a preface by Harrison that eloquently argued the case for a unified culture that ignored the divisions of class and category and that embraced the tragic and the comic, the mystic and the mundane. It was Harrison’s artistic manifesto and should still be required reading today.The Trackers marked yet another stage in Harrison’s multifarious career as he then increasingly directed his own work, made films for television and created live events in non-theatre spaces: one (Poetry or Bust) in a Yorkshire wool-combing shed, another (The Kaisers of Carnuntum) in a Roman stadium near Vienna, a third (The Labourers of Herakles) on an excavated site in Delphi. Harrison was always an explorer and pioneer pushing the boundaries of poetry in performance but I suspect he will be remembered theatrically for his ability to take classic texts and to prove that you could be erudite without being elitist and popular without being condescending. I got to know him a bit through having worked with Siân Thomas, his long-term partner and devoted helpmeet during his difficult final years of illness. My recollection is of a shrewd and kindly man who embodied, in his character, the unified sensibility that was always his aesthetic goal.Explore more on these topicsTony HarrisonPoetryTheatreLeedsYorkshirePolitical theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Via flashback, we witness Zev dismiss her emotional needs, demand she get rid of her dog and – worst of all – pour scorn on her cultural preferences: Vanderpump Rules, the “Real Housewomen of North Carolina”, Miley Cyrus songs. When Jess enthusiastically sings along to the ballad Angels Like You, Zev admonishes her: “It’s not real music, it’s manufactured bullshit – come on, you’re too smart to fall for that.” Jess briefly defends Cyrus, before retreating. “Don’t make me feel stupid for loving things!” she implores tearily.Zev is a bad guy and a cultural snob. He’s a bad guy partly because he’s a cultural snob. He’s also a relic. We live in a world where contempt for culture based on its level of sophistication or intellectual value is considered deeply passé, if not borderline evil. The derogatory labels – guilty pleasure, idiotbox, dumbed-down entertainment, disposable pop, trash TV – are no longer in circulation. Culture of every stripe is worthwhile: superhero movies prompt near academic levels of discourse; Taylor Swift is the subject of multiple university classes; and reality shows double as state of the nation treatises (The Traitors echoes British democracy’s dysfunctions,wrote Ian Dunt in the i; the brutal competition of Love Island USA is an allegory for the mercilessness of American life, according tothe New Yorker). Throwing insults – vapid, stupid, pointless, brain cell-depleting – is now like spitting into a mirror: it says more about you than the song/show/movie you are criticising.But what if cultural snobbery, so effectively cast off over the past decade, wasn’t a waste of time? What if it did actually uphold certain standards? What if – faced with a future dominated by social media advertainment and AI-generated content – it’s our only hope?You could argue that culture has been on an intellectual downward spiral since the Victorian era, when mass-market literature lowered the collective brow. Ever since, we’ve adapted to art in increasingly populist, democratic and easily digestible forms – cinema, pop music, television, the internet – much of it reflective of new technologies. Over time, suspicion about specific mediums became synonymous with elitism and a fear of change – yet there were always hierarchies within these modern forms, often directed along lines of race, gender and sexuality with the output (and tastes) of the straight, white male generally receiving the least derision.View image in fullscreenStrange bed fellows … Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixIn a2004 New York Times article, Kelefa Sanneh summarised rockism – the musical facet of that mindset – as favouring punk over disco, live shows over music videos and idolising “the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star”. By the mid-00s, rockism seemed suffocating. To move beyond it, Sanneh suggested we envisage a world where “it’s impossible to separate classics from guilty pleasures” and try “to acknowledge that music videos and reality shows and glamorous layouts can be as interesting – and as influential – as an old-fashioned album”.We certainly rose to that challenge. Soon poptimism – an ideology that maintained that authenticity was a pose and conventionally unserious music (and, later, film, TV and books) had inherent value – became the status quo. It was bolstered by the belief that snobbery towards certain genres was inseparable from bigotry (the shudder-inducing memory of 1979’s Disco Demolition night; Noel Gallagher responding to Jay-Z’s 2008 Glasto headline slot by saying: “I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury, it’s wrong”). People wanted to purge themselves of the prejudices that prevented them embracing lowbrow culture, resulting in headlines such as “My anti-romance book snobbery was rooted in internalised misogyny”. In Zev and Jess’s case, it is no coincidence that her favoured music and TV are stereotypically feminine. Needless to say, appraising art through a misogynistic, homophobic, white-supremacist lens is not a good thing. Yet poptimism’s reach went far beyond oppressive power structures – in the end, open-mindedness curdled into indiscriminate celebration.Too Much demonstrates how. Jess’s ultimate defence of her devotion to Cyrus is to equate Zev’s disdain with a kind of emotional robbery; to judge is to shame is to destroy joy that is in short supply in a world plagued by catastrophe and disconnection. This applies not only to reality TV and chart fodder, but also manchild-friendly comic franchises and fantasy epics. In 2016, a webcomic by Adam Ellis depicting a sports fan telling his snide friend to “let people enjoy things” captured this perspective so well it became a popular meme.View image in fullscreenMaking a scene … The Studio.Photograph: APThese days, “let people enjoy things” is the prevailing attitude towards all cultural consumption. The mainstreaming of obsessive fandom helped conflate criticism with trauma-inducing attacks (see: Swifties who take the musician’s output – and discussion of it – incredibly personally), as did superstars clapping back at commentators (Lana Del Rey taking the time totweet multiple haughty rebuttalsto an NPR review; Halsey expressing her hopes that the “basement they run [Pitchfork] out of” – situated in the World Trade Center no less – collapses). With any negativity now considered psychic violence (sometimes countered by threats of actual violence from fans), enthusiasm took over as the default mode. Ironically, considering the Gallaghers’ track record of insulting their peers, it’s a mindset that has benefited the Oasis reunion no end: don’t call them derivative, dull or lyrically inane like people did in the 1990s; just focus on the rare and precious sight of British people having fun.This may all sound very nice, but a new age is upon us. Accounts pumping out AI-generated music are reaching massive audiences; in June, a fake rock band calledthe Velvet Sundownamassed more than 1m Spotify plays in weeks. In light of advances in AI video technology, YouTube recently issued a warning about content that is “inauthentic”, “mass-produced” and “repetitious” (which does admittedly sound like a 1990s dad describing happy hardcore). There is now an established term for this sort of thing: slop – a word that reflects its junky, empty, imitative nature. Should we just let people enjoy that, too?Probably not. In December, brain rot – a term popular with gens Z and A – was crowned the Oxford word of the year. Defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state” due to “overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging”, it is proof we don’t need to wait for the robots to take over: consuming human-created social media dross clearly feels unhealthy on a biological level.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ryan Olbrysh/The GuardianThe funny thing is, the defining traits of AI and social media slop are the very qualities cultural snobbery used to rail against. One of these was naked commercialism: AI content takes barely any time or effort to create and economies of scale mean profit is the point, while the success of social media content is judged almost entirely on its viewership. Another was soulless imitation: AI draws crudely on existing culture; social media slop, meanwhile, often involves re-enacting trends or crazes.Some of these old standards will feel alien to zoomers and alphas. In his 2022 book The Nineties, the critic Chuck Klosterman explores the decade’s hostility towards “selling out,” which he calls “the single most nineties aspect of the nineties”. Selling out involved a respected artist deciding to make work that was more “palatable” and therefore more commercially viable. By 2010, says Klosterman, “it was hard to illustrate to a young person why this act was once seen as problematic; by 2020 it was difficult to explain what the term literally expressed”.Social media decimated the binary between advertising and entertainment long ago. So what if art and commerce become synonymous? Well, how about this remarkably on-the-nose warning from the recent past. When NFTs – digital artworks that only exist online – exploded in popularity during the pandemic, there was little sign of luddite elitism: Christie’s sold an NFT by Beeple for a record-setting $69.3m. To detractors, Rosanna McLaughlin wrote in the Guardian, the makers of NFTs were “morally bankrupt, environmentally vandalistic money-grabbers whose creations barely qualify as art”, a view shared by Beeple himself who described the work as “a big pile of ass-shit”. NFTs helped “the distinction between art and asset” disappear, observed McLaughlin. “Prices, not ideas, dominate.” This meant that when the bubble burst – it was reported in 2023 that 95% of NFTs were worthless – nothing at all remained.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Deliberate imitation and an obsession with numbers increasingly rule conventional popular culture, too. The tech companies who now create and distribute so much television are interested almost exclusively in viewership (as their policy of cancelling acclaimed shows has repeatedly proved) and they have always been committed to exploiting existing tastes: House of Cards, Netflix’s first original series, came about after the platform noticed that Kevin Spacey, director David Fincher and the original BBC version were all popular.Following the prestige television era, this mindset has, unsurprisingly, produced diminishing returns. Last year, the New York Times critic James Poniewozikcoined the term“mid TV”, defined as a “profusion of well-cast, sleekly produced competence” that represented modern television’s “willingness to retreat, to settle, to trade the ambitious for the dependable”. In other words, to make safe bets on emulative and unchallenging shows (Poniewozik cites Mr and Mrs Smith and House of the Dragon as examples).The quest to appeal to proven preferences has reshaped pop music too, as songwriters craft bland, vapid tracks in the hope of pleasing Spotify algorithms. It’s also why we’re trapped in a nightmare of endless reboots, adaptations and spin-offs (there have been 11 Star Wars shows since 2021 alone). AI may be entirely derivative, but so is much TV. And Hollywood is so obviously beholden to branding – whether that be existing IP or actual consumer products – that Apple TV+’s affectionate satire The Studio used this obsession as the cornerstone of its movie business pastiche. Initially, The Studio’s protagonist Matt Remick (Seth Rogen) pays lip service to cultural snobbery: he is infuriated by his CEO’s insistence they make a Kool-Aid film. But the show teaches him to compromise in a post-Barbie reality. (You really can’t hold it against Remick: he exists within the TV arm of a phone company trying to foster cultural cachet; he was always going to be a capitalist stooge.)View image in fullscreenEconomies of scales … House of the Dragon.Photograph: HBOObviously, the value of art is subjective up to a point, but there are still some broad criteria we can claw back, regardless of the medium.Shifty, Adam Curtis’s recent docuseries about 1980s Britain, includes a clip of Martin Amis informing an interviewer that “there is a great convulsion of stupidity happening in the world, mostly to do with television […] It’s almost like consumerism of culture.” Amis seems almost comically fusty in the footage. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a point. A great convulsion of stupidity endures – see: brain rot – but the idea that art can spread idiocy has disappeared. Implicit in the “let people enjoy things” mindset is the argument that people need mindless pleasure and distraction during terrible times. To deny them that is mean-spirited. But what if those terrible times were partly a product of our dumbed-down, money-fixated culture in the first place?AI, bot farms and innocent indie victims: how music streaming became a hotbed of fraud and fakeryRead moreIn a 1993 interview, David Foster Wallace defined “low” culture – such as “TV and popular film” – as art that is lucrative because it knows “audiences prefer 100% pleasure”. Serious art is “more apt to make you uncomfortable, or to force you to work hard to access its pleasures, the same way that in real life true pleasure is usually a by-product of hard work and discomfort”. We may live in an era when watching an entire TV programme without looking at your phone feels like monastic contemplation, but Foster Wallace’s ethos remains true and applicable. The easier art is to consume and produce, and the more focused it is on remuneration, the less it gives us: no food for thought, just reaffirmation at a time when echo chambers are the default.Cultural snobbery might end up being no match for tech giants and AI and social media’s infinite scroll. But as a bulwark against vacant, commercial, intellectually bereft art made by robots or humans or a combination of the two, it’s worth reconsidering. Throughout this article, I’ve been tempted, in characteristically millennial style, to give assurance of my own lack of cultural snobbery – I have enthusiastically consumed years’ worth of dross – but by the end I felt less perverse pride than straightforward shame. At the very least, we should stop villainising the proponents of some kind of standards: the Zevs of this world may have their flaws, but when it comes to brain-rotting culture, they could also be our saviours.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as the Beatles and Led Zep showed in the past, more scenic routes can pay offEamonn FordeSun 28 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 16.50 EDTShareAs the mania around them was erupting in early 1963, the Beatles toured the UK supporting Helen Shapiro, including shows in Wakefield, Taunton and Hanley (now amalgamated as part of Stoke-on-Trent). In late 1971, as their untitled fourth album was released, Led Zeppelin roared around the country, including stops in Preston, Bournemouth and Salisbury. Gathering a head of steam in 1994, Oasis performed in Tunbridge Wells, Derby and Newport. Promoting his debut album in 2011, Ed Sheeran stopped off in Keele, Falmouth and Aberdeen.But over the decades, most of these regional cities and towns steadily fell off the touring map as focus turned to the bigger cities, often those with large student populations. By the early 2000s it was contracting further due to a mix of rising costs, venue closures and tour support from record labels drying up as CD sales collapsed.Opportunities to see grassroots acts are shrinking: in October, the Music Venue Trust (MVT) reported that acts played on average 11 shows when touring smaller venues in 2024, compared with 22 three decades earlier. But, speaking to live music business publication IQ earlier this year, Denis Desmond, chairman of Live Nation UK & Ireland, said that the touring map was expanding: “Compared to 2015, we’re hosting events in 40% more towns across the UK – showing that demand really is nationwide.”A curious bifurcation now appears to be reshaping UK touring. Acts over a certain size frequently over-supply a handful of major cities (mainly London, Manchester, Glasgow and Leeds), or tour the regions as a novelty – Jake Bugg’s recent Your Town tour, CMAT’s pre-Glastonbury warm-up run – while smaller acts venturing deeper into the provinces can often only do so under straitened conditions.View image in fullscreen‘Off the map’ … Esquires in Bedford.Photograph: Neil McCartyAs part of the Delgados’ 2023 reunion tour, Emma Pollock played Brighton, London, Manchester, Sheffield and Glasgow. She is also touring as a solo act in October and will visit Hull, Perth, Aberdeen and Sale as well as several of the major touring cities. “To be as profitable as possible means that you play in front of as many people on the one night as you possibly can – and that pushes you into the cities,” she says. “As a bigger artist, you will stick to the cities; but as a smaller artist, you are sticking to the clubs.” That means venturing off the beaten track – venue capacities may be smaller, but audiences are often hungrier and more appreciative.Calum Miller is owner of the 350-capacity PJ Molloys in Dunfermline. “Bands are finding it better to just do one large headline show than 10 Scottish shows,” he says. “Once a band gets to a [certain] level, they would rather do Barrowland [in Glasgow].” But this may be a short-sighted move when it comes to nurturing a fanbase: doing “nothing for six months before that in Scotland [is] putting all their eggs into one basket”.The brutal truth behind this is often economic, with associated costs such as crew, petrol and accommodation currently going through the roof. Confining tours to the biggest cities theoretically seems the less risky option, but could be a false economy. “Booking agents have responded to that cost pressure by reducing the length of tours – in some ways in quite a nonsensical way,” argues Beverley Whitrick, COO of MVT. “Accommodation in major cities is more expensive than in smaller towns and cities.”Some agents and promoters have been accused of targeting short-term gain over the kind of long-term development that acts can gain from honing their craft in smaller venues. “It’s profit that’s prized above the cultural experience,” Pollock says with a sigh. Agents, who negotiate fees for their acts from promoters who often front most of the risk to put on the shows, “are pretty guilty of just chasing the moneyevery single time”.MVT says that 25 grassroots venues closed last year and 200 were at serious risk of closure. New venues are opening, but it takes time to become established, while others need to reclaim lost ground. Gareth Barber took over the running of Esquires in Bedford a decade ago when it had, he says, “fallen off the map slightly” and wasn’t seen as a main touring venue. He has rebuilt its standing to draw in more tours, including a pre-Glastonbury CMAT and upcoming dates from Ibibio Sound Machine and former Kraftwerk member Wolfgang Flür.“I don’t think that touring provincially is particularly risky,” he argues. “The audiences actually want it that little bit more.” Catering to under-served audiences can be good long-term business. Both Ed Sheeran and Sam Fender, in their early touring days, played small clubs and beach bars in Cornwall, for example, and built up enviable fan loyalty there. Plus, Barber says, “we hear from tour managers that merchandise sales on the shows here are much higher than they are in some of the cities.”View image in fullscreenWorth squeezing in … Squid performing live at the Cornish Bank in Falmouth.Photograph: Brian Robinson/The ObserverWill Greenham is bookings manager at the 260-capacity Cornish Bank in Falmouth. He says the team opened the venue four years ago, in part as a way of getting promoters and agents to take their acts further west than Bristol (almost 200 miles away). “Some agents just don’t bother answering the email,” he says of the regular frustrations and challenges of getting acts to play there. “If they came, we would sell out and the venue would do even better. If they come to somewhere like Falmouth, they will get the most real experience. You’re so far from London. People down here will give you the best night.”The venue also has flats “with amazing sea views” for touring acts to use: Squid are among the acts to have done residencies there. “They were Airbnbs before we took the building on, so we quickly demolished that with loud music!” Greenham laughs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Sybil Bell, founder and chief executive of Independent Venue Week, says small venues around the country are going through a quiet revolution to make things better for touring acts. “They really take care of the artists,” she says. “There are so many cases [in the past with venues] where people [running them] just become a bit complacent. It would be a damp, shitty, horrible dressing room. People have really upped their game.” She cites Mal Campbell, who runs the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge, as an example of a venue owner going the extra mile for acts, helping them load in and ensuring they are properly fed and looked after.View image in fullscreenRichard Hawley at the Trades Club, Hebden Bridge, in 2017.Photograph: Visionhaus/Corbis/Getty ImagesMVT is lobbying to have £1 from each ticket for UK arena and stadium shows go to support small venues, but involvement so far, from acts like Enter Shikari and Sam Fender, has been voluntary. Whitrick says one of MVT’s plans for the money is to keep helping venues (many of them regional) renovate to become materially better for touring acts. “If money is invested in grassroots music venues to put in a self-contained flat, that would help touring artists,” she says. “So much money goes on hotels, buyouts [of meals] and all the other costs. An initial investment could have a massive impact on so many artists in the longer term, enabling more touring because you’ve immediately taken down some of those cost lines.”Independent promoters in the regions are diligently working to extend the touring circuit, but it also requires the backing of the bigger names in the live industry. “It’s just about agents being more open to putting in more shows,” says .Notably, a variety of acts are putting in the hard yards regionally. Richard Hawley’s latest tour has stops in Weston-Super-Mare, Margate and Worthing. Snapped Ankles will perform in Saint Leonards, Bradninch and Gloucester. The Unthanks will visit Kingston, Worcester and Colne.One supposed “risk” of this strategy is ticket cannibalisation: some in the live business fear that playing two nearby towns might see the larger venue pull ticket sales away from the smaller venue, not believing the two can coexist.Miller insists this is a damaging myth that needs to be dispelled. “Would you rather play one night in Glasgow to 600 people or play to 500 people in Glasgow and 250 people the next night in Dunfermline?” he asks. “There’s a whole fanbase in Dunfermline that are not travelling to your Glasgow show.” Just ask the Beatles or Sheeran: it’s a leap of faith worth taking.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Belgian art historian and Rubens expert was visiting Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches museum for a conference in 1993 and had asked to see a van Dyck in the archives. On her way out she caught a glimpse of a vast, 2.7-metre by 3.5-metre oil painting of a wild and drunken parade writhing with naked bodies young and old.“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Van der Stighelen recalled. “I really know my way around Flemish paintings from the 17th century, but when I saw this picture I could not match it with anything I knew.” The archivist informed her of an intriguing fact: it was believed to be the work of a woman.Three decades later, The Triumph of Bacchus is no longer hidden away in the Kunsthistorisches’ archives but has been given top billing as the centrepiece of a new show – and its creator is no longer nameless. Opening on 30 September, the exhibition Michaelina Wautier, Painter for the first time gathers into one show all known works by an artist who is belatedly coming to be recognised as one of the old masters of her age.View image in fullscreenSelf-portrait, Michaelina Wautier, 1649.Photograph: Museum of Fine Arts, BostonIt includes monumental history paintings, portraits and still lives as well as allegorical treatments such as The Five Senses, a series of five paintings showing boys experiencing sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. The latter, assigned to Wautier only after a first retrospective in Antwerp in 2018, will be on display in Europe for the first time since Wautier’s rediscovery. Two studies – of a saint and a boy with a white cravat – will be shown for the first time carrying her name.“For female baroque artists to work on this scale and with this variety of subjects is completely unseen,” Van der Stighelen said. “You had excellent women artists at the time painting flowers or still lives, but in general they were much smaller than those produced by men, largely due to the fact that they didn’t have their own workshops. Wautier is a complete exception to the rule.”View image in fullscreenThe Five Senses: Taste, Michaelina Wautier, 1650.Photograph: Museum of Fine Arts, BostonLittle is known of Wautier’s biography beyond the fact that she was born in Mons in 1604, now the capital of Hainaut province in Belgium’s Walloon region, and that she had a brother five years her senior, Charles, who worked as a professional artist and was posthumously presumed to be the author of some of her paintings.Jonathan Fine, director general of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, said: “We know practically nothing about her from historical documents. Most of what we know, we know from her paintings.”Of the 35 works that are attributed to her, around half are dated and signed “Michaelina Wautier”, but the spelling of her name in inventories varies, including “Michelle”, “Wouteers” and “Votier”. A large number of these works ended up in the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, one of the great art patrons of his age, pointing to the Wautiers having some links to aristocratic circles.View image in fullscreenTwo Girls as Saint Agnes and Saint Dorothea, Michaelina Wautier, 1655.Photograph: Rik Klein Gotink/Kunsthistorisches MuseumWhile women at the time were not allowed to study at academies, the dexterity with which she wielded a brush makes it unimaginable that Wautier did not receive some formal training, possibly from her brother, experts say.The very existence of The Triumph of Bacchus also suggests that Michaelina was able to use Charles’s studio, and to study naked male models in the flesh there.“When you look at Wautier’s paintings, it’s immediately evident that she knew what the body was,” said von der Stighelen. “When you look at the variety of ages, skin colours and hair textures in the Bacchus painting, it’s impossible that she worked purely off plaster copies. She must have had the opportunity to draw and paint from life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others such as Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1653) have in recent years been reassigned a seat at the old master table for their contributions to baroque art. But The Triumph of Bacchus makes Wautier the first known female artist to have drawn the naked male body on a lifesize scale.Fine said mastery of technique was not the only attribute that merited the Vienna retrospective. Many of Wautier’s paintings express a bittersweet, melancholy, quintessentially modern sensibility.Her series portrays the five senses as providing pleasure and pain. There is beautiful music and fine food, but “Smell” has a boy pinching his nose while holding a rotten egg, and “Touch” shows its juvenile subject scratching his head after cutting his finger with a whittling knife.View image in fullscreenPortrait of Martino Martini, Michaelina Wautier, 1664.Photograph: Courtesy of The Klesch CollectionThe Triumph of Bacchus, too, is not triumphant in a straightforward way. In the far-right corner of the painting, starkly illuminated and accentuated by a brightly coloured half-toga, Wautier has painted herself as one of the revellers.Unlike those around her, she is not joyous: a man to her left appears to be grabbing her head in the same manner that the cherubim to her feet manhandle a goat. Yet the expression on her face is not one of intimidation but of confidence.“How she has painted herself into the picture is a sign of self-assertion”, Fine said. “She is being grabbed by the man next to her. But she resists and breaks away from him and the drunken revelry to look out of the picture plane.”Explore more on these topicsArtPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

Certainly the most memorable; I used it myself as an epigram in my novel Bag of Bones.Daphne du Maurieralso wrote what may be the best first line in a tale of the uncanny and outre. Her classic story The Birds opens with this: “On December the third the wind changed overnight and it was winter.” Short, chilly and to the point. It could almost be a weather report.It works so well at the outset of the gripping tale that follows, in which every species of bird attacks humankind, because it’s flat, declarative and realistic. Du Maurier can gin up horror when she wants – seeThe Doll, The Blue Lenses and the shocking final two pages of Don’t Look Now – but knows that what’s wanted here to instil belief (and suspense) is a tone that’s closer to reportage than narration.Thefilm version of The Birds, overloaded with a love match between Hollywood pretty people (Rod Taylor as Mitch, Tippi Hedren as Melanie) to go with the bird attacks, bears almost no resemblance to Du Maurier’s story. The setting is California’s sunny Bodega Bay instead of cold and overcast Cornwall, England, and the number of characters has been expanded. The only real similarity between the story and the movie lies in their endings. In the film, Mitch and Melanie escape while thousands of roosting birds are resting between attacks. What happens later is up to the viewer to guess. The conclusion of the Du Maurier story is even more chilling in its flat narration. After smoking his last cigarette, Nat tries the wireless and finds it silent. “He threw the empty packet on the fire, and watched it burn.”What happens at the end? We don’t know. Du Maurier doesn’t care. This is the essence of her unsettling geniusThis final line is as quietly terrible, yet as matter-of-fact, as the one that opens the story. What happens to Nat, his wife and his children? We don’t know. Du Maurier doesn’t care, and she’s right not to care. What she gives us is that last cigarette, which carries its own freight of firing-squad symbolism, and the burning packet. She tells us, in effect, decide for yourself. This is the essence of her unsettling genius.I am impatient with the idea of “spoilers”, a term that’s come into vogue along with other unpleasant side-effects of the internet in general and social media in particular. I find “You spoiled it!” to be, typically, the cry of spoilt people. I’d argue you can rarely spoil a good story, because the joy is in the journey rather than the arrival. Du Maurier’s stories are a notable exception to that rule. To talk about any of them at length would destroy their effect. Suffice it to say that you are in the hands of a master storyteller. Adiabolicalone, at that.The line-by-line quality of Du Maurier’s writing is astonishing, given how prolific she was: 17 novels, six biographies, three plays and dozens of short stories. She is particularly good at quick-sketch characterisation. Midge, from The Apple Tree, is a masterpiece of passive-aggressive behaviour, a woman whose chief talent seems to be making her husband’s life miserable. Not in any big way – she’s not a thief, drug addict or adulterer – but in a series of small nips that draw trickles of blood. She may or may not be aware of what she’s doing. Either way, consciously or unconsciously, she is exerting control.View image in fullscreenDaphne du Maurier in the 1930s.Photograph: Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/AlamyThe narrator of The Apple Tree (unnamed, like so many of Du Maurier’s characters, including the second Mrs de Winter of Rebecca) is a gentleman who gives his wife the newspaper first. She returns it crumpled and folded and out of order. The birth of a child to mutual friends is noted by Midge with dismay, whether a boy or a girl; she sees the drawbacks to both sexes. Although the couple have a maid, Midge “would labour past him, stooping under the weight of the laden tray”.The sighing, martyred Midge passes away, but her widowed husband remains in her thrall, associating an ugly apple tree with “poor Midge”, and the smaller, more shapely apple tree in its shadow with a laughing, cheerful farm girl named May, who Midge’s husband once kissed (and who died in a motorbike accident). Du Maurier describes the “Midge-tree” this way: “The moon shone upon the withered branches, and they looked like skeleton’s arms raised in supplication. Frozen arms, stiff and numb with pain.”Poor Midge, indeed!Is the ugly apple tree, with its sour, mealy fruit, a kind of revenant, or does the narrator – a bit of a fussbudget, far from perfect himself – simply find it psychologically impossible to escape his dead wife’s influence? Du Maurier doesn’t say. She is deft enough to have it both ways, which is the case with many of her stories.A few, like Monte Verità, feature doomed romance; at least one (The Breakthrough) deals with telepathy, telekinesis and even envisions our current fixation with AI; the best of them inhabit a murky borderland between what may be supernatural or could be no more than overactive imaginations stressed into malignancy. In The Blue Lenses, following an eye operation, Marda West begins seeing people with the heads of animals that reflect the personalities of the people to whom those heads belong; the revelation that her husband has the head of a vulture is especially creepy. In The Pool, a young girl believes she sees a whole other plane of existence, guarded by a woman commanding a turnstile at the bottom of a scummy woodland pool.Even when things seem relatively innocuous, you sense the shadows gathering. This is a gift few writers haveI love Du Maurier’s stories. I love their clarity, I love their often grim view of human nature, I love her prodigious talent and narrative ability. There is a reason why collections of short stories are, as a rule, less popular than novels. With a novel, you settle in with a cast of characters for what may be a day or two (if you’re a fast reader, like my wife) or a week or more (if you’re a slow reader, like me). When it comes to short stories, the reader has to create a fictional world in his or her imagination, then disassemble it, move on to the next fictional world and build that one. That can be hard work. It’s not with these stories.Entering these worlds is a pleasure rather than an effort. Sometimes the buildup can be slow, but “there are violins”, as some critic or other said about Robert Bloch’sPsycho. (That is certainly true of Bernard Herrmann’s music for the film version, which is almost all violins.) Meaning that even when things seem relatively innocuous, you sense the shadows gathering. This is a gift few writers have.Some stories have a sexual tingle. The most overtly sexual isThe Doll, where a woman named Rebecca (thatRebecca? Who is to say it’s not?) fascinates another of Du Maurier’s unnamed narrators. Rebecca is frightening, with her “great wide fanatical eyes like a saint, the narrow mouth that hid [her] teeth, sharp and white as ivory, and [her] halo of savage hair, electric, dark, uncontrolled”. I am particularly taken with that halo of savage hair, which should not work (hair cannot be savage, any more than waves can be angry) but somehow does.Rebecca has a secret lover named Julio. The narrator describes Julio, who seems to be about 16, this way: “His face was the most evil thing I have ever seen. It was ashen pale in colour, and the mouth was a crimson gash, sensual and depraved. The nose was thin … the eyes were cruel, gleaming and narrow, and curiously still. They seemed to stare right through one – the eyes of a hawk.” Du Maurier doesn’t come right out and say that Rebecca is having a sexual relationship with Julio, but it’s strongly implied … and the narrator clearly believes it. What makes this particularly perverse is the fact that Julio is not human (at least probably not), but a mannequin.‘Trump is a horror story, isn’t he?’ Stephen King on villains, dark secrets and dreamsRead moreThere. I have given away, at least in this story, a secret that should have been Du Maurier’s to impart, but only because the title allows the reader to see it coming. Written in 1928, The Doll was for many years presumed lost. Because of the subject matter, Du Maurier, then just 21 years old, may have been persuaded to hold it back, lest it damage her reputation at a time when sexual matters were best left sub rosa. Although it had been published in 1937, in a book of previously rejected stories aptly titled The Editor Regrets, it was notrediscovered until 2011.I have said quite enough. It’s time for you to take Daphne du Maurier’s hand and let her lead you into the dark. Her talent is a bright light that will guide you. Her remarkable stories await. I envy your discoveries.

She asks the audience to look across the traverse stage and lock eyes with a stranger. We do as she asks, smiling. “Would you fuck them?” she says, and scouts our averted gazes for an answer, pressing us for a response. Is she joking? Catching us out? Bullying us?What seems like a cuddly warm-up exercise gathers uncomfortable psychological undercurrents. “You understand I’m not asking you anything you haven’t thought about before?”That opening exudesMamet-esque vibes, as does the setting for the drama itself – the basement of a debt collection agency which might turn into a latter-dayGlengarry Glen Rossas two best mates competitively josh and confide to other about their ambitions, insecurities, love lives.But it takes an unexpected swing: this firm is owned by Nicole (Allison McKenzie), the ball-breaking businesswoman of the beginning, who has employed her son, Darwin (Ashley Margolis), who comes to work in sliders and shorts, while Richie (Nathan Clarke) bursts with plans to make it big in Silicon Valley one fine day. It becomes clear that he is also living with obsessive-compulsive disorder, having to fulfil urgent rituals and juggling dark fantasies with positive imaginings, all enacted on stage. Nicole doubles up as his inner voice, variously wheedling, seductive and scary.Will Lord’s arresting play does not pull away from high-wire theatricality: the inner voice swaggers on to cajole Richie or lies prone on a filing cabinet, on Janet Bird’s stage, waiting to sabotage him. Characters pop out of wardrobes while murderous fantasy and quotidian reality is seamlessly entwined.But its intention to do two things at once leaves it weaker and sometimes opaque. Alongside its portrayal ofOCDare ruminations on and critiques of the personal development and self-help industries, so it seems. Much of the latter aspect comes through Richie’s inner voice, which conflates his capitalist ambition with self-realisation and manifestation.View image in fullscreenJoshing behaviour … Ashley Margolis and Nathan Clarke.Photograph: Rich LakosMcKenzie, as this voice, sounds variously like a hippie, an ambassador for neurolinguistic programming (“Could you speak your happiness into future existence?”), and a Thatcher-era thug. Richie’s OCD and these broader elements become confused. while the plot does not quite go far enough.Yet it remains powerful is its concept with excellent performances, especially from McKenzie.

Calmness, softness of touch and introspection are among the Icelandic pianist’s widely admired trademarks. It helps make him a perfect performer for the AirPod age.But how does Ólafsson respond to a full orchestra in a large-scale work such as Beethoven’s third piano concerto? The answer, in this opening concert of thePhilharmonia’s season, is that he does it with enviable ease. It assured a distinguished start to the 80th birthday year of an orchestra whose founder, Walter Legge, had shamefully tried to kill it off when it had not even reached two decades old.Looking at times as if he might happily conduct the whole thing from the piano, Ólafsson’s characteristically clear playing went from imposing and lyrical in the grandly constructed opening movement, through rapt and contemplative in the largo, which he began in the 18th-century manner with a tiny decorative flourish of his own, to brilliant and witty in the rondo finale. If it felt in retrospect like a performance of three separate mood pieces rather than something more fully bound together, it was a sparkling rendition all the same.View image in fullscreenDelicately scored … Gabriela Ortiz, centre, takes the applause beside Santtu-Matias Rouvali for her new composition.Photograph: Mark AllanBefore the concerto, Santtu-Matias Rouvali conducted the UK premiere ofGabriela Ortiz’s Si el Oxígeno Fuera Verde, which the orchestra had premiered in Amsterdam the previous day. Described by the composer as a fragile green murmur of life, the environmentally inspired work is delicately scored as a bubbling forest of gentle arpeggios and trills, which eventually coheres into an insistent dance with echoes of John Adams and the Stravinsky of The Rite of Spring.Alongside Ólafsson, who stayed to listen to the second half of the concert, the evening’s star attraction was the Royal Festival Hall organ being played at full throttle. With Notre Dame cathedral’sOlivier Latryat the organ controls, and Rouvali neatly alive to the work’s overall architecture and colours, Saint-Saëns’s third symphony is a guaranteed crowd pleaser for a special occasion – and so it proved.Broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 29 September and then available on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe Philharmonia OrchestraVíkingur ÓlafssonSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2005 he set off from New York and rode 12,000 miles to Rio de Janeiro in search of the perfect meal. After writing a book about his experience, he settled in Burgundy and added wine to the equation, turning a derelict 17th-century water mill in the village of Auxey-Duresses intoThe Hungry Cyclist Lodge. Guests can set off each day to pedal around the surrounding vineyards, winding between tastings and lunches, and relax back at the lodge (which has a swimming pool).Bring a bike on the train (TGV from Paris to Dijon), then a short connection to Beaune and a 10km bike – or taxi – ride from the station. Or rent one when you get there (€22 a day for a hybrid). Next door to the lodge is a small vineyard of Gamay, where Tom’s family produce around 500 bottles a year of their Vin Du Moulin. Try it over a dinner that Tom whips up from fruit and veg grown in the garden and meat from the local butcher – in autumn this might include guinea fowl roasted over raisins and tarte tatin with fig leaf ice-cream.Doubles from€170B&B, dinner€40ppexcluding wine,thehungrycyclist.comExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysRail travelShort breaksProvence holidaysFrance holidaysBelgium holidaysNetherlands holidaysShareReuse this content"

You’re leaving a busy life behind and venturing into the bush where constant phone notifications can’t reach you.Our merry band of hikers – four adults and three kids – have opted for a five-day walk encompassing Smitt Rock and Eighth Gorge in Nitmiluk national park, 30km north-east of Katherine in Australia’sNorthern Territory.The park covers a vast area, including 13 spectacular gorges carved out of rusty red sandstone. In theJawoyn Dreaming story, the water flows through tracks made by Bolung, also known as the Rainbow Serpent.View image in fullscreenTegan Forder navigates the rugged path: ‘It’s a rocky challenge for my poor ankles.’Photograph: Claire SalterDuring the dry season Nitmiluk “cicada place” (Katherine) Gorge is a magnet for adventure seekers and day trippers from the luxury cross-country train The Ghan. Hiking can be a quieter way to explore the park, as some areas can only be reached on foot.After a night in the Nitmiluk campground, we set off. Our packs strain at the seams, with enough water for the warm day ahead, as well as food for the entire hike.We start following the Yambi Walk to Smitt Rock, our first campsite on the trail. Rated a grade-four track, it’s a rocky challenge for my ankles and, while I think the kids will require regular breaks, it’s me who needs to rest.We’re rewarded with expansive views across rocky country, with glimpses of the lush gorges below. As we traverse an escarpment, we’re surrounded by native grasses, bright green pandanus and sprays of purple, red and yellow dry-season flowers, some sprouting in areas where fires have been.We decide to take a (rather long) detour to Lily Pond Falls. A sign warns that only experienced hikers should continue. We descend slowly, placing our feet strategically to stop us sliding down the rocky “path”. I’m not as keen as the rest but the desperate desire to submerge in something cold persuades me.At the bottom we realise that a boat has beaten us there and a group are lunching by the main pond, so we clamber down a bit lower to find some shallow pools to dip in and fill our bottles. After the boat departs we wander through to Lily Pond Falls, taking a moment to appreciate the still, sacred spot before heading back.View image in fullscreenSunset at Smitt Rock campground.Photograph: Tegan ForderSweaty but rejuvenated by our lunch and swim, we press ahead along the Waleka Walk trail (grade five) until we reach our first campsite at Smitt Rock just before nightfall. Before putting up our tents we rush out to the ledge to watch the sunset and spy a crocodile’s yellow eyes as it makes its way across the gorge below us. We later find out from a couple of kayakers that the rangers have already checked whether it’s a deadly salty – reassuringly, it’s just a big freshwater croc.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe next day’s walk continues along the same rocky and undulating trail but with the promise of a water hole waiting for us at Eighth Gorge. During the dry season a steady waterfall from the pool above feeds the swimming hole but it can dry up as the months pass.View image in fullscreenThe water hole at Eighth Gorge campground.Photograph: Tegan ForderWe spend two nights there so we can have an indulgent rest day, swimming, reading, playing cards with the kids, spotting water monitors and exploring the gorge below. There is also a loop walk into the Jawoyn valley where you can view galleries of Aboriginal rock art. Some careful exploring is required to find the paintings depicting the Jawoyn people’s Dreamtime stories.The kids find us a scenic spot for dinner which we dub the “bistro”, a ledge overlooking the spectacular gorges below. After eating our rehydrated bolognese followed by biscuits for dessert, we gaze up at the stars. No matter how many times I see the Milky Way I’m always amazed by just how many stars there are, especially out here, with no light pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That feeling of being slightly exhausted, humbled by your surroundings and happily full from food that would never usually taste as good.It’s hard to leave this idyllic spot but we pack and eat breakfast quickly before heading back the way we came to get ahead of the day’s heat. This time we have the afternoon to hike down the cliff – which is as steep and rocky as it sounds – and run down the giant, piping hot dunes into the crisp water, swimming around Smitt Rock and up to the next gorge. We see more people than we have on the whole hike, with kayakers making their way up the gorges for the day or to camp overnight on the beach.For our final day’s walk, we choose a smoother path back along the Yambi Walk, stopping in at Dunlop Swamp where delicate flowers peak out of the mud. There are still a few hills for our tired feet to navigate before we return to our cars and head in different directions – the family back to the campground for a swim, and my friend and I to Katherine Hot Springs for a recovery session.Food and drinkTheNitmiluk cafeserves breakfast and lunch, and theJatti Pool Bar & Bistroat the campground swimming pool has drinks, snacks and dinner options.

Theopen-top 95 busto Sandy Bay stops almost outside.I drop my luggage and wander the few steps down to Exmouth beach. The soft tawny sand is crisscrossed with gull footprints. It’s a warm day and I get in the water straight away. The temperature is perfect, though I feel a strong current. I keep close to shore, looking out at the neogothic tower of Holy Trinity church and the seafront’s big wheel.View image in fullscreenLunch at the River Exe Café.Photograph: Ed Schofield/The ObserverAfterwards, a walk around town morphs into a cafe crawl. Lured by the smell of baking scones, I start with a mug of tea outsideBumble and Beein Manor Gardens, with its begonia baskets. Nearby, along a wide path with a waterwheel, lily pond and magnolias, a baby T rex and protoceratops are hatching out of reptilian eggs.They are part ofExmouth’s Dinosaur Safari, featuring 17 life-sized models that were unveiled in 2016.

I stop for a while at a free afternoon concert outsideExmouth Pavilionand doze off in a deckchair among palms and pale Michaelmas daisies.

There is a secondhand bookshop and the gardens offer playful diversions: croquet on the lawn, shell-themed board games on the orchard tables and a sign that says “Lie down. Look up at the clouds”.I decide to walk the couple of miles back to town. A signed path leads down through meadows to theExe Estuary Trail, a popular cycle ride with tunnels of butterfly-magnet buddleia and a maritime smell of stranded seaweed. “Tea garden open” says a chalkboard by the path atLower Halsdon Farm. The scones are warm and come with clotted cream from Langage Farm near Plymouth. I notice how quiet it is. Four times an hour, trains hoot and hurtle past on the waterside railway. Otherwise, there’s little sound save the plaintive cries of seabirds on the sandbanks and susurrating poplars overhead.Next morning starts with a radiant early dip in gold-lit water and a short seaward stroll to buzzingHeydaysand the neighbouringHangtimebeach cafe, which serves bowls of granola heaped with berries and bananas, and bagels full of rocket, chilli jam and halloumi. A few steps inland, I cross theMaer nature reserve. It’s a big, sandy, grassy area, sprouting clumps of silvery sea holly and yellow cups of evening primrose. There’s a long-necked brachiosaurus on the far side of the field (that dino safari again). I sit nearby, in the low branches of an evergreen holm oak, and listen to a chiffchaff singing overhead. Heading through parks and well-signed leafy pathways, there are flowers everywhere, from clifftop agapanthus to a bank of pink cyclamen under a sycamore.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, a train crosses the River Clyst at TopshamFor a long, relaxing lunch I head to theRiver Exe Café, a floating restaurant in the middle of the estuary, reachable only by boat (I take the bespoke hourly ferry from Exmouth Marina). Surrounded by gently rocking waves, I eat sea bream with capers and buttery new potatoes. The cafe is only open from April until the end of September and there’s a waiting list for reservations, but you can get lucky – as I did – with occasional cancellations.‘I’ve lived here 14 years. Travelled the world all my life … and I love this place more than anywhere else’Cormorants stand guard on a wrecked boat nearby. Local poetJennifer Keevillcompares them to “menacing dinner guests, all in black”. Her poems evoke Exmouth’s waterscapes: seabirds, sunsets, crumbling cliffs, kite surfers, Christmas Day swimmers. I head back to the beach for an evening dip and supper in the Premier Inn’s own restaurant. I’d usually look for somewhere more distinctive, but I’m tired and it’s right here. The hotel’s seafront terrace, with tubs of lavender and French marigolds, turns out to be a good place to watch the sun set over the sea and eat plates of inexpensive pub-style grub.Coves, caves and Agatha Christie – a car-free tour along the English Riviera in DevonRead moreNext day, inspired by Keevill’s poem Ferry to the Other Side, I take theseasonal boat across to Starcross(April-end of October) andwalk a circuitpast the brackeny deer park atPowderham Castle, up through groves of sweet chestnuts and down past marshes full of water mint and warblers. From the ferry, there are distant views of Exmouth and its “landmark buildings / a clock tower, a cafe, a row of old houses”. Back on the east bank, I stop at Land and Sea for a valedictory half of maltyOtter Aleand then a crisp beer fromTeignworthy breweryon the glass-walled balcony ofThe Grove. Looking out across the sunlit water, I feel any trace of tension slip away.It’s my last evening and I’m loath to leave. Local resident Geoff Crawford is enthusiastic about Exmouth: “I’ve lived here 14 years. Travelled the world all my life … and I love this place more than anywhere else.” He suggests more eateries to sample: “hidden gem”La Mar, a bistro abovethe Beach pub, and tiny backstreetLoluli’s Fire and Fish, “a take away cooked-over-coals fish shop”.An easy escape and seafood-lover’s paradise, Exmouth is a restful place to decompress beside the water. There are walks, boats and buses on the doorstep if you need them, but it’s also ideal for just being. Sit back, relax and watch the sun set.This trip was supported byGWRandPremier Inn(rooms from about £50 a night).

Indeed, so good is it that, though the dish is native to the southern region of Casamance, it’s popular on menus as far afield as neighbouring Gambia. Ifpoulet yassais new to you, however, you have a real treat in store: a braised dish of chicken marinated in sweet onions, tangy citrus and warm chilli, it tastes, asLerato Umah-Shaylorputs it so beautifully, like “sunshine on a plate” – and certainly, as my parents observed when I introduced them to it, far more than the sum of its parts. Simple ingredients, complex flavours – and a guaranteed crowdpleaser.The meatAlexa Weibel, who adapted chefPierre Thiam’s recipefrom The Fonio Cookbook for the New York Times, says that though Thiam uses chicken legs, “in southern Senegal, where the dish originated, you might be served other chicken parts, fish yassa or even lamb yassa”.View image in fullscreenStart with a whole chicken, then joint it, advises food writer Jessica Harris. All thumbnail images by Felicity Cloake.Legs are the most popular cut, with Umah-Shaylor also suggesting thighs in her book Africana, though both Gabonese chef and food writerAnto Cocagneandfood historian and authorJessica B Harrisstart with whole birds, and joint them. I think the juiciness of legs makes them the superior choice, but go with whatever you prefer, leaving the skin on and the bones in, ideally – the skin will help keep the flesh moist and render fat into the sauce, while the bones provide flavour. (Note that, if you don’t eat meat, this sauce also works well with tofu or roast squash.)The marinadeThe common factor here is citrus juice, be that lemon or lime, though I prefer the richer, fruitier tang of the latter. Cocagne and Umah-Shaylor put in the zest as well, a nice idea that I’m going to save for the sauce, because I don’t think the flavour really transfers to the chicken while it’s marinating. Most recipes also add chopped or pureed onion (though Thiam and Dakar-bornKhadim Mbamba,the chef behind London’sLittle Baobab, both prefer the green spring onion variety). Other possible additions include thyme, bay and parsley, none of which my testers and I can really pick up in the meat – like the citrus zest, then, such aromatics are also better deployed later in the process, as are Mbamba and Cocagne’s ginger and mustard.The latter makes a Senegalese red pepper paste,nokoss, to go in the marinade, which as well as the ingredients already mentioned features chilli, red onion, tomato, celery andsoumbalapowder, which is made from the fermented seeds of the néré, or African locust bean tree. I suspect peppers and tomatoes in the UK are more watery and less intensely flavoured than those in Senegal, because my version turns out noticeably paler and more liquid than the one in the photograph, and sadly doesn’t add much flavour when deployed in such a small quantity.View image in fullscreenAnto Cocagne’s chicken yassa has ‘a marmalade-like flavour of lemon zest’.Mbamba’s green pepper version is far punchier, but I’ve elected to keep things very simple indeed and stick to salt, citrus and onion, and the same ingredients that flavour the sauce. Rather than adding all the onions to the marinade, as many recipes suggest, I’ve kept most of them back to speed up the browning process when it comes to making the sauce.The cookingWeibel explains that “the cooking method is flexible: the chicken develops the best smoky char when grilled, but will still be delicious seared in a grill pan or cast-iron skillet”. The consensus online seems to be that while yassa traditionally involves barbecued meat, these days home cooks are more likely to fry it indoors, though you could roast it, too, as Mbamba recommends, with similarly delicious results. Indeed, roasting or using a grill pan are both great options, as is Umah-Shaylor’s overhead grill, but I’ve chosen to fry them, as recommended by Cocagne’s book Saka Saka and Amethyst Ganaway’srecipe for Serious Eats, to render as much fat, and therefore flavour, as possible from the skins for use in the sauce. (My only caveat with roasting the meat is that it doesn’t leave the chicken quite as juicy as frying, grilling, or griddling to colour, before braising it with the sauce. Whichever method you choose, pour any fat or juice that’s escaped the chicken into the sauce when you add the meat to it.)The sauceOnions and citrus, with a backbone of chilli heat, are the building blocks here – pretty much everything else is an optional extra – so it’s essential to take the time to brown the onions properly, so they offer a caramelised contrast to the tangy juice. My testers and I also really like the sweetness Harris’ that carrots bring to proceeding (though you may prefer to use red pepper or Thiam’s green version, though they will, of course, be less sweet), as well as the saltiness of the olives that she and Mbamba both pop in.View image in fullscreenKhadim Mbamba pops olives into his sauce.Olives and dijon mustard, the probable legacy of three centuries of colonial occupation by France, are not obligatory, but the flavours do work really well. Orléans-based caterer Mamy Cocotoldfood blogger and author Bernard Laurance in 2014 that in her native Casamance, poulet yassa tends to be less citrussy and mustardy than the versions now found in places such as Dakar, concluding that it was thus “for you to judge the level of acidity that best pleases your tastebuds”. I’d echo this, while urging you not to be too shy; this recipe sings at full volume.We love the almost marmalade-like flavour that the lemon zest gives Cocagne’s dish, and the complementary warmth of thyme and ginger with the obligatory chilli. Which variety you use, and in what quantity, depends similarly on the pleasure capsaicin brings your tastebuds. I like the fruitiness of scotch bonnet, pricked so it gently infuses the sauce with its heat (and can be whipped out when it hits your specific sweet hotspot), but any red chilli will do, depending on availability and preference. If you’re not keen on chilli heat, use a milder variety and go big on black pepper instead – Thiam adds two whole teaspoons of the stuff to his version.If you’ve barbecued or roasted the chicken, you might want to dilute the sauce with chicken stock, as Umah-Shaylor and Ganaway recommend, but if you’ve fried it, it should be rich enough without. (That said, though none of the recipes I try calls for it, a dash ofMaggi seasoningis a common addition, so a pinch of MSG wouldn’t go amiss, if you feel so moved.)View image in fullscreenPierre Thiam adds all of two teaspoons of ground black pepper to his version.To eatRice is the most common serving suggestion, but couscous is mentioned by Ganaway,“creamy mashed potatoes and green beans”by Umah-Shaylorand fluffy, nuttyfonio,an ancient variety of millet that’s a staple in West Africa, by almost everyone else. Erica Turner tells readers of America’s Test Kitchen that “braised hibiscus leaves (widely eaten in Senegal) are a traditional accompaniment, but cooked spinach seasoned with lemon juice is a fine alternative”.Perfect chicken yassaThis can be made ahead of time, because it reheats very well indeed.Prep20 minMarinate4 hr+Cook55 minServes42 lemons, or 3 limesFine salt and black pepper4 skin-on and bone-in chicken legs4 medium onions2 tbsp groundnut oil, or other neutral oil2 carrots, thinly sliced at an angle, or 1 red pepper, thinly sliced1 tbsp grated fresh ginger1 tbsp thyme leaves, or 1 tsp dried thyme1 tbsp dijon mustard1 scotch bonnet, or other warm red chilli pepper80g green olivesFinely grate the zest of half the citrus fruit, set the zest aside, then juice all the fruit into a bowl and stir in a teaspoon of salt.

Then something curious happened ...Grace DentSun 28 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 28 Sep 2025 07.41 EDTShareOver a lunch atBrasserie Constancein Fulham, west London, eating my main course claypot chicken with barley while surrounded by smiling diners at other tables, I got a glimpse of how it must feel to beKim Jong-un. My journey to Fulham Pier had been odd enough, but now I was in my Great Dictator era.Actually, maybe I should wind back a little. Even finding Brasserie Constance had been a bit of an issue, not least because this new “neighbourhood restaurant” from the well-loved chefAdam Byattis not quite what’s advertised. Constance, the website says, is on the banks of the Thames, “where the river’s beauty is on full display”. It is a restaurant named in tribute to the mid-20th-century florist, potter and cookConstance Spry, a doyenne of domestic bliss who is the inspiration for this classy brasserie where coronation chicken paté en croute, potted duck with damson andDevon splitwith mead and greengages are on offer. So far, so dreamy.View image in fullscreen‘A showstopper’: Brasserie Constance’s crab vol-au-vent with coronation remoulade.I had not previously heard ofFulham pier, but this sounded like a joint designed to snare the long-lunch, deep-pocket River Cafe faithful with the likes of day-boat skate wing with lovage and baked alaska for afters. One thing Brasserie Constance certainly does not mention on its dreamy, quasi-pastoral website is that it is essentially a souped-up corporate box inside Craven Cottage, Fulham Football Club’s ground. In fact, your first clue to that fact will probably be when the taxi driver turfs you out by the ticket kiosk. Signage guiding you from there to Brasserie Constance itself, however, is non-existent. Nada, zilch – not even a timely Post-it note stuck to the ticket office door; even the Craven Cottage staff seemed not to have heard of the new restaurant’s existence.My lunch companion and I wandered around inside the club’s marketing suites, opening doors into corporate boxes and just looking for lunch. Eventually, we found an opulent, no-expense-spared room that looked for all the world like the private dining option on a luxury liner. Why not just say upfront that Brasserie Constance is a fancy restaurant designed for the prawn sandwich brigade whom Roy Keane onceso famously scoffed at?View image in fullscreenBrasserie Constance’s claypot chicken for two, with a herby, beery barley sauce.We sat at our table in a deserted restaurant. The warm, knowledgeable staff seemed rather shocked to see us – two actual midweek lunchtime guests. Soon, a flurry of management huddled in a corner, no doubt mumbling to each other that a critic was on the premises. We ordered a bowl of hot, crisp fried skate knobs with tartare sauce and a round of delightful corn and green chilli tarts. Both lovely. We demolished an outstanding Dorset crab vol-au-vent with curry remoulade, a showstopper of sweet, flaky pastry with beautifully dressed crab meat. We waited for a slice of that coronation chicken paté en croute, which was a tad dry by the time it arrived, because its sauce had all but evaporated into the cold, pastry-encased chicken. Brasserie Constance is everything you’d expect of an Adam Byatt restaurant: fine produce, meticulously deliberated over and, largely, cooked with serious aplomb.Then something odd happened. The table next to us filled up with a group of twentysomethings and, soon after, another table did likewise, then another, until there were five jam-packed tables around us, all merrily going through the motions of having lunch, although, curiously, none of them seemed to have been offered menus or had orders taken. In fact, on closer inspection, not much food was on those tables, either. It was almost as if they were miming having a meal.The claypot chicken, a sharer for two, was presented to us in its pot for inspection, then whisked away, carved, shredded and mixed with a herby barley sauce. A side of carrots in sunflower seeds had crunch and vigour, while a Russian salad was a joyous cacophony of new potatoes and green beans. We moved on to a hulking-great slice of delightful and moist treacle, date and walnut tart, complete with a generous jug of pouring cream, at which point the penny finally dropped.View image in fullscreenBrasserie Constance’s ‘hulking-great slice of delightful, moist and sating’ treacle, date and walnut tart with pouring cream.“They’re not having lunch!” I said, pointing at the next table. “They’re just pretending to for us!”“Oh my god, yes!” my guest replied. “They’re probably all from the marketing teams who work on this floor.”We stared at the fake customers, who studiously pretended not to see us. As we finished dessert and I paid the bill, each table emptied one by one, all seemingly chuntering “Rhubarb, rhubarb” as the extras – sorry, diners – wandered back to their offices after a fictitious lunch. “This is how Kim Jong-un must feel every time he leaves the house,” I said.Brasserie Constance is easily the weirdest restaurant experience I have had in spring/summer 2025. But autumn/winter is all to play for.Brasserie ConstanceLevel 1, Fulham Pier, Stevenage Road, London SW6, 020-3002 5221. Open lunch Tues-Sun, noon-2.30pm (4.30pm Sun); dinner Tues-Sat, 6-9.30pm.

More than half of young US consumers claimed in onesurveythat they hadn’t touched alcohol in six months.But they’re not turning away from wine, industry leaders insist: just drinking it differently.The focus is on less strength, and more flavor, according to Lily Taggart, 21, aNew YorkCity chef. “It’s hard to forge connections if you’re drinking high [alcohol by volume] ABV and can’t remember conversations the next day.”“Gen Z is taking the pretentiousness of wine away and it’s all about intentionality over status,” she said. “There is this European shift of sipping a drink, bonding with friends and wanting more authentic connections.”According toresearchby IWSR, a drinks industry data provider, Gen Z is gravitating toward sustainable, natural wines and embracing innovative styles like chilled reds and orange wines. They want bottles that are fun, more sessionable and easier to enjoy in social settings.“This young consumer doesn’t want to get hammered,” said Steve Riboli, president and CEO of the Stella Rosa wine label. “They want to be able to socialize for five hours.”Stella Rosa’s lineup spans from black cherry and strawberry to more adventurous flavors like pineapple chili and watermelon chili.When the label noticed Gen Z’s predilection towards cocktails, Riboli explained, it launched Spritz Del Conte: a ready-made Aperitif cocktail label.Much of the traditional wine industry seems out-of-reach and too “elitist” for this generation, Taggart said. “The whole white tablecloth [culture] of wine is really expensive, and the language feels really inaccessible,” she said. “If you can describe flavors you’re interested in food, I think you can describe flavors you’re interested in wine. But I still think people are scared to.”The Brooklyn wine bar Sauced has become a Gen Z favorite, with a rustic lowkey vibe, natural wines and nonalcoholic offerings – and no need to know the difference between tannins and terroir. With no menu, patrons simply tell the waiters the vibe or tastes they would like, and receive a personalized recommendation.“You don’t need to speak the language of wine to go to Sauced,” said Mira Hobbs, 26, founder of On CloudWine, a New York–based wine social club. “It makes wine feel fun and intuitive, not intimidating.”Wine clubs like On Cloud,ChardonngayandWine for Meare cropping up across the city, geared around this younger wine culture. Their common goal: making wine approachable, fun and social.Kristin Olszewski, founder of wine label Nomadica, noticed Gen Z’s different habits when she was a sommelier at Michelin-starred restaurants. “Young consumers would come in the restaurant and drink so much orange wine and chilled red, and I asked them why,” she said.“The answer was always ‘I don’t need to know anything about orange wine to enjoy it’,” Olszewski added. “The grape riddles between different reds and different whites are confusing so orange wine feels less pretentious, but still high quality and fun.”Nomadica specializes in canned and boxed wine. Its range – which includes the classics, along with an orange wine and a Rose Yuzu spritz – is zero-sugar and low calorie. A QR code on the packaging brings consumers to a playlist curated to set a complementary mood.“I wanted to invite the [consumer] into the wine world,” Olszewski said. “A major misconception is that Gen Z and younger millennials don’t care, but they actually care so much and they’re so interested to learn more. They just don’t want to be talked down to.”Nomadica has branched out into different spaces to reach younger consumers, engaging Gen Z on social media, at music festivals and organic markets like Whole Foods.Price point is also important, according to Olszewski “It’s all about making wine more accessible and a ‘good-for-you’ wine that fits in this generation’s health conscious mindset,” she said.Take Hoxie Spritzer: a low ABV, no added sugar, sustainable wine-based beverage. Josh Rosenstein, its founder, wanted to create a spritz that consumers found “easy to drink while being social, and still being able to go on a run the next morning”.Hoxie has tried to develop intriguing flavors, mixing a familiar taste like grapefruit and a unique ingredient like elderflower. Gen Z wants “an experience,” suggested Rosenstein. “By drinking Hoxie with your friends, I want you to feel like you’ve gone on vacation in St Tropez or by a lakeside in upstate New York.”Times are changing, according to Rosenstein and Olszewski, who say the traditional wine industry needs to adapt to the tastes and values of this new era of wine drinkers, rather than cling to the established wine culture.For Taggart, Gen Z is redefining what a wine drinker is. “Before I thought a wine drinker would be like my grandma [with a] dark red. It felt like you had to be either old or really rich to enjoy,” she said. “Now, I think of someone young and hip, like [someone who] lives in Brooklyn and has patchwork tattoos.”Explore more on these topicsWineFoodNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
